alexander kent in gallant company bolitho for winifred with love our foe was no skulk in his ship i tell you his was the surly english pluck and there is no tougher or truer and never was and never will be walt whitman show of strength the stiff offshore wind which had backed slightly to the northwest during the day swept across new york s naval anchorage bringing no release from the chilling cold and the threat of more snow tugging heavily at her anchor cables his britannic majestys ship trojan of eighty guns might appear to a landsmans unpractised eye as indifferent to both wind and water but to the men who continued with their work about her decks or high above them on the slippery yards and rigging her swaying motion made her anything but that it was march but to lieutenant richard bolitho officer of the afternoon watch it felt like midwinter it will be dark early he thought and the ships boats would have to be checked their moorings doubly secured before night closed in completely he shivered not so much because of the cold but because he knew there would be little relief from it once he was allowed to go below for despite her massive size and armament the trojan a twodecked ship of the line whose complement of six hundred and fifty officers seamen and marines lived out their lives within her fat hull had no more than the galley fires and bodywarmth to sustain them no matter what the elements might do bolitho raised his telescope and trained it towards the fading waterfront as the lens passed over other anchored ships of the line frigates and the general clutter of small supporting craft he found time to wonder at the change it had been just last summer when trojan in company with a great fleet of one hundred and thirty ships had anchored here off staten island after the shock of the actual revolution within the american colonies the occupation of new york and philadelphia with such a show of force had seemed to those involved as a start on the way back a compromise it had been such a simple and leisurely affair at the time after phasing his troops under canvas along the green shoreline of staten island general howe with a token force of infantry had gone ashore to take possession all the preparations by the continentals and local militia had come to nothing and even the staten island force of four hundred men who had been commanded by general washington to defend the redoubts at all costs had grounded their muskets and obligingly sworn allegiance to the crown bolatlao lowered the glass as it blurred in drifting snow it was hard to recall the green island and crowds of onlookers the loyalists cheering the rest watching in grim silence now all the colours were in shades of grey the land the tossing water even the ships seemed to have lost their brightness in the persistent and lingering winter ile took a few paces this way and that across trojans spacious quarterdeck his shoes slipping on the planking his damp clothing tugging at him in the wind he had been in the ship for two years it was beginning to feel a lifetime like manly others throughout the fleet he had felt mixed feelings at the news of the revolution surprise and shock sympathy and then anger and above all the sense of helplessness the revolution which had begun as a mixture of individual ideals had soon developed into something real and challenging the war was like nothing they had known before big ships of the line like trojan moved ponderously from one inflamed incident to another and were well able to cope with anything which was careless enough to stray under their massive broad sides but the real war was one of communications and supply of small fast vessels sloops brigs and schooners and throughout the long winter months while the overworked ships of the inshore squadrons had patrolled and probed some fifteen hundred miles of coastline the growing strength of the continentals had been further aided by britain s old enemy france not openly as yet but it would not be long before the many french privateers which hunted from the canadian border to the caribbean showed their true colours after that spain too would be a quick if unwilling ally her trade routes from the spanish main were perhaps the longest of all and with little love for england anyway she would likely take the easiest course all this and more bolitho had heard and discussed over and over again until he was sick of it whatever the news good or bad the trojans role seemed to be getting smaller like a rock she remained here in harbour for weeks on end her company resentful the officers hoping for a chance to leave her and find their fortunes in swifter more independent ships bolitho thought of his last ship the twentyeightgun frigate destiny even as her junior lieutenant and barely used to the seachange from midshipmans berth to wardroom he had found excitement and satisfaction beyond belief he stamped his feet on the wet planks seeing the watchkeepers at the opposite side jerk round with alarm now he was fourth lieutenant of this great anchored mammoth and looked like remaining so trojan would be better off in the channel fleet he thought manoeuvres and showing the flag to the watchful french and whenever possible slipping ashore to plymouth or portsmouth to meet old friends bolitho turned as familiar footsteps crossed the deck from the poop it was cairns the first lieutenant who like most of the others had been aboard since the ship had recommissioned in after being laid up in bristol where she had originally been built cairns was tall lean and very selfcontained if he too was pining over the next step in his career a command of his own perhaps he never showed it he rarely smiled but nevertheless was a man of great charm bolitho both liked and respected him and often wondered what he thought of the captain cairns paused biting his lower lip as he peered up at the towering crisscross of shrouds and running rigging thinly coated with clinging snow the yards looked like the branches of gaunt pines he said the captain will be coming off soon ill be on call so keep a weathereye open bolitho nodded gauging the moment cairns was twentyeight while he was not yet twentyone but the span between first and fourth lieutenant was still the greater he asked casually any news of our captains mission ashore sir cairns seemed absorbed get those topmen down dick theyll be too frozen to turnto if the weather breaks pass the word for the cook to break out some hot soup he grimaced that should please the miserly bugger he looked at bolitho mission well i thought we might be getting orders he shrugged or something he has been with the commanderinchief certainly but i doubt well hear anything stronger than the need for vigilance and an eye to duty i see bolitho looked away fie was never sure when cairns was being completely serious cairns tugged his coat around his throat carry on mr bolitho they touched their hats to each other the informality laid aside for the moment bolitho called midshipman of the watch he saw one of the drooping figures break away from the shelter of the hammock nettings and bound towards him sir it was couzens thirteen years old and one of the new members of the ships company having been sent out from england aboard a transport he was roundfaced constantly shivering but made up for his ignorance with a willingness which neither his superiors nor the ship could break bolitho told him about the cook and the captains expected return then instructed him to arrange for piping the relief for the first dogwatch he passed his instructions without conscious thought but watched couzens instead seeing not him but himself at that tender age he had been in a ship of the line too chased harried bullied by everyone or so it had seemed but he had had one hero a lieutenant who had probably never even noticed him as a human being and bolitho had always remembered him he had never lost his temper without cause never found escape in humiliating others when he had received a tellingoff from his captain bolitho had hoped he would be like that lieutenant one day he still hoped couzens nodded firmly aye aye sir trojan carried nine midshipmen and bolitho sometimes wondered how their lives would take shape some would rise to flag rank others drop by the wayside there would be the usual sprinkling of tyrants and of leaders of heroes and cowards later as the new watch was being mustered below the quarterdeck one of the lookouts called boat approaching sir the merest pause tis the captain bolitho darted a quick glance at the milling confusion below the quarterdeck the captain could not have chosen a better time to catch them all out he yelled pass the word for the first lieutenant man the side and call the boatswain directly men dashed hither and thither through the gloom and while the marines tramped stolidly to the entry port their crossbelts very white in the poor light the petty officers tried to muster the relieving watchkeepers into some semblance of order a boat appeared pulling strongly towards the main chains the bowman already standing erect with his hook at the ready boat ahoy the coxswains cry came back instantly trojan their lord and master was back the man who next to god controlled each hour of their lives who could reward flog promote or hang as the situation dictated was amongst their crowded world once more when bolitho glanced round again he saw that where there had been chaos there was order with the marines lined up muskets to their shoulders their commanding officer the debonair captain desterre standing with his lieutenant apparently oblivious to wind and cold the boatswains mates were here moistening their silver calls on their lips and cairns his eyes everywhere waited to receive his captain the boat hooked on to the chains the muskets slapped and cracked to the present while the calls shrilled in piercing salute the captains head and shoulders rose over the side and while he doffed his cocked hat tb the quarterdeck he too examined the ship his command with one sweeping scrutiny he said curtly come aft mr cairns he nodded to the marine officers smart turnout desterre he turned abruptly and snapped why are you here mr bolitho as he spoke eight bells chimed out from the forecastle you should have been relieved surely bolitho looked at him i think mr probyn is detained sir do you indeed the captain had a harsh voice which cut above the din of wind and creaking spars like a cutlass the responsibility of watchkeeping is as much that of the relief as the one awaiting it he glanced at cairns impassive face pon my soul mr cairns not a difficult thing to learn id have thought they walked aft and bolitho breathed out very slowly lieutenant george probyn his immediate superior was often late taking over his watch and other duties too for that matter ile was the odd man in the wardroom morose argumentative bitter although for what reason bolitho had not yet discovered he saw him coming up the starboard ladder broad untidy peering around suspiciously bolitho faced him the watch is aft mr probyn probyn wiped his face and then blew his nose in a red handkerchief i suppose the captain was asking about me even his question sounded hostile he noted you were absent bolitho could smell brandy and added but he seemed satisfied enough probyn beckoned to a masters mate and scanned quickly through the deck log which the man held below a lantern bolitho said wearily nothing unusual to report one seaman injured and taken to the sickbay he fell from the boat tier probyn sniffed shame he closed the book you are relieved he watched him broodingly if i thought anyone was making trouble for me behind my back bolitho turned away hiding his anger do not fret my drunken friend you are doing that for yourself probyns rumbling voice followed him to the companion as he put his men to their stations and allotted their tasks as he ran lightly down the companion ladder and made his way aft towards the wardroom bolitho wondered what the captain was discussing with cairns once below the ship seemed to enfold him contain him with her familiarity the combined smells of tar and hemp of bilge and packed humanity they were as much a part of bolitho as his own skin mackenzie dhe senior wardroom servant who had ended his service as a topman when a fall from aloft had broken his leg in three places and made him a permanent cripple met him with a cheery smile if everyone else was sorry for him mackenzie at least was well satisfied his injuries had given him as much comfort and security as any man could hope to find in a kings ship ive some coffee sir piping hot too he had a soft scottish accent which was very like cairns bolitho peeled off his coat and handed it with his hat to logan a ships boy who helped in the wardroom id relish that thank you the wardroom which ran the whole breadth of the ships stern was wreathed in tobacco smoke and touched with its own familiar aromas of wine and cheese right aft the great stern windows were already in darkness and as the counter swung slightly to the pull of the massive anchor it was possible to see an occasional light glittering from the shore like a lost star hutchlike cabins little more than screens which would be torn down when the ship cleared for action lined either side tiny havens which contained the owners cot chest and a small hanging space but each was at least private apart from the cells about the only place in the ship a man could be alone directly axove and in a cabin which matched in size and space that which contained most of his officers was the captains domain also on that deck was the master and the first lieutenant to be in easy reach of the quarterdeck and the helm but here in the wardroom was where they all shared their moments offduty where they discussed their hopes and fears ate their meals and took their wine the six lieutenants two marine officers the sailing master the purser and the surgeon it was crowded certainly but when compared with the belowthewaterline quarters of the midshipmen and other warrant officers and specialists let alone the great majority of seamen and marines it was luxury indeed dalyell the fifth lieutenant sat beneath the stern windows his legs crossed and resting on a small keg a long clay pipe balanced in one hand george probyn adrift again eh dick bolitho grinned it is becoming a habit sparke the second lieutenant a severefaced man with a coinshaped scar on one cheek said id drag him to the captain if i were the senior here he returned to a tattered newssheet and added vehemently these damned rebels seem to do what they like two more transports seized from under our frigates noses and a brig cut out of harbour by one of their bloody privateers were too soft on em bolitho sat down and stretched grateful to be out of the wind even though he knew the illusion of warmth would soon pass his head lolled and when mackenzie brought the mug of coffee he had to shake his shoulder to awaken him in companionable silence the trojans officers drew comfort from their own resources some read others wrote home letters which might never reach those for whom they were intended bolitho drank his coffee and tried to ignore the pain in his forehead without thinking his hand moved up and touched the rebellious lock of black hair above his right eye beneath it was a livid scar the source of the pain he had received it when he had been in destiny it often came back to him at moments like this the illusion of safety the sudden rush of feet and slashing hacking weapons the agony and the blood oblivion there was a tap at the outer screen door and then mackenzie said to sparke who was the senior officer present your pardon sir but the midshipman of the watch is here the boy stepped carefully into the wardroom as if he was walking on precious silk sparke snapped curtly what is it mr forbes the first lieutenants compliments sir and will all officers muster in the cabin at two bells very well sparke waited for the door to close now we will see gentlemen maybe we have something of importance to do unlike cairns the second lieutenant could not conceal the sudden gleam in his eyes promotion prize money or just a chance for action instead of hearing about it he looked at bolitho i suggest yoiichanfe into a clean shirt the captain seems to have his eye on you bolitho stood up his head brushing the deckhead beams two years in this ship and apart from a dinner in the cabin when they had recommissioned the ship at bristol he had barely crossed one social barrier to meet the captain he was a stern remote man and yet always seemed to possess uncanny knowledgeof what was happening on every deck in his command dalyell carefully tapped out his pipe and remarked maybe he really likes you dick raye the lieutenant of marines yawned i dont think hes human sparke hurried to his cabin shying away from involvement with any criticism of authority he is the captain he does not require to be human captain gilbert brice pears finished reading the daily log of events aboard his ship and then scrawled his signature which was hastily dried by teakle his clerk outside the stem windows the harbour and the distant town seemed faraway and unconnected with this spacious welllit cabin there was some good furniture here and in the neighbouring dining cabin the table was already laid for supper with foley the captains servant neat as a pin in his blue coat and white trousers hovering to tend his masters needs captain pears leaned back in his chair and glanced round the cabin without seeing it in two years he had got to know it well he was fortytwo years old but looked older thickset even square he was as powerful and impressive as the trojan herself he had heard gossip amongst his officers which amounted almost to discontent the war for it must now be accepted as such seemed to be passing them by but pears was a realistic man and knew that the time would eventually come when he and his command would be able to act as intended when trojans great keel had first tasted salt water just nine years ago privateers and raiding parties were one thing but when the french joined the fray in open strength and their ships of the line appeared in these waters trojan and her heavy consorts would display their true worth he looked up as the marine sentry stamped his boots together outside the screen door and moments later the first lieutenant rejoined him i have passed the word to the wardroom sir all officers to be here at two bells good pears merely had to look at his servant and foley was beside him pouring two tall glasses of claret the fact is mr cairns pears examined the wine against the nearest lantern you cannot go on forever fighting a defensive war here we are in new york a clawhold on a land which is daily becoming more rebellious in philadelphia things are little better raids and skirmishes we burn a fort or an outpost and they catch one of our transports or ambush a patrol what is new york a besieged city a town under reprieve but for how long cairns said nothing but sipped the claret half his mind attending to the noises beyond the cabin the sigh of wind the groan of timbers pears saw his expression and smiled to himself cairns was a good first lieutenant probably the best he had ever had he should have a command of his own a chance one which only came in war but pears loved his ship more than hopes or dreams the thought of sparke taking over as senior lieutenant was like a threat he was an efficient officer and attended to his guns and his duties perfectly but imagination he had not he thought of probyn and dismissed him just as quickly then there was bolitho the fourth much like his father although he sometimes seemed to take his duties too lightly but his men appeared to like him that meant a lot in these hard times pears sighed bolitho was still a few months short of twentyone you needed experienced officers to work a ship of the line he rubbed his chin to hide his expression maybe it was bolitho s youth and his own mounting years which made him reason in this fashion he asked abruptly are we in all respects ready for sea cairns nodded aye sir i could well use another dozen hands because of injury and illhealth but that is a small margin these days it is indeed i have known first lieutenants go greyhaired because they could not woo press or bribe enough hands even to work their ships out of port at the prescribed time the doors were opened and trojans officers excluding the midshipmen and junior warrant officers filed into the great cabin it was a rare event and took a good deal of time to get them into proper order and for foley and hogg the captains coxswain to find the right number of chairs it gave pears time to watch their varying reactions to see if their presence in strength would make any sort of difference probyn relieved from his duties by a masters mate was flushed and very brighteyed just too steady to be true sparke prim in his severity and young dalyell were seated beside the sixth and junior lieutenant quinn who just five months ago had been a midshipman then there was erasmus bunce the master he was called the sage behind his back and was certainly impressive in his special trade which produced more characters and outstanding seaman than any other bunce was one to turn any mans head he was well over six feet tall deepchested and had long straggly grey hair but his eyes deepset and clear were almost as black as the thick brows above them a sage indeed pears watched the master ducking between the overhead beams and was reassured bunce liked his rum but he loved the ship like a woman with him to guide her she had little to fear molesworth the purser a pale man with a nervous blink which pears suspected was due to some undiscovered guilt thorndike the surgeon who always seemed to be smiling more like an actor than a man of blood and bones two bright patches of scarlet by the larboard side the marine officers desterre and lieutenant raye and of course cairns completed the gathering it did not include all the other warrant officers and specialists the boatswain and gunner the masters mates and the carpenters pears knew them all by sight sound and quality probyn said in a loud whisper mr bolitho doesnt seem to be here yet pears frowned despising probyns hypocrisy he was about as subtle as a hammer cairns suggested ill send someone sir the door opened and closed swiftly and pears saw bolitho sliding into an empty chair beside the two marines stand up that officer pears harsh voice was almost caress ing ah it is you sir at last bolitho stood quite still only his shoulders swaying slightly to the ships slow roll i i am sorry sir bolitho saw the grin on dalyells face as drops of water trickled from under his coat and on to the black and white checkered canvas which covered the deck pears said mildly your shirt seems to be rather wet sir he turned slightly foley some canvas for that chair it is hard to replace such things out here bolitho sat down with a thump not knowing whether to be angry or humiliated he forgot pears abrasive tone and the shirt which he had snatched off the wardroom line still wringing wet as pears said more evenly we will sail at first light gentlemen the governor of new york has received information that the expected convoy from halifax is likely to be attacked it is a large assembly of vessels with an escort of two frigates and a sloopofwar but in this weather the ships could become scattered some might endeavour to close with the land to ascertain their bearings his fingers changed to a fist that is when our enemy will strike bolitho leaned forward ignoring the sodden discomfort around his waist pears continued i was saying as much to mr cairns you cannot win a defensive war we have the ships but the enemy has the local knowledge to make use of smaller faster vessels to have a chance of success we must command and keep open every trade route search and detain any suspected craft make our presence felt wars are not finally won with ideals they are won with powder and shot and that the enemy does not have in quantity yet he looked around their faces his eyes bleak the halifax convoy is carrying a great deal of powder and shot cannon too which are intended for the military in philadelphia and here in new york if just one of those valuable cargoes fell into the wrong hands we would feel the effects for months to come he looked round sharply questions it was sparke who rose to his feet first why us sir of course i am most gratified to be putting to sea in my countrys service to try and rectify some pears said heavily please get on with the bones of the matter sparke swallowed hard his scar suddenly very bright on his cheek why net send frigates sir because there are not enough there never are enough also the admiral feels that a show of strength might be of more value bolitho stiffened as if he had missed something it was in the captains tone just the merest suggestion of doubt he glanced at his companions but they seemed much as usual perhaps he was imagining it or seeking flaws to cover up his earlier discomfort under pears tongue pears added whatever may happen this time we must never drop our vigilance this ship is our first responsibility our main concern at all times the war is changing from day to day yesterdays traitor is tomorrows patriot a man who responded to his countrys call he shot a wry smile at sparke is now called a loyalist as if he and not the others was some sort of freak and outcast the master erasmus bunce stood up very slowly his eyes peering beneath a deckhead beam like twin coals a man must do as he be guided sir it is for god to decide who be right in this conflict pears smiled gravely old bunce was known to be very religious and had once hurled a sailor into portsmouth harbour merely for taking the lords name into a drunken song bunce was a devonian and had gone to sea at the age of nine or ten he was now said to be over sixty but pears could never picture him ever being young at all he said quite so mr bunce that was well said cairns cleared his throat and eyed the master patiently was that all mr bunce the master sat down and folded his arms it be enough the captain gestured to foley no words seemed to be required here bolitho thought glasses and wine jugs followed and then pears said a toast gentlemen to the ship and damnation to the kings enemies bolitho watched probyn looking round for the jugs his glass already emptied he thought of pears voice when he had spoken of the ship god help george probyn if he put her on a lee shore after taking too many glasses soon after that the meeting broke up and bolitho realized that he had still got no closer to the captain than by way of a reprimand he sighed when you were a midshipman you thought a lieutenants life was in some sort of heaven maybe even captains were in dread of somebody although at this moment it was hard to believe the next dawn was slightly clearer but not much the wind held firm enough from the northwest and the snow flurries soon gave way to drizzle which mixed with the blown spray made the decks and rigging shine like dull glass bolitho had watched one ship or another get under way more times than he could remember but it never failed to move and excite him the way every man joined into the chain of command to make the ship work as a living perfect instrument each mast had its own divisions of seamen from the swift braces and halliards from the deck as the calls shrilled and the men poured up on deck through every hatch and companion it seemed incredible that trojans hull which from figurehead to taffrail measured two hundred and fifteen feet could contain so many yet within seconds the dashing figures of men and boys marines and landmen were formed into compact groups each being checked by leatherlunged petty officers against their various lists and watchbills the great capstan was already turning as was its twin on the deck below and under his shoes bolitho could almost sense the ship stirring waiting to head towards the open sea like the mass of seamen and marines the officers too were at their stations probyn with dalyell to assist him on the forecastle the foremast their responsibility sparke commanded the upper gundeck and the ships mainmast which was her real strength with all the spars cordage canvas and miles of rigging which gave life to the hull beneath lastly the mizzen mast handled mostly by the afterguard where young quinn waited with the marine lieutenant and his men to obey cairns first requirements bolitho looked across at sparke not an easy man to know but a pleasure to watch at work he controlled his seamen and every halliard and brace with the practised ease of a dedicated concert conductor a hush seemed to fall over the ship and bolitho looked aft to see the captain walking to the quarterdeck rail nodding to old bunce the sage then speaking quietly with his first lieutenant far above the deck from the mainmast truck the long scarlet pendant licked and hardened to the wind like bending metal a good sailing wind but bolitho was thankful it was the captain and old bunce who were taking her through the anchored shipping and not himself he glanced over the side and wondered who was watching friends or spies who might already be passing news to washington s agents another manofwar weighing where bound for what purpose he returned his attention inboard if half what he had heard was true the enemy probably knew better than they did there were said to be plenty of loose tongues in new york s civil and military government circles cairns raised his speaking trumpet get a move on mr tolcher tolcher the squat boatswain raised his cane and bellowed more ands to th capstan save lads he glared at the shantyman with his fiddle play up you bugger or illave you on th pumps from forward came the cry anchors hove short sir hands aloft loose topsls cairns voice magnified by the trumpet pursued and drove them like a clarion loose the headsls released to the wind the canvas erupted aid flapped in wild confusion while spread along the swaying yards like monkeys the topmen fought to bring it under control until the right moment sparke called man your braces mr bolitho take that mans name aye sir bolitho smiled into the drizzle it was always the same with sparke take that mans name there was nobody in particular but it gave the seamen the idea that sparke had eyes everywhere again the hoarse voice from the bows anchors aweigh sir released from the ground her first anchor already hoisted and catted trojan sidestepped heavily across the wind her sailsspreading and thundering like a bombardment as the men hauled at the braces their bodies straining back angled down almost to the deck round and further still the yards swinging to hold the wind the sails freed one by one to harden like steel breastplates until the ship was thrusting her shoulder in foam her lower gunports awash along the lee side bolitho ran from one section to the next his hat knocked awry his ears ringing with the squeal of blocks and the boom of canvas and above all the groaning and vibrating chorus from every stay and shroud when he paused for breath he saw the outline of sandy hook sliding abeam some men waiting in a small yawl to wave as the great ship stood over them he heard cairns voice again get the tgansls on her bolitho peered up the length of the mainmast with its great bending yards he saw midshipmen in the tops and seamen racing each other to set more canvas when he looked aft again he saw bunce with his hands thrust behind him his face like carved rock as he watched over his ship then he nodded very slowly that was as near to satisfaction as bolitho had ever seen him display he pictured the ship as she would look from the land her fierce glaring figurehead the trojan warrior with the redcrested helmet spray bursting up and over the beakhead and bowsprit the massive black and buff hull glistening and reflecting the cruising whitecaps alongside as if to wash herself clean from the land probyns voice sounded raw as he shouted at his men to secure the second anchor he would need plenty to drink after this bolitho thought he looked aft past his own seamen as they slid down stays and vaulted from the gangways to muster again below the mast then he saw the captain watching him along the ship over all the bustle and haste their eyes seemed to meet selfconsciously bolitho reached up and straightened his hat and he imagined he saw the captain give a small but definite nod but the mood was soon broken for trojan rarely gave much time for personal fancies man the braces there stand by to come about sparke was shouting mr bolithol bolitho touched his hat aye i know sir take that mans name by the time they had laid the ship on her chosen tack to both the captains and bunces satisfaction the land was swallowed in mist and rain astern a wild plan lieutenant richard bolitho crossed to the weather side of the quarterdeck and gripped the hammock nettings to hold his balance towering above and ahead of him trojans great pyramids of sails were impressive even to one accustomed to the sight especially after all the frustration and pain in the last four and a half days he thought the wind which had followed them with such promise from sandy hook had changed within hours as if driven or inspired by the devil himself backing and veering without warning with all hands required to reef or reset the sails throughout each watch it had taken one complete miserable day just to work round and clear of the dreaded nantucket shoals with sea boiling beneath the long bowsprit as if heated by some force from hell then after raising their progress to four and even five knots the wind would alter yet again bellowing with savage triumph while the breathless seamen fought to reef the hard canvas fisting and grappling while their pitching world high above the decks went mad about them but this was different trojan was standing almost due north her yards braced round as far as they would to take and hold the wind and along her lee side the water was creaming past as evidence of real progress bolitho ran his eyes over the upper gundeck below the quarterdeck rail he could see the hands resting and chatting as was the custom while awaiting to see what the cook had produced for the midday meal by the greasy plume which fell downwind from the galley funnel bolitho guessed that it was another concoction of boiled beef hacked from salted casks mixed with a soggy assortment of ships biscuit oatmeal and scraps saved from yesterday george triphook the senior cook was hated by almost everyone but his toadies but unlike some he enjoyed the hatred and seemed to relish the groans and curses at his efforts bolitho felt suddenly ravenous but knew the wardroom fare would be little better when he was relieved to snatch his share of it he thought of his mother and the great grey house in falmouth he walked away from couzens his watchful midshipman who rarely took his eyes off him how terrible the blow had been in the navy you could risk death a dozen ways in any day disease shipwreck or the cannons roar the walls of falmouth church were covered with memorial plaques the names and deeds of seaofficers sons of falmouth who had left port never to return but his mother surely not her always youthful and vivacious ready to standin and shoulder the responsibility of house and land when her husband captain james bolitho was away which was often bolitho and his brother hugh his two sisters felicity and nancy had all loved her in their own different and special ways when he had returned home from the destiny still shocked and suffering from his wound he had needed her more than ever the house had been like a tomb she was dead it was impossible to accept even now that she was not back in falmouth watching the sea beyond pendennis castle laughing in the manner which was infectious enough to drive all despair aside a chill they had said then a sudden fever it had been over in a matter of weeks he could picture his father at this very moment captain james as he was locally known was well respected as a magistrate since losing his arm and being removed from active duty the house in winter the lanes clogged with mud the news always late the countryside too worried by pressures of cold and wet of lost animals and marauding foxes to heed much for this faroff war but his father would care brooding as a shipofwar anchored or weighed in carrick roads needing pining for the life which had rejected him and now completely alone it must be a million times worse for him bolitho thought sadly cairns appeared on deck and after scrutinizing the compass and glancing at the slate on which a masters mate made his halfhourly calculations he crossed to join bolitho bolitho touched his hat she holds steady sir nor by east full and bye cairns nodded he had very pale eyes which could look right through a man we may have to reef if the wind gets up any more were taking all we can manage i think he shaded his eyes before he looked to larboard for although there was no sun the glare was intent and harsh it was difficult to see an edge between sea and sky the water was a desert of restless steel fragments but the rollers were further apart now cruising down in serried ranks to lift under trojans fat quarter to tilt her further and burst occasionally over the weather gangway before rolling on again towards the opposite horizon they had the sea to themselves for after beating clear of nantucket and pushing on towards the entrance of massachusetts bay they were well clear of both land and local shipping somewhere some sixty miles across the weather side lay boston there were quite a few aboard trojan who could remember boston as it had once been before the bitterness and resentment had flared into anger and blood the bay itself was avoided by all but the foolhardy it was the home of some of the most able privateers and bolitho wondered not for the first time if there were any stalking the powerful twodecker at this moment cairns had a muffler around his throat and asked what make you of the weather dick bolitho watched the men streaming to the hatches on their way to the galley and their cramped messes he had taken over the watch as bunce had been keeping a stern eye on the ritual taking of noon sights although it was more a routine than to serve any real purpose in this poor visibility the midshipmen lined up with their sextants the masters mates watching their progress or their lack of it bolitho replied calmly fog cairns stared at him is this one of your celtic fantasies man bolitho smiled the master said fog the first lieutenant sighed then fog it will be though in this half gale i see no chance of it deck there they looked up caught off guard after so much isolation bolitho saw the shortened figure of the mainmast lookout a tiny shape against the low clouds it made him dizzy just to watch sail on th weather beam sir the two lieutenants snatched telescopes and climbed into the shrouds but there was nothing just the wavecrests angrier and steeper in the searching lens and the hard relentless glare shall i inform the captain sir bolitho watched cairns face as he returned to the deck he could almost see his mind working a sail what did it mean unlikely to be friendly even a lost and confused ships master would not fail to understand the dangers hereabouts not yet cairns glanced meaningly towards the poop hell have heard the masthead anyway hell not fuss until were ready bolitho thought about it another view of captain pears which he had not considered but it was true he never did rush on deck like some captains afraid for their ships or impatient for answers to unanswerable questions he looked at cairns quiet face again it was also true that cairns inspired such trust bolitho asked shall i go aloft and see for myself cairns shook his head no i will the captain will doubtless want a full report bolitho watched the first lieutenant hurrying up the shrouds the telescope slung over his shoulders like a musket up and up around the futtock shrouds and past the hooded swivel gun there to the topmast and further still towards the lookout who sat so calmly on the crosstrees as if he was on a comfortable village bench he dragged his eyes away from cairns progress it was something he could never get used to or conquer his hatred of heights each time he had to go aloft which was mercifully rare he felt the same nausea the same dread of falling he saw a familiar figure on the gundeck below the quarterdeck rail and felt something like affection for the big ungainly man in checkered shirt and flapping white trousers one more link with the little destiny stockdale the muscular prizefighter he had rescued from a barker outside an inn when he and a dispirited recruiting party had been trying to drum up volunteers for the ship stockdale had taken to the sea in a manner born as strong as five men he never abused his power and was more gentle than many the angry barker had been hitting stockdale with a length of chain for losing in a fight with one of bolithos men the man in question must have cheated in some way for bolitho had never seen stockdale beaten since he spoke very little and when he did it was with effort as his vocal chords had been cruelly damaged in countless barefist fights up and down every fair and pitch in the land seeing him then stripped to the waist cut about the back by the barkers chain had been too much for bolitho when he had asked stockdale to enlist he had said it almost without thinking of the consequences stockdale had merely nodded picked up his things and had followed him to the ship and whenever bolitho needed aid or was in trouble stockdale was always there like that last time when bolitho had seen the screaming savage rushing at him with a cutlass snatched from a dying seaman later he had heard all about it how stockdale had rallied the retreating seamen had picked him up like a child and had carried him to safety when bolithos appointment to trojan had arrived he had imagined that would be an end to their strange relationship but somehow then as now stockdale had managed it he had wheezed one day youll be a capn sir reckon youll need a coxswain bolitho smiled down at him stockdale could do almost anything splice reef and steer if need be but he was a gun captain now on one of trojans upper battery of thirty eighteen pounders and naturally he just happened to be in bolithos own division what dyou think stockdale the mans battered face split into a wide grin they be watching us mr bolitho bolitho saw the painful movements of his throat the seas bite was making it hard for stockdale you think so eh aye he sounded very confident theyll know what were about an where were heading i wager therell be other craft hull down where we cant seeem cairns feet hit the deck as he slid down a stay with the agility of a midshipman he said schooner by the cut of her can barely make her out its so damn hazy he shivered in a sudden gust same tack as ourselves he saw bolitho smile at stockdale and asked may i share the joke stockdale said that the other sail is watching us sir keeping well up to windrd cairns opened his mouth as if to contradict and then said i fear he may be right instead of a show of strength trojan may be leading the pack down on to the very booty we are trying to protect he rubbed his chin by god that is a sour thought i had expected an attack to be on the convoys rear the usual straggler cut out before the escort has had time to intervene all the same he rubbed his chin harder theyll not try to attack with trojans broadsides so near bolitho recalled pears voice at the conference the hint of doubt his suspicion then had now become more real cairns glanced aft past the two helmsmen who stood straddlelegged by the great double wheel their eyes moving from sail to compass its not much to tell the captain dick he has his orders trojan is no frigate if we lost time in some fruitless manoeuvres we might never reach the convoy in time you have seen the winds perverse manners hereabouts it could happen tomorrow or now bolitho said quietly remember what the sage said fog he watched the word hitting cairns like a pistol ball if we have to lie to well be no use to anyone cairns studied him searchingly i should have seen that these privateersmen know more about local conditions than any of us he gave a wry smile except the sage lieutenant quinn came on deck and touched his hat im to relieve you sir ile looked from bolitho to the straining masses of canvas bolitho would only go for a quick meal especially as he wanted to know about pears reactions but to the sixth lieutenant eighteen years old it would seem a lifetime of awesome responsibility for to all intents and purposes he would control trojans destiny for as long as he trod the quarterdeck bolitho made to reassure him but checked himself quinn must learn to stand on his own any officer who depended on help whenever things got awkward would be useless in a real crisis he followed cairns to the companionway while quinn made a big display of checking the compass and the notes in the log cairns said softly hell be fine given time bolitho sat at the wardroom table while mackenzie and logan endeavoured to present the meal as best they could boiled meat and gruel ships biscuit with black treacle and as much cheese as anyone could face but there was a generous supply of red wine which had arrived in new york with the last convoy from the lock on probyns face he had made very good use of it he peered across at bolitho and asked thickly what was all that din about a sail somebody getting a bit nervous eh he leaned forward to peer at the others god the navys changing bunce sat at the head of the table and intoned deeply without looking up it is not his doing mr probyn he has no time for the godless sparke said unfeelingly this bloody food is swill i shall get a new cook at the first chance i can that rogue should be dancing on a halter instead of poisoning us the deck tilted steeply and hands reached out to seize plates and glasses until the ship rolled upright again bunce took out a watch and looked at it bolitho asked quietly the fog mr bunce will it come thorndike the surgeon heard him and laughed he made a braying sound really erasmus fog when she pitches about in this wind bunce ignored him and replied tomorrow we will have to lie to there is too great a depth to anchor he shook his massive head time lost more knots to recover he had spoken enough and stood up from the table as he passed probyns chair he said in his deep voice we will have time to see who is nervous then im thinking probyn snapped his fingers for some wine and exclaimed angrily he is becoming mad in his old age he tried to laugh but nothing happened captain desterre eyed him calmly at least he seems to have our lord on his side what do you have exactly in the cabin above captain pears sat at his large table a napkin tucked into his neckcloth he caught the gust of laughter from the wardroom and said to cairns they seem happier at sea eh cairns nodded so it would appear sir he watched pears bowed head and waited for his conclusions or ideas pears said alone or in company the schooner is a menace to us if only we had been given a brig or a sloop to chase off these wolves as it is he shrugged may i suggest something sir pears cut a small piece of cheese for himself and examined it doubtfully it is what you came for surely he smiled speak out cairns thrust his hands behind him his eyes very bright you have heard the masters views on the chance of fog sir pears nodded i know these waters well fog is common enough though i would not dare to make such a bold prediction this time he pushed the cheese aside but if the master says a thing it is usually right well sir we will have to lie to until it clears i have already taken that into account damn it but so too will our watchdog both for his own safety and for fear of losing us the fog might be an ally to us he hesitated sensing the captains mood if we could find her and take her by boarding he got no further in gods name mr cairns what are you saying that i should put boats down fill them with trained hands and send them off into a damned fog hells teeth sir they would be going to certain death there is a chance there may be another vessel in company cairns spoke with sudden stubbornness they will display lights with good care and the use of a boats compass i think an attack has a good chance he waited seeing the doubts and arguments in pears eyes it would give us an extra vessel and maybe more information news of what the privateers are doing pears sat back and stared at him grimly you are a man of ideas ill give you that cairns said the fourth lieutenant put the thought in my mind sir might have guessed it pears stood up and walked towards the windows his thickset frame angled to the deck damned cornishmen pirates and wreckers for the most part did you know that cairns kept his face stiff i understood that falmouth mr bolithos home was the last place to hold out for king charles against cromwell and parliament sir pears gave a tight grin well said but this idea is a dangerous thing we might never find the boats again and they may not discover the enemy let alone seize her cairns insisted the fog will reach the other vessel long before us sir i would suggest that as soon as that happens we change tack and close with her with every stitch which will draw but if the wind goes against us pears held up his hand easy mr cairns i can see your disappointment but it is my responsibility i must think of everything overhead and beyond the cabin doors life was going on as usual the clank of a pump the padding of feet across the poop as the watch hurried to trim a yard or splice a fraying halliard pears said slowly but it does have the stuff of surprise about it he made up his mind my compliments to the master and ask him to join us in the chart room he chuckled although knowing him as i do i suspect he is already there out on the windswept quarterdeck his eyes smarting to salt spray bolitho watched the men working overhead the shivering power of each great sail time to reef soon for the captain to be informed he had seen the activity beneath the poop pears with cairns entering the small chart room which adjoined bunces cabin a little later cairns walked out into the drizzle and bolitho noticed that he was without his hat that was very unusual for cairns was always smartly turned out no matter how bad the circumstances have you had further reports from the masthead aye sir bolitho ducked as a sheet of spray burst over the nettings and soaked them both cairns barely flinched bolitho said quickly as before the stranger is holding to windrd of us on the same bearing i will inform the captain cairns added no matter he is here bolitho made to cross to the lee side as was customary when the captain came on deck but the harsh voice caught him stay mr bolitho pears strode heavily to the quarterdeck rail his hat tugged down to his eyes i believe you have been hatching some wild plan with the first lieutenant well sir i madness pears watched the straining maincourse as it billowed out from its yard but with a grain a very small grain of value bolitho stared at him thank you very much sir pears ignored him and said to cairns the two cutters will have to suffice i want you to handpick each man yourself you know what we need for this bloody work he watched cairns face and then said almost gently but you will not be going as cairns made to protest he added i cannot spare you i could die tomorrow and with you gone too what would become of trojan eh bolitho watched both of them it was like being an intruder to see the disappointment showing for the first time on cairns face then cairns replied aye sir ill attend to it as he strode away pears said bluntly but you can send this one hell not be missed pears returned to the poop where bunce was waiting for him his straggly hair blowing in the wind like spunyarn he barked pass the word to the second lieutenant to lay aft bolitho considered his feelings he was going so was sparke take that mans name he thought of cairns as his one chance of showing his mettle had been taken from him it was another measure of the man bolitho thought some first lieutenants would have kept all the credit for the idea of boarding the other craft hoarding it for the final reward it was getting dark early again the low cloud and steady drizzle adding to the discomfort both below and on deck cairns met bolitho as he came off watch and said simply i have selected some good hands for you dick the second lieutenant will be in command assisted by mr frowd who is the ablest masters mate we have and mr midshipman libby you will be assisted by mr quinn and mr couzens bolitho met his even gaze apart from sparke and frowd the masters mate and to a lesser extent himself the others were children at this sort of thing he doubted if either the nervous quinn or the willing couzens had ever heard a shot fired other than at wildfowl but he said thank you sir he would show the same attitude that cairns had displayed to the captain cairns touched his arm go and find some dry clothing if you can as he turned towards his cabin he added you will have the redoubtable stockdale in your cutter i would not be so brave as to try and stop him bolitho walked through the wardroom and entered his little cabin there he stripped naked and towelled his damp and chilled limbs until he recovered a sensation of warmth then he sat on his swaying cot and listened to the great ship creaking and shuddering beneath him the occasional splash of spray as high as the nearest gunport this time tomorrow he might be on his way to disaster if not already dead he shivered and rubbed his stomach muscles vigorously to quell his sudden uncertainty but at least he would be doing something he pulled a dean shirt over his head and groped for his breeches no sooner had he done so than he heard the distant cry getting louder and closer all hands all hands hands aloft and reef topsls he stood up and banged his head on a ringbolt damnation then he was up and hurrying again to that other world of wind and noise to the trojans demands which must always be met as he passed probyns untidy shape the lieutenant peered at him and grinned fog is it bolitho grinned back at him go to hell it took a full two hours to reef to the captains satisfaction and to prepare the ship for the night the news of the proposed attack had gone through the ship like fire and bolitho heard the many wagers which were being made the sailors margin between life and death in this case and it would all probably come to nothing such things had happened often enough on this commission preparation and then some lastminute hitch bolitho imagined it was going to be an almost impossible thing to find and take the other ship equally he knew he would feel cheated if it was all called off he returned to the wardroom to discover that most of the officers had turned into their bunks after such a day of wind and bustle the surgeon and captain desterre sat beneath a solitary lantern playing cards and alone by the streaming stern windows staring at the vibrating tillerhead was lieutenant quinn in the glow of the swaying lantern he looked younger than ever if that were possible bolitho sat beside him and shook his head as the boy logan appeared with an earthenware wine jug are you feeling all right james quinn looked at him startled yes thank you sir bolitho smiled richard dick if you like he watched the others despair this is not the midshipmans berth you know quinn darted a quick glance at the card players the mounting pile of coins beside the marines scarlet sleeve the dwindling one opposite him then he said quietly youve done this sort of thing before sir i mean dick bolitho nodded a few times he did not want to break quinns trust now that he had begun i i thought it would be in the ship when it happened quinn gestured helplessly around the wardroom and the cabin flat beyond you know all your friends near you with you i think i could do that put up with the first time the fighting bolitho said i know the ship is home it can help quinn clasped his hands and said my family are in the leather trade in the city of london my father did not wish me to enter the navy his chin lifted very slightly but i was determined id often seen a manowar working down river to the sea i knew what i wanted bolitho could well understand the shock quinn must have endured when he was faced with the reality of a kings ship with all the harsh discipline and the feeling that you as a new midshipman are the only one aboard who is in total useless ignorance bolitho had grown up with it and to it the dark portraits which adorned the walls and staircase of the old bolitho home in cornwall were a constant iiemminder of all who had gone before him now he and his brother hugh were carrying on the tradition hugh was in a frigate now probably in the mediterranean while he was here about to embark in the sort of action they often yarned about in the taverns of falmouth he said it will be all right james mr sparke is leading us for the first time he saw quinn smile as he said i must admit he frightens me more than the enemy bolitho laughed wondering why it was that quinns fear had somehow given him strength turn into your cot while you can try to sleep tell mackenzie youd like a tot of brandy george probyns cure for everything quinn stood up and almost fell as the ship quivered and lunged across the hidden sea no i must write a letter as he walked away desterre left the table pocketing his winnings and joined bolitho by the tillerhead the surgeon made to follow but desterre said no more robert your poor play might blunt my skill he smiled be off with you to your bottles and pills the surgeon did not give his usual laugh but walked away feeling for handholds as he went desterre gestured towards the silent cabins is he worried a little the marine tugged at his tight neckcloth wish to god i was coming with you if i cant put my lads to a fight they will be as rusty as old pikes bolitho gave a great yawn im for bed he shook his head as desterre flicked the cards between his fingers id not play with you anyway you have the uncomfortable knack of winning as he lay in his cot hands thrust behind his head bolitho listened to the ship identifying each sound as it fitted into the pattern and fabric of the hull the watch below slung in their closepacked hammocks like pods the air foul around them because of the bilges and because the gunports had to be tightly sealed against sea and rain everything bloomed with damp the deckheads dripping the pumps clanking mournfully as trojan worked her massive bulk over a stiff quartersea on the orlop deck beneath the waterline the surgeon would soon be asleep in his sickbay he had only a handful of ill or injured men to deal with it was to be hoped it remained like that further forward in the midshipmans berth all would be quiet although probably a flickering glim would betray somebody trying to read a complicated navigational problem with a solution expected in the forenoon by bunce their own world seamen and marines painters and caulkers ropemakers and gun captains coopers and topmen as mixed a crowd as you could meet in a whole city and right aft doubtless still at his big table the one who ruled all of them the captain bolitho looked up at the darkness pears was almost directly above him with the watchful foley nearby and a glass at his elbow as he pondered over the days events and tomorrows uncertainties that was the difference he decided we obey and execute his orders as best we can but he has to give them and the reward or the blame must be on his shoulders bolitho rolled over and buried his face in the musty pillow there were certain advantages in remaining a mere lieutenant the faithful the following day was little different from the preceding ones overnight the wind had backed slightly but had lost much of its strength so that the great dripping sails filled and sagged in noisy confusion and added in some way to the general air of tension towards noon with the drizzle as heavy as ever and the sea an expanse of dirty grey the pipe echoed around the ship hands lay aft to witness punishment it was common enough and under normal conditions might have excited little comment in a kings ship discipline was hard and quickly executed and the punishment given by members of the company to one of their own caught stealing from a shipmates meagre possessions was far worse but today should have been different after all the weeks and months of frustration and waiting of being cooped up in harbour with little more comfort than a prison hulk or beating up and down the coastline on some fruitless mission or other it had been hoped that this would bring a change the weather did nothing to help as bolitho stood with the other lieutenants while the marines clattered up and across the poop in two scarlet lines the ships company hurried aft they had to squint against the blown spray and rain and the biting wind which stirred the dripping canvas with long uneven gusts a sullen unhappy start bolitho thought the man to be punished came to the larboard gangway flanked by paget the swarthy masteratarms and mr tolcher the boatswain paget was a tightlipped bitter man and set against him and the squat boatswain the prisoner looked by far the most innocent bolitho watched him a young swede named carlsson he had a cleancut face with long flaxen hair and was staring around as if he had never laid eyes on the ship before he was typical of the trojans mixture bolitho thought you never knew what sort of man you would confront from day to day many tongues and races had been gathered up into trojans hull in two years and yet somehow they all seemed to settle in a very short while of coming aboard bolitho hated floggings even though they were part of a sailors life there still seemed to be no alternative for a captain to maintain discipline when far away from higher authority and the company of other ships the grating was rigged by the gangway and balleine a muscular boatswains mate stood waiting beside it the red baize bag dangling at his side cairns crossed the quarterdeck as pears appeared beneath the poop company assembled sir his eyes were expressionless very well pears glanced at the compass and then walked heavily forward to the quarterdeck rail there was a hush over the crowded seamen who filled the gundeck and overflowed on to the gangways and into the shrouds themselves bolitho glanced at the midshipmen grouped alongside the older warrant officers he had been sick at a flogging when he had been a midshipman he thought about carlsson found asleep on watch after a whole day of fighting wind and rebellious canvas with some officers it might have made a difference but lieutenant sparke had no such weakness as sentiment bolitho wondered if he was thinking about it now how it had cast a blight over the very day he was going to lead a boat attack he glanced sideways at him but saw nothing but sparkes usual tight severity pears nodded uncover he removed his hat and tucked it beneath his arm while the others followed his example bolitho looked to larboard half expecting to see the sails of their faithful shadow during the night the schooner had edged closer and was now visible from the tops of the lower shrouds but not from the quarterdeck as yet that made it harder to accept in a sailors simple reasoning a yankee rebel cruising along as safe as you please and one of their own about to be flogged pears opened the articles of war and read the relevant numbers with little change from his normal tone he finished with the words he shall be punished according to the laws and customs of such cases used at sea he replaced his hat adding two dozen lashes the rest of the proceedings moved swiftly carlsson was stripped to the waist and seized up to the grating his arms spread up and out as if he was crucified balleine had taken his catoninetails from the red baize bag and was running it through his fingers his face set in a grim frown he was to be in bolithos boat for the attack was he thinking of that pears said in his harsh voice do your duty balleines thick arm came back over and down the lash swishing across the mans naked shoulders with a dull crack bolitho heard the man gasp as the air was knocked from his lungs one counted the masteratarms nearby the surgeon and his mates waited to attend the man should he faint bolitho made himself watch the ritual of punishment his heart like lead it was unreal the grey light the stark clarity of the sailmakers patches on the heavily flapping maincourse the lash rose and fell and the scars across the swedes skin soon changed to overflowing red droplets which altered into a bloody mess of torn flesh as the flogging continued some of the blood had spattered across the mans flaxen hair the rest eddied and faded in the drizzle across the deck planking twentyone bolitho heard a midshipman sobbing quietly and saw forbes the youngest one aboard gripping his companions arm to control himself carlsson had not cried out once but as the final stroke cracked over his mutilated back he broke and started to weep cut him down bolitho looked from the captains profile to the watching company two dozen lashes was nothing to what some captains awarded but in this case it might destroy the man bolitho doubted if carlsson had understood more than a few words of what had been said to him the surgeons assistants moved in to carry the sobbing man below two seamen started to swab up the blood and others hurried to obey tolche s order to unrig the grating and replace it the marines trooped down either poop ladder and captain desterre sheathed his bright sword as the company broke up and continued about its affairs sparke said to bolitho we had best go over the raid again so that we know each others thinking bolitho shrugged aye sir maybe sparkes attitude was the right one bolitho liked carlsson what he knew of him obedient cheerful and hardworking but suppose it had been one of the ships real troublemakers who had been caught sleeping on watch would he still have felt the same dismay sparke leaned his hands on the quarterdeck rail and peered down at the two cutters which had already been manhandled away from the other boats on the tier in readiness for swaying out he said i am not too hopeful he gestured at the vibrating shrouds and halliards mr bunce is usually right but this time a seaman yelled from the maintop deck there tother vessels fallin off sir dalyell who was officer of the watch snatched a glass and climbed into the weather shrouds he exclaimed right by god the schooners falling downwind not much but shell be visible to all hands by the time theyve had their spirit ration he laughed at bolithos face damme dick that bugger is a saucy one bolitho shaded his eyes against the strange light and saw a brief blur across the tumbling water perhaps the schooners master believed the same as bunce and was drawing nearer so as not to lose his large quarry or maybe he was merely trying to provoke the captain into doing something foolish bolitho pictured pears face as he had read from the articles of war there was no chance of the latter sparke was saying it will have to be very fast they might have boarding nets but i doubt it it would hamper her people more than ours he was thinking aloud seeing his name and citation in the gazette bolitho guessed it was clear in his eyes like fever or last i will go and see the master sparke hurried away his chin thrusting forward like a galley prow stockdale emerged from somewhere and knuckled his forehead ive seen to the weapons sir ive put all the cutlasses and boarding axes to the grindstone he wheezed painfully we still going sir bolitho crossed to the side and took a telescope from the midshipman of the watch i hope so then he saw that the midshipman was forbes the one who had been holding on to his friend during the flogging are you well mr forbes the boy nodded wretchedly and sniffed aye sir good he trained the glass across the nettings it comes hard to see a man punished so we must always be on the lookout to remove the cause in the first place he held his breath as the other vessels topmasts flitted above the heaving water as if the rest of her were totally submerged she had a red square stitched against the throat of her mainsail a makeshift patch he wondered or some special form of recognition he shivered feeling the rain trickling over his collar plastering his hair to his forehead it was uncanny to see the disembodied masts to know nothing of the vessel and crew he turned to speak with stockdale but he had vanished as silently as he had appeared dalyell lurched up the sloping deck and said hoarsely it looks as if youll be staying with us dick hegrinned unfeelingly im not sorry ive no wish to do george probyns work when hes in his cups bolitho grimaced im coming round to everyone elses view simon ill go below now he looked up at the flapping masthead pendant it seems i shall have the afternoon watch after all but it appeared that the captain had other ideas and still retained some powerful faith in his sailing master bolitho was relieved from his watchkeeping duties and spent most of lie time compiling a letter to his father he merely added to the same long letter whenever he found the opportunity and ended it just as abruptly whenever they spoke with a homebound packet it would be a link with his father the reverse would also be true as bolitho described daily events the sighting of ships and islands the life which was no more for captain james he sat on his sea chest squinting his eyes as he tried to think of something new to put in his letter a chill seemed to run up his spine as if a ghost had suddenly entered his tiny cabin he looked up startled and saw the deckhead lantern flickering as before but was it he stared and then peered round at the small hanging space where his other clothing had been swaying and creaking just moments earlier bolitho stood up but remembered to duck his head as he rushed out and aft into the wardroom the stern windows were dull grey streaked with spindrift and caked salt he pressed his face against them and exclaimed my god the sage was right he hurried up to the quarterdeck instantly aware of the motionless figures all around him their eyes peering across the quarter or up at the sails which were lifting and then drooping shaking against the pressures of rigging and spars cairns had the watch and looked at him gravely the fog dick he pointed across the nettings it is coming now bolitho watched the slow progress the way it seemed to smooth the turbulence from the waves and flatten the crests as it approached deck there oive lost sight o th schooner zur pears voice cut across the speculation and gossip bring her up two points mr cairns he watched the sudden bustle the shrill calls between decks man the braces there pears said to the deck at large well gain a cable or so he looked up as the wheel squeaked and the yards began to swing in response to the braces with her great spread of canvas still holding the dying wind trojan heeled obediently and pointed her jib boom further to windward flapping canvas chattering blocks and the yells of petty officers did not cover his voice as he said to the tall sailing master that was well done mr bunce bunce dragged his gaze from the helmsmen and the swaying compass card in the dull light his eyes and brows stood out from all else he replied humbly it is his will sir pears turned away as if to hide a smile he barked mr sparke lay aft mr bolitho attend the cutters and have them swayed out presently steel clashed between decks and more men swarmed up to the boat tier their arms filled with cutlasses pikes and muskets bolitho was on the gundeck watching the second cutters black painted hull rising on its tackles then he turned to look aft and saw that the upper poop and the taffrail were already misty and without substance he said lively lads or well not find our way over the bulwark it brought a few laughs pears heard them and said soberly to sparke tend well what the master tells you about the set of the current hereabouts it will save a mile of unnecessary boat pulling and not see you arriving on your prize with no breath to lift a blade he watched sparkes eyes as they took it all in and take care if you cannot board then stand off and wait for the fog to clear well not drift that much apart he cupped his hands shorten sail mr cairns bring her about and lie to more shouted commands and moments later as the courses and topsails were brailed up to the yards the two boats detached themselves from the shadowy gundeck and swung up and over the gangway bolitho came aft and touched his hat the people are mustered and armed sir sparke handed him a scribbled note estimated course to steer mr bunce has allowed for the schooners drift and the strength of the current he looked at the captain ill be away sir pears said carry on mr sparke he was going to add good luck but set against sparkes severe features it seemed superfluous he did say to bolitho however do not get lost sir ill not hunt around massachusetts bay for a year bolitho smiled i will do my best sir as he ran down to the entry port pears said to cairns young rascal but cairns was watching the pitching boats alongside already filled with men and waiting for sparke and bolitho to take them clear of their ship his heart was with them it did him no good to realize that the captains decision had probably been the right one pears watched the black hulls turning end on the confused splash and thud of oars suddenly picking up the stroke and taking them deeper into the wet enveloping mist double the watch on deck mr cairns have swivels loaded and set to withstand any boarding attempt on ourselves what will you do now sir pears looked up at his ships strength each sail was either furled or motionless and trojan herself was paying off to the current rolling deeply on a steady swell do he yawned i am going to eat bolitho stood up in the sternsheets and gripped stockdales shoulder while he found his balance through the mans checkered shirt his muscles felt like warm timber the mist swirled into the boat clinging to their arms and face making their hair glisten as if with frost bolitho listened to the steady unhurried pull of the oars no sense in urgency save the strength for later he said hold her norwest stockdale i am assured that is the best course to take he thought of bunces wild eyes could there be any other course indeed then leaving stockdale at the tiller crouching over the boats compass bolitho groped his way slowly towards the bows climbing over thwarts and grunting seamen treading on weapons and the feet of the extra passengers the twentyeightfoot cutter had a crew of eight and a coxswain in normal times now she held them and an additional party which in total amounted to eighteen officers and men he found balleine the boatswains mate crouching above the stem like a figurehead peering into the wet mist a hand cupped around his ear to pick up the slightest sound which might be a ship or another boat bolitho said quietly i cannot see the second lieutenants cutter so we must assume we are dependent on our own resources aye sir the reply was blunt bolitho thought balleine might be brooding over the flogging or merely resentful in being given a lookouts job while stockdale took the tiller bolitho said i am depending on your experience today he saw the man nod and knew he had found the right spot i fear we are somewhat short of it otherwise the boatswains mate grinned mr quinn and mr couzens sir ill see em fair i knew it he touched the mans arm and began to make his way aft again he picked out individual faces and shapes dunwoody a millers son from kent a darkskinned arab named kutbi who had enlisted in bristol although nobody knew much about him even now rabbett a tough little man from the liverpool waterfront and varlo who had been crossed in love and had been picked up by the pressgang while he had been drowning his sorrows at his local inn these and many more he had grown to know some he knew very well others stayed away keeping the rigid barrier between forecastle and quarterdeck he reached the sternsheets and sat down between quinn and couzens their three ages added together only came to fiftytwo the ridiculous thought made him chuckle and lie felt the others turning towards him they think me already unhinged i have lost sight of sparke and am probably steering in quite the wrong direction he explained i am sorry it was just a thought ile took a deep breath of the wet salt air but getting away from the ship is reward enough he spread his arms and saw stockdale give his lopsided grin freedom to do what we w right or wrong quinn nodded i think i understand bolitho said your father will be proud of you after ah f we live that long cairns had explained to bolitho what quinn had meant about his family being in the leather trade bolitho had imagined it to be a tanyard of the kind they had in falmouth bridles and saddles shoes and straps cairns had almost laughed man his father belongs to an allpowerful city company he has contracts with the army and influence everywhere else when i look at young quinn i sometimes marvel at his audacity to refuse all that power and all that money he must be either brave or mad to exchange it for this a large fish broke surface nearby and flopped back into the water again making couzens and some of the others gasp with alarm easy all bolitho held up his arm to still the oars again he was very conscious of the sea of their isolation as the oars rose dripping and motionless along the gunwales he heard the gurgle of water around the rudder as the boat idled forward into the swell the splash of another fish the heavy breathing of the oarsmen then quinn said in a whisper i hear the odhcr cutter sir bolitho nodded turning his face to starbcard picking upp the muffled creak of oars sparke was keeping about sat npace and distance he said give way all beside him couzens gave a nervous cough and asked hhon many of the enemy will there be sir depends if theyve already taken a prize or two theylll be short of hands if not we may be facing twice our number ci more i see sir bolitho turned away couzens did not see but he was able to discuss it in a manner which would do justice to a veteran he felt the fog against his cheek like a cold breath was in moving faster than before he had a picture of the wind rising and driving the fog away laying them bare beneath the schooners guns even a swivel could rip his party to shrede before he could get to grips he looked slowly along the straining oarsmen and the other waiting to take their turn how many would change sides if that happened it had occurred often enough already when british seamen had been taken by privateers it was common practice in the navy too trojan had several hands in hei company caught or seized in the past two years from both sea and land it was thought better to fight alongside their old enemy rather than risk disease and possible death in a prison hulk while there was life there was always hope bolitho reached up and touched his scar it was throbbing again and seemed to probe right through his skull stockdale opened the shutter of his lantern very slightly and examined his compass he said steady as she goes sir it seemed to amuse him on and on changing the men at the oars listening foa sparkes cutter watching for even a hint of danger bolitho thought that the schooners master being a local man may have made more sail and outpaced the fog might already be miles away laughing while they pulled slowly and painfully towards some part of new england he allowed his mind to explore what was fast becoming a real possibility they might get ashore undetected and try to steal a small vessel and escape under sail then what balleine called hoarsely theres a glow of sorts sir bolitho stumbled forward again everything else forgotten there sir bolitho strained his eyes through the darkness a glow that described it exactly like the window of an alehouse through a waterfront fog no shape no centre a lantern balleine licked his lips hung very high so therell be another bugger nearby bunce had been very accurate but for his careful calculations they might have passed the other vessel without seeing her or the light she was standing about a mile away maybe less bolitho said easy all when he returned to the sternsheets he said shes up ahead lads from our drift id say shell be bows on or stern on well take what comes quinn said in a husky voice mr sparke is coming sir they heard sparke call are you ready mr bolitho he sounded impatient even querulous his earlier doubts forgotten aye sir we will take her from either end sparkes boat loomed through the fog the lieutenants white shirt and breeches adding to the ghostlike appearance that way we can divide their people bolitho said nothing but his heart sank either end so the boat which pulled the furthest would have a good chance of being seen before she could grapple sparkes oars began to move again and he called i will take the stern bolitho waited until the other was clear and then signalled his own men to pull you all know what to do couzens nodded his face compressed with concentration i will stay with the boat sir quinn added jerkily ill support you sir er dick and take the foredeck bolitho nodded balleine will hold his men until they are ready to use their muskets cairns had been insistent about that and rightly so any fool might set off a musket too soon if it was loaded and primed from the start bolitho drew his curved hanger and unclipped the leather scabbard dropping it to the bottom boards there it would wait until he needed it but worn during an attack it might trip and throw him under a cutlass he touched the back of the blade but kept his eyes fixed on the wavering glow beyond the bows the nearer they got the smaller it became as the fogs distortion had less control over it from one corner of his eye he thought he saw a series of splashes as sparke increased his stroke and went in for the attack bolitho watched as with startling suddenness the masts and booms of the drifting schooner broke across the cloudy sky like black bars and the lantern sharpened into one unwinking eye stockdale touched couzens arm making the boy jump as if he had cut him here your fist on the tillerbar sir he guided him as if couzens had been struck blind take over from me when i give the word with his other hand stockdale picked up his outdated boarding cutlass which weighed as much as two of the modern ones bolitho held up his arm and the oars rose and remained poised over either beam like featherless wings he watched holding his breath feeling the drag of current and holding power of the rudder they would collide with the schooners raked stem right beneath her bowsprit with any sort of luck boat your oars he was speaking in a fierce whisper although surely his heartbeats against his ribs would be heard all the way to boston his lips were frozen in a wild grin which he could not control madness desperation fear it was all here ready with the grapnel he watched the slender bowsprit sweeping across them as if the schooner was riding at full power to smash them under her forefoot bolitho saw balleine rising with his grapnel gauging the moment ducking to avoid losing his head on the schooners bobstay there was a sudden bang followed by a longdrawnout scream bolitho saw and heard it all in a mere second the flash which seemed to come from the sea itself the response from the vessel above him yells and startled movements before more explosions ripped across the water towards the scream he jumped to his feet ready lads he shut sparke from his mind the fool had allowed somebody to load a musket and it had gone off hitting one of his men it was too late now for any of them bolitho threw up his arm and seized the trailing line as the grapnel thudded into the schooners bowsprit and slewed the cutter drunkenly around the bows at em lads then he was struggling with feet and hands the hanger dangling from his wrist as he fought his way up and around the flared hull the other end of the vessel was lit by exploding muskets and as bolithos men clambered over the forecastle and cannoned into unfamiliar pieces of gear more shots hammered into the deck around them or whined above the rocking cutter like maddened spirits he heard quinn gasping and stumbling beside him stockdales heavy frame striding just a bit ahead the cutlass moving before him as if to sniff out the enemy something flew out of the darkness and a man fell shrieking a pike driven through his chest more cracks and two more of bolitho s men dropped but they were nearer now bolitho gripped his hanger and yelled surrender in the kings name it brought a chorus of curses and derisive shouts as he knew it would but it gave him just the few more seconds he needed to get to grips he hacked out and knocked a sword from somebodys hand as the man ran to retrieve it bolitho heard stockdales cutlass smash into his skull heard the big man grunt as he wrenched it free then they were chest to chest blade to blade behind him bolitho heard balleine yelling and blaspheming the sporadic bang of muskets as he managed to get off a few shots at the shrouds where sharpshooters were trying to find their targets a bearded face loomed through the others and bolitho felt his blade grate against the mans sword with a clang of steel as they parried pushed each other clear to find the space to fight around them figures staggered and reeled like crazed drunkards their cutlasses striking sparks the voices distorted and wild with hate and fear bolitho ducked slashed the man across the ribs and as he lurched clear he brought the hanger down on his neck with such force he numbed his wrist but they were being pushed back towards the forecastle all the same somewhere a hundred miles away bolitho heard a cannon shot and through his dazed mind he guessed that it was another vessel nearby trying to show that help was on its way his shoes slipped on blood and a dying sailor trodden and kicked by the fighting hacking mass of men above him tried to seize bolithos ankle another man screamed and fell from aloft dead from a musket ball before he hit the deck but carried by the desperately fighting seamen he still seemed to cling to life like a tipsy dancer bolitho saw a pair of white legs against the bulwark and knew it was quinn he was being attacked by two men at once and even as bolitho slashed one of them across the shoulder and dragged him screaming to one side quinn gasped and dropped to his knees his sword gone and both hands pressed to his chest his attacker was so wild with the lust of battle he did not seem to see bolitho he stood above the lieutenant and drew back his arm for the kill bolitho caught him by the sleeve swung him round using the impetus of the mans swordthrust to take him off balance then he drove the knuckle guard of his hanger into his face the pain jarring his wrist again like a wound the man lurched upright and seemed to be spitting out teeth as he bore down for another attack then he stopped stockstill his eyes white in the gloom like pebbles as he slowly pirouetted around and then fell balleine pounced forward and tore his boarding axe from the mans back as he would from a chopping block there was a commotion alongside and moments later the retreating boarders heard sparks s penetrating voice as he shouted to me trojans to me attacked from both ends of the schooner and with the obvious possibility of other boats nearby the fight ended as swiftly as it had begun there were not even any curses thrown at the british seamen this time trojans men were too wild and shocked with the handtohand fighting which had left several of their own dead and badly wounded to accept insults as well the schooners crew seemed to sense this and allowed themselves to be disarmed searched and then herded into two manageable groups sparke a pistol in either hand strode amongst the corpses and whimpering wounded and when he saw bolitho snapped might have been worse he could not control his elation nice little craft very nice he saw quinn and leaned over him is it bad balleine who had torn open the lieutenants shirt and was trying to stem the blood said slit his chest like a peach sir but if we can get him to but sparke had already gone elsewhere bellowing for frowd his masters mate to attend to the business of getting under way at the first breath of a breeze bolitho was on his knees holding quinns hands away from the wound as balleine did his best with a makeshift bandage easy james he saw quinns head lolling his efforts to control his agony his hands were like ice and there was blood everywhere you will be all right i promise sparke was back again come come mr bolitho theres a lot to do and ill wager well have company before too long he dropped his voice suddenly and bolitho was confronted by a sparke he had not seen before in the two years he had known him i know how you feel about quinn responsible but you must not show it not now in front of the people dyou see theyre feeling the shock the fights going out of them theyll be looking to us so well save our regrets for later eh he changed back again now then cutters to be warped aft and secured check the armament or lack of it and see that it is loaded to repel attack canister grape anything you can lay hands on he looked for somebody in the foggy darkness you archer train a swivel on the prisoners one sign that they might try to retake the ship and you know what to do stockdale was wiping his cutlass on a piece of some luckless mans shirt he said ill watch over mr quinn sir he rubbed the cutlass again and then thrust it through his belt a good tot would suit him fine im thinking bolitho nodded aye see to it he walked away the sobs and groans from the darkened deck painting a better picture than any sight could do he saw dunwoody the millers son groping around an inert shape by the bulwark the seaman said brokenly its me mate sir bill tyler bolitho said i know i saw him fall he recalled sparkes advice and added get that lantern down from aloft directly we dont want to invite the moths do we dunwoody stood up and wiped his face no sir i suppose not he hurried away but glanced back at his dead friend as if to tell himself it was not true sparke was everywhere and when he rejoined bolitho by the wheel he said briskly shes the faithful owned by the tracy brothers of boston known privateers and very efficient at their trade bolitho waited feeling his wrists and hands trembling with strain sparke added i have searched the cabin quite a haul of information he was bubbling with pleasure captain tracy was killed just now he gestured to the upturned white eyes of the man killed by balleines boarding axe thats him the other one his brother commands a fine brig apparently the revenge taken from us last year she was named mischief then aye sir i remember she was taken off cape may it was amazing that he could speak so calmly as if they were both out for a stroll instead of standing amidst carnage and pain sparke eyed him curiously are you steadier now he did not wait for an answer good the only way bolitho asked does she have any sort of cargo sir none she was obviously expecting to get that from our convoy ile looked up at the bare masts put some hands to work on this deck its like a slaughterhouse drop the corpses over the side and have the wounded carried below theres precious little comfort for them but its a sight warmer than on deck as bolitho made to hurry away sparke added calmly besides which i want them to be as quiet as possible there may be boats nearby and i intend to hold this vessel as our prize bolitho looked round for his hat which had gone flying in the fight that was more like it he thought grimly for a brief moment he had imagined that sparkes reason for moving the injured was solely for humanitys sake he should have known better the work to clear up the deck and to search out the vessels defences and stores went on without a break the fit and unwounded men did the heavy work the ones with lesser injuries sat with muskets and at the loaded swivels to watch over the prisoners the badly wounded one of whom was the man who had foolishly fired his musket and had lost half his face in doing so managed as best they could sparke had not mentioned the musket incident but for it the casualties would have been much reduced even minimal the schooners crew were brave enough but without that warning and lacking as they did the hardened discipline of trojans seamen it would likely have ended with little more than a bloody nose or two bolitho knew sparke must have thought about this he would doubtless be hoping that pears would see only the prize and forget the oversight several times bolitho climbed down to the masters cabin where the late captain tracy had lived and made his plans there quinn was lying whitefaced on a rough bunk his bandages soaked in blood his lip cut where he had bitten it to stem the anguish bolitho asked stockdale what he thought and the man answered readily he has a will to live sir but hes precious little hope im thinking the first hint of dawn came with the lightening of the surrounding mist the schooners lazaret had been broken open and a generous ration of neat rum issued to all hands including the two young midshipmen of the attacking force of thirttsix officers and seamen twelve were already dead or as near to as made no difference and several of the survivors had cuts and bruises which had lef them too weak and dazed to be of much use for the moment bolitho watched the paling mist seeing the schooner taking shape around them he saw couzens and midshipman libb from sparkes boat staring at the great bloodstains on the plank ing perhaps realizing only now what they had seen and done mr frowd the masters mate waited by the wheel watchini the limp sails which bolithos men had shaken out in readines for the first breeze the only sounds were the clatter of loosi gear the creak of timbers as the vessel rolled uncomfortably o the swell with the dawn came the awareness of danger that which fox might feel when it crosses open land bolitho looked along the deck the faithful carried eigh sixpounders and four swivel guns all of which had been madh in france this fact added to the discovery of some very fins and freshly packed brandy in the captains lazaret hinted at close relationship with the french privateers she was a very handy little vessel of about seventyfive feet one which would sail to windward better than most and outpace any heavier squarerigged ship whoever captain tracy had once been he would not have planned to be dead on this new dawn the boom of the large gaffheaded mainsail creaked noisily and the deck gave a resounding tremble sparke shouted lively there here comes the wind bolitho saw his expression and called stand by the foresl he waved to balleine ready with stays and jib the schooners returning life seemed to affect him also a goof hand at the wheel mr frowd frowd showed his teeth he had picked a helmsman already but understood bolithos mood he had been in the navy a long as the fourth lieutenant had been on this earth every man had at least two jobs to do at once but watched by the silent prisoners they bustled about the confined deck as if they had been doing it for months sir mastheads to starboard sparke spun round as bolitho pointed towards the rolling bank of fog two masts were standing through above it one with a drooping pendant but enough to show it was a larger vessel than the faithful the blocks clattered and squealed as the seamen hauled and panted while the foresail and then the big mainsail with its strange scarlet patch at its throat were set to the wind the deck tilted and the helmsman reported gruffly we ave steerage way sir sparke peered at the misty compass bowl wind seems as before mr frowd let her fall off well try and hold the windgage from this other beauty but well run if needs be the two big sails swung out on their booms shaking away the clinging moisture and yesterdays rain like dogs emerging from a stream bolitho said mr couzens take three hands and help balleine with the staysl as he turned again he saw what sparke had seen with the fog rolling and unfolding downwind like smoke the other vessel seemed to leap bodily from it she was a brig with the nowfamiliar striped grand union flag with its circle of stars set against the hoist already lifting and flapping from her peak something like a sigh came from the watching prisoners and one called now youll see some iron before they bury you sparke snapped keep that man silent or put a ball in his head i dont care which he glanced at frowd fall off two points steer noreast will i have the sixpounders run out sir sparke had found a telescope and was training it on the brig shes the old mischief he steadied the glass ah i see her captain must be the other tracy he looked at bolitho no if we get close enough to use these little guns the brig will reduce us to toothpicks within half an hour agility and speed is all we have he tugged out his watch and studied it he did not even blink as a gun crashed out and a ball slapped through the foresail like an invisible fist spray lifted over the bows and pattered across the busy seamen there the wind got stronger as the fog hurried ahead of the little schooner as if afraid of being impaled on the jib boom the brig had set her topsails and forecourse now and was in hot pursuit trying to beat to windward and outsail the schooner in one unbroken tack her two bowchasers were shooting gun by gun the air cringing to the wild scream which could only mean chainshot or langridge just one of those around a mast and it would be the start of the end another gun must have been trained round to bear on the elusive faithful and a moment later a ball ripped low over the poop cutting rigging and almost hitting one of the prisoners who had risen to watch a seaman snarled at him ysee matey yankee iron is just as bloody for you this time balleine hurried aft and asked shall i cut the boats adrift sir we might gain half a knot without them another ball slammed down almost alongside hurling spray clean over the poop like tropical rain a seaman yelled in disbelief the yankees goin about sir sparke permitted himself a small smile of satisfaction with the fog retreating rapidly through her towering masts and rigging like ghostly gunsmoke the trojan loomed to meet them her exposed broadside already run out in twin lines of black muzzles sparke said bless me mr bolitho theyll have us if were not careful midshipman libby ran aft like a rabbit and seconds later the british ensign broke from the gaff bright scarlet to match the one above trojans gilded poop below in the tiny cabin stockdale wiped quinns forehead with a wet rag and looked at the skylight quinn moved his lips very slowly what was that sound stockdale watched him sadly cheering sir mustve sighted the old trojan he saw quinn swoon away again on a tide of pain and the brandy which he had been forcing into him if he lived he might never be the same again then he thought of the splashes alongside as the corpses friends and enemies alike had been buried at sea even so hed be better off than them rendezvous bolitho strode aft and paused beneath the trojans poop conscious of the many watching eyes which followed him along the deck just as they had greeted his return on board he was aware too of his dirty and bedraggled appearance the tear in his coat sleeve and smears of dried blood across his breeches he looked over his shoulder and saw the prize more graceful than ever at a distance riding comfortably beneath trojans lee it was hard to picture what had happened aboard her during the night let alone accept he had managed to survive it sparke had come across to the trojan immediately they had made signal contact and had left bolitho to attend to the transfer of wounded and the burial of the man whose musket had exploded in his face before reporting to the captain bolitho had hurried down to the orlop almost dreading what he would find responsible that was what sparke had said it was how it had felt as he had looked at the spreadeagled body on the surgeons table shining like a corpse in the swaying deckhead lanterns quinn had been stripped naked and as thorndike had slit away the last of the matted bandage bolitho had seen the gash for the first time from the point of quinns left shoulder diagonally across his breast it opened like an obscene mouth quinn was unconscious and thorndike had said curtly not too bad but another day he shrugged different story bolitho had asked can you save him thorndike had faced him displaying his bloody apron as he had snapped ill do what i can i have already taken off a mans leg and another has a splinter in his eye bolitho had said awkwardly i am sorry iil not delay you further now as he made his way towards the stern cabin where a scarletcoated marine stood stiffly on guard he felt the same dull ache of failure and despair they had taken a prize but the cost had been too great the marine stamped his boots together and then foley as neat as ever opened the outer door his eyes widening as he took in bolithos crumpled appearance with obvious disapproval in the stern cabin captain pears was at his desk some papers strewn across it a tall goblet of wine in one hand bolitho stared at sparke he was smartly dressed shaved and looked as if he had never left the ship pears ordered wine for the fourth lieutenant he watched bolitho as he took the goblet from his servant saw the strain the dragging weariness of the nights work mr sparke has been telling me o f your impressive deeds mr bolitho pears face was devoid of expression the schooner is a good catch bolitho let the wine warm his stomach soothe the ache in his mind sparke had come straight to the ship had changed and cleaned himself before presenting his report to the captain how much had he told him about the first part the startling crash of the musket which had added so much to the bill pears asked how is mr quinn by the way the surgeon is hopeful sir pears eyed him strangely good and i understand both the midshipmen behaved well too he turned his attention to the littered papers the rest apparently put aside finished pears said these papers were found by mr sparke in the faith f uls cabin they are of even greater value than the prize herself he looked at them grimly they give details of the schooners mission after she had taken on any captured powder and weapons from the convoy the escorts would have been hard put to protect the whole convoy and keep it intact after the sort of weather we have been experiencing and i have no doubt it was even worse conning out of halifax as it is the brig will have to manage without her although i would expect there to be other wolves trailing such rich cargoes even now bolitho asked when will you expect to sight the ships sir mr bunce and i believe tomorrow he spoke as if it no longer mattered but there is something else which must be done without delay the faithful was to rendezvous with the enemy near the mouth of delaware bay our army in philadelphia is hard put to force supplies upriver to the garrison there are patrols and skirmishers every mile of the way to fire on our boats and barges just think how much worse it will get if the enemy can lay hands on more arms and powder bolitho nodded and took another goblet from foley his mind seeing it exactly delaware bay was some four hundred miles south of where he was standing a fast lively craft could reach the rendezvous in three days if the weather favoured her they had been that confident he thought the red patch on the mainsail the signal to the watchers on the shore it was just the right place for it too very shallow and treacherous at low tide where no prowling frigate would dare give chase for fear of tearing out her keel he said you will send the faithful sir yes there will be some risk of course the passage might take longer than we plan for the enemy know that faithful has been seized and will use every ruse to pass the word south without losing a moment signals fast horsemen it can be done he permitted himself a wintry smile mr revere has established that point beyond question sparke drew himself up very stiffly and looked at bolitho i have been given the honour of commanding this mission pears said calmly if you wish mr bolitho you may go with the second lieutenant as before the choice is yours this time bolitho nodded marvelling that he did not even hesitate aye sir id like to go that is settled then pears dragged out his gold watch i will have your orders written at once but mr sparke already knows the bones of the matter cairns entered the cabin his hat tucked under his arm i have sent some hands across to the schooner sir the gunner is attending to the armament he paused his eyes on bolitho mr quinn is still unconscious but the surgeon says his heart and breathing are fair pears nodded tell my clerk to come aft at once cairns hesitated by the door i have brought the prisoners aboard sir shall i swear them in pears shook his head no volunteers i will accept but this war has taken too firm a hold to expect a change of loyalties as a matter of course they would be like bad apples in a barrel and ill not risk discontent in my ship well hand them to the authorities in new york when we return there cairns left and pears said the written orders will not protect you from the cannon of our patrols in the area so show them a clean pair of heels if there are spies about it will make your guise even more acceptable teakle the captains clerk scurried into the cabin and pears dismissed them go and prepare yourselves gentlemen i want you to keep that rendezvous and destroy what you discover there it will be worth a great deal and may put heart into our troops at philadelphia the two lieutenants left the cabin and sparke said we will be taking some marines this time he sounded as if he disliked the idea of sharing his new role but speed is the thing so go and hurry our people to ferry the rest of the stores and weapons across to the schooner bolitho touched his hat and replied aye sir and replace midshipman couzens with mr weston this is no work for children bolitho walked out into the chilling air and watched the boats plying back and forth between the unmatched vessels like waterbeetles weston was the signals midshipman and like libby who had been in sparke s boat would be the next on the list for examination for lieutenant if quinn died the promotion of one of them would be immediate he saw couzens watching from the lee gangway as trojan rolled and complained while she lay hove to for the transfer of men and equipment couzens has obviously already been told of the change and said breathlessly id like to come with you sir bolitho eyed him gravely couzens at thirteen would be worth two of weston he was an overweight gingerhaired youth of seventeen and something of a bully when he could get away with it he replied next time maybe hle looked away we shall see it was odd that he rarely thought of being replaced himself of being just another name marked dd discharged dead to be killed was one thing to be replaced by someone he actually knew at this moment brought it home like a dash of ice water he saw stockdale arms folded on the schoonee s little poop as she rolled sickeningly on a procession of troughs waiting knowing with his inner sense that bolitho would be going across at any moment to join him the marines were climbing down into the boats now pursued by all the usual insults from the watching seamen captain desterre accompanied by his sergeant joined bolitho on the gangway thanks to you dick my lads will get some exercise i trust he waved to his lieutenant who was remaining aboard with the rest of the marines take care ill outlive you yet the marine lieutenant grinned and touched his hat at least i may have a chance of winning a hand of cards while youre away sir then the captain and his sergeant followed the others into the nearest boat bolitho saw sparke speaking with cairns and the master and said impetuously visit mr quinn whenever you can will you do that for me couzens nodded with sudden gravity it was a special task something just for him alone aye sir he stood back as sparke came hurrying from the quarterdeck and added quickly i will pray for you sir bolitho stared at him with surprise but he was moved too thank you that was well said then touching his hat to the quarterdeck and nodding to the faces along the gangway he hurried into the boat sparke thumped down beside him his written orders bulging from an inner pocket as the boat shoved off bolitho saw the seamen hurrying along the trojans decks and yards getting ready to make sail again once she had retrieved her boats sparke said at last something to make them all sit up and take notice desterre was looking at the dizzily swaying schooner with sudden apprehension how the deuce will we all get settled into her in heavens name sparke bared his teeth it will not be for long sailors are used to such small hardships bolitho let his mind drift away seeing his own hand as he continued with the last letter to his father as if he were actually writing it at this moment today i had the chance to stay with the ship but i chose to return to the prize he watched the masts and booms rising above the labouring oarsmen perhaps i am wrong but i believe that sparke is so full o f hope for the future he can see nothing else the boat hooked on and the last of the marines clambered and clattered over the bulwark swaying on the deck like toy soldiers in an unsteady box shears their sergeant soon took charge and within minutes there was not a red coat to be seen as one by one they climbed down into the vessels main hold one of trojans ninepounders had been ferried across and was now firmly lashed on the deck with tackles skilfully fitted to the schooners available ringbolts and cleats how william chimmo trojans gunner had managed to get it ferried over remounted and set in its present position was evidence of a real expert a professional warrant officer he had sent one of his mates a taciturn man called rowhurst to tend the ninepounders needs and he was looking at the gun rubbing it with a rag and probably wondering what would happen to the schooners deck planking when he had to lay and fire it by the time they had sorted out the hands the new ones and those of the original party who were still aboard and put them to work trojan was already standing downwind with more and more canvas ballooning from her yards one boat was still being lowered inboard on to the tier pears was so eager to make up for lost time bolitho watched her for some minutes seeing her from a distance as quinn had once seen the great ships heading down the thames things of power and beauty while within their hulls they carried as much hope and pain as any landlocked town now quinn was lying on the orlop or perhaps already dead mr frowd touched his hat ready to get under way sir he glanced meaningly at sparke who was peering at his written orders entirely absorbed bolitho called we are ready sir sparke scowled irritated at the interruption then please be so good as to turn the hands to frowd rubbed his hands as he looked at the big boomed sails and the waiting seamen shell fly this one he became formal again i suggest we take account of the present wind sir and steer soueast thatll take us well clear of the bay and prepare us for old nantucket again bolitho nodded very well bring her about and lay her on the starboard tack sparke came out of his trance and crossed the deck as the man ran to bring the schooner under command it is a good plan he stuck out his narrow chin the late and unlamented captain tracy wrote almost everything about the rendezvous except the colour of his countrymens eyes he gripped a stay as the wheel went over and the two great booms swung above the gurgling water alongside and each sail filled until it looked ironhard bolitho noticed that even the hole in the foresail made by the brigs cannon had been deftly patched during the last few hours the dexterity of the british sailor when he put his mind to something was beyond measure he thought the faithful was responding well in spite of her changed ownership with spray leaping over her stem and sluicing into small rivers along her lee scuppers she came about like a thoroughbred the sails filling again and thundering to the wind eventually leaning over stiffly to take full advantage of the new tack frowd was satisfied after serving under bunce he had learned to take nothing for granted sparke watched unblinking from right aft by the taffrail he said dismiss the watch below mr bolitho he turned and shaded his eyes to seek out the trojan but she was hidden in a rain squall little more than a shadow or a smudge on an imperfect painting sparke lurched unsteadily to the cabin hatch i will be below if you need me bolitho breathed out slowly sparke was no longer a lieutenant he had become a captain mr bolitho sir bolitho rolled over in the unfamiliar bunk and blinked at a shaded lantern it was midshipman weston leaning over him his shadow looming across the cabin like a spectre what is it bolitho dragged his mind reluctantly from the precious sleep he sat up massaging his eyes his throat sore from the stench of the sealed cabin the damp and foul air weston watched him the second lieutenants compliments sir and would you join him on deck bolitho threw his legs over the bunk and tested the schooners motion it must be nearly dawn he thought and sparke was already about that was strange to say the least as he usually left the matters of watchkeeping and routine alterations of tack and course to bolitho or frowd weston said nothing and bolitho was disinclined to ask what was happening it would show doubt and uncertainty to the midshipman who had enough of his own already he scrambled through the companion hatch and winced to the greeting of needlesharp spray and wind the sky was much as he had last seen it low scudding clouds and with no sign of a star he listened to the boom of canvas the creak of spars as the schooner plunged drunkenly across a deep trough with such violence it almost flung him to the deck it had been like this for three days the wind had become their enemy more often than not and they had been made to change tack again and again beating back and forth for miles to make an advance of just a few cables or indeed for a complete loss of progress sparke had been almost desperate as day by day they had driven south and then southwest towards the land and the mouth of the delaware even the most disciplined seaman aboard had become sullen and resentful at sparkes attitude he was intolerant of everyone and seemed totally obsessed by the task entrusted to him and now the possibility of failure bolitho crossed the slippery planking and shouted above the wind you sent for me sir sparke swung round retaining his grip on the weather shrouds his usually immaculate hair streaming in the wind as he replied angrily of course damn it you have taken long enough bolitho controlled his sudden anger knowing that sparkes shouted rebuke must have been heard by most of the men on deck he waited sensing the lieutenants mood his allconsuming need to drive the ship with every stitch she would carry sparke said abruptly the masters mate has suggested we stay on this tack until noon bolitho forced his mind to grapple with it to picture their wavering progress on the chart he answered without hesitation mr frowd means we are less likely to run foul of local shipping or worse one of our own patrols mr frowd is an idiot hle was yelling again and if you agree with him you are equally so damn your eyes bolitho swallowed hard counting seconds as he would for a fall of shot i have to agree with him sir ile is a man of much experience and i am not i suppose ile held up his free hand do not bother to argue with me my mind is settled on it we will change tack in one hour and head directly for the rendezvous it will cut the time considerably on this tack we could be another full day bolitho tried again the enemy will not know our exact time of arrival sir or indeed if we are coming at all war leaves no room for such planning sparke had not heard him by the living god ill not let them get away now ive waited long enough watching others being handed giltedged commands because they know somebody at the admiralty or in court well mr bolitho not me ive worked all the way earned each step up the ladder he seemed to realize what he had said that he had laid himself wide open before his subordinate and added now call the hands tell mr frowd to prepare his chart he eyed him fixedly his face very pale in the gloom ill have no arguments tell him that alsov have you discussed it with captain desterre sir sparke laughed certainly not he is a marine a soldier as far as i am concerned in the cupboardlike space adjoining the masters cabin which was the faith fuls chart room bolitho joined frowd and peered at the calculations and compass directions which had become their daily fare since leaving trojans company frowd said quietly it will get us there more quickly sir but bolitho was bent low to avoid the deckhead conscious of the vessels violent motion the nearness of the sea through the side aye mr frowd there are always the buts we will just have to hope for some luck frowd grinned bitterly ive no wish to be killed by my own countrymen by mistake or otherwise sir an hour later with all hands employed on deck faithful clawed around to starboard pointing her bowsprit towards the invisible land a single reef in main and foresail all that sparke would tolerate she was leaning right over to leeward the sea creaming up and over the bulwark or sluicing across the tethered ninepounder like surf around a rock it was still extremely cold and what food the cook managed to produce was soon without warmth and soggy with spray after its perilous passage along the upper deck as the light strengthened sparke sent an extra lookout aloft with orders to report anything he saw even if it is a floating log bolitho watched sparkes anxiety mount all through the forenoon as the schooner pushed steadily westward only once did the lookout sight another sail but it was lost in spray and distance before he could give either a description or the course she was steering stockdale was rarely out of bolithos sight and was using his strength to great advantage as the seamen were ordered from one mast to the other or made to climb aloft to repair and splice fraying rigging the cry from the masthead when it came was like an unexpected shot land ho men temporarily forgot their discomfort as they squinted through the curtain of rain and spray searching for the landfall sparke hung on to the shrouds with his telescope all dignity forgotten as he waited for the schooner to leap on a steep crest and he found the mark he had been hoping for he jumped down to the deck and glared triumphantly at frowd let her fall off a point that is cape henlopen yonder to the norwest of us he could not contain himself now mr frowd how about your caution eh the helmsman called west by north sir full an bye frowd replied grimly the winds shifted sir not much as yet but were heading for shallows to the southrd of delaware bay sparke grimaced more caution it is my duty to warn you on these matters sir he stood his ground bolitho said mr frowd is largely responsible for this final landfall sir that i will acknowledge at the right time provided he stared up the mast as a lookout yelled deck there sail on th larboard quarter god damn sparke stared up until his eyes brimmed over with water ask the fool what she is midshipman libby was already swarming up the weather shrouds his feet moving like paddles in his efforts to reach the lookout then he shouted too small for a frigate sir but i think shes sighted us bolitho watched the tossing grey water they would all be able to see the newcomer soon too small for a frigate libby had said but like one in appearance three masts squarerigged a sloopofwar faithfuls slender hull would be no match for a sloops sixteen or eighteen cannon we had better come about sir and hoist our recognition signal he saw the uncertainty on sparkes narrow features the scar very bright on his cheek like a red penny the other lookout called excitedly two small craft to loord sir standin inshore bolitho bit his lip probably local coasting craft in company for mutual protection and steering for the bay their presence ruled out the possibility of parleying with the patrolling sloop if they were nearby so too might other less friendly eyes frowd suggested helpfully if we come about now sir we can outsail her even to windrd ive been in schooners afore and i know what they can do sparkes voice rose almost to a scream how dare you question my judgement ill have you disrated if you speak like that to me again come about wait and see run away god damn it youre more like an old woman than a masters mate frowd looked away angry and hurt bolitho broke in i know what he was trying to say sir he watched sparkes eyes swivel towards him but did not drop his gaze we can stand off and wait a better chance if we continue even with the darkness soon upon us that sloopofwar has only to bide her time to hold us in the shallows until we go aground or admit defeat the people we are supposed to meet and capture will not wait to share the same fate i think when sparke spoke again he was very composed even calm i will overlook your anxiety on mr frowds behalf for i have observed your tendency to become involved in petty matters he nodded to frowd carry on hold this tack as long as the wind favours it in half an hour send a good leadsman to the chains he smiled wryly will that satisfy you frowd knuckled his forehead aye aye sir when the halfhour glass was turned beside the compass the other vessels topgallant sails were in sight from the deck desterre very pale from the holds discomfort came up to bolitho and said hoarsely god i am so sick i would wish to die he peered at the sloops straining sails and added will she catch us i think not shes bound to go about soon he pointed to the creaming wash alongside theres barely eight fathom under our keel and itll soon be half as much the marine stared at the water with amazement you have done nothing to reassure me dick bolitho could imagine the activity aboard the pursuing sloop she would be almost as big as the destiny he thought wistfully fast agile free of the fleets ponderous authority every glass would now be trained on the scurrying faithful and her strange red device the bowchasers were probably run out with the hope of a crippling shot her captain would be waiting to see what the schooner might do and act accordingly after months of dreary patrol work with precious little help from the coastal villages he would see the schooner as some small reward when the truth was discovered and sparke had to explain what he had been doing there would be a doublehell to pay he could understand sparkes eagerness to get to grips with the enemy and do what pears expected of him but frowds advice had been sound and he should have taken it now they would have the sloop to contend with while they hunted for the colonists and the craft they would be using to ferry powder and shot to a safe hiding place there was a muffled bang the sound blown away by the wind almost as quickly a ball slashed along the nearest wave crest and stockdale said admiringly not bad shooting a second ball ripped right above the schooners poop and then sparke who had been standing rigidly like a statue shouted harshly there what did i tell you shes wearing going about just as i said she would bolitho watched the angle of the sloops yards changing the momentary confusion of her sails before she leaned over on the opposite tack midshipman weston exclaimed that was most clever of you sir i would never have believed bolitho felt his lips crease into a smile in spite of his anxiety sparke no matter what mood he was in had little time for crawlers hold your tongue when i want praise from you i will ask for it now be about your duties or ill have balleine lay his rattan across your fat rump weston scurried away his face screwed up with humiliation as he pushed through some grinning seamen sparke said we will shorten sail mr bolitho tell balleine to close up his anchor party in case we have to let go in haste see that our people are all armed and that the gunners mate knows what to do when required his eyes fell on stockdale get below and put on one of the coats in the cabin captain tracy was about your build i believe youll not be near enough for them to spy the difference bolitho gave his orders and felt some relief at sparkes sudden return to his old self right or wrong successful or not it was better to be with the devil one knew he came out of his thoughts as sparke snapped really must i do everything as the evening gloom followed them towards the land faith uls approach became more stealthy and cautious the hands waited to take in the sails or to put the schooner into the wind should they run across some uncharted sandbar or reef and every few minutes the leadsmans mournful chant from the forecastle reminded anyone who might still be in doubt of their precarious position later a little before midnight faithfuls anchor splashed down and she came to rest once again the quality of courage its getting lighter sir bolitho stood beside the motionless wheel and watched the water around the anchored schooner until his eyes throbbed with strain sparke grunted but said nothing his jaw working up and down on a nugget of cheese bolitho could feel the tension made more extreme by the noises of sea and creaking timbers they were anchored in a strange powerful current so that the faithful repeatedly rode forward until her anchor was almost apeak if the tide fell sharply and you could not always trust the navigational instructions she might become impaled on one of the flukes another difference was the lack of order and discipline about the decks uniforms and the familiar blue jackets of the boatswains and masters mates had been put below and the men lounged around the bulwarks in varying attitudes of relaxed indifference to their officers only the marines crammed like fish in a barrel were still sealed in the hold awaiting the signal which might never come sparke remarked quietly even this schooner would make a fine command a good start for any ambitious officer bolitho watched him cut another piece of cheese his hands quite steady as he added shell go to the prize court but after that bolitho looked away but it was another jumping fish which had caught his eye he must not think about afterwards for sparke it would mean almost certain promotion maybe a command of his own this schooner even it was obviously uppermost in his mind just now and why not bolitho pushed his envy aside as best he could he himself if he avoided death or serious injury would soon be back in trojans crowded belly he thought of quinn as he had last seen him and shivered perhaps it was because of the wound he had taken on his skull he reached up and touched it cautiously as if expecting the agony to come again but injury was more on his mind than it had been before he had been slashed down seeing quinns gaping wound had made it nearer as if the odds were going against him with each new risk and action when you were very young like couzens or midshipman forbes the sights were just as terrible but pain and death only seemed to happen to others never to you now bolitho knew differently stockdale trod heavily across the deck his head lowered as if in deep thought his hands locked behind him in a long blue coat he looked every inch a captain especially one of a privateer metal rasped in the gloom and sparke snapped take that mans name i want absolute silence on deck bolitho peered up at the mainmast searching for the masthead pendant the wind had shifted further in the night and had backed almost due south if that sloop had sailed past their position in the hope of beating back again at first light she would find it doubly hard and it would take far longer to achieve another figure was beside the wheel a seaman named moffitt originally from devon he had come to america with his father as a young boy to settle in new hampshire but when the revolution had been recognized as something more than some illorganized uprisings moffitts father had found himself on the wrong side labelled a loyalist he had fled with his family to halifax and his hardworked farm had been taken by his new enemy moffitt had been away from home at the time and had been seized then forced into a ship of the revolutionary navy one of the first american privateers which had sailed from newburyport their activities had not lasted for long and the privateer had been chased and taken by a british frigate for her company it had meant prison but for moffitt it had been a chance to change sides once more to gain his revenge in his own way against those who had ruined his father now he was beside the wheel waiting to play his part bolitho heard the approaching hiss of rain as it advanced from the darkness and then fell across the deck and furled sails in a relentless downpour he tried to keep his hands from getting numb his body from shivering it was more than just the discomfort the anxious misery of waiting it would make the daylight slow to drive away the night to give them the vision to know what was happening without help they had no chance of finding those they had come to capture this coastline was riddled with creeks and inlets bays and the mouths of many rivers large and small you could hide a ship of the line here provided you did not mind her going high and dry at low water but the land was there lying across the choppy water like a great black slab eventually it would reveal itself into coves and trees hills and undergrowth where only indians and animals had ever trod around it and sometimes across it the two armies manoeuvred scouted and occasionally clashed in fierce battles of musket and bayonet huntingknife and sword whatever the miseries endured by seamen their life was far the best bolitho decided you carried your home with you it was up to you what you made of it boat approaching sir it was balleine a hand cupped round his ear reminding bolitho of the last moments before they had boarded this same schooner for a moment sparke did not move or speak and bolitho imagined he had not heard then he said softly pass the word be ready for treachery as balleine loped away along the deck sparke said i hear it it was a regular splash of oars the efforts noisy against a powerful current bolitho said small boat sir yes the boat appeared with startling suddenness being swirled towards the schooners bows like a piece of driftwood a stout fishing dory with about five men aboard then just as quickly it was gone steered or carried on the current it was as if they had all imagined it frowd said not likely to be fishing sir not this time o day surprisingly sparke was almost jovial as he said they are just testing us seeing what we are about a kings ship would have given them a dose of canister or grape to send them on their way as would a smuggler ive no doubt theyve been passing here every night and day for a week or more just to be on the safe side his teeth showed in his shadowy face ill give them something to remember all their lives the word went along the deck once more and the seamen relaxed slightly their bodies numbed by the rain and the raw cold overhead the clouds moved swiftly parting occasionally to allow the colours of dawn to intrude grey and blue water the lush dark green of the land white crests and the snakelike swirls of an inshore current they could have been anchored anywhere but bolitho knew from his past two years service that beyond the nearest cape sheltered by the bay and the entrance to the delaware river were towns and settlements farms and isolated families who had enough to worry about without a war in their midst bolithos excitement at being at sea again in the calling which had been followed by all his ancestors had soon become soured by his experiences many of those he had had to fight had been men like himself from the west country or from kent from newcastle and the border towns or from scotland and wales they had chosen this new country risked much to forge a new life because of others in high places of deep loyalties and deeper mistrusts the break had come as swiftly as the fall of an axe the new revolutionary government had challenged the king that should have been enough but when he thought about it honestly bolitho often wished that the men he fought and those he had seen die had not called out in the same tongue and often the same dialect as himself some gulls circled warily around the schooners spiralling masts then allowed themselves to be carried by the wind to more profitable pickings inland sparke said change the lookouts and keep one looking to seaward in the strengthening light he looked thinner his shirt and breeches pressed against his lean body by the rain shining like snakeskin a shaft of watery sunlight probed through the clouds the first bolitho had seen for many days the telescopes would be watching soon he asked shall i have the mainsl hoisted sir yes sparke fidgeted with his swordhilt the seamen hauled and panted at the rainswollen halliards until loosely set the sail shook and flapped from its boom the red patch bright in the weak sunlight the schooner swung with it tugging at the cable coming alive like a horse testing bit and bridle boat to starboard sir bolitho waited seeing what looked like the same dory pulling strongly from the shore it was unlikely that anyone would know or recognize any of the faith f uls company otherwise the recognition patch would be superfluous just the sight of the schooner would be enough bolitho knew from his childhood how the cornish smugglers came and went on the tide within yards of the waiting excisemen with no more signal than a whistle but someone knew somewhere between washingtons army and growing fleet of privateers were the linkmen the ones who fixed a rendezvous here hanged an informer there he looked at stockdale as he strode to the bulwark and was impressed stockdale gestured forward and two seamen swung a loaded swivel towards the boat while he shouted in his hoarse voice stand off there moffitt stepped up beside him and cupped his hands what dyqu want of us the boat rocked on the choppy water the oarsmen crouched over with the rain bouncing on their shoulders the man at the tiller shouted back that capn tracy stockdale shrugged mebbe sparke said theyre not sure look at the bloody fools bolitho turned his back on the shore he could almost feel the hidden telescopes searching along the deck examining them all one at a time where you from the boat idled slowly nearer moffitt glanced at sparke who gave a curt nod he shouted theres a british manowar to seaward ill not wait much longer have you no guts man frowd said thats done it here they come the open mention of the british sloop and moffitts colonial accent seemed to have carried more weight than the scarlet patch the dory grated alongside and a seaman caught the line thrown up by one of the oarsmen stockdale stood looking down at the boat and then said in an offhand manner which bolitho had not heard before tell the one in charge to step aboard im not satisfied he turned towards his officers and bolitho gave a quick nod sparke hissed keep him away from the ninepounder whatever happens he gestured to balleine start opening the hold bolitho watched the man climb up from the boat trying to picture the faith fuls deck through his eyes if anything went wrong now all they would have to show for their plans would be five corpses and a dory the man who stood on the swaying deck was solidly built but agile for his age he had thick grey hair and a matching beard and his clothing was roughly stitched like that of a woodsman he faced stockdale calmly i am elias haskett he took another half pace you are not the tracy i remember it was not a challenge but a statement moffitt said this is capn stockdale we took over the faithful under capn tracys orders he smiled letting it sink in he went in command of a fine brig like his brother the man named elias haskett seemed convinced weve been expecting you it aint easy the redcoats have been pushing their pickets across the territory and that ship you told of has been up and down the coast for weeks like a nervous rabbit he glanced at the others nearby his eyes resting momentarily on sparke moffitt said mostly new hands british deserters you know how it goes man i do haskett became businesslike good cargo for us balleine and a few hands had removed the covers from the hold and haskett strode to the coaming to peer below bolitho watched the pattern of men changing again just as they had practised and rehearsed the first part was done or so it appeared now he saw rowhurst the gunners mate stroll casually to join haskett his hand resting on his dirk one note of alarm and haskett would die before he hit the deck bolitho peered over a seamans shoulder and tried not to think of the marines who were packed in a hastily constructed and almost airless chamber below a false platform from the deck it looked as if the hold was full of powder kegs in fact there was just one layer and only two were filled but it only needed a marine to sneeze and that would be an end to it moffitt clambered down and remarked coolly good catch we cut out two from the convoy weve muskets and bayonets too and a thousand rounds of ninepound shot bolitho wanted to swallow or to clear his parched throat moffitt was perfect he was not acting he was the intelligent mate of a privateer who knew what he was about haskett said to stockdale ill hoist the signal the boats are hid yonder he waved vaguely towards some overlapping trees which ran almost to the waters edge it could be a tiny cove or the entrance of a hitherto unexplored bay what about the british sloop moffitt glanced briefly at sparke shell take half a day to claw back here an ive put some good lookouts where they can get a first sight of her bolitho watched haskett as he bent on a small red pendant and ran it smartly to the foremast truck he was no stranger to ships and the sea no matter how he was dressed he heard one of the seamen gasp and saw what looked like part of a tree edging clear of the shore then he realized it was a fat roundbowed cutter her single mast and yard covered with branches and gorse while her broad hull was propelled slowly but firmly by long sweeps from either beam she was followed by her twin they looked dutch built and he guessed they had probably been brought here from the caribbean or had made their own way to earn a living from fishing and local trading he knew that sparke had been counting on a single vessel or several small lighters even pulling boats each of these broadbeamed cutters was almost as large as the faithful and built like a batteringram moffitt saw his quick nod and said one will be enough they look as if they could carry a kings arsenal haskett nodded true but we have other work after this south towards the chesapeake our boys captured a british ordnance brigantine a week back shes aground but filled to the gills with muskets and powder we will offload her cargo into one of the cutters enough to supply a whole army bolitho turned away he could not bear to look at sparkes face he could read his mind could picture his very plan of attack with the sloop too far away to be of help sparke would seize the whole credit for himself the next few moments were the worst bolitho could recall the slow business of manoeuvring the two heavy cutters with their strange disguise and long galleylike sweeps they must hold thirty or forty men he decided some seamen and the rest probably from the local militia or an independent troop of washingtons scouts the faith f uls masthead pendant flapped wetly in the wind and bolitho saw the nearest cutter start to swing across the current minutes to go mere minutes and it would be too late for her to work clear or set her sails moffitt murmured stand by there if he was nervous he was not showing it a seaman called aye aye sir bolitho chilled it might have been expected that somebody even himself who had helped to plan the deception should overplay his part the smart acknowledgement to moffitts order was not that of a defecting sailor or halftrained privateersman haskett swung round with an oath you dirty scum the crash of a pistol made every man freeze voices from the dory alongside mingled with the shrill cries of startled seabirds but bolitho could only stare at the greyhaired stranger as he staggered towards the bulwark blood gushing from his mouth while his hands clutched at his stomach like scarlet claws sparke lowered his pistol and snapped swivels open fire as the four swivels cracked from their mountings sweeping the side and deck of the nearest cutter with whining canister rowhursts men tore the tarpaulin from the ninepounder and threw their weight on tackles and handspikes a few shots came from the nearest cutter but the unexpected attack had done what sparke had intended the packed canister had swept amongst the men at the long sweeps cutting them down and knocking the stroke into chaos the cutter was broaching to drifting abeam while rowhursts other crews waited by the stubby sixpounders which would bear their slowmatches ready the guns carefully loaded in advance with grapeshot fire as you bear bolitho drew his hanger and walked amongst his men as they came alive again steady a ball whined past his face and a seaman fell kicking and screaming beside the dead elias haskett sparke took his reloaded pistol from a seaman and remarked absently i hope rowhursts aim is as good as his obscenities even the taciturn rowhurst seemed shocked out of his usual calm he was capering from side to side of the ninepounders breech watching as the second cutter managed to set her mainsail and jib the sweeps discarded and drifting away like bones the disguise dropping amongst them as the wind ballooned into the canvas rowhurst cursed as one of his men reeled away a massive hole punched through his forehead he yelled ready sir he waited for the faithful to complete another swing on her cable and then thrust his slowmatch to the breech doubleshoued and with grape added for good measure the gun hurled itself back on its makeshift tackles like an enraged beast the crash of the explosion rolled around the sea like thunder and the billowing smoke added to the sense of horror as the cutters mast disintegrated and fell heavily in a tangle of rigging and thrashing canvas reload run out when youre ready and fire at will the shock of sparkes pistol shot had given way to a wave of wild excitement this was something they understood what they had been trained for day by backbreaking day while the swivels and sixpounders kept up their murderous bombardment on the first cutter rowhursts crew maintained a regular attack on the other with mast and sails gone she was soon hard aground on a sandbar and even as someone gave a cheer a savage plume of fire exploded from her stern and spread rapidly with the wind the rainsoaked timbers spurting steam until the fire took hold and she was ablaze from stem to stern through and above the din of cannonfire and yelling men bolitho heard desterre call lively sarnt shears or therell be little left for us to do desterre blinked in the billowing smoke from the cutter and rowhursts ninepounder and said by god this one will be up to us shortly bolitho watched the first cutter swinging drunkenly towards the faith fuls bows there were more men in evidence on her deck now but there were many who would never move again blood ran in bright threads from her scuppers to mark the havoc left by the canister and packed grape marines forward like puppets they stepped up to the bulwark their long muskets rising as one present the sergeant waited ignoring the balls which buzzed overhead or thudded into the timbers fire bolitho saw those who had gathered at the point where both vessels would come togethei stagger and sway like corn in a field as the carefully aimed volley ripped amongst them the sergeant showed no emotion as he beat out the time with his handspike while the ramrods rose and fell together as if on a range take aim fire the volley was upset by the sudden collision of both hulls but not enough to save another handful of the yelling defiant men who started to clamber aboard cutlasses swinging or firing at the ninepounders crew on the forecastle sparke shouted strike damn you ill see you in hell bolitho ran to the bulwark briefly aware that someone had defied sparke even in the face of death sergeant shears shouted fix bayonets he looked at desterres raised sword marines advance bolitho shouted tell them again to strike sir sparke looked wild as he retorted they had their chance damn them the marines moved with precision shoulder to shoulder a living red wall which cut the boarders off from the gun crews separated them from their own craft and from all hope bolitho saw a figure duck past a bayonet and run aft a cutlass held across his body like a talisman bolitho raised his hanger seeing the clumsy way he was holding the cutlass worse he was no more than a youth surrender but the youth came on whimpering with pain as bolitho turned his blade aside and with a twist of the wrist sent his cutlass clashing into the scuppers even then he tried to get to grips with bolitho sobbing and almost blinded with fury and tears stockdale brought the flat of his cutlass down on the youths head and knocked him senseless sparke exclaimed its done he walked past desterre and regarded the remaining attackers coldly there were not many of them the rest dead or wounded by the lunging line of bayonets sprawled like tired onlookers bolitho sheathed his hanger feeling sick and the returning ache in his head the dead were always without dignity he thought no matter the cause or the value of a victory sparke shouted secure the cutter mr libby take charge there balleine put those rebels under guard frowd came aft and said quietly we lost three men sir an two wounded but theyll live with any fortune sparke handed his pistol to a seaman damn it mr bolitho look what we have achieved bolitho looked first at the blackened carcass of the second cutter almost burnt out and smoking furiously above a litter of wreckage and scattered remains most of her crew had either died under rowhursts solitary bombardment or had been carried away to drown on the swift current few sailors could even swim he thought grimly alongside and closer to the eye the other cutter was an even more horrific sight corpses and great patterns of blood were everywhere and he saw midshipman libby with his handful of seamen picking his way over the deck his face screwed up fearful of what he would see next sparke said but the hull and spars are intact dyou see eh two prizes within a week therell be some envious glances when we reach sandy hook again make no mistake he gestured angrily at the wretched libby for gods sake sir stir yourself and get that mess over the side i want to make sail within the hour damn me if i dont captain desterre said ill send some marines to help him sparke glared you will not sir that young gentleman wishes to become a lieutenant and he probably will shortages in the fleet being what they are so be must learn that it rates more than the uniform damn me so it does he beckoned to the masters mate come below mr frowd i want a course for the chesapeake ill get the exact position of the brigantine at leisure they both vanished below and desterre said quietly what a nauseating relish he displays bolitho saw the first of the corpses going over the side drifting lazily past as if glad to be free of it all he said bitterly i thought you craved action desterre gripped his shoulder aye dick i do my duty with the best of em but the day you see me gloat like our energetic second lieutenant you may shoot me down the youth who had been knocked unconscious by stockdale was being helped to his feet he was rubbing his head and sobbing quietly when he saw stockdale he tried to hit out at him but moffitt caught him easily and pinioned him against the bulwark bolitho said he could have killed you you know through his sobs the youth exclaimed i wish he had the british killed my father when they burned norfolk i swore to avenge him moffitt said harshly your people tarred and feathered my young brother it blinded him he pushed the youth towards a waiting marine so were equal eh bolitho said quietly no opposite is how i see it he nodded to moffitt i did not know about your brother moffitt shaking violently now that it was over said oh theres more sir a whole lot more frowd reappeared on deck and walked past the sobbing prisoner without a glance he said grimly i thought this days work would be an end to it sir for the moment at least he looked up at the pendant and then at the cutter alongside the hands working with buckets and swabs to clear the bloodstains from the scarred and riddled planking shes named the thrush i see his professional eye confirmed bolitho s opinion dutch built handy craft and well able to beat to windrd better even than this one midshipman weston hovered nearby his face as red as his hair he had shouted a lot during the brief engagement but had hung back when the colonials had made their impossible gesture frowd was saying id hoped that sloop might have joined us he sounded anxious mr sparkes got the name of the cove where they beached the brigantine i know it but not well how did he discover that frowd walked to the rail and spat into the water money sir theres always a traitor in every group if the price is right bolitho made himself relax he could forget frowds bitterness he had been afraid that sparke in his desperate eagerness to complete his victory would use harsher methods of obtaining his information his face as he had killed elias haskett had been almost inhuman how many more sparkes were there still to discover he pondered in a steady wind both vessels eventually got under way and started to work clear of the sandbars and shoals the smoke from the burnedout cutter following them like an evil memory charred remains and gaping corpses parted to allow them through when with all sails set both vessels started the first leg of their long tack to seaward sparke came on deck during the proceedings he peered through a telescope to see how midshipman libby ably assisted by the boatswains mate balleine and a handful of seamen were managing aboard the thrush then he sniffed at the air and snapped run up our proper colours mr bolitho and see that mr libby follows our example later with both vessels in close company heeling steeply on the starboard tack bolitho felt the stronger upthrust of deeper water and not for the first time was glad to be rid of the land from the rendezvous point where they had won such a bloody victory to the next objective a cove just north of cape charles which marked the entrance to chesapeake bay it was approximately one hundred miles sparke had hoped for a change of wind but on the contrary it soon became worse and more set against them both vessels were able to keep company but each tack took longer each mile gained could be quadrupled by the distance sailed to achieve it every time that sparke went on deck he showed no sign of apprehension or dismay he usually examined the thrush through his glass and then looked up at his own flag bolitho had heard one of the marines whispering to his friend that sparke had made himself an admiral of his own squadron the weather and the constant demands of working the schooner to windward had cleared most of the tension and bitterness from bolithos thoughts on the face of it it had been a success a vessel seized another destroyed and many of the enemy killed or routed if the plan had misfired and the trap laid in reverse he doubted if the enemy would have showed them any mercy either once aboard the schooner the combined numbers of both cutters would have swamped sparkes resistance before the ninepounder could have levelled the balance it took three days to reach the place where the brig was supposedly hidden the rugged coastline which pointed south towards the entrance of chesapeake bay was treacherous even more than that which they had left astern many a coasting vessel and larger ships as well had come to grief as they had battered through foul weather to find the narrow entrance to the bay once within it there was room for a fleet and then some but to get there was something else entirely as bunce had remarked often enough once again the sadfaced moffitt was the one to step forward and offer to go ashore alone and spy out the land the faith fuls boat had taken him in while close to the nearest land both vessels had anchored and mounted guard to ward off any attack bolitho had half expected moffitt not to return he had done enough and might be pining to rejoin his family but five hours after being dropped on a tiny beach while the longboat laid off to wait for his return moffitt appeared wading through the surf in his eagerness to bring his news it was no rumour the ordnance vessel a brigantine was beached inside the cove exactly as sparkes informer had described moffitt had even discovered her name the minstrel and thought her too badly damaged even to be moved by expert salvage parties he had seen some lanterns nearby and had almost trodden on a sleeping sentry sparke said i will see that you are rewarded for this work moffitt he was almost emotional as he added this is the quality of courage which will always sustain us ordering that moffitt be given a large tot of brandy or rum both if he wished sparke gathered his officers and senior rates together there was barely room to draw breath in the schooners cabin but they soon forgot their discomfort when sparke said bluntly dawn attack we will use our own and thrushs boat surprise attack at first light right he eyed them searchingly captain desterre you will land with your contingent under cover of darkness and find some cover above the cove stay there to mark our flank and our withdrawal if things go wrong sparke looked at the rough map which mofftt had helped to make i will of course take the leading boat mr libby will follow in the other he looked at bolitho you will assume command of thrush and bring her into the cove for the transfer of cargo once i have smashed whatever opposition which may still be near the brigantine the marines will then move down and support us from the beach he clapped his hands together well desterre said id like to leave now if i may sir yes i shall need the boats very soon he looked at bolitho you were about to say something a hundred miles in three days sir another half day by dawn i doubt very much if we will surprise them youre not getting like mr frowd surely a real jeremiah indeed bolitho shut his mouth tightly it was pointless to argue and anyway with the marines in position to cover them they could fall back if it was a trap sparke said it is settled then good mr frowd will take charge here in our absence and the ninepounder will be more than a match for any foolhardy attacker eh midshipman weston licked his lips his face was glistening with sweat what shall i do sir sparke smiled thinly you will be with the fourth lieutenant do what he says and you might learn something do not do what he says and you may well be dead before you fill yourself with more disgusting food they trooped up on deck where a few pale stars had appeared to greet them moffitt reported to captain desterre im ready sir ill show you the way the marine nodded you are a glutton for punishment but lead on with my blessing the two boats were already filling with marines and would now be in continuous use that left only the captured dory it was as well somebody had kept it secured during the fighting stockdale was by the taffrail his white trousers flapping like miniature sails he wheezed glad youre not going this time sir bolitho stiffened why did you say that feeling sir just a feeling ill be happier when were out of here back with the real navy again bolitho watched the boats pulling clear the marines crossbelts stark against the black water the trouble with stockdale was that his feelings as he called them were too often transformed into actual deeds bolitho moved restlessly around the thrushs tiller very conscious of the stillness the air of expectancy which hung over the two vessels the wind was from the same direction but was dropping with each passing minute allowing the warmth to replace the nights chill the sun to penetrate the fullbellied clouds he trained his telescope towards the nearest hillside and saw two tiny scarlet figures just showing above the strange tangled gorse desterres marines were in position pickets out they would have a good view of the little cove although from the thrushs deck there was nothing to see but fallen rotting trees by the entrance and the swirl of a crosscurrent by some scattered rocks he heard midshipman weston with some seamen sorting out the good sweeps from those broken by the swivels canister he could also hear him retching as he found some gruesome fragment which libbys men had overlooked stockdale joined him by the rail his face black with stubble and grime should be there by now sir not heard a shot nor nothin bolitho nodded it was uppermost in his mind the wind was dropping and that made movement difficult if urgently required he would need to move the thrush under sweeps and the longer it took the more chance of an ambush there was he cursed sparkes eagerness his blind determination to take all the rewards for himself at any time of day a frigate might pass nearby and they could depend on support by the boatload i even at the expense of sharing the victory he said get in the dory im going to that little beach yonder he pointed to the two scarlet shapes on the hillside ill be safe enough midshipman weston panted along the deck his ungainly feet catching and jarring on splinters from the raked planking bolitho said you take charge here he could almost smell his fear ill be in view the whole time he saw stockdale and two seamen climbing down to the dory eager to be doing something to break the strain of waiting or maybe to get away from the scene of such carnage when bolitho stepped on to the firm beach which was not much bigger than the boat itself it felt good to smell the different scents to hear birds and the vague rustling of small creatures nearby was like a balm then one of the seamen exclaimed there sir tis mr libbys boat bolitho saw the midshipmans head and shoulders even before he heard the swish of oars over here libby waved his hat and grinned relief and more was plain on his tanned face he shouted the second lieutenant says to bring the cutter sir theres no sign of anyone ashore and mr sparke thinks they must have run when they saw the boats bolitho asked what is he doing now he is about to board the brigantine sir she is a fine little vessel but is badly holed sparke probably wanted to make quite sure there was no chance of adding her as well as her cargo to his little squadron feet slithered on the hillside and bolitho swung round to see moffitt followed by a marine stumbling and falling towards him what is it moffitt he saw the anguish on his face sir he could barely get the words out we tried to signal but mr sparke did not see us he gestured wildly them devils have laid a fuse i can see the smoke theyre going to blow up the brigantine they mustve been waiting libby looked appalled man your oars well go back bolitho ran into the water to stop him but even as he spoke the earth and sky seemed to burst apart in one tremendous explosion the men in the boat ducked and gasped while around and across them pieces of splintered wood and rigging rained down covering the water with leaping feathers of spray then they saw the smoke lifting and spreading above the coves shoulder until the sunlight was completely hidden bolitho groped his way to the dory his ears and mind cringing from the deafening explosion marines blundered down the slope and waited until libbys oarsmen had recovered sufficiently to bring their boat towards the tiny beach but all bolitho could see was sparkes face as he had out lined his last plan the quality o f courage it had not sustained him bolitho pulled himself together as desterre with his sergeant and two skirmishers walked towards him again he seemed to hear sparkes crisp voice speaking as he had aboard the schooner when the shocked aftermath of battle had begun to take charge theyll be looking to us so well save our regrets for later it could have been his epitaph bolitho said huskily get the marines ferried over as quickly as you can he turned away from the stench of burning wood and tar well get under way directly desterre eyed him strangely another few minutes and it could have been libbys boat or yours bolitho met his gaze and replied there may not be much time so lets be about it shall we desterre watched the last squad of marines lining up to await the boats return he saw bolitho and stockdale climb from the dory to the faithfuls deck frowd hurrying across to meet them desterre had been in too many fights of one sort or another to be affected for long but this time had been different he thought of bolithos face suddenly so pale beneath the black hair with its unruly lock above one eye determined using every ounce of strength to contain his feelings junior he might be in rank but d esterre had felt in those few moments that he was in the presence of his superior a lieutenants lot lieutenant neil cairns looked up from the small bulkhead desk in response to a knock on his cabin door come bolitho stepped inside his hat beneath his arm his features tired cairns gestured to the only other chair take those books oft there and sit yourself down man he groped amongst piles of papers lists and scribbled messages and added there should be some glasses here too you look as if you need a drink i am certain i do if anyone advises you to take on the role of first lieutenant i suggest you tell him to go to hell bolitho sat and loosened his neckcloth there was the hint of a cool breeze in the cabin and after hours of walking around new york and the long pull across the harbour in trojans launch he was feeling sweaty and weary he had been sent ashore to try to get some new hands to replace those killed or injured aboard the faithful and later when sparkes cutter and his men had been blasted to fragments it all seemed like a vague distorted dream now three months ago and already it was hard to put the order of things together properly even the weather made it more obscure then it had been miserably cold and bleak with fierce running seas and the fog which had then seemed like a miracle now it was bright sunshine and long periods without any wind at all the trojans hull creaked with dryness and her deck seams shone moistly in the glare clinging to the shoes and to the seamens bare feet cairns watched him thoughtfully bolitho had changed a great deal he decided he had returned to new york with the two prizes a different man more mature and lacking the youthful optimism which had marked him out from the others the events which had changed him sparkes terrible death in particular had even been noticed by the captain cairns said red wine dick warm but better than anything else to hand i bought it from a trader ashore he saw bolitho tilt back his head the lock of hair clinging to his forehead and hiding the cruel scar despite his service in these waters bolitho looked pale and his grey eyes were like the winter they had long since left behind bolitho knew he was being watched but he had become used to it if he had changed so too had his world with sparke dead the officers had taken another step on promotions ladder bolitho was now the third lieutenant and the most junior post then left vacant had been taken by midshipman libby he was now trojans acting sixth lieutenant whether he was able to take his proper examination or not the age difference between the captain and his lieutenants was startling bolitho would not be twentyone until october and his juniors were aged from twenty to libbys mere seventeen years it was a wellused system in the larger ships but bolitho could find little comfort in his promotion even though his new duties had kept him busy enough to hold most of the worst memories to the back of his mind cairns said suddenly the captain wants you to accompany him to the flagship this evening the admiral is holding court and captains will be expected to produce a likely aide or two he refilled the glasses his features impassive i have work to do with the damned victualling yard so ill not be able to go not that i care much for empty conversation when the whole world is failing apart he said it with such bitterness that bolitho was moved to ask is something troubling you cairns gave a rare smile just everything i am heartily sick of inactivity of writing down lists of stores begging for new cordage and spars when all those rogues ashore want is for you to pass them a few pieces of gold damn their eyes bolitho thought of the two prizes he had brought back to new york they had been whisked away to the prize court sold and recommissioned into the kings service almost before die new ensigns had been hoisted not one man of the trojans company had been appointed to them and the lieutenant given command of the faithful had barely been out from england more than a few weeks it was unfair to say the least and it was obviously a sore point with cairns in about eighteen months he would be thirty the war could be over and he might be thrown on the beach as a halfpay lieutenant it was not a very enjoyable prospect for a man without means beyond his naval pay anyway cairns leaned back and looked at him the captain has made it plain hed rather have you with him in his admirals presence than our tippling second lieutenant bolitho smiled it was amazing how probyn survived he was fortunate perhaps that after trojans return from escorting the convoy from halifax the ship had barely been to sea at all two short patrols in support of the army and a gunnery exercise with the flagship well within sight of new york was the extent of her efforts a few more storms and probyns weakness might have put an end to him bolitho stood up id better get changed then cairns nodded youre to meet the captain at the end of the first dogwatch hell be taking the barge so make sure the crew are smart and ready hes in no mood to suffer slackness i can tell you sharp at four bells captain pears strode on to the quarterdeck resplendent in his fulldress uniform and carrying his sword at his side like a pointer if anything the glittering gold lace set off against the dark blue coat and white breeches made him appear younger and taller bolitho also dressed in his best clothes waited by the entry port a sword instead of his usual hanger slung across his waistcoat on a crossbelt he had already examined the barge to ensure it was ready and suitable for trojans captain it was a finelooking boat with a dark red hull and white painted gunwales in the sternsheets there were matching red cushions while across the transom was the ships name in gilt swaying against trojans side with the oars tossed in two vertical lines her crew dressed in red and white checkered shirts and black tarred hats the barge looked good enough for an emperor bolitho thought cairns hurried to the side and murmured something to the captain molesworth the nervouslooking purser was waiting by the mizzen and bolitho guessed that cairns was going ashore with him to bolster his dealings with the victuallers who like ships chandlers thought more of personal profit than patriotism captain desterre snapped marines present arms the bayoneted muskets jerked up almost to the canvas awning overhead and bolitho momentarily forgot pears as he recalled the marines on the faith f uls deck as they had cut down the boarders with the same crisp precision pears seemed to see bolitho for the first time ali it is you he ran his eye over bolithos best cocked hat his white lapels and freshly pressed waistcoat i thought i had a new officer for a while bolitho smiled thank you sir pears nodded carry on bolitho ran down the ladder to the boat where hogg the burly coxswain stood in readiness his hat in his hand like a grimfaced mourner the pipes trilled and then the barge tilted to pears weight as he stepped down and into the sternsheets shove off out oars hogg was conscious of his captain and watching telescopes from nearby warships give way all bolitho sat stiffly with his sword between his knees lie found it impossible to relax when he was with the captain so he watched trojan instead seeing her curved tumblehome change shape as the boat swung round and beneath her high stern he saw the red ensign curling listlessly above the taff rail the glitter of gilt paint and polished fittings every gunport was open to catch the offshore air and at each one withdrawn like a resting beast trojans considerable artillery showed a round black muzzle they too were as clean as desterres silver buttons bolitho glanced at pears grim profile what news there was of the war was bad stalemate at best real losses too often for comfort but whatever pears thought about the situation and the future he was certainly not going to let down his ship by any sign of slackness beneath her furled sails and crossed yards shimmering in her own haze of black and buff trojan was a sight to stir even the most doubting heart pears said suddenly have you heard from your father bolitho replied not of late sir he is not much for writing pears looked directly at him i was sorry to learn of your mothers death i met her just the once at weymouth you were at sea i believe a gracious lady it makes me feel old even to remember her bolitho looked astern at trojan so that was part of it and no wonder suppose just suppose that trojan had to fight really fight with ships of her own size and fire power he thought of the officers pears would carry into battle probyn getting more difficult and morose every day dalyell cheerful but barely equipped to take over his new role as fourth lieutenant and poor quinn tightlipped and in constant pain from his wound and confined to light duties under the surgeons attention now there was libby one more boy in a lieutenants guise pears had good cause to worry about it he thought it must be like having a shipload of schoolboys how many men did you get today bolitho stared pears knew everything even about his trip ashore four sir it was even worse when you said it aloud hmm we may have better luck when the next convoy arrives pears shifted on the red cushion damned knaves prize seamen protected by the east india company or some bloody government warrant hells teeth youd think it was a crime to fight for your country but ill get my hands on a few of em exemptions or not he chuckled by the time their lordships hear about it well have changed em into kings men bolitho turned his head as the flagship loomed around another anchored manofwar she was the resolute a secondrate of some ninety guns and a veteran of twentyfive years of service there were several boats at her booms and bolitho guessed it was to be quite a gathering he looked up at the drooping flag at her mizzen and wondered what their host would be like rearadmiral graham coutts in command of the inshore squadron had controlled trojans destiny since her first arrival in new york bolitho had never laid eyes on him and was curious to know what he was like probably another pears he decided rocklike unbreakable he shifted his attention to the professional side of their arrival the marines at the entry port the gleam of steel the bustle of blue and white and the faint shout of commands pears was sitting as before but bolitho noticed that his strong fingers were opening and closing around the sharkskin grip of his sword the first sign of agitation he had ever noticed in him it was a fine sword and must have cost a small fortune it was a presentation sword given to pears for some past deed of individual courage or more likely a victory over one of england s enemies ready to toss yer oars hogg was leaning on the balls of his feet his fingers caressing the tillerbar as he gauged the final approach oars up as one the blades rose and remained motionless in paired lines the sea water trickling unheeded on to the knees of the bargemen pears nodded to his crew and then climbed sedately up the side doffing his hat to the shrill calls and the usual ceremony which greeted every captain bolitho counted seconds and then followed he was met by a thinnosed lieutenant with a telescope jammed beneath his arm who looked at him as if he had just emerged from some stale cheese you are to go aft sir the lieutenant gestured to the poop where pears in company with resolutes flag captain was hurrying towards the shade bolitho paused to look around the quarterdeck very like trojans the lines of tethered guns their tackles neatly turned on to cleats or flaked down on the snowwhite planking seamen going about their work a midshipman studying an incoming brig through his glass his lips moving silently as he read her flag hoist of numbers which would reveal her name and that of her captain down on the gundeck a seaman was standing beside a corporal of marines while another midshipman was speaking rapidly to a lieutenant a crime committed a man about to be taken aft for punishment or he might be up for promotion or discharge it was a familiar scene which could mean so many things he sighed bike the trojan and yet again she was completely different bolitho walked slowly beneath the poop and was startled by the sound of music and the muted laughter of men and women every screen had been removed and the admirals quarters had been opened up into one huge cabin by the open stern windows some violinists were playing with great concentration and amongst the jostling crowd of sea officers civilians and several ladies servants in red jackets carried trays laden with glasses while others stood at a long table refilling them as fast as they could pears had been swallowed up and bolitho nodded to several lieutenants who like himself were only here under sufferance a tall figure emerged from the crush and bolitho saw it was lamb the flagships captain he was a steadyeyed man with features which might at first appear to be severe even hard but when he smiled everything changed you are mr bolitho i understand he held out his hand welcome aboard i heard about your exploits last march and wanted to meet you we can use men of mettle who have seen what war is all about it is a hard time but also one of opportunity for young men such as yourself if the moment comes seize your chance believe me bolitho they rarely come twice bolitho thought of the graceful schooner even the stubbyhulled thrush his own chance had already come and gone come and meet the admiral he saw bolitho s expression and laughed he will not eat you more pushing to get through the crowd flushed faces loud voices it was difficult to imagine that the war was just miles away he saw a hunched set of blue shoulders and a goldlaced collar and groaned inwardly ponderous slowmoving a disappointment after all but the flag captain pushed the big man aside and revealed a slight figure who barely came up to his shoulder rearadmiral graham coutts looked more like a lieutenant than a flag officer he had dark brown hair which was tied to the nape of his neck in a casual fashion he had an equally youthful face devoid of lines or the usual mask of authority which bolitho had seen before he thrust out his hand bolitho is it good he nodded and smiled impetuously proud to meet you he beckoned to some hidden servant wine over here then he said lightly i know all about you i suspect that if you and not your superior officer had been leading that boat attack you might even have recaptured the brigantine he smiled no matter it showed what can be done given the will an elegant figure in blue velvet walked from a noisy group by the quarter gallery and the admiral said quietly see that man bolitho that is sir george helpman from london his lip curled slightly an expert on our malaise here a very important person one to be heard and respected at all times the mood changed and just as swiftly he was the admiral again be off with you bolitho enjoy what you wish the food is palatable today he turned away and bolitho saw him greeting the man from london he got the impression that rearadmiral coutts did not like him very much it had sounded like a warning although what a lowly lieutenant could do to upset matters was hard to imagine he thought about coutts not a bit what he had expected he shied away from what he felt admiration a strange sense of loyalty for the man he had met for just a few minutes but it was there it was useless to deny it it was getting dark by the time the guests started to leave some were so drunk they hhad to be carried to their boats others lurched glassyeyed and unsupported fighting each step of the way for fear of disgracing themselves bolitho waited on the quarterdeck watching the civilians and the officials the ladies and a few of the military being helped pushed or lowered by tackles into the bobbing flotilla of boats alongside he had just passed a cabin which he guessed was that of coutts flag lieutenant the door had been slightly ajar and bolitho had caught just a brief view before it had swung shut a womans body naked to the waist her arms wrapped around the officers head as he tore at her clothing like a madman and she had been giggling bubbling with sheer enjoyment her husband or escort was probably lying in one of the boats right now bolitho thought he smiled was he shocked or envious again a boatswains mate harassed by his additional duties called yer captains comin sir aye call the barge bolitho adjusted his swordbelt and straightened his hat pears appeared with captain lamb the two men shook hands and then pears followed bolitho down into the boat as the barge edged clear and swung on a swift moving current pears made one comment disgusting was it not he then lapsed into silence and did not move until trojans lighted gunports were close by then he said curtly if that was diplomacy then thank god im a simple sailor bolitho stood in the swaying boat beside the coxswain and as pears reached out for the ladder his foot slipped bolitho thought he heard him swear but was not certain but he felt vaguely honoured to share the moment pears was in perfect control again but only just that made him seem more human than bolitho could remember pears harsh voice came down from the entry port dont stand there like a priest mr bolitho pon my soul sir others have work to do if you do not bolitho looked at hogg and grinned that was more like it amongst other tasks required of ships lieutenants was the wearying and thankless duty of officer of the guard in new york to ease the work of the shorebound authorities the various ships at anchor were expected to supply a lieutenant for a full twentyfourhour duty it entailed checking the various guardboats which pulled around the jetties and moored ships to make certain they allowed no enemy agents to get near enough to do damage or discover secret information equally they were required to prevent any of the fleets seamen from deserting to seek shelter and more doubtful pleasures on the waterfront seamen entrusted with work ashore were often tempted and drunken wildeyed sailors had to be sorted out to await an escort back to their rightful ships and a few lashes for good measure two nights after his visit to the flagship it fell to trojans third lieutenant to place himself at the disposal of the port admiral and provost marshal for such duty new york made him feel uneasy a city waiting for something to happen a pattern to settle once and for all it was a city of constant movement refugees arriving from inland others thronging offices and government buildings in search of relatives lost in the fighting some were already leaving for england and for canada others waited to reap rich rewards from the victors no matter what colour their coats might be it could be a dangerous place at night especially along the crowded waterfront with its taverns and brothels boarding houses and gaming rooms where anything was available so long as there was gold for the taking bolitho followed by a file of armed seamen walked slowly along a line of sundried planked buildings careful to stay close to the wall and avoid any filth which might be thrown or accidentally dropped on to his patrol he heard stockdales wheezing breath behind him the occasional clink of weapons as they made their way towards the main jetty few people were in view although behind most of the shuttered windows he could hear music and voices raised in song or blasphemy one house stood silhouetted against the swirling water and he saw the usual marine sentries outside the entrance a sergeant pacing up and down by a small lantern alt oo goes there officer of the guard advance an be recognized it was always the same even though the marines knew most of the fleets lieutenants by sight night or day the sergeant stamped to attention two men for the vanquisher sir fightin drunk they are bolitho walked through some doors and into a large hall it had once been a fine house the home of a tea merchant now it served the navy they seem quiet enough sergeant the man grinned unfeelingly ah sir now they is he gestured to two inert shapes in leg irons ad to quieten em like bolitho sat down at a scarred desk half listening to the noises beyond the doors the clatter of wheels across the dutch cobbles the occasional shriek of some whore he looked at the clock past midnight another four hours to go at times like this he longed for the trojan when hours earlier he had pined to be free from her regulated routine when the fleet had first arrived off staten island someone had described it as being like london afloat it had become too much of a reality to be mentioned nowadays bolitho had seen two lieutenants from one of the frigates as they had gone into a gaming house he knew both by sight but little more in those few moments he had caught a snatch of their conversation sailing on the tide going to antigua with despatches what it was to be free able to get clear away from this floating muddle of ships the sergeant reappeared and regarded him doubtfully i got a crimp outside sir he jerked his thumb towards the door i know im of old a rogue but reliable e says there are some ands from the brig diamond jumped ship afore she weighed three days back bolitho stood up reaching for his hanger what was she the sergeant grinned hugely no bother sir she werent under no warrant she was with general cargo from an english port bolitho nodded a brig from england that implied trained seamen deserters or not he said bring the er crimp inside the man was typical of his trade small greasy furtive they were common enough in any seaport boardinghouse runners who sold information about likely hands to officers of the press the man whined it be my duty sir to eip the kings navy bolitho eyed him coldly the man still retained the accent of the london slums how many six sir his eyes glittered fine strong lads they be the sergeant said offhandedly theyre in lucys place he grimaced poxed to the eyebrows i shouldnt wonder tell my men to fall in sergeant bolitho tried not to think of the delay this would cause he would probably miss his sleep altogether the crimp said could we come to an agreement nah sir no you wait here if i get the men youll get paid if not he winked at the grinning marines well have you seized up and flogged he strode out into the night hating the crimp these detestable methods of getting enough men despite the hardships of naval life there were plenty of volunteers but there were never enough death by many means and injury by many more saw to that stockdale asked where sir a place called lucys one of the seamen chuckled oi bin there zur bolitho groaned then you lead carry on once in the narrow sloping street which stank like an open sewer bolitho split his men into two groups most of the trusted hands had done it before several times even pressed men once settled in their new life were ready enough to bring the navys rough justice to the fore if we have to go why not you seemed to be their only yardstick stockdale had vanished to the rear of the building his cutlass in his belt and carrying instead a cudgel as big as a leg of pork bolitho stood for a few more seconds taking deep breaths while he stared at the sealed door beyond which he could hear someone crooning quietly like a sick dog they were probably sleeping it off he thought grimly if they were there at all he drew his hanger and smashed the pommel against the door several times shouting open in the kings name the response was immediate shuffles and startled cries the muffled tinkle of breaking glass followed by a thud as a wouldbe escaper fell victim to stockdales cudgel then the door was flung open but instead of a rush of figures bolitho was confronted by a giant of a woman whom he guessed to be the notorious lucy she was as tall and as broad as any sailorman and had the language to match as she screamed abuse and waved her fists in his face lanterns were appearing on every hand and from windows across the street heads were peering down to enjoy the spectacle of lucy routing the navy why you poxy young bugger she placed her hands on her hips and glowered at bolitho ow dare you come accusin me of arbouring deserters other women some halfnaked were creeping down a rickety stairway at the back of the hallway their painted faces excited and eager to see what would happen i have my duty bolitho listened to his own voice disgusted with the jeering woman humiliated by her contempt stockdale appeared behind her his face unsmiling as he wheezed gotem sir six like e said bolitho nodded stockdale must have found his own way through the rear well done he felt sudden anger running through him while were here we shall take a look for more innocent citizens she reached out and seized his lapels and pursed her lips to spit into his face bolitho got a brief view of bare kicking legs and thighs as stockdale gathered her up in his arms and carried her screaming and cursing down the steps to the street without further ado he dropped her face down in a horse trough and held her head under the water for several seconds then he released her and as she staggered retching and gasping for breath he said if you talks to the lieutenant like that again my beauty ill take my snickersnee to yer gizzard see he nodded to bolitho all right now sir bolitho swallowed hard he had never seen stockdale behave like it before fr thank you he saw his men nudging each other and grinning and tried to assert himself get on with the search he watched the six deserters lurching past one holding his head from one of the other houses an anonymous voice yelled leave em be you varmints bolitho entered the door and looked at the upended chairs empty bottles and scraps of clothing it was more like a prison than a place for pleasure he thought two additional men were brought down the stairs one a lobster fisherman the other protesting that he was not a sailor at all bolitho looked at the tattoos on his arms and said softly i suggest you hold your tongue if as i suspect you are from a kings ship it were better to say nothing he saw the man pale under his sunburn as if he had already seen the noose a seaman clattered down the stairs and said thats the lot sir cept for this youngster bolitho saw the youth being pushed through the watching girls and decided against it probably someones young son out on an errand seeking a first thrill in this foul place ii i ii very well call the others he looked at the youth slimshouldered eyes downcast and in shadow this is no place for you boy be off before something worse happens where do you live when there was no reply bolitho reached out and lifted the others chin allowing the lantern light to spill over the frightened face he seemed to stand locked in the same position for an age and yet he was aware of other things happening elsewhere the feet shuffling on the cobbles as his men sorted their new hands into file and the distant shout of orders as a military patrol approached from the end of the street t hen events moved swiftly the figure twisted away and was out and through the door before anyone could move a lieutenants lot log a seaman bellowed stop that man and along the street bolitho heard a challenge from the soldiers bolitho ran out shouting gait but it was too late and the crash of the musket seemed like a cannon in the narrow street he walked past his men and stood over the sprawled figure as a corporal of infantry ran forward and rolled the body on to its back thought e was escapin from you sir bolitho got down and unbuttoned the youths rough jerkin and shirt he could feel the skin still hot and inflamed and very smooth like the chin had been there was blood too glittering in the lantern light as if still alive bolitho ran his hand over the breast there was no heartbeat and he could feel the dead eyes staring at him in the darkness hostile and accusing he stood up sickened its a girl then he turned and added that woman bring her here the woman called lucy edged closer gripping her hands together as she saw the sprawled corpse gone was the bluster and coarse arrogance bolitho could almost smell her terror he asked who was she he was surprised at the sound of his own voice flat and unemotional a strangers ill not ask a second time woman more noises echoed along the street and then two mounted figures cantered through the army patrol and a voice barked what the hell is going on here bolitho touched his hat officer of the guard sir it was a major who wore the same insignia as the man who had shot the unknown girl oh i see well then the major dismounted and stooped over the body bring that lantern corporal he put his hand under the girls head letting it roll sty towards the beam bolitho watched unable to take his eyes from the girls face the major stood up and said quietly fine kettle of fish lieutenant he rubbed his chin id better rouse the governor hell not take kindly to it what is it sir the major shook his head what you dont know will do you no harm he became businesslike as he snapped to the other mounted soldier corporal fisher ride to the post and rouse the adjutant i want him and a full platoon here on the double he watched the man gallop away and then added this damned house will be dosed and under guard and you his whitegloved finger shot out towards the shivering lucy are under arrest she almost fell as she pleaded why me sir what have i done the major stood aside as two soldiers ran to seize her arms treason madam thats what he turned more calmly to bolitho i suggest you go about your affairs sir i have no doubt you will hear more of this surprisingly he gave a quick smile but if its a consolation you may have stumbled on something of real value too many good men have fallen to treachery heres one who will betray no more bolitho walked back towards the waterfront in silence the major had recognized the dead girl and from the fineness of her bones the smoothness of her skin she came from a good family he tried to guess what had been happening before he and his men had burst in but all he could remember were her eyes as she had looked at his face when they had both known the truth bolitho moved a few paces across the quarterdeck in an attempt to stay in the shadow of trojans great spanker it was oppressively hot and despite a steady wind across the quarter it was impossible to draw comfort from it bolitho turned as a ships boy reversed the halfhour glass and six bells chimed out from the forecastle an hour of the forenoon still to run he winced as the sun smashed down between the sails shadows and seared his shoulders likea blacksmiths forge he took a telescope from its rack and trained it ahead seeing the flagship resolute leap to meet him how quickly things had changed he thought just the day after the mystery of the dead girl orders had been received to weigh and put to sea with the first favourable wind no mention was made of the destination or the purpose and up to the last some of the wardroom cynics had expected it to turn into another exercise a brief display of strength for the armys moral support that had been four days ago four long days of crawling south with barely a ripple around the rudder to show some progress it had taken them four days to make good four hundred miles bolitho swung the glass slowly across the quarter and saw the sun shimmering on the topgallant sails of the frigate vanquisher well out to windward ready to dash down to assist her ponderous consorts if she were needed he returned to study the flagship again just occasionally as she pitched heavily in a deep swell he caught sight of another smaller set of sails far ahead of the squadron the admirals eyes as trojan had weighed anchor and prepared to leave sandy hook bolitho had watched the sloopofwar spite spreading her sails and speeding out of harbour with the minimum of fuss she was up there now ready to pass back her signals if she sighted anything which might interest the admiral she was a lovely little vessel of eighteen guns and bolitho had discovered her to be the one which had fired on the faithful before sparkes attempt to seize the ordnance brigantine her commander was only twentyfour years old and like the three other captains here today knew exactly what he was doing and where he was ordered to go secrecy seemed to have crept into their world like the first touch of a disease the deck trembled and he heard the portlids on the lower batterys starboard side being opened and after a pause the squeak of gun trucks as thirty of trojans thirtytwopounders were run out as if to give battle if he looked over the side he would be able to see them easily just the thought of it was enough even the touch of the tinderdry bulwark or quarterdeck rail was like a burn what dalyell now appointed in charge of the lower gundeck was suffering he could barely imagine the sails clapped and rustled overhead and he glanced up at the trailing pendant looking for a shift of wind it seemed steady enough from the northwest but without the strength they needed to drive the humidity and discomfort from between decks rumble rumble rumble the thirtytwopounders were being run in again and no doubt dalyell was peering at his watch and consulting with his midshipmen and petty officers it was taking too long and captain pears had made his requirements plain from the start of the commission clear for action in ten minutes or less and when firing three rounds every two minutes this last exercise had sounded twice as long he could picture the stripped and sweating gun crews struggling to run out those massive cannon with the ship leaning over on the starboard tack the guns each weighing over three tons had to be hauled bodily up the sloping deck to the ports this was not the weather for it but then it never was as cairns had often remarked bolitho stared across the nettings picturing the invisible land as he had studied it on the chart during each watch cape hatteras and its shoals lay some twenty miles abeam and beyond pamlico sound and the rivers of north carolina but as far as bolitho and the lookouts were concerned the sea was theirs four ships spread out to obtain best advantage of wind and visibility moving slowly towards a secret destination bolitho thought about their combined companies which must amount to close on eighteen hundred officers and men just a few moments earlier he had seen the purser with his clerk hurrying down the main companion molesworth carrying his ledger his clerk with a box of tools which he used for opening casks and checking the quality of their contents it was monday and bolitho could imagine the scribbled instructions in molesworths ledger per man this day one pound of biscuit one gallon of small beer one pint of oatmeal two ounces of butter and four ounces of cheese after that it was up to triphook and his mates to do what they could with it no wonder pursers were always worried or dishonest sometimes both multiply a mans daily ration by the whole company and by the long days and weeks at sea and you got some idea of his problems midshipman couzens standing discreetly by the lee rail with his telescope ready to train on the flagship hissed captain sir bolitho turned swiftly the effort making the sweat run between his shoulder blades and gather at his waistband like hot rain he touched his hat sousouwest sir full and bye pears glanced at him impassively the wind appears to have veered in the last hour but not enough to make any difference he said nothing further and bolitho crossed to the lee side to allow his captain the freedom of the deck pears paced slowly up and down his face totally absorbed what was he thinking about bolitho wondered his orders or his wife and family in england pears paused and swivelled his head towards him pipe some hands forrard mr bolitho the weather forebrace is as slack as fill this watch dammit pon my soul sir youll have to do better bolitho nodded aye sir at once he gestured to couzens and a moment later some seamen were hauling lustily each knowing he was under the captains scrutiny bolitho found himself pondering over pears behaviour the forebrace had seemed no slacker than you might expect in the rising and falling gusts of wind was it just to keep him on his toes he thought suddenly of sparke and his take that mans name the memory saddened him he saw quinn coming up the ladder from the gundeck and nodded to him adding a quick shake of the head to warn him of pears presence quinn was doing far better than bolitho had dared hope he had got his colour back and could walk upright without twisting his face in readiness for the pain bolitho had seen the great scar on quinns breast if his attacker had not been startled and taken off guard his blade would have sliced through bone and muscle to the heart itself the voice settled on the young fifth lieutenant like a mesh mr quinn sir he hurried across the deck his face working anxiously as to what he had done wrong pears studied him grimly i am indeed glad to see you are up and about quinn smiled gratefully thank you sir quite so pears continued with his daily walk you will exercise your men at repelling boarders this afternoon then if we remain on this tack you will put the new hands aloft for sail drill he nodded curtly that should restore your wellbeing better than any pills eh couzens yelled excitedly signal from flag sir he was peering through his big telescope his forehead wrinkled like that of an old man as he read the hoist of coloured bunting at resolutes yard make more sail sir pears growled call the hands get the royals on her stunsls too if she can take them he strode aft as the master appeared beneath the poop and bolitho heard him say in his harsh tone more sail that is all he can think of damn it cairns hurried up as the calls trilled between decks and brought the watch below scampering to their stations hands aloft set the royals cairns saw bolitho and shrugged the captain is in a foul mood dick we lay each course a day ahead but i am as wise as you as to where we are bound he looked to see that pears was not close by it has always been his way to explain to share his views with us but now it seems our admiral has other ideas bolitho thought of the admirals youthful enthusiasm maybe pears had become staid out of touch with things but there was nothing wrong with his eyes as he yelled mr cairns sir get those topmen aloft flog them if you must ill not be goaded again by the flagship it was noon by the time the royals and then the great batlike studding sails had been set on either beam the flagship had also made as much sail as she could carry and appeared to be buried under the towering pyramids of pale cafivas lieutenant probyn relieved bolitho without his usual sarcasm or complaint but remarked i see no gain in this at all day after day with neer a word of explanation it makes me uneasy and thats no lie but two more days were to pass before anyone had settled on the truth of the matter rearadmiral coutts little squadron continued on its southerly course and then swung southeast skirting cape fear so aptly named to take advantage of the winds sudden eagerness to help them bolitho was about to go off watch when he was unexpectedly summoned aft to the great cabin but it was not a conference and he found the captain alone at his desk his coat was hanging across his chairback and he had loosened his neckdoth and shirt bolitho waited the captain looked very cam so it seemed unlikely there was to be a reprimand for something he had done or not done pears glanced up at him the master and now the first lieutenant know the extent of my orders you may think it strange for me to confide in you before the rest of my officers but under the circumstances i think it is fair he bobbed his head do sit down bolitho sat sensing the sudden irritation which was never far from pears manner there was some trouble at new york you played no small part in it pears smiled wryly whidi did not surprise me of course bolitho pricked up his ears somehow he had known that the matter of the dead girl would come up again even that it might be connected in some small way with the squadrons unexpected departure from sandy hook i will not go into full detail but the girl you discovered in that brothel was the daughter of a new york government official a very important one to boot it could not have come at a worse time sir george helpman is out from england under the direct instructions of both parliament and admiralty to discover what is being done to pursue the war to prevent the whole campaign being bogged down in stalemate if or rather when the french come into the open to fight in strength we will be hard put to hold what we have let alone make any gains i thought we were doing all we could sir pears looked at him pityingly when you are more experienced bolitho he looked away frowning angrily helpman will see it for himself the corrupt officials the dandies of the military government who dance and drink while our soldiers in the field pay the price and now this an important officials daughter is discovered to be working handinglove with the rebels she has been leaving her home in a carriage and changing into boys clothes just so that she can meet one of washington s agents and pass him any titbit of secret information she could lay her hands on bolitho could well imagine the fury and consternation it must have caused he could find pity for the blowzy whore who had tried to spit in his face with so much at stake and with important heads on the block her interrogators would have few scruples in the manner of gaining information pears said due to her treachery the tracy brothers were able to plot our every move and but for our taking the faithful and mr bunces liaison with the almighty on matters concerning the weather we might never have known anything links in a chain and now we have one more scrap to play with that damned whore had her ear to the keyhole more often than not the colonials have a new stronghold constructed with the express purpose of receiving and transporting powder and weapons to their ships and soldiers bolitho licked his lips and we are heading there now sir thats the strength of it yes fort exeter in south carolina about thirty miles north of charles town bolitho nodded remembering clearly what happened near there about a year ago at another rebel fort only that had been to the south of charles town a large squadron with troops as well as marines embarked had sailed to seize the fort which commanded the inshore waters and would thus interdict all trade and privateer traffic to and from charles town the busiest port south of philadelphia instead of victory it had ended in humiliating defeat some of the ships had gone aground because of wrongly marked charts while elsewhere the water had been too deep for the soldiers to wade ashore as had been intended and all the time the colonials snug behind their fortress walls had kept up a steady bombardment on the largest british vessels until commodore parker whose flagship had taken the worst of it had ordered a complete withdrawal trojan had been on her way to offer support when she had met the returning ships in the navy unused to either defeat or failure it had seemed like an overwhelming disaster pears had been watching his face i see you have not forgotten either bolitho i only hope we all live to remember this new venture with a start bolitho realized the interview was over as he made to leave pears said quietly i told you all this because of your part in it but for your actions we might not have found out about that girl but for her sir george helpman would not he raising hell in new york he leaned back and smiled and but for himn our admiral would not now be trying to prove he can do what others cannot links in a chain bolitho as i said earlier think about it bolitho walked out and cannoned into captain desterre the marine said why dick you look as if you have seen a ghost bolitho forced a smile i have mine when the time came for lieutenant cairns to share pears orders with the lieutenants and warrant officers even the most unimaginative one present could not fail to marvel at their admirals impudence while out of sight of land and with the frigate patrolling to ensure they were left undisturbed the sloop spite was to embark all of the flagships and trojans marines and with boats under tow would head inshore under cover of darkness the twodeckers in company with vanquisher would then continue along the coast towards the same fort which had routed commodore parkers squadron the previous year to any watchers along the coast and to the officers of the fort and the charles town garrison it would not seem an unlikely thing for the british to attempt hurt pride and the fact that the fort was still performing a useful protection for privateers and the landing of stores and powder were two very good reasons for a second attempt fort exeter on the other hand was easier to defend to seaward and would feel quite safe when the small squadron had sailed past in full view of the colonial pickets bolitho when he had listened to cairns level unemotional voice as he explained the extent of their orders had imagined he could detect rearadmiral coutts speaking directly to him spite would land the marines a party of seamen and all the necessary tackle and ladders for scaling walls and then stand out to sea again before dawn the rest an attack from inland towards the rear of the fort would be left to the discretion of the senior officer in this case he was major samuel paget commanding officer of the flagships marines desterre had said of him in confidence a very hard man once he has made up his mind nothing will shift him and no argument is tolerated bolitho could well believe it he had seen paget a few times very erect and conscious of the figure he made in his scarlet coat and matching sash impeccable white lapels and collar he was nevertheless having difficulty in concealing his growing corpulence his face had once been handsome but now in his middle thirties the major had all the signs of a heavy drinker and one who enjoyed a good table desterre had also said this little jaunt might take some of the fat off him but he had not smiled and bolitho had guessed that he had wished he and not the major was to command once their mission was out in the open the ships company got down to work and preparation with the usual mixture of attitudes grim resignation for those who would be taking part cheerful optimism from those who would not at the chosen time the work of ferrying the marines and seamen to the little sloopofwar was begun without delay after the blazing heat of a july day the evening brought little respite and the gruelling irksome work soon roused tempers and onthespot justice from fist and ropes end bolitho was counting the last group of seamen and making sure they were all armed as well as being equipped with flasks of water and not hoarded rum when cairns strode up to him and snapped there has been another change how so bolitho waited expecting to hear that the raid was being delayed cairns said bitterly i am remaining aboard he looked away hiding his hurt again bolitho did not know what to say cairns had obviously set his heart on going with the attack as senior lieutenant having missed the chance of being a prizemaster or even of taking part in the faith fuls capture he must have seen the landing as his rightful reward although by going he stood as much chance of being killed as anyone else someone from the flagship sir cairns faced him no probyn is to lead god help you bolitho examined his feelings and young james quinn is to go with us also quinn had said nothing when he had been told but he had looked as if someone had struck him cairns seemed to read his thoughts aye dick so it may fall to you to look after our people but why not the flagship surely they have a lieutenant and more to spare cairns regarded him curiously you dont understand admirals dick they never let go of their own they must always show a perfect front a well ordered world of officers and men coutts will be no exception hell want perfection not a rabble of old men and boys like we are fast becoming he could have said more bolitho thought that quinn was being sent to prove that his wound had not destroyed his resolution and courage and probyn because he would not be missed he thought of his own position and almost smiled pears was only doing what the admiral had done keeping the best for himself anyone below cairns in rank and quality would be sacrificed first cairns said i am glad you can still discover humour in this affair dick for myself i find it intolerable midshipman couzens hung about with telescope dirk pistols and a bulging sack of food called breathlessly spite has signalled sir last party to go across now bolitho nodded very well man your boats he watched a second midshipman a seriousfaced sixteenyearold named huyghue climbing down into the cutter to sit beside the coxswain who was probably twice his age i see you are ready mr bolitho probyns thick voice made him turn towards the quarterdeck the second lieutenant could only just have been told of pears change of plans but he looked remarkably unworried he was very flushed but that was quite usual and as he leaned on the quarterdeck rail to peer at the boats alongside he seemed calm to the point of indifference cairns straightened his back as the captains heavy tread came across the deck good luck both of you he glanced at the dizzily swaying sloop by god i wish i was coming with you probyn said nothing but touched his hat to the quarterdeck before following the others down into a crowded boat bolitho saw stockdale in one of the other boats and nodded to him if for some reason he had not been taking part it would have been like an illomen something final seeing him there big and quietfaced made up for many of the other nagging doubts probyn said shove off coxn i dont want to fry in this damn heat as they drew closer to the sloop her commanding officer hurried to the side and cupped his hands move yourselves damn you this is a kings ship not a bloody lobster boat only then did probyn show some mettle hear that impudent young chicken god how command changes a man bolitho shot him a quick glance in just those few angry words probyn had revealed a lot bolitho knew he had been beached on halfpay before the war whether it was because of his drinking or he had simply become a hardened drinker because of his illluck he was not sure but he had certainly been passed over for promotion and to be shouted at by the spites youthful commander would not make it any easier as they clambered up on to the sloops busy deck he wondered where all the marines had gone as in the faithful they had been swallowed up within minutes of boarding aft by the taffrail he saw major paget speaking with desterre and the two marine lieutenants the sloops commander walked across to meet the last arrivals he nodded curtly and then shouted mr walker get the ship under way if you please to bolitho he added i suggest you go below my people have enough to contend with at present without being faced by unknown officers from every hand bolitho touched his hat unlike probyn he could understand the young mans sharpness he was very conscious of his command and the mission suddenly thrust upon him close by two ships of the line his admiral and some senior post captains would be watching waiting to find fault to compare his efficiency with others the commander swung on his heel i understand that you were the officer involved with my ship two weeks back eh he had a sharp incisive tone and bolitho guessed he would be a difficult man to get on with twentyfour years old what had probyn said how command changes a man well aye sir i was secondincommand of the raid my senior was killed i see he nodded my gunner nearly did that to you earlier he walked away bolitho made his way aft pushing through the bustling seamen as they ran to braces and halliards oblivious to everyone but their own officers the pulling boats were already falling obediently astern on their lines and almost before bolithos head had passed into the shadow of the companionway the spite was heeling over to the wind and presenting her counter to the big twodeckers the wardroom was crowded with officers and spites purser soon produced bottles and glasses for all the additional guests when it came to probyn he shook his head and said abruptly not for me but thankee later maybe bolitho looked away unable to bear the sight of the mans battle probyn had never refused a drink before and it had cost him a great deal to do it now he thought of probyns bitterness about the sloops commander and what lay ahead of them tomorrow it was of paramount importance to probyn that he should succeed and for that he would give up a lot more than brandy during the night and through the following day spite tacked back and forth biding her time while she continued a slow approach towards the land fort exeter stood on a sandy fourmilelong island which was shaped rather like an axehead at low water it was connected to the mainland by an unreliable causeway of sand and shingle and the entrance to a lagoonlike anchorage was easily protected by the forts carefully sited artillery as soon as the landing party was ashore spite would with draw and be out of sight of land by the following dawn if the wind died the attack would be postponed until it returned whatever happened it would not be abandoned unless the enemy were ready and waiting when bolitho thought of major samuel paget the man who would be leading the attack he doubted if it would be cancelled even then fortexeter the landing which took place at one in the morning was carried out with unexpected ease a favourable wind carried the sloop close inshore where she dropped anchor and started to ferry the marines ashore as if it were part of a peacetime manoeuvre major samuel paget went with the first boat and when bolitho eventually stepped on to glistening wet sand and squelched after a hurrying file of marines he found time to admire the mans sense of planning he had brought two canadians with him and had explained they were better at scouting than any damn dogs they were both fiercelooking men with beards and rough trappers clothing and a smell to match any pelt one a sadeyed scot named macdonald had originally lived for some years in south carolina and had been driven from his land when the main loyalist force in the area had been beaten in a pitched battle by the patriot militia his hate reminded bolitho of the resourceful moffitt paget greeted bolitho with his usual abruptness all quiet i want our men positioned before first light well issue rations and water he scanned the starry sky and grunted too bloody hot for my liking stockdale said hoarsely mr couzens is comin with the last lot sir very well bolitho watched as probyn blundered out of some dark scrub sniffing around him like a fox everyones ashore sir probyn watched the marines plodding past their weapons and equipment carefully muffled like silent ghosts from some forgotten battle god it makes you think here we are bloody miles from anywhere marching into heaven knows what and to what purpose eh bolitho smiled he had been thinking much the same the marines seemed quite at home on land as they did at sea but he could sense the wary caution of the seamen the way they tended to bunch together no matter what they were threatened with desterre appeared from somewhere and showed his teeth come along dick join the marines and see the world he went off to find his lieutenant swinging his sword like a cane bolitho looked at the beach shining faintly in the darkness the boats had already gone and he imagined he could hear the sounds of sails being shaken out above the murmur of breakers then it really hit home they were to all intents and purposes abandoned on this unknown shore with just the skill of two canadian scouts whom paget had borrowed from the army suppose that even now they were being trailed their stumbling progress marked as they approached some terrible ambush the night was still but for the wind in the trees and the occasional cry of a startled bird even the wind sounded different here which was not surprising bolitho thought as he peered at the strange palms which ran almost to the waters edge they gave the land a tropical touch something alien lieutenant raye of trojans marines marched out of the darkness and exclaimed cheerfully ah here you are the major says you are to follow with the rearguard mr bolitho make certain the men do not crash into each other with their ladders and suchlike he touched his hat to probyn he sends his compliments sir and would you join him with the main party probyn nodded muttering bloody soldiers thats what we are bolitho stood aside to allow the seamen to lurch past some with ladders and heavy tackles others carrying muskets powder and shot the remainder were loaded down with food and water lieutenant quinn was right at the rear with only the blurred shapes on either side to reveal some of the marine skirmishers who were covering their advance bolitho fell in step beside him and asked quietly how is the wound james i dont feel it much quinn sounded as if he were shivering but i wish we were afloat instead of here bolitho recalled him saying much the same before the last fight desterre and thorndike the surgeon playing cards under a lantern the ship sleeping around them quinn said im afraid of what i might do he was almost pleading if i have to face another handtohand i think i shall break easy man dont start meeting trouble before you must he knew exactly how quinn felt as he had done after being wounded it was worse for quinn he had not been in action before that last time quinn did not seem to hear i think of sparke a lot how he used to rant and rave i never really liked him but i admired his courage his his he groped for words his style bolitho reached out to steady a seaman as he almost tripped over a root with his load of muskets style yes it described sparke better than anything else quinn sighed i could never do what he did never in a thousand years there was a thud and a marine raised his musket and brought down the butt a second time on some coarse grass beside the file of seamen snake he mopped his face cor thats the bloody potful as far as im concerned bolitho thought suddenly of cornwall in july at this very moment hedgerows and lush fields sheep and cows dotted on the hillsides like scattered flowers he could almost smell it hear the bees the swish of hooks as the farm workers cleared some new land to grow more food to feed the country the army midshipman couzens said between gasps for breath skys brighter sir bolitho replied we must be near the place then what would happen if instead of a suitable hideout for the landing party as remembered by the canadian macdonald they found an enemy encampment sure enough the rearguard was already catching up with the main party where pagets sergeants and corporals waited like the keepers of invisible gates to guide and push the men into smaller sections bolitho watched the white crossbelts and the checkered shirts fading away obediently to the preselected sites in the centre of what felt like a shallow wooded basin the officers grouped together and waited to receive their orders bolitho felt unusually tired and wanted to keep yawning and yet his mind was very clear and he guessed that the yawning might also betray his fear he had known it before too often major paget still erect and showing no trace of weariness said stay with your people issue the rations but mind they waste nothing and leave no trace of their rubbish he looked at desterre meaningly you know what to do take control of the perimeter double the pickets and tell them to keep down to probyn he said you are in charge here of course i shall need an officer with me in a moment probyn sighed you go bolitho if i send quinn the major will eat him for breakfast bolitho reported to paget after the others had vanished into the gloom to seek out their men he took couzens with him and answered stockdales plea to go too by saying firmly save your strength for when it is needed as needed it will be in a fight or in a raging storm at sea stockdale was unbeatable creeping through unfamiliar territory when at any second they might stumble on an enemy lookout or patrol was not his place his big frame and powerful limbs were enough to wake an army but it was painful to sense his hurt all the same couzens on the other hand was bubbling with excitement bolitho had never known anything like it he seemed to put the awful sights and sounds behind him dropping them with the tough resilience of youth in war major paget was drinking from a silver flask while his orderly checked a brace of pistols for him he held out the flask here have some he leaned forward his polished boots squeaking oh its you bolitho ive heard about you he did not elaborate bolitho gasped as the hot brandy trickled over his tongue paget nodded to the midshipman him too mans drink for a mans work eh he chuckled the sound like two dry sticks rubbing together couzens smacked his lips thank you sir that was lovely paget looked at bolitho and exclaimed lovely in hells name what sort of a navy is this with the orderly following respectfully at their heels they set off in a southwesterly direction the sea to their left out of sight but comfortingly close bolitho sensed some of desterres scouts nearby flitting through the scrub and trees like forest animals as they protected their commanding officer from attack they walked on in silence aware of the lightening sky the stars fading obediently as the land took shape from the shadows they seemed to be moving up a gentle slope now weaving occasionally to avoid sprawling clumps of prickly bushes and fallen trees a dark figure rose out of the shadows and paget said ah the canadian gentleman the scout greeted them with a lazy wave this is far enough major the rest o th way you gets down on yer belly paget snapped his fingers and like a footman serving his master a picnic the marine orderly brought out with a flourish something like a short green cape paget removed his hat and his sword then slipped the cape over his head it completely hid his uniform down as far as his waist bolitho could feel the scout and couzens staring openmouthed but when he glanced at the orderly he saw only stiff indifference and guessed that pagets own men knew better than to show amusement paget muttered had the thing made last year no sense in getting your head blown off by some backwoodsman what bolitho grinned good idea sir ive seen poachers use them too huh the major lowered himself carefully on to his hands and knees well lets get on with it well be pestered by flies and a million sorts of beetles before another hour i want to be back at the camp by then it took all of half an hour to discover a suitable observation point and by that time the sky was considerably brighter and when bolitho propped himself on his elbows he saw the sea the horizon like a thin gold thread he craned forward the sharppointed grass pricking his face and hands the soil alive with minute insects with the sun still below the horizon the lagoonshaped bay was in darkness but against the shimmering water with the restless procession of white horses further to seaward he could see the fort clearly a black untidy shape perched on the end of the low island he saw two lanterns and what appeared to be a sheltered fire outside the wall but little else paget was breathing heavily as he trained a telescope through the grass and rough scrub he seemed to be thinking aloud as he muttered got to be careful at this angle if the sun comes up suddenly some fellow down there might see it reflected in this damn glass couzens whispered to bolitho can you see the guns sir bolitho shook his head picturing the marines charging across the alleged causeway into a hail of canister or worse not yet he strained his eyes again the fort is not square or even rectangular six maybe seven sides perhaps one gun per wall the scout wriggled nearer and said theyre supposed to have a flat pontoon major he raised an arm releasing an even sourer smell when they get supplies sent by land they put th wagons an horses on th pontoon an haul the thing across paget nodded as i thought well thats how well go this time tomorrow while the devils are still asleep the scout sucked his teeth nighttimed be better paget replied scornfully the dark is damn useless to everybody man no well watch today tomorrow we attack as you say major paget rolled over heavily and peered at bolitho you take the first watch eh send the boy to me if you sight anything useful then with remarkable stealth he was gone couzens smiled tightly are we alone sir for the first time he sounded nervous bolitho smiled tightly it would seem so but you saw where the last picket was if you go back with a message put yourself in his hands i dont want you wandering off he drew a pistol from his belt and felt it carefully then he unsheathed his hanger and laid it beside him thrusting the blade into the sand to hide any reflection it was going to be very hot before long bolitho tried not to think of fresh drinking water couzens said i feel im doing something sir something useful at last bolitho sighed i hope youre right by the time the suns rim had broken above the horizon and come spilling down towards the fort and its protected anchorage bolitho had learned a lot more about his companion couzens was the fifth son of a norfolk clergyman had a sister called beth who intended to marry the squires son if she got half a chance and whose mother made the best apple pie in the county they both fell silent as they peered at the newly revealed fort and its immediate surroundings bolitho had been right about its shape it was hexagonal and the walls which were of double thickness and constructed of stout palmetto wood had their inner sections filled with rocks and packed earth both inner and outer wall was covered by a parapet and bolitho guessed that even the heaviest ball would find it hard to penetrate such a barrier he saw a squat tower on the seaward side with a flagpole and a drifting smear of smoke which suggested a galley somewhere below in the central courtyard there were the usual loopholes and as the light strengthened bolitho saw two gun embrasures pointing towards the mainland and the causeway and he could also see the shadow of a gateway between them two small boats were pulled up on to the nearest beach and the skeleton of another probably the only remains of some skirmish a year or more ago couzens whispered excitedly there sir the pontoon bolitho lowered his eye to the telescope and scanned first the fort and then the moored pontoon it was a crude affair with trailing ropes and slatted ramps for horses and wagons the sand on both mainland and beach was churned up to mark the many comings and goings he moved the glass carefully towards the anchorage small but good enough for two vessels brigs and schooners most likely he thought a trumpet echoed over the swirling water and moments later a flag jerked up to the top of the pole and broke dejectedly towards them a few heads moved on the parapet and then bolitho saw a solitary figure appear from the pontoons inner ramp a musket over his shoulder gripped casually by the muzzle bolitho held his breath that was worth knowing he had had no idea there was a space there for a sentry with daylight spreading inland and his companions on the move again the sentrys night vigil was done if pagets scheme was going to work that sentry would have to be despatched first as the first hour dragged by bolitho studied the fort carefully and methodically as much to take his mind off the mounting glare and heat than with any purpose in mind there did not appear to be many men in the garrison and the amount of horse tracks by the pontoon suggested that quite a number had left very recently probably in response to the news of the british squadron which had been sighted heading further south bolitho thought of rearadmiral coutts plan the simplicity of it he would like to be here now he thought seeing his ideas taking shape the canadian macdonald slid up beside him without a sound and showed his stained teeth itd bin no use you reachin fer yer blade mister his grin widened i coulda slit yer throat easylike bolitho swallowed hard most probably he saw quinn and midshipman huyghue crawling through the scrub towards him and said we are relieved it seems later when they reached pagets command post bolitho described what he had seen paget said we must get that pontoon he looked meaningly at probyn job for seamen eh probyn shrugged of course sir bolitho sat with his back to a palm and drank some water from a flask stockdale squatted nearby and asked is it a bad one sir im not sure yet he saw the pontoon the sentry stretching as he had emerged from his hiding place hed quite likely been asleep it would not be difficult for such an easily defended fort to become overconfident stockdale watched him worriedly ive made a place for you to lie sir he pointed to a rough cover of brush and fronds cant fight without sleep bolitho crawled under the tiny piece of cover the freshness of the water already gone from his mouth it was going to be the longest day of all he thought grimly and the waiting unbearable he turned his head as he heard someone snoring it was couzens lying on his back his freckled features burned painfully by the sun the sight of such apparent confidence and trust helped to steady bolitho couzens was probably dreaming of his mothers pies or the sleepy norfolk village where something or somebody had put the idea in his mind to be a sea officer and leave the land stockdale leaned back against a tree and watched bolitho fall asleep he was still watching when one of desterres marines crawled through the scrub and hissed where is the lieutenant bolitho awoke reluctantly his mind trying to grapple with where he was and what he was doing the marine explained wearily the majors compliments sir and would you join im where you was this mornin bolitho stood up each muscle protesting violently why mr quinn sighted a strange sail sir bolitho looked at stockdale and grimaced what timing it couldnt be at a worse moment it took longer to reach the lookout the second time the sun was much higher in the sky and the air so humid it was hard to draw breath paget complete with green cape was lying with his telescope carefully shaded by some leaves probyn sprawled beside him and further down the slope trying to find some shade quinn and his midshipman looked like survivors from a desert trek paget snapped so here you are he relented slightly and added look for yourself bolitho took the glass and trained it on the approaching craft she was broad in the beam and from her low freeboard he guessed her to be fully laden she was moving at a snails pace her tancoloured sails flapping uncomfortably as she tacked towards the fort three masts on a small sturdy hull she was obviously a coasting lugger there were plenty of such craft along the east coast as they were good seaboats but equally at home in shallow water bolitho wiped the sweat from his eyes and moved the lens on to the forts square tower there were quite a lot of heads there now watching the approaching lugger and bolitho saw that the gates were wide open and some more men were walking unhurriedly below the walls and making for the beach on the far side of the island none of the forts cannon was run out or even manned he said must be expecting her paget grunted obviously probyn complained itll make our task damn near impossible well have the enemy on two sides of us he swore crudely and added just our luck i intend to attack as planned paget watched the lugger bleakly i cant waste another full day a patrol might stumble on our people at any moment or the spite may return ahead of time to see what we are about he thrust out his heavy jaw no we attack he crawled awkwardly across some sharp stones and snapped im going back keep watch and tell me what you think later probyn glared after him he makes me sickv bolitho lay on his back and covered his fare with his arms he was being stung and bitten by tiny unseen attackers but he barely noticed he thought of the lugger and how the unexpected could rearrange a puzzle in seconds probyn said grudgingly still he may be right about another delay and i cant see him calling off the attack altogether bolitho knew he was watching him and smiled what about you me probyn grabbed the telescope again who cares what i think it was well into the afternoon before the lugger had worked around the end of the island and into the anchorage as her sails were carelessly brailed up and her anchor dropped bolitho saw a boat pulling from the beach towards her probyn looked and sounded tired out he asked irritably well what dyou see bolitho levelled the glass on the man who was climbing down into the boat bravado conceit or was it just to display his confidence but his uniform so bright against the luggers untidiness was clearer than any message bolitho said quietly thats a french officer down there he looked sideways at probyns features so now we know midshipman couzens crawled on his hands and knees until he had reached bolitho at the top of the rise all accounted for sir he peered down the slope towards the sea and the forts uncompromising outline bolitho nodded there were a dozen questions at the back of his mind had the seamens weapons been checked to make sure that some nervous soul had not loaded his pistol despite the threats of what would happen to him had couzens impressed on them the vital importance of silence from now on but it was too late now he had to trust every man jack of them bolitho could sense them at his back crouching in their unfamiliar surroundings gripping their weapons worrying at least there was no moon but against that the wind had dropped away and the slow regular hiss of surf made the only sound to get the men down to the beach and across to the island without raising an alarm would be doubly difficult without some noise to cover their approach ile thought of desterre s cool appraisal of the island and its defences he had studied it through his telescope from three different angles the fort had at least eight heavy cannon and several smaller pieces the garrison although depleted appeared to number about forty just a dozen men could hold the fort and sweep away a frontal attack without effort it was a miracle that some hunter or scout had not stumbled on the hidden marines but this place was like an abandoned coast they had seen nothing but a few men around the island and the occasional comings and goings from the anchored lugger the french officer was thought to be in the fort although his purpose for being there was still a mystery probyns choice stockdale hissed mr quinns party is ere sir good poor quinn he looked like death and they had not even begun yet tell him to get ready bolitho peered through his glass towards the lugger but saw nothing but her shadow no riding light to betray her presence and even some drunken singing had stopped hours ago a hand touched his shoulder and he heard the canadian scout say now bolitho stood up and followed him down the steep side of the hill towards the water his shoes loosened stones and sand and he could feel the sweat running down his chest it was like being naked walking towards levelled muskets which at any moment would cut him down too late now too late now he walked steadily behind the other mans shadow knowing the rest of his party were close on his heels he could even picture their faces men like rowhurst the gunners mate kutbi the staringeyed arab rabbett the little thief from liverpool who had escaped the rope by volunteering for the navy the seas noises came to meet them giving them confidence like an old friend they paused by some sundried bushes while bolitho took stock of his position the bushes had looked much larger from the hilltop now the seamen crowded behind and amongst them peering across the rippling water towards the fort and probably thinking that they were the last cover until they reached those walls the canadian whispered them there are th guide ropes fer th pontoon he was chewing methodically his body hunched forward as he studied the shelving strip of beach bolitho saw the great timbers which had been raised to carry the ropes and found himself praying that their calculations on tide and distance were right if the pontoon was hard aground it would take an army to move it he thought of the two big muzzles he had seen pointing towards the mainland and the hidden causeway he doubted if the garrison would give them time for regrets he wondered if paget was watching their progress from some vantage point seething with impatience bolitho took a grip on his racing thoughts this was no moment to get flustered the scout was stripping off his jerkin as he said ill be goin over then he could have been remarking on the weather if you hear nothiri youd better follow bolitho reached out and touched the mans shoulder it was covered in grease he forced himself to say good luck the scout left the bushes and walked unhurriedly to the waters edge bolitho counted the paces four five six but already the canadian was merging with the water then he was gone altogether the sentries around the fort stood threehour watches probably because they were shorthanded it would with luck make them extra weary the minutes dragged past and several times bolitho thought he heard something and waited for the alarm to be raised rowhurst muttered should be long enough sir he had a bared cutlass in his fist must be all right bolitho looked at the gunners mate in the darkness was he that confident or did he think his lieutenant had lost his nerve and was merely trying to jolt him into action one more minute he beckoned to couzens go and tell mr quinn to prepare his men again he had to check himself make sure the ladders were muffled quinn would have seen to that he must have he nodded to rowhurst you take the left rope he beckoned to stockdale well take the right one the seamen had split into two groups and he saw them crossing the open beach towards the massive timbers then up and out on the sagging ropes dangling at first and then lower until their legs and then their bodies were pushed and buffeted by the swirling current after the beat of the day and the discomfort of waiting the water was like cool silk bolitho dragged himself along the rope it felt greasy like the scouts shoulder every man in the party was handpicked even so he could hear a few grunts and gasps and felt his own arms throbbing with strain then all of a sudden they were there dropping silently on to the pontoons crude deck peering round with white eyes waiting for a challenge instead the scout moved out of the shadows and drawled all done e never even woke up bolitho swallowed he did not need to be told anything more the luckless sentry must have fallen asleep to awake with the scouts doubleedged hunting knife already sawing into his throat he said rowhurst you know what to do carry on and collect the others let the current move the thing rowhurst nodded patiently aye sir ill do that bolitho stepped carefully off the ramp his foot brushing against an outflung arm where the dead sentry lay at the waters edge he shut him from his mind as he tried to remember all he had seen here the fort was on the other side of the narrow island about half a mile less the sentries would be watching to seaward if they were watching at all they had plenty of reason for confidence he thought the lugger had taken an age to work around the point so even firing blindly the fort could cripple a large manofwar in no time at all nobody in his right mind would anticipate an attack from inland without even boats provided for the crossing stockdale whispered huskily shes movin sir the pontoon was slipping away merging with the shadows and the black mainland beyond bolitho walked towards the fort his little group of men spreading out on either side now he felt really alone and completely cut off from aid if things went wrong after groping their way towards the fort for some while they discovered a shallow gully and gratefully clambered into it bolitho lay with his telescope propped over the lip of coarse sand and tried to discover some sign of life but like the island itself the fort seemed dead the original building long since destroyed by fire and battle had been constructed to defend the early settlers from attack by indians those hardy adventurers would be laughing now if they could see us bolitho thought grimly after what seemed like a lifetime a seaman whispered mr couzens is comin sir led by the canadian scout out of breath and grateful to have discovered his companions couzens fell into the gully he said mr quinn is over here now sir and captain desterre with his first section of marines bolitho let his breath exhale very slowly whatever happened now he was not alone and unsupported the pontoon would be on its way back and with any sort of luck more marines would soon be landing he whispered take two men and feel your way along the beach to those boats i want them guarded in case we have to leave with sudden haste he could sense the youths concentration so be off with you he watched him crawl over the lip of the gully with two armed seamen one less to worry about there was no sense in couzens getting killed for such a hazy plan it was easy to picture the marines spreading out in two sections making their way towards the forts gates while the next to land took station to cover the eventual attack or retreat bolitho guessed that probyn would be with the major if only to make certain he was not forgotten after the excitement was over another figure slithered amongst the tense seamen it was quinns midshipman out of breath and quivering with exertion well mr huyghue bolitho thought suddenly of sparke in the heat of a fight cool detached it was easier said than done is your party ready huyghue bobbed his head aye sir ladders and grapnels he licked his lips noisily mr quinn says it will be light very soon now bolitho looked at the sky quinn must be ill at ease to mention the obvious to his midshipman iie said wed best begin in that case he stood up and loosened his shirt how many more times like this when would it be his turn to fall and never get up again bolitho said harshly follow me the unnatural sound of his own voice made him feel slightly unsteady lightheaded mr huyghue remain here and keep a good watch if we are repulsed you will join mr couzens at the boats huyghue was shifting from foot to foot as if he were standing on hot coals and then sir bolitho looked at him you will have to decide on that for i fear there will be none left to advise you he heard rabbetts little titter and wondered how anyone could laugh at such a feeble gruesome joke he felt the breeze on his face soft and coolly caressing as he strode towards the corner of the fort it was still a cable away and yet he felt starkly visible as he made his way towards quinns hiding place someone rose to his knees with an aimed musket but fell prone again as he recognized bolithos party quinn was with his men by the ladders edgy and nervous as he waited for bolitho to use his telescope bolitho said nothing it looks quiet very quiet i think they must place a lot of trust in the seaward entry and the one we left by the beach he saw quinn flinch and added softly get a grip james our people have nothing but us to judge their chances by he forced a grin feeling his lips tighten as if freezing so let us earn our pay eh rowhurst strode from the shadows ready sir he glanced quickly at quinn no sign of the buggers on this parapet bolitho turned his back towards the fort and raised his arm he saw the crouching figures breaking from cover and knew he had committed all of them there was no turning back the ladders were carried swiftly towards the chosen wall and on either side of them the first party of seamen loped forward their cutlasses and boarding axes making them look like figures from an old norman tapestry bolitho had once seen at bodmin bolitho gripped quinns wrist squeezing it until he winced with pain we dont know what well find james but the gates must be opened do you hear me he spoke slowly despite his tumbling thoughts it was essential for quinn to hold out now quinn nodded yes i ill be all right sir bolitho released him dick quinn stared at him dazedly dick the first ladder was already rising against the pale stars up and up and the second following even as the waiting seamen hurried to steady them bolitho made sure that his hanger was looped around his wrist and then ran lightly to the nearest ladder knowing that stockdale was following rowhurst watched quinn and then tapped his arm seeing him jump as he hissed come along sir with a gasp quinn ran to the other ladder scrambling and panting as he pulled himself towards the hard black edge below the stars bolitho hoisted himself over the rough planking and dropped on to the wooden rampart it was little different from a ship he thought vaguely except for the terrible stillness he felt his way along a handrail past a mounted swivel gun and towards where he thought the gates would be he sucked breath to his aching lungs seeing the rounded hump on the wall which he knew was directly above the entrance he could smell the embers of a wood fire cooking horses and men the smell of a tightly packed garrison almost anywhere in the world he twisted round as the seaman rabbett slid forward and brought down the side of his boarding axe on what bolitho had thought to be a pile of sacks it was another sentry or perhaps just a man who had come up to the parapet to find some cool air it was such a swift and savage blow that bolitho thought it doubtful if he would draw breath again the shock of it helped to tighten his reactions to compress every ounce of concentration in what he was doing he found the top of a ladder and knew the gates were just yards away stockdale moved beside him ill do it sir bolitho tried to see his face but there was only shadow well do it together with the remainder of the men kneeling or lying on the parapet bolitho and stockdale stepped very slowly down the uneven wooden stairs at the other end of that same wall quinn and his party would be making towards the watchtower to protect bolitho from the rear if the guard turned out it had all begun in rearadmiral coutts mind many miles from this sinister place now they were here when previously bolitho had thought they would be attacked and beaten back before they had even found a refuge to hide it had been so ridiculously easy that it was unnerving at the same time he felt the ground under his shoes and knew he had reached the courtyard he could sense rather than discern the low buildings and stables which lined the inner walls but when he looked at the tower he discovered he could see the flagpole and the paling sky above stockdale touched his arm and pointed towards a small outthrust hut beyond the gates there was a soft glow of light through some shutters and bolitho guessed it was where the guard took its rest between watches he whispered come it took only seven paces to reach the centre of the gates bolitho found he was counting each one as if his life depended on it there was a long beam resting on iron slots to secure the gates and nothing more stockdale laid down his cutlass and took the weight of the bar at one end while bolitho watched the hut it was just as stockdale put his great strength under the beam that it happened a terrified shout rising to a shrill scream before being cut off instantly as if slammed behind a massive door for an instant longer nobody moved or spoke and then as startled voices and padding feet echoed around the courtyard bolitho yelled open it fast as you can shots cracked and banged haphazardly and he heard them slamming into timber or whistling harmlessly towards the water he could imagine the confusion and pandemonium it was causing and plenty of the garrison must still be thinking the attack was coming from outside the defences light spilled from the guard hut and bolitho saw figures running towards him one firing his musket and then being knocked down by more men who were charging out palely naked against the shadows he heard someone yell load and fire at will lads then steel grated on steel and more shouts changed to screams and desperate cries before anyone from bolithos party could fire a man lunged at him with a bayoneted musket but he parried it away letting the charge carry his attacker past gasping with terror until the hanger slashed him down at stockdales feet bolitho yelled to me trojans there were more cries and then cheers as the first gate began to move and stockdale heaved the great beam aside hurling it amongst the confused figures by the hut like a giants lance but others were appearing from across the courtyard and some semblance of order came with shouted commands a responding rattle of musketfire which hurled two seamen from the parapet like rag dolls stockdale snatched up his cutlass and slashed a man across the chest turning just enough to take a second in the stomach as he tried to stab under bolithos guard kutbi the arab screamed shrilly and ran forward whirling his axe like a madman oblivious to everything but the urge to kill another seaman fell coughing blood by bolithos feet and he heard quinns men clashing blades with the guards from the tower getting nearer and louder as they were driven back towards the gates clang clang clang bolitho thought his arm would break as he hacked and parried at a uniformed figure which had seemingly risen from the ground beneath him he could feel the mans strength his determination as step by step he drove him back and further still bolitho felt strangely clearheaded devoid of fear or any recognizable sensation this must be the moment what it was like the end of luck of everything clang clang clang he locked his hilt with the other mans sensing his power against his own fading strength vaguely he beard stockdale bellowing trying to cut his way through to help him instinct told him there was no help this time and as the other man swung him round using the locked hilts like a hinge he saw a pistol protruding from his belt with one last agonizing effort he flung himself forward letting his swordarm drop while he snatched for the trigger cocking the weapon and firing even as he tore it free the explosion threw it from his hand and he saw the man double over his agony too terrible even for screams as the heavy ball ripped through his groin like molten lead bolitho raised his hanger swayed over the writhing man and then lowered it again it would be kinder to free him from his agony forever but he could not do it the next moment the other gate was being thrust aside and through the drifting smoke of musket and pistol fire bolitho saw the white crossbelts and the faintly glittering bayonets as the marines surged through there were a few last pockets of resistance handfuls of men fighting and dying in a cellar and on the parapet some tried to surrender but were shot down in a wave of madness by the victorious marines others burst through the gates and ran for the sea only to be trapped by pagets next cordon of muskets probyn limped through the chaos of dying men and prisoners with their hands in the air he saw bolitho and grunted that was close bolitho nodded leaning against a horserail sucking air into his aching body he looked at probyns limp and managed to gasp are you wounded probyn replied hotly got tripped by some fools with a ladder might have broken my damn leg it was so absurd in the midst of all the pain and death that bolitho wanted to laugh but he knew if he did he would not be able to stop or control it desterre came from beneath the stable roof and said the fort is taken its done he turned to receive his hat from a marine and brushed it against his leg before adding the devils had a gun already loaded and trained on the causeway if they had been warned we would have been cut down completely attacking or running away rowhurst waited until bolitho had seen him and then said heavily we lost three men sir ile gestured with his thumb towards the tower an two badly wounded bolitho asked quietly and mr quinn rowhurst replied gruffly es all right sir what did that mean bolitho saw paget and more marines coming through the open gates and decided not to press further not yet paget looked at the hurrying marines and seamen and snapped where is the forts commanding officer desterre said he was absent sir but we have taken his secondincommand paget snorted hell do show me to his quarters he looked at probyn have your people lay a couple of heavy cannon on that lugger if she tries to make sail dissuade her what probyn touched his hat and muttered sourly hes having a fine time and no mistake rowhurst was already looking up at the gun embrasures with a professional eye ill attend to the lugger sir he strode off yelling names glad to be doing something he understood the man whose pistol bolitho had used just minutes earlier gave a single cry and then died bolitho stood looking at him trying to discover his feelings towards someone who had tried to kill him a marine from the trojan marched across the courtyard and could barely stop himself from grinning as he reported beg pardon sir but one of your young gennlemen as caught a prisoner at that moment couzens and two seamen came through the gates leading them for that was how it looked was the french officer his coat over one arm and carrying his cocked hat as if going for a stroll couzens exclaimed he was making for the boats sir ran right into us he was glowing with pride at his capture the frenchman glanced from bolitho to probyn and said calmly not running i assure you merely taking advantage of circumstances he bowed his head i am lieutenant yves contenay at your service probyn glared at him you are under arrest damn you the frenchman gave a gentle smile i think not i command yonder vessel i put in for he shrugged the reason is unimportant he looked up as some seamen used handspikes to train one of the cannon further round towards the anchorage for the first time he showed alarm even fear probyn said i see unimportant well i shall expect you to tell your people not to attempt to leave or to damage the vessel in any way if they do i will have them fired upon without quarter i believe that contenay turned to bolitho and spread his hands i have my orders also you know bolitho watched him the strain dragging at his body like claws your lugger is carrying gunpowder is she not the frenchman frowned lugger then he nodded ah yes loacgre i understand he shrugged again yes if you put one shot into her pouf probyn snapped stay with him i must go and tell the major bolitho looked at couzens well done the french officer smiled indeed yes bolitho watched the bodies being dragged from the gates and the guard hut two of the prisoners in their blue and white uniforms were already being put to work with brooms and buckets to clear away the blood he said quietly you will be asked about your cargo msieu but you know that yes i am under official orders there is no law to stop me my country respects the revolution it does not respect your oppression bolitho asked dryly and france hopes to gain nothing of course they both grinned at each other like conspirators while couzens robbed of some of his glory watched in confusion two lieutenants bolitho thought caught up in a tidal wave of rebellion and war it would be hard to dislike this french officer but he said i suggest you do nothing to rouse major paget just so contenay tapped the side of his nose you have officers like that too do you as probyn returned with a marine escort bolitho asked where did you learn such good english msieu i lived in england for a long time his smile widened it will be useful one day oui probyn snapped take him to major paget he watched the man go with his escort and added angrily you should have shot him mr couzens dammit hell be exchanged for one of our officers dont doubt it bloody privateers id hang the lot of em theirs and ours stockdale called see the flag sir bolitho looked up at the garrison flag which paget had sensibly ordered to be hoisted in the usual way there was no sense in drawing suspicion from sea or land until they had finished what they had begun but he knew what stockdale meant instead of flapping lazily towards the land it was lifting and falling towards the brightening horizon the wind had completely changed direction overnight up to now everyone had been too busy and apprehensive to notice he said quietly spite will not be able to stand inshore probyns palm rasped across his bristles as he replied anxiously but itll shift back again you see if it dont bolitho turned his back on the sea and studied the hillside where he and couzens had baked in the sun from the fort it looked different again dark and brooding but until it does we are the defenders here major paget squatted on the corner of a sturdy table and eyed his weary officers grimly sunlight streamed through the windows of the garrison commanders room and through a weapon slit bolitho could see the trees along the shore and a small sliver of beach it was halfway into the morning and still without a sight of friend or enemy that did not mean they had not kept busy on the contrary with the captured french lieutenant as hostage probyn and an escort of armed marines had been pulled across to the lugger when he had eventually returned he had described the vessels cargo for pagets benefit she was full to the deck seams with west indian gunpowder several stands of french muskets pistols and numerous pieces of military equipment paget said she is a very valuable capture denying the enemy her cargo will do washington s campaign some damage i can assure you gentlemen if we are attacked here before help comes for us it seems very likely that the enemy will destroy the lugger if they cannot recapture her i intend that she should not fall into their hands again bolitho heard the tramp of marching feet and the hoarse cries of the marine sergeants pagets assessment made very good sense fort exeter had to be destroyed and with it all the defences weapons and equipment which had been gathered over the months but it would take time and it seemed unlikely that it could be long before the enemy counterattacked i am in command of this operation paget ran his eyes over them as if expecting an argument it falls to me to appoint a prize crew for the lugger to sail her without delay to new york or to report to any kings ship whilst on passage there bolitho tried to contain his sudden excitement the lugger li had a crew of natives which had been recruited by the french authorities in martinique no wonder a man like lieutenant contenay had been picked for such a small and lonely command he was a cut above many officers bolitho had met and well suited for such arduous work it was no mean task to sail the lugger from martinique in the caribbean all the way to this poorly charted anchorage even with such a devastating and lethal cargo she would make a pleasant change from this he thought and once in new york anything might happen before trojans authority caught up with him again a frigate perhaps going back to the most junior aboard a frigate would be reward enough he thought he had misheard as paget continued mr probyn is to command he will take some of the lesser wounded men to watch over the native crew bolitho turned expecting probyn to explode in protest then it came to him after all why should not probyn feel as he did go with the prize and present himself to the commanderinchief in the hopes of getting a better appointment and promotion to boot probyn was so obsessed with the idea he had not touched a drop of wine or brandy even after taking the fort he was not shrewd enough to see beyond the new prize and his eventual entrance to sandy hook not the sort of man to consider that others might think it strange for so senior a lieutenant to take so small a command probyn stood up his features showing satisfaction better than any speech paget added i will write the necessary orders unless he glanced at bolitho you intend to change your mind probyns jaw lifted firmly no sir it is my right the major glared at him only if i say so he shrugged but so be it desterre murmured i am sorry for your missed chance dick but i cannot say the same of your remaining with us bolitho tried to smile thank you but i think poor george probyn may soon be back in trojan he is likely to run into a senior ship on his journey whose captain may have other ideas about the luggers cargo pagets eyebrows knitted together when you have quite finished gentlemen desterre asked politely what of the french lieutenant sir he will remain with us rearadmiral coutts will be interested to meet him before the authorities in new york get the chance he gave a stiff smile if you can see my point the major stood up and flicked some sand from his sleeve be about your affairs and see that your men are on the alert probyn waited by the door for bolitho and said curtly you are the senior here now his eyes glittered through his tiredness and i wish you luck with this rabble bolitho watched him impassively probyn was not that much senior in years but looked almost as old as pears he asked why all this bitterness probyn sniffed i have never had any real luck or the background of your family to support me he raised his fist to bolithos sudden anger i came from nothing and had to drag myself up every rung by my fingernails you think i should have asked for you to be sent with the lugger eh whats a damned frenchie blockaderunner to a senior lieutenant like me thats what youre thinking bolitho sighed probyn was deeper than he had imagined it did cross my thoughts when sparke was killed the next chance fell to me i took it and i intend to exploit it to the fullest range dyou see i think so bolitho looked away unable to watch probyns torment you can wait for the relief to arrive then you can tell mr bloody cairns and anyone else who might be interested that im not coming back to trojan but if i ever do have to visit the ship i will be piped aboard as a captain in my own rightv he swung on his heel and walked off whatever pity or understanding bolitho might have felt melted when he realized that probyn had no intention of speaking with the men he was leaving behind or visiting those who would die from their wounds before the lugger had tacked clear of the anchorage desterre joined him on the parapet and watched probyn as he marched purposefully along the beach towards one of the longboats i hope to god he stays out of his cups dick with a hull full of powder and a crew of frightened natives it could be a rare voyage if george returns to his favourite pastime he saw his sergeant waiting for him and hurried away bolitho went down one of the stairways and found quinn leaning against a wail he was supposed to be supervising the collection of sidearms and powder flasks but was letting his men do as they pleased bolitho said well you heard what the major had to say and what probyn said to me just now i have a few ideas of my own but first i want to know what happened at dawn when we attacked he waited remembering the awful cry the bark of musket fire quinn said huskily a man came out of the watchtower we were all so busy looking at the gates and trying to mark down the sentries he just seemed to come from nowhere he added wretchedly i was the nearest i could have cut him down easily he shuddered he was just a youngster stripped to the waist and carrying a bucket i think he was going down to get some water for the galley he was unarmed what then we stood looking at each other i am not sure who was the more surprised i had my blade to his neck one blow but i couldnt do it he looked desperately at bolitho he knew it too we just stood there until rowhurst was it yes with his dirk but he was too late bolitho nodded i thought we were done for he recalled his own feelings as he had stood over the man he had shot to save himself quinn said i saw the look in the gunners mates eyes he despises me it will go through the ship like fire ill never be able to hold their respect after this bolitho ran his fingers through his hair youll have to try and earn it james he felt the sand and grit in his fingers and longed for a bath or a swim but weve work here now he saw stockdale and some seamen watching him take those hands to the pontoon directly it is to be warped into deep water and broken up he gripped his arm and added think of them james tell them what you want done quinn turned and walked dejectedly towards the waiting men at least with stockdale in charge he should be all right bolitho thought a petty officer knuckled his forehead and asked weve broached the main magazine zur he waited patiently his eyes like those of a sheepdog bolitho collected his thoughts while his mind and body still tried to detain him but it had to be faced he was in charge of the seamen just as probyn had said he said very well ill come and see what youve found cannon had to be spiked and made useless stores to be set alight before the fort itself was blasted to fragments with its own magazine bolitho glanced at the empty stables as he followed the petty officer into the shade he was thankful there were no horses left in the fort the thought of having to slaughter them to deny them to the enemy was bad enough what it might have done to the battlewearied seamen was even worse death injury or punishment under the lash the average sailor seemed to accept as his lot but bolitho had seen a boatswains mate split open a mans head in plymouth merely for kicking a stray dog marines bustled everywhere in their element as they prepared long fuses stowed casks of powder and trundled the smaller fieldpieces towards the gates by the time the work was half completed the pontoon had been warped into deep water and from a parapet bolitho saw the seamen hacking away the ropes and destroying the ramp with their axes small in the distance quinn stood watching them the next time he was thrown into a fight he would not be so lucky bolitho decided sadly he saw midshipman couzens in the watchtower a telescope trained towards the anchorage when he turned bolitho saw the lugger making sail her anchor swinging and dripping as it was hoisted to the cathead the same wind which would delay spite should carry probyn and his little command well clear of the land by nightfall pity was never a good reason for making friends bolitho thought but it had been a bad parting and if they ever met again it would be between them of that he was certain so there you are bolitho paget peered down from his crude window come up here and i will give you your instructions in the room once again bolitho felt the weariness the aftermath of destruction and fear pulling him down paget said another piece of intelligence we now know where the enemy are getting some of their armaments and powder eh he watched bolitho narrowly its up to the admiral now there was a rap at the door and bolitho heard someone whispering urgently outside wait paget said calmly i had no choice over the lugger she was yours by right in my view because of the manner in which you opened the fort for us he shrugged heavily but the navys ways are not mine and so i understand sir good paget moved across the room with remarkable speed and flung open the door well man it was lieutenant fitzherbert of the flagships marines he stammered we have sighted the enemy sir coming up the coast together they walked into the blinding sunlight and paget calmly took a telescope from one of the sentries then after a full minute he handed it to bolitho theres a sight for you i reckon your mr probyn will be sorry to miss it bolitho soon forgot his disappointment and the majors sarcasm as he trained the glass towards the shore there must be a track there following the seas edge probably all the way to charles town weaving along it was a slowmoving ribbon of blue and white it was broken here and there by horses and shining black shapes which could only be artillery paget folded his arms and rocked back on his heels so here they come no use trying any more deceptions i think he looked up at the pole his eyes redrimmed with strain run up the colours sergeant itll give em something to rant about bolitho lowered the glass quinn was still down by the partly wrecked pontoon oblivious to the threatening column coming up the road probyn was too involved in working his vessel clear of the sandspit to notice it or care much if he did he swung the glass towards the horizon his eyes stinging in the fierce glare nothing broke the sharp blue line to betray the presence of a friendly sail he thought of the captured french officer with any luck his captivity would be one of the shortest on record paget barked stir yourself sir main battery to be man andled towards the causeway you have a good runner with you i believe tell him i want a full charge in each weapon this is going to be hot work dammit bolitho made to hurry away but paget added firmly i dont care what they promise or offer we came to destroy this place and we will so help me god when bolitho reached the courtyard he turned and looked again at the tower paget was standing bareheaded in the sun staring at the newly hoisted jack which the marines had brought with them then he heard a seaman say quietly to his friend mister bolitho dont look too troubled bill cant be anythin we wont be able to tackle bolitho glanced at them as he passed his heart both heavy and proud they did not question why they were here or even where they were obedience trust hope they were as much a part of these men as their cursing and brawling he met rowhurst by the gate you have heard no doubt rowhurst grinned seen em too sir like a whole bloody army on the march just for us bolitho smiled gravely weve plenty of time to get ready aye sir rowhurst looked meaningly at the mounting pile of powder casks and fuses one thing they wont have to bury us theyll just ave to pick up the bits night action bolitho entered the room at the top of the tower where the former garrison commander had lived out his spartan days and found paget discussing a map with desterre bolitho asked you sent for me sir he barely recognized his own voice he had got past tiredness almost to a point of exhaustion all through the day he had hurried from one task to another conscious the whole time of that faroff blue and white column as it weaved in and out of sight along the coast now it had vanished altogether and it seemed likely that the road turned sharply inland before dividing opposite the island paget glanced up sharply he had shaved and looked as if he had been freshly pressed with his uniform yes wont be long now what he gestured to a chair all done bolitho sat down stiffly all done like an endless muddle of jobs dead had been buried prisoners moved to a place where they could be guarded by the minimum of men stores and water checked powder stacked in the deep magazine to create one devastating explosion once the fuses were set and fired the heavy fieldpieces manhandled to the landward side to be trained on the causeway and the opposite stretch of shoreline he replied aye sir and ive brought all the seamen inside the fort as you ordered good paget poured some wine and pushed the goblet across the table have some not too bad considering the major continued you see its mostly a matter of bluff we know quite a lot about these fellows but theyll not know much about us yet theyll see my marines but one redcoat looks much like another anyway why should the enemy think we are marines eh could just as easily be a strong force of skirmishers who have cut through their lines thatll give em something to worry about bolitho glanced at desterre but his normally agile face was expressionless so bolitho guessed he and not paget had thought up the idea of concealing the presence of his sailors it made sense too after all there were no boats and who better than the returning garrison commander would know the impossibility of getting a manofwar into the anchorage without passing those heavy cannon the wind showed no sign of changing direction and in fact had gained in strength all afternoon it had driven a pall of dust from the distant marching column out across the sea like gunsmoke paget said hour or so to sunset but theyll make themselves felt before dark thats my wager bolitho looked across the room and through a narrow window he could just see part of the hillside where he had lain with young couzens a million years ago the sunscorched bushes and scrub were moving in the wind like coarse fur and everything was painted in fiery hues by the evening light the marines were down by the uprooted timbers where the pontoon had been moored dug into little gullies they were invisible to eyes across the restless strip of water desterre had done a good job of it now they all had to sit and wait bolitho said wearily water is the problem sir they always brought it from a stream further down the coast theres not much left if they guess were waiting for a ship to take us off the island they will know exactly how much time they have and us too paget sniffed id thought of that naturally theyll try to bombard us out but there we have the advantage that beach is too soft to support artillery and it will take another day at least for them to move their heavier pieces up the hill to hit us from there as for the causeway id not fancy a frontal attack along it even at low water bolitho saw desterre give a small smile he was probably thinking it was exactly what would have been expected of him and his men if bolitho had failed to open the gates the door banged open and the marine lieutenant from the flagship said excitedly enemy in sight sir paget glared really mr fitzherbert this is a garrison not a scene from drury lane dammit nevertheless he got up and walked into the hot glare reaching for a telescope as he strode to the parapet bolitho rested his hands on the sundried wood and stared at the land two horsemen five or six foot soldiers and a large black dog he had not expected to see the whole enemy column crammed on to the narrow beach but the little group was a complete anticlimax paget said theyre looking at the pontoon ramps i can almost hear their brains rattling bolitho glanced at him paget really was enjoying it one of the horsemen dismounted and the dog ran across to him waiting for something to happen his master obviously the senior officer present reached down to fondle his head the movement familiar without conscious thought fitzherbert asked cautiously what will they do sir paget did not answer immediately he said look at those horses desterre see how their hoofs are digging into the sand the only piece of supported road led to the pontoon loading point he lowered the glass and chuckled dryly never thought theyd have to attack i imagine sergeant shears called saw some more of em on the hillside sir cant hit us with a musket from there thank god paget rubbed his hands tell your gunner to put a ball down on the end of the causeway he looked at bolitho sharply now rowhurst listened to pagets order with obvious enthusiasm good as done sir with some of his men at their handspikes and other slackening or tightening the tackles he soon trained the cannon towards the wet bank of sand nearest the land stand clear lads bolitho yelled keep out of sight you men stockdale see that our people stay down the crash of the single shot echoed around the fort and across the water like thunder scores of birds rose screaming from the trees and bolitho was just in time to see a tall spurt of sand as it received the heavy ball like a fist the horses shied violently and the dog ran round and round his bark carrying excitedly across the water bolitho grinned and touched rowhursts arm reload he strode back to the tower and saw quinn watching him from the other parapet paget said good fine shot just close enough for them to know were ready and able a few moments later sergeant shears called flag o truce sir one horseman was cantering towards the causeway where a tendril of smoke still drifted to mark the fall of shot paget snapped ready with another ball mr bolitho its a flag of truce sir bolitho forgot his tiredness and met pagets glare stubbornly i cannot tell rowhurst to fire on it pagets eyebrows rose with astonishment what is this a spark of honour he turned to desterre explain it to him desterre said quietly theyll want to sound us out discover our strength they are not fools one sight of a marines coat and theyll know how we came and what for fitzherbert said unhelpfully the horseman is an officer sir bolitho shaded his eyes to follow the distant horse and rider how was it possible to argue over honour and scruples at such a moment today or tomorrow he would be expected to cut down that same man if need be without question or thought and yet he said bluntly ill put a ball in the centre of the causeway paget turned from studying the little group on the beach oh very well but do get on with it the second shot was equally well aimed and threw spray and sand high into the air while the horseman struggled to regain control of his startled mount then he turned and trotted back along the beach now they know paget seemed satisfied i think id like a glass of wine he left them and reentered his room desterre smiled grimly i suspect emperor nero was something of a paget dick bolitho nodded and moved to the seaward side of the tower of probyns new command there was no trace and he pictured her gaining more and more distance in the favourable offshore wind if the enemy column had seen the vessel leave they would assume she had turned away at the sight of the redcoats otherwise why should not the forts new occupiers go with her bluff stalemate guessing it all added up to one thing what would they do if the sloop did not or could not come to take them off the island if the water ran out would paget surrender it seemed unlikely the enemy commander would be eager to be lenient after they had blown up his fort and every weapon with it he leaned over the parapet and looked at the seamen who were sitting in the shadows waiting for something to do if the water ran out could these same men be expected to obey or keep their hands off the plentiful supply of rum they had unearthed by the stables bolitho recalled pagets words he knew where the enemy were getting much of their powder and shot the information would be little help to rearadmiral coutts if their brave escapade ended here just to be back in trojan he thought suddenly after this he would never complain again even if he remained one of her lieutenants for the rest of his service the very thought made him smile in spite of his uncertainty he knew in his heart that if he survived this time he would be as eager as ever to make his own way he heard lieutenant raye of trojans marines clattering up the ladder and reporting to desterre to bolitho it was another sort of life tactics and strategy which moved at the speed of a mans feet or a horsemans gallop no majesty of sail no matter how frail when the guns roared just men and uniforms dropping into the earth when their time came forgotten he felt a chill at the nape of his neck as desterre said to the two lieutenants i feel certain they will attack tonight an assault to test us out to be followed up if we are caught unawaresi want two platoons on immediate readiness the guns will have to fire over their heads so keep em down in their gullies until i give the word he turned and looked meaningly at bolitho ill want two guns by the causeway as soon as it gets dark we might lose them if we fall back but we stand no chance unless we can give them bloody noses at the first grapple bolitho nodded ill see to it how calm he sounded a stranger he remembered his feelings as he had stood facing the fort with the pontoon moving away in the darkness if the enemy broke through the causeway pickets it was a long way to the gates for those in retreat desterre was watching him gravely it sounds worse than it is we must be ready keep our men on the alert and together we might find ourselves with visitors after dark he gestured to the roughly dressed canadian scouts two can play their game as shadows deepened between island and mainland the marines and seamen settled down to wait the beach was empty once more and only the churned up sand betrayed where the horses and men had stood to watch the fort paget said clear night but no moon he wiped one eye and swore bloody wind constant reminder of our one weakness bolitho with stockdale close by his side left the fort and went to watch the two guns being hauled down to the causeway it was hard backbreaking work and there were no laughs or jests now it seemed cold after the days heat and bolitho wondered how he could go through another night without sleep how any of them could he passed little gullies their occupants revealed only by their white crossbelts as they crouched and cradled their muskets and watched the glitter of water he found quinn with rowhurst siting the second cannon arranging powder and shot so that it would be easily found and used in total darkness stockdale wheezed whod be a soldier eh sir bolitho thought of the soldiers he had known in england the local garrison at falmouth the dragoons at bodmin wheeling and stamping to the delight of churchgoers on a sunday and little boys at any time this was entirely different brute force and a determination to match anything which came their way on desert or muddy field the soldiers lot was perhaps the worst of all he wondered briefly how the marines saw it the best or the worst of their two worlds quinn hurried across to him speaking fast and almost incoherent they say it will be tonight why cant we fall back to the fort when we attacked it they said the cannon commanded the causeway and the pontoon so why not the same for the enemy easy james keep your voice low we must hold them off the island they know this place we only think we know it just a handful of them around the fort and who knows what could happen quinn dropped his head ive heard talk they dont want to die for a miserable little island which none of them had ever heard of before you know why we came he was surprised yet again by the tone of his own voice it seemed harder colder but quinn must understand if he broke now it would not be a mere setback it would be a headlong rout quinn replied the magazine the fort but what will it matter really count for after were dead its a pinprick a gesture bolitho said quietly you wanted to be a sea officer more than anything your father wanted differently for you to stay with him in the city of london he watched quinns face pale in the darkness hating himself for speaking as he was as he must well i think he was right more than you knew he realized you would never make a kings officer not now not ever he swung away shaking off quinns hand and saying take the first watch here i will relieve you directly he knew quinn was staring after him wretched and hurt stockdale said that took a lot to speak like so sir i know ow you cares for the young gentleman but theres others wot depends on im bolitho paused and looked at him stockdale understood was always there when he needed him thank you for that stockdale shrugged his massive shoulders and said its nothing but i thinks about it sometimes bolitho touched his arm warmed and moved by his ungainly companion im sure you do stockdale two hours dragged past the night got colder or seemed to and the first stiffening tension was giving way to fatigue and aching discomfort bolitho was between the fort and the causeway when he stopped dead and turned his face towards the mainland stockdale stared at him and then nodded heavily smoke it was getting thicker by the second acrid and rasping to eyes and throat as it was urged across the island by the wind there were flames too dotted about like malicious orange feathers changing shape through the smoke spreading and then linking in serried lines of fires midshipman couzens who had been walking behind them asleep on his feet gasped what does it mean bolitho broke into a run theyve fired the hillside theyll attack under the smoke he forced his way through groups of startled retching marines until he found the cannon get ready to fire he picked out fitzherbert with one of his corporals a handkerchief wrapped around his mouth and nose will you tell the major fitzherbert shook his head his eyes streaming no time hell know anyway he dragged out his sword and yelled stand to face your front pass the word to the other section he was groping about coughing and peering for his men as more marines ran through the smoke desterres voice controlling them demanding silence restoring some sort of order couzens forgot himself enough to seize bolithos sleeve and murmur listen swimming bolitho pulled out his hanger and felt for his pistol near his home in cornwall there was a ford across a small river but sometimes especially in the winter it flooded and became impassable to wagons and coaches but he had seen and heard horses often enough to know what was happening now theyre swimming their mounts across he swung round as above the sounds of water and hissing fires he heard a longdrawnout cheer desterre shouted theyre coming from the causeway as well he pushed through his men and added keep em down sarnt let the cannon have their word first some armed seamen amongst them blundered out of the darkness and slithered to a halt as bolitho called keep with me follow the beach his mind was reeling grappling with the swiftness of events the closeness of disaster a cannon roared out and from somewhere across the water he heard the cheers falter broken by a chorus of cries and screams the second cannon blasted the darkness apart with its long orange tongue and bolitho heard the ball smashing into men and sand and pictured quinn stricken with fear as the defiant cheers welled back as strong as before stockdale growled theres one of em bolitho balanced himself on the balls of his feet watching the hurtling shadow charging from the darkness someone fired a pistol and he saw the horses eyes huge and terrified as it pounded towards the seamen and then swerved away as another horseman lurched from the water and loomed above them like an avenging beast he thought stockdale was saying to couzens easy son keep with me stand yer ground or be may have been speaking to me he thought then he forgot everything as he felt his hanger jerk against steel and he threw himself to the attack lieutenant james quinn ducked as musketfire clattered along the causeway and some of the shots clanged and ricocheted from the two cannon he was almost blinded by smoke from the burning hillside and now with additional fog of gunfire out in the open it seemed far worse than any gundeck metal shrieked overhead and through the smoke men stumbled and cursed as they rammed home fresh charges and grapeshot to try and hold off the attack fire quinn winced as the nearest cannon belched flame and smoke in the swift glare he saw running figures and a gleam of weapons before darkness closed in again and the air was rent by terrible screams as the murderous grape found a target a marine was yelling in his ear the devils are on the island sir he was almost screaming cavalry lieutenant fitzherbert ran through the smoke silence that man he fired his pistol along the causeway and added savagely youll start a panic quinn gasped cavalry he said fitzherbert glared at him his eyes shining above the handkerchief like stones wed all be corpses if there was man a few riders no doubtv rowhurst shouted hoarsely gettin short of powder he blundered towards quinn damn yer eyes sir do somethin fer christs sake quinn nodded his mind empty of everything but fear he saw midshipman huyghue crouching on one knee as he tried to level a pistol above a hastily prepared earthwork tell mr bolitho what is happening the youth stood up uncertain which way to go quinn gripped his arm along the beach fast as you can a shrill voice shouted ere the buggers come fitzherbert threw his handkerchief away and waved his sword sarnt triggs a corporal said hes dead sir the marine lieutenant looked away god almighty then as the shouts and whooping cheers echoed across the water he added forward marines stumbling and choking in the smoke the marines emerged from their gullies and ditches their bayonets rising in obedience to the order their feet searching for firm ground as they peered with stinging eyes for a sign of their enemy a hail of musketfire came from the causeway and a third of the marines fell dead or wounded quinn stared with disbelief as the marines fired started to reload and then crumpled to another welltimed volley fitzherbert yelled i suggest you spike those guns or get your seamen to reload our muskets he gave a choking cry and pitched through his dwindling line of marines his jaw completely shot away quinn shouted rowhurst fall back rowhurst thrust past him his eyes wild most of the lads ave gone already even in the face of such danger he could not hide his contempt you might as well run too from over his shoulder quinn heard the sudden blare of a trumpet it seemed to grip the remaining marines like a steel hand the corporal earlier on the edge of terror called retreat easy lads reload take air n he waited for some of the wounded to hop or crawl through the line fire quinn could not grasp what was happening he heard the snap of commands the click of weapons and somehow knew that desterre was coming to cover the withdrawal the enemy were barely yards away he could hear their feet slipping and squelching on the wet sand sense their combined anger and madness as they surged forward to retake the landingplace yet all he could think of was rowhursts disgust the need to win his respect in these last minutes he gasped which gun is loaded he staggered down the slope his pistol still unloaded and the hanger which his father had had specially made by the best city sword cutler firmly in its scabbard rowhurst dazed and bewildered by the change of events paused and stared at the groping lieutenant like a blind man it was stupid to go back with him what safety remained was a long run to the forts gates every moment here cut away a hope of survival rowhurst was a volunteer and prided himself on being as good a gunners mate as any in the fleet in a month or so if fate was kind he might gain promotion proper warrant rank in another ship somewhere he watched quinns pathetic efforts to find the gun which because of the marines leaving cover was still unfired either way it was over if he waited he would die with quinn if he escaped quinn would charge him with disobeying orders insolence to an officer something like that rowhurst gave a great sigh and made up his mind ere this is the one he forced a grin sir a corpse propped against one of the wheels gave a little jerk as more random shots slammed into it it was as if the dead were returning to life to witness their last madness the crash of the explosion as the slowmatch found its mark and the whole doubleshotted charge swept through the packed ranks of attackers seemed to bring some small control to quinns cringing mind he groped for the finely made hanger his eyes streaming his ears deafened by that final explosion all he could say was thank you rowhurst thank you but rowhurst had been right about one thing he lay staring angrily at the smoke a hole placed dead centre through his forehead no gunners mate could have laid a better shot quinn walked dazedly away from the guns his swordarm at his side the white breeches of dead marines shone in the darkness staring eyes and fallen weapons marked each moment of sacrifice but quinn was also aware that the din of shouting had gone from the causeway they too had taken enough he stopped suddenly tense and ready as figures came down towards him two marines the big gun captain called stockdale and a lieutenant with a drawn blade in his hand quinn looked at the ground wanting to speak to explain what rowhurst had done had made him do but bolitho took his arm and said quietly the corporal told me but for your example no one outside the fort would be alive now they waited as the first line of marines came down from the fort letting the battered and bleeding survivors from the causeway pass through them to safety bolitho ached all over and his swordarm felt as heavy as iron he could still feel the fear and desperation of the past hour the thundering horses the swords cutting out of the darkness and then the sudden rallying of his own mixed collection of seamen couzens had been stunned after being knocked over by a horse and three seamen were dead he himself had been struck from behind and the edge of the sabre had touched his shoulder like a redhot knife now the horses had gone swimming or drifting with the current but gone from here several of their riders had stayed behind for ever desterre found them as he came through the thinning smoke and said we held them it was costly dick but it could save us he held up his hat and fanned his streaming face see the wind is going about at last if there is a ship for us then she can come he watched a marine being carried past his leg smashed out of recognition in the darkness the blood looked like fresh tar we must get replacements to the causeway ive sent for a new gun crew he saw couzens walking very slowly towards them rubbing his head and groaning im glad hes all right desterre replaced his hat as he saw his sergeant hurrying towards him im afraid they took the other midshipman huyghue prisoner quinn said brokenly i sent him to look for you it was my fault bolitho shook his head no some of the enemy got amongst us theyd allowed for failure i expect and wanted to seize a few prisoners just in case bolitho made to thrust his hanger into its scabbard and discovered that the hilt was sticky with blood he let out a long sigh trying to fit his thoughts in order but as usual nothing came as if his mind was trying to protect him to cushion him from the horror and frantic savagery of hand to hand fighting sounds brief faces and shapes terror and wild hate but nothing real it might come later when his mind was able to accept it had it all been worthwhile was liberty that precious and tomorrow no today it would all begin again he heard quinn call they will need more powder for those guns see to it will you an anonymous figure in checkered shirt and white trousers hurried away to do his bidding an ordinary sailor he could be every sailor bolitho thought quinn faced him if you want to report to major paget i can take charge here he waited watching bolithos strained features as if searching for something i can really bolitho nodded id be grateful james i shall be back directly stockdale said roughly with rowhurst gone youll need a fair and at the guns sir he grinned at quinns face keep up the good work eh sir bolitho made his way into the fort weaving through groups of wounded each one a small island of pain in the glow of a lantern daylight would reveal the real extent of what they had endured paget was in his room and although bolitho knew he had been controlling the defences from the first minutes he looked as if he had never left the place paget said we will hold the causeway tonight of course he gestured to a bottle of wine but tomorrow we will prepare for evacuation when the ship comes we will send the wounded and those who have stood guard tonight first no time for any bluff if theyve got prisoners they know what were up to bolitho let the wine run over his tongue god it tasted good better than anything what if the ship does not come sir well that simplifies things paget watched him coldly well blow the magazine and fight our way out he smiled very briefly it wont come to that i see sir in fact he did not paget ruffled some papers i want you to sleep for an hour or so he held up his hand that is an order youve done fine work here and now i thank god that fool probyn made the decision he did id like to report on mr quinns part sir the major was getting misty in bolithos aching vision and the two midshipmen they are all very young paget pressed his fingertips together and regarded him unsmilingly not like you of course an ancient warrior what bolitho picked up his hat and made for the door with paget you knew exactly where you were he had selected him for some precious sleep the very thought made him want to lie down immediately and close his eyes equally he knew the true reason for pagets concern someone would have to stay behind and light the fuses you needed a measure of alertness for that bolitho walked past desterre without even seeing him the marine captain picked up the wine bottle and said you told him sir about tomorrow paget shrugged no he is like i was at his age didnt need to be told everything he glared at his subordinate unlike some desterre smiled and walked to the window somewhere across the water a telescope might be trained on the fort on this lighted window like bolitho he knew he should be snatching an hours rest but out there still hidden in darkness were many of his men sprawled in the careless attitudes of death he could not find it in his heart to leave them now it would be like a betrayal a gentle snore made him turn paget was fast asleep in the chair his face completely devoid of anxiety better to be like him desterre thought bitterly then he downed the drink in one swallow and strode out into the darkness rear guard when the sun eventually showed itself above the horizon and felt its way carefully inland it revealed not only the horror of the nights work but to those who had survived it also brought new hope hull down with the early sunlight were two ships and at first it seemed likely that the enemy had somehow found the means to frustrate any attempt of evacuation but as the vessels tacked this way and that drawing nearer and nearer to land with each change of course they were both identified and cheered not only had the sloopofwar spite come for them but also the thirtytwogun frigate vanquisher sent it seemed by rearadmiral coutts himself as soon as it was light enough the work of collecting and burying the dead got under way across the causeway now partially submerged a few corpses rolled and moved with the current most had been carried away to deeper water during the night or retrieved perhaps by their comrades paget was everywhere bullying suggesting threatening and occasionally tossing a word of encouragement as well the sight of the two ships put fresh life into his men and even though neither of them was a match for wellsited shore batteries they would shorten the work of evacuation more pulling boats fresh rested seamen to work them officers to take over the strain of command bolitho was in the deep magazine with stockdale and a marine corporal for much of the morning the place had a dreadful stillness about it a quality of death which he could feel like a chill breeze keg upon keg of gunpowder boxes of equipment and many unpacked cases of new french muskets and sidearms fort exeter had a lot to answer for in past dealings with england s old enemy stockdale hummed to himself as he attached the fuses to the foot of the first mound of explosives entirely engrossed and glad to be out of the bustle in the fort above boots tramped in the courtyard and there were sounds of grating metal as the cannons were spiked and then moved to a point above where the explosion would be bolitho sat on an empty keg his cheeks stinging from the shave which stockdale had given him when he had awakened from his deep exhausted sleep he remembered his father telling him when he had been a small boy if youve not had to shave with salt water you never know how soft is the life of a landsman by comparison he could have had all the fresh water he wanted but even now with the ships so near you could not be complacent or certain he watched stockdale s big hands so deft and gentle as he worked with the fuses it was a gamble always light the fuses head for safety minutes to get dear a seaman appeared on the sunlit ladder beg pardon sir but the major would like you with im he looked at stockdale and at the fuses and paled gawd bolitho ran up the ladder and across the courtyard the gates were open and he looked across the trampled ground the dried bloodstains the pathetic mounds which marked the hasty graves paget said slowly another flag of truce dammit bolitho shaded his eyes and saw the white flag some figures standing on the far end of the causeway their feet touching the water desterre came hurrying from the stables where some marines were piling up papers and maps and all the contents of the tower and quartermasters stores he took a telescope from pagets orderly and then said grimly theyve got young huyghue with them paget said calmly go and speak with them you know what i said this morning he nodded to bolitho you too it might help huyghue bolitho and the marine walked towards the causeway stockdale just behind them with an old shirt tied to a pike how he had heard what was happening and been here in time to keep bolitho company was a mystery it seemed to take an age to reach the causeway the whole time the little group at the far end never moved just the white flag streaming over a soldiers head to display the winds impartial presence bolitho felt his shoes sinking into sand and mud the further they walked towards the waiting group here and there were signs of battle a broken sword a mans hat and a pouch of musket balls in deep water he saw a pair of legs swaying gently as if the corpse was merely resting and about to surface again at any moment desterre said cant get any closer the two groups stood facing each other and although the man who waited by the flag was without his coat bolitho knew it was the senior officer from yesterday as if to prove it his black dog sat on the wet sand at his side a red tongue lolling with weariness a little to the rear was midshipman huyghue small seemingly frail against the tall sunburned soldiers the officer cupped his hands he had a deep resonant voice which carried without effort i am colonel brown of the charles town militia who have i the honour of addressing desterre shouted captain desterre of his britannic majestys marines brown nodded slowly very well i have come to parley with you i will allow your men to leave the fort unharmed provided you lay down your weapons and make no attempt to destroy the supplies and the arms he paused and then added otherwise my artillery will open fire and prevent evacuation even at the risk of blowing up the magazine ourselves desterre called i see to bolitho he whispered he is trying to drag out the time if he can get cannon on the hilltop he can certainly throw some long shots at the ships when they anchor it only needs a lucky ball just one in the right place he shouted again and what does the midshipman have to do with all this brown shrugged i will exchange him here and now for the french officer you are holding prisoner bolitho said softly i see it he is going to open fire anyway but wants the frenchman in safety first he fears we might kill him or that he would be cut down in a bombardment i agree desterre said loudly i cannot agree to the exchange bolitho saw the midshipman take a pace forward his hands half raised as if pleading brown called you will regret it bolitho wanted to turn his head and look for the ships to see how near they had managed to tack but any sign of uncertainty now might bring disaster another frontal attack perhaps if the enemy knew about the guns being spiked they would be halfway across the island by now he felt suddenly vulnerable but how much worse for huyghue sixteen years old to be left out here amongst enemies in a strange land where his death or disappearance would excite very little comment desterre said i might exchange your secondincommand instead no colonel browns hand was rubbing the dogs head as he spoke as if to calm his own thoughts he obviously had his orders bolitho decided as we all do the mention of the secondincommand had changed little except to prove that paget still had his prisoners guarded and alive that knowledge might help huyghue to survive a gun banged out suddenly the sound hollow and muffled bolitho thought the militia had got their guns into position already and felt the disappointment tug at his heart until he heard distant cheering stockdale wheezed one o the ships as dropped anchor sir desterre looked at bolitho and said simply we must go ill not prolong the boys misery bolitho shouted take care mr huyghue all will be well you will be exchanged soon ive no doubt huyghue must have believed up to the last second that he was going to be released his experiences during the bloody fighting had been enough in his eyes perhaps being taken prisoner was beyond his understanding he tried to run into the water and when a soldier seized his arm he fell on his knees calling and sobbing help one dont leave me please help even the militia colonel was moved by the boys despair and he gestured for him to be taken up the beach again bolitho and his companions turned their backs and started back towards the fort huyghues pathetic cries following them like a curse the frigate was anchored well out from the land but her sails were brailed up and there were boats in the water already pulling strongly towards the island the spite being smaller was still working her way inshore leadsmen busy in the chains to seek out any uncharted reef or bar they looked so clean so efficiently remote that bolitho felt suddenly sick of the land the heavy smell of death which seemed to overpower even that of the nights fires quinn was by the gates watching his face as he strode into the shade you left him yes bolitho looked at him gravely id no choice if all we had to do was exchange our victims thered be no point in coming here he sighed but ill not forget his face in a hurry paget examined his watch first wounded men to the beach he glanced at bolitho do you think they might try and rush us eh bolitho shrugged the smaller swivels could deal with them in daylight sir itd make our work harder though paget turned to listen as more cheers echoed around the fort simple fools he looked away blessem a marine ran down a ladder from the parapet mr rayes respects and hes sighted soldiers on the hill artillery too he thinks sir paget nodded right we must make haste signal spite to anchor and lower boats as fast as she can as quinn hurried away with the marine paget added warm work for you bolitho im afraid but whatever happens see that the magazine goes up what about the prisoners sir if theres room enough and time to spare ill have them shipped to the frigate he smiled wryly if i was left as rearguard id see they went up with the magazine damned bloody rebels but as you will be in charge you may use your discretion on your head be it the vanquishers boats were being beached and seamen were already hoisting wounded marines aboard their faces shocked at the small number of survivors then the sloops boats pulled ashore and more men started on their way to safety and medical care bolitho stood on the parapet above the gates where he and stockdale had crouched on that first terrible night when quinn had lost his nerve the fort already felt emptier and as marines hurried through the gates towards the rear bolitho watched the little scarlet figures down by the causeway and the two remaining cannon once he gave the order for final withdrawal sergeant shears and his handful of pickets would light the fuses which were attached to both guns two tightly packed charges would blow off the trunnions and render them as useless as those in the fort he wondered if anyone would ever hear about it in england the small but deadly actions which made up the whole few ever wrote of the real heroes he thought the lonely men on the prongs of an attack or those left behind to cover a retreat sergeant shears was probably thinking about it just now of the distance to the fort of the marines under his charge there was a loud bang followed by a whimpering drone as a heavy ball passed low overhead and slammed hard into the sand midshipman couzens pointed at the hillside see sir the smoke theyve got one gun at least in position bolitho watched him couzens looked pale and sick it would take time to recover from the nights fighting the rearing horses and sabres go and tell the major hell know but tell him anyway as couzens made for the ladder he added quietly then report to the senior officer with the boats dont come back here he saw the emotions flooding across the boys face relief concern finally stubbornness bolitho added firmly i am not asking it is an order but sir i want to stay with you bolitho turned as another bang echoed from the hillside this time the ball hit the sea and ricocheted over the wavecrests like a maddened dolphin i know but how will i explain to your father if anything happens to you eh whod eat your mothers pies he heard what sounded like a sob and when he turned again the parapet was empty time enough for you bolitho thought sadly three years younger than huyghue a child he saw the brilliant flash of a cannon and felt the ball tear above the fort with the sound of ripping canvas they had the range now the shot fell directly in line with the anchored frigate throwing spray over one of her boats as it pulled back to the island for more men desterre came up the ladder and looked at him last section moving out now theyre taking most of the prisoners too major pagets sent the frenchman contenay over with the first boat taking no chances he removed his hat and stared at the causeway damnable place a voice called from the courtyard vanquishers shortenin er cable sir getting clear before she gets a piece of colonel browns iron on her quarterdeck desterre looked anxious it might spark off an attack now that they think were on the run dick bolitho nodded ill get ready i hope theyve got a fast boat for us it was meant to sound amusing relaxed but it merely added to the strain the tension which was making it difficult to breathe evenly desterre said spites jolly boat its there waiting just for you bolitho said go now ill be all right he watched a small squad of marines scurrying through the courtyard one pausing to hurl a torch into the pile of papers and stores inside the stables desterre watched him walking towards the magazine and then just as quickly turned and followed his men through the gates a ball shrieked above the squat tower but desterre did not even look up it seemed to have no menace all danger and death was here like a foul memory he saw the frigates outline shortening as she tacked steeply away from the land her forecourse filling and flapping even as one of her boats pulled frantically alongside for the other boats it would be a long hard pull to reach her but her captain would know the danger of wellhidden artillery to lose a frigate was bad enough to allow her to be added to the revolutionary navy was even worse bolitho forgot desterre and everything else as he found stockdale with his slowmatch a solitary marine corporal and a seaman he recognized through the grime and stubble as rabbett the thief from liverpool light the fuses he winced as a heavy ball crashed through a parapet and came splintering amongst the stables which were now well alight he said get to the gates corporal call back your pickets fast as you can the fuses hissed into life somehow obscene in the gloom like serpents they seemed to be burning at a terrible speed he thought lie clapped stockdale on the shoulder time for us another ball smashed into the fort and hurled a swivel gun into the air like a stick two more sharp explosions came from the causeway and he knew the cannon had been destroyed musketfire too remote and without effect at this range but they would be coming soon they ran out into the blinding sunlight past discarded boxes and blazing stores two loud bangs and then splintering woodwork flying above the parapet told bolitho that browns men must have worked like demons to get their guns up the hill the corporal yelled seargeant shears is comin at th double sir the whole bloody rebel armys on their eels bolitho saw the running marines even as one fell headlong and stayed down soldiers were wading and struggling across the causeway too firing and reloading as they came bolitho measured the distance it was taking too long round one wall of the fort along the sloping beach where the jolly boat was waiting bolitho noticed that the crew had their oars out backing water watching the land mesmerized sergeant shears panted down the beach his men behind him into the boat bolitho looked up at the tower their flag still above it then he realized he was alone on the beach that stockdale had his arm and was hauling him over the gunwale as a nervouslooking lieutenant ordered give way all minutes later as the jolly boat bounded over the first lazy roller some soldiers appeared below the fort firing at the boat the shots going everywhere one hit the side and threw droplets of water across the panting marines shears muttered id get the hell out of here if i was them sir they were midway between the beach and the sloop when the explosion blasted the day apart it was not the sound but the sight of the complete fort being hurled skywards in thousands of shattered fragments which remained fixed in bolithos reeling mind long after the last piece had fallen as the smoke continued to billow across the island bolitho saw there was nothing there but one huge black wilderness all the prisoners had been taken off after all and he wondered what they must be thinking at this moment and young huyghue too would he remember the part he had played or would he think only of his own plight when he turned his head he saw the sloops masts and yards swaying above him willing hands waiting to assist them on board he looked at stockdale and their eyes met as if to say once again we survived once more fate stayed her hand he heard the sloops young commander cunningham shouting irritably lively there weve not got all damn day bolitho smiled wearily he was back captain gilbert brice pears sat at his table his strong fingers interlaced in front of him while his clerk arranged five beautifully written copies of the fort exeter raid for his signature around him trojans great hull creaked and clattered to a stiff quarter sea but pears barely noticed he had read the original report most carefully missing nothing and had questioned desterre on the more complex details of the attack and withdrawal nearby his lean body angled to the deck and silhouetted against the spraydappled windows cairns waited patiently for some comment pears had fretted at the delay in reaching the rendezvous after their feint attack towards charles town the winds sudden change a total absence of news and the general lack of faith he held in coutts plan added to his worst fears even coutts must have sensed his uneasiness and had despatched the frigate to assist spites recovery of the landing party pears had watched trojans seamen and marines climbing back aboard after they had eventually regained contact the tired haggard yet somehow defiant marines what was left of them and the filthy seamen desterre and bolitho with young couzens waving to his fellow midshipmen half laughing partly weeping fort exeter was no more he hoped it had all been worthwhile but secretly doubted it he nodded grimly to his clerk very well teakle ill sign the damn things he glanced at cairns must have been a bloody business our people did well it seems pears glared through the dripping windows at the blurred shape of the flagship closehauled on the same tack her courses and topsails filling to the wind now this blast his eyes cairns followed his glance knowing better than most how his captain felt it had taken six days for the ponderous ships of the line to rendezvous with vanquisher and spite then a further two while their admiral had interviewed the senior officers of his little squadron watched an interrogation of the disarmingly cheerful french prisoner and had considered the information which paget had gleaned at the fort now instead of returning to new york for further orders and to obtain replacements for the dead and wounded trojan was to proceed further south pears orders were to seek out and finally destroy an island base which if half of the intelligence gathered from the prisoners was to be trusted was the most important link in the supply chain for arms and powder for washington s armies at any other time pears would have welcomed it as the chance to use his ship as he had always wanted to make up for the humiliating setbacks and delays the months of patrol duty or the boredom of being at anchor in harbour the flagship resolute would be leaving them shortly and would return to sandy hook taking coutts impressive reports to the commanderinchief along with the prisoners and most of the badly wounded seamen and marines the youthful rearadmiral had taken the unprecedented step in pears view of appointing his flag captain lamb as acting officerincharge of the inshore squadron while he coutts transferred his flag to trojan to pursue the attack in the south coutts probably guessed that if he returned with his own flagship the commanderinchief in connivance with or under direct orders from the government expert sir george helpman would be ordered elsewhere before he could see his strategy brought to a successful end there was a tap at the door enter pears looked up watching bolithos face from the moment he walked into the great cabin his cocked hat tucked under one arm he looked older pears decided strained but more confident in some way there were lines at the corners of his mouth but the grey eyes were steady enough like those battered marines defiant pears noticed how he was holding his shoulder it was probably stinging badly from that sabres quick touch more so from the surgeons attentions but in his change of clothing bolitho appeared restored pears said good to see you in one piece he waved to a chair and waited for his clerk to leave youll hear soon enough were to stand further south to seek out and destroy an enemy supply headquarters there he grimaced french to all accounts bolitho sat down carefully his body clean his clothes fresh and strangely unfamiliar he was just beginning to feel the slackening of tension they had been good to him cairns the sage dalyell all of them and it felt free to be here in this groaning overcrowded hull he had no idea what was happening until now after the swift passage aboard the sloop the sadness of seeing more survivors die and be buried over the side he had found little time other than to scribble his own version of what had happened apart from a few quiet words with pears as he and the others had been helped aboard he had not spoken with him at all pears said the war makes great demands we were short of experienced officers now we are even shorter he stared at the empty table where the report had been lying good men killed others maimed for life half my marines gone in the blink of an eye and nozv with two officers taken prisoner to boot i am feeling like a clergyman with an empty church bolitho glanced at cairns but his face gave nothing away he had seen a brig speaking with the flagship that morning but he knew nothing further he asked two officers sir he must have missed something pears sighed young huyghue and now the flagship has told me about probyn he was apparently run down by a privateer one day after leaving you at fort exeter he watched bolithos face shortest command in naval history id imagine bolitho thought of the last time he had seen probyn angry triumphant bitter now it had all been taken away his hopes dashed all he could find in his heart was pity so pears voice brought him back with a jerk you are hereby appointed as second lieutenant of this ship my ship bolitho stared at him dazedly from fourth to second he had heard of it happening but had never expected it like this i that is thank you sir pears eyed him flatly i am glad you did not crow over probyns fate but i think i could have understood even that cairns nodded his lips parted in a rare smile congratulations pears waved his large hands save them for later and spare me mr cairns be about your affairs appoint another midshipman to huyghues duties and i suggest you consider the masters mate frowd as acting lieutenant a promising fellow i think the marine sentry opened the door gingerly beg pardon sir midshipman o th watch is ere it was little forbes somehow grown in stature to his title ssir mr dalyells respects and the flagship has just signalled us to heave to pears glanced at cairns see to it ill be up presently as the two lieutenants hurried after the midshipman bolitho asked why is this cairns stared at him you are out of touch dick he pointed to a petty officer with a flag neatly rolled under his arm today we will hoist the fag to our mizzen rearadmiral coutts is to be our very present help in trouble flagship acting cairns straightened his hat as they strode forward to the quarterdeck rail until coutts reaps his reward or lays his head on the block seamen were already running to their stations and bolitho had to make himself look at the massive trunk of the mainmast where he had once taken so many orders and goads from lieutenant sparke now he was second lieutenant with still two months between him and twentyone years he saw stockdale watching him and nodding it was thanks to stockdale and some missing faces that he was here at all all hands stand by to wear ship cairns voice found him with the speaking trumpet mr bolitho sir hurry those men at the braces they are like old cripples today bolitho touched his hat and kept his face straight across the scrambling seamen he saw quinn staring at him still uncertain at his new station he smiled at him trying to break the strain that was still there lively mr quinn he hesitated holding another memory take that mans name rivals the day after rearadmiral coutts had shifted his flag to trojan found bolitho pacing the quarterdeck keeping an eye on the forenoon watch and enjoying a fresh northwest breeze during the night the big ninetygun resolute with the frigate in company had vanished astern and would now be beating back towards new york the wind making every mile a battle of its own for the trojan things were different as if coutts unexpected arrival had brought a change of circumstances she must make a fine sight bolitho thought as his feet took him up and down the windward side without conscious effort in her fairweather canvas and under courses topsails and topgallants she was leaning her shoulder into the blue water throwing curtains of spray high above her beakhead the compass held steady at south southeast taking the powerful twodecker well away from the land down towards the long chain of islands which separated the atlantic from the caribbean the wind held back the heat and allowed the less badly wounded and injured men to move about the decks to find themselves again in their own way the remainder some of whom might die before they reached sandy hook had gone with the flagship as had the prisoners and coutts report of the attack only one captive remained aboard the frenchman contenay he took regular walks on deck without an escort and seemed completely at home in a kings ship bolitho had discovered that he still knew little about his own captain the brief moments of contact even warmth upon his return to the ship had been replaced by pears usual stem remote demeanour bolitho thought that the admirals presence had a lot to do with it coutts had appeared on deck this morning youthful relaxed and apparently interested he had strolled along the weather gangway pausing to watch the barebacked seamen at their work the carpenter with his crew the sailmaker and the cooper the ships tradesmen who daily changed a manofwar into a busy street he had spoken to the officers and some of the senior hands the sage had been impressed by his knowledge of arctic exploration and midshipman forbes reduced to blushing incoherence by a few wellaimed questions if he was troubled at the doubtful prospect of running another enemy supply cache to earth or at what the commanderinchief might say at his behaviour he certainly did not show it his plans he kept to himself and only ackerman his urbane flag lieutenant the one bolitho had seen in a cabin with a halfnaked woman and his personal clerk shared his confidences bolitho decided that would also irritate pears beyond measure a step fell on the deck nearby and cairns joined him at the rail his eyes taking in the working parties and the set of each sail with practised authority he said the admiral is with our captain i sense an air of grapeshot close by he turned and glanced meaningly at the poop skylight i was glad to leave the great men no news yet not much like desterre the admiral plays a taut hand he will rise like a comet he gestured at the deck or fall like one with coutts aboard cairns also faced changes the main result was that he shared more of his thoughts with his second lieutenant he added slowly the captain was wanting to know why this ship and not resolute was selected for the mission he smiled grimly the admiral explained as cool as you please that trojan is the faster vessel and her company deserving of reward for their work bolitho nodded i suppose so resolute has been out here far longer and has had few refits i believe she must be foul with weed cairns eyed him admiringly well make a politician of you yet he waved bolithos confusion aside you see the backhanded compliment coutts lays on treacle with talk of reward and the better ship for the task then in the next breath he gently reminds captain pears that his own flagship is in truth the more deserving bolitho pursed his lips that is clever it takes a rogue to recognize one dick in that case what is the real reason cairns frowned i suspect because he wants the flagship on her proper station that would make sense also he despatched vanquisher as escort and because she will be sorely needed elsewhere with the growth of privateers everywhere he dropped his voice as sambell masters mate of the watch strolled past with elaborate indifference on his tanned face he will want to follow this plan to the end reap the reward or cover the flaws as best he can he would not trust our captain to act alone and if things go disastrously badly then he will need a scapegoat other than his own flag captain cairns watched bolithos eyes i see that you see ill never understand this kind of reasoning cairns winked one day youll be teaching it more feet thudded on the sundried planking and bolitho saw pears and the sailing master leaving the chart room the latter carrying his leather satchel which he used to stow his navigational notes and instruments he looked much as usual turning briefly to examine the compass and the two helmsmen his eyes glittering in the sunlight beneath the great black brows pears by comparison appeared tired and in ill humour impatient to get whatever it was over and done with well soon know where this blessed spot is to be dick cairns loosened his neckcloth and sighed i hope it is not another fort exeter bolitho watched the first lieutenant continue on his daily rounds wondering if cairns was still brooding over the chances of leaving trojan and getting a ship of his own so far trojans lieutenants had not fared very well away from her protection sparke killed probyn a prisoner of war while bolitho had returned each time like a wayward son he saw quinn without his coat his shirt sticking to his back like another skin stepping between the busy sailmaker and his mates his face still pale and strained eighteen years old he looked far more bolitho thought the savage slash across his chest still troubled him you could see it in his walk and the tightness of his mouth a constant reminder of other things too that moment at the fort when his nerve had failed and by the guns when he had almost gone mad because of rowhursts scorn midshipman weston shouted suddenly spites signalling sir bolitho snatched a telescope from its rack and climbed swiftly into the weather shrouds it took a few moments to find the little sloopofwar their only companion on this adventure as cairns had described it the glass steadied on spites pale topgallant sails and the bright hoist of flags at her yards weston was saying from spite sail in sight to the southrd bolitho turned and looked at him weston was now the senior midshipman and probably smarting at pears advice to promote mr frowd to acting lieutenant instead of him advice from a captain was as good as a command bolitho felt almost sorry for weston almost ungainly overweight belligerent he would be a bad officer if he lived long enough very well keep watching spite ill not inform the captain yet bolitho continued his measured pacing the air seemed fresh but when you paused for too long you felt the suns power right enough his own shirt was sodden with sweat and the scar across his shoulder stung like a snakebite the sloops captain would be fretting and eager to be off on his own he thought right now he would be watching the unknown sail considering translating details into facts to relay as well as he could with his signal book for his admirals decision half an hour passed smoke gushed from the galley funnel and molesworth the purser and his clerk appeared en route for the spirit store to check the daily issue of rum or brandy some marines who had been drilling on the forecastle holding off imaginary boarders marched aft and returned their pikes there was also a small contingent of marines from the flagship to help fill the gaps until proper replacements could be obtained bolitho thought of all the little mounds on the island who would care weston called from spite sir disregard another small encounter most likely a dutchman on her lawful occasions anyway cunningham of the spite was satisfied in fact the strange sail had probably made off at full speed at the first sign of the sloops topsails it paid to be careful these days the margin between friend and foe changed too often for overconfidence stockdale crossed the quarterdeck on his way aft to the starboard battery as he passed he whispered admiral sir bolitho stiffened and turned as coutts walked out of the poop and into the glare bolitho touched his hat wondering briefly if weston had deliberately failed to warn him coutts smiled easily morning bolitho still on watch i see he had a pleasant even voice unaffected bolitho replied a moment more sir coutts took a glass and studied the faroff spite for several minutes good man cunningham should be posted soon with any luck bolitho said nothing but thought of cunninghams youth his luck with coutts blessing he would be made a full captain and with the war going as it was he would make post rank within three years safe from demotion on the road to higher things i can hear your mind at work bolitho coutts tossed the glass to weston again the action was casual yet timed to the second do not fret when your time arrives you will discover that a captains life is not all claret and prizemoney just for a moment his eyes hardened but the opportunities are there for those who will dare and who do not use their orders as substitutes for initiative bolitho said yes sir he did not know what coutts was implying that there was hope for him or that he was merely revealing his feelings for pears coutts shrugged his shoulders and added dine with me tonight i will have ackerman invite a few others once more bolitho discerned the youthful devilment and touch of steel in my quarters of course i feel certain the captain will not object he strolled away nodding to sambell and weston as if they were yokels on the village green the hands were already gathering on the upper gundeck for the afternoon watch and bolitho knew that dalyell would soon be here to relieve him unlike george probyn he was never late bolitho was confused by what he had heard he felt excited at coutts interest yet uneasy because of it it was like disloyalty to pears he smiled at his confusion pears probably didnt even like him so what was the matter dalyell appeared blinking in the sunlight some crumbs sticking to his coat the watch is aft sir bolitho eyed him gravely very well mr dalyell they both winked their faces hidden from the men their good spirits masked by the formality quinn on the larboard gangway watched the two lieutenants as they supervised the usual milling confusion of changing watches he had seen and had felt the ache of longing rising to match the pain of his wound bolitho had come out of it or if not had managed to put his memories behind him while all he could do was to measure each step calculate every action as he went along he kept telling himself that his momentary defiance his stand at the causeway had not been a fluke that he had failed once but had fought to retrieve and hold on to his pride again he felt that the ships company were watching him rating his confidence it was why he was lingering on the gangway waiting for bolitho before he went below for the noon meal bolitho was his strength his only chance if chance there was bolitho beckoned to him not hungry james and i am told that we have some fine beef today barely a year or so in the cask he clapped quinn on the shoulder make the best of it eh when quinn faced him he saw the sudden gravity in bolithos eyes and knew his words had nothing to do with food with her yards retrimmed and her great spread of canvas filling and banging in the wind trojan settled down on her new tack bolitho looked at cairns and touched his hat steady as she goes sir cairns nodded dismiss the watch below if you please as the seamen and the afterguard hurried thankfully below bolitho glanced quickly at pears who was with the admiral on the weather side of the quarterdeck it was another fiery sunset and against it the two men were in silhouette their faces hidden but there was no mistaking coutts irritation pears dogged stubbornness it all seemed a long long way from the relaxed supper in the great cabin coutts had kept the wit and conversation going with little pause except to recharge the glasses he had enthralled the young lieutenants with stories of intrigue and corruption in the new york military government of the grand houses in london the men and in many cases the ladies who held the reins of power once pears and the sailing master had concluded their calculations the ships destination and purpose had gone through each deck like a bolt of lightning there was a small island one of a group which lay in the passage between santa domingo and puerto rico avoided by all but the most experienced navigators it would seem to be the ideal place for transferring arms and powder to washington s growing fleet of supply vessels a s coutts had discussed his hopes for a swift ending of the mission bolitho and most of the others had sensed his eagerness his excitement at the prospect of a quick victory he had known that nothing could outpace him with a warning no horseman to carry the word that the british were coming not this time with the vast atlantic at his back the keeneyed spite sweeping well ahead coutts had had good reason for confidence but that had been fifteen days ago the delays had been unavoidable but nevertheless had put a marked strain on coutts and his officers several times trojan had been forced to lie to while spite made off under full sail to investigate a strange vessel and then beat the weary miles round again and make her report the wind too had backed and veered as bunce had predicted but had on the whole favoured their slow advance now with another sunset closing over the ship bolitho could sense a growing impatience even anger in coutts quick movements with head and hands once more spite had been sent ahead to discover if the tiny island was in fact the one described in pagets documents if it was cunningham was to put a boat ashore and if possible discover the strength of the enemy there if there was nothing at all he was to report back instantly either way he should have returned by now with darkness closing in with its usual swiftness it was very unlikely they would make contact until tomorrow another day more anxiety he stiffened and touched his hat as pears strode past his feet thudding loudly on the planking the slam of the chart room door was further evidence of his mood bolitho waited knowing coutts was going to speak with him a long day bolitho aye sir bolitho faced him trying to discover the mans feelings but the glass is steady we should be able to maintain our tack during the night coutts had not heard he rested his hands on the quarterdeck rail and stared down intently at the larboard battery of eighteenpounders he was without his hat and his hair was blowing across his forehead to make him appear even younger he asked quietly are you like the others do you think me a fool to press on with this mission a task which has no more substance than a scrap of paper i am only a lieutenant sir i was not aware of any doubt coutts laughed bitterly doubt god man theres a mountain of it bolitho waited feeling the admirals urgency his frustration coutts said when you reach flag rank you believe the world is yours you are only partly right i was a frigate captain and good at my work i know sir thank you coutts seemed surprised most people look at an admiral and seem to think he has never been anything else not an ordinary man at all he pointed vaguely through trojans black web of shrouds and stays but i believe the information is true otherwise i would not have risked my ships and my reputation i do not care what some softspoken official from london thinks of me i want to get this war over with more cards on our side than across the enemys table he was speaking quickly his hands moving eloquently to describe his feelings his fears each extra day brings more enemies against us ships to seek out and bring to battle we have no squadrons to spare but the enemys agility is such that we must match his every move no merchantman is safe without escort we have even been forced to send armed vessels to the davis strait to protect our whaling ships it is no time for the timid or the one who waits for the enemy to act first his terse emphatic manner of speaking of sharing his thoughts was something new to bolitho it was like seeing the world his world opening up to reach far beyond the ships hull and further still to every sea where britain s authority was being challenged i was wondering sir bolitho hesitated and then added why you did not request ships to be sent from antigua we have sailed four times the distance it would have taken the vessels which patrol from there coutts watched him his face in shadow saying nothing as if he were seeking some criticism in bolithos question then he said i could have sent spite to the admiral at antigua it would have been faster certainly he turned away but would they have acted i think not the affairs in new york and the threat of washington s armies seem a long way off in the caribbean only the commanderinchief could have made a request and with sir george helpman at his elbow i doubt he would have done more than enter it in his report for the admiralty bolitho understood it was one thing to hear of a victorious sea fight but nothing to match the sight of a beaten enemy being brought into port her flag beneath the british ensign coutts had evidence but that was insufficient too many men had died so far to warrant another haphazard scheme and with probyns prize being retaken by the enemy even the destruction of fort exeter might appear unimportant in faroff london but a sharp determined attack on a supply base right under the noses of the french who were flaunting their neutrality like a false flag might sway the balance especially if successfully completed before anyone could say no coutts seemed to read his thoughts remember this bolitho when you attain high rank never ask what you shall do the superior minds of admiralty tend to say no rather than encourage risk which might disturb their rarified existence even if you put your career and your life in jeopardy do as you believe is right and in the manner best for your country acting merely to placate your superiors is living a lie pears loomed through the dimming light and said harshly we will shorten sail in one hour mr bolitho but ill not lie to theres too much current for comfort hereabouts he looked at the admiral and added curtly we shall need to be on station for spites return coutts took pears arm and guided him away but not far enough for bolitho to miss the anger in his voice as he snapped by god you drive me too hard captain ill brook no insolence from you or anyone else dyou hear pears rumbled something but they were out of earshot bolitho saw couzens his face glowing in the compass light as he wrote his entry on the masters mates slate he seemed to symbolize something youth innocence or ignorance whichever way you looked at it they were all being carried forward to what might easily turn into a disaster coutts determination to win might soon give way to grasping straws pears mistrust of his superior could do for all of them just as easily bolitho was torn between them he admired coutts more than he could say yet he could understand pears more cautious approach the old and the new one man at the peak of his career whereas the admiral saw himself in a far greater role in the not too distant future he heard cairns on the upper gundeck speaking with tolcher the boatswain discussing tomorrows routine which could never be allowed to falter not in war or peace and no matter what kind of man walked the poop in lordly silence the ship came first tomorrow and all the other tomorrows painting to be done a man to be flogged another to be promoted rigging and spars to be overhauled it never ceased he remembered suddenly what probyn had said about taking full advantage of any chance which offered itself it was as if he had heard him speak aloud well cairns would be off the ship soon even pears could not refuse the next time bolitho sighed finding no comfort in the fact that in a matter of weeks or days he might be doing cairns work until pears could find himself a more experienced replacement cairns would make a good commander fair firm and intelligent a few more like him and there would be victories enough to satisfy everyone he thought bitterly midshipman couzens crossed the deck and asked will we see any more action sir bolitho considered it you know as much as i couzens stepped back to hide his expression he had seen bolitho discussing important matters with the admiral naturally he would not allow himself to share such privileged information with a mere midshipman but that bolitho knew that he knew was almost as good as sharing it he thought to everyones relief and no little surprise the spites topsails were reported by the masthead lookout within minutes of the first dawn light a tiny pale pyramid of sails drawing nearer and nearer with such maddening slowness that bolitho could sense the mood around him like a threat the decks were holystoned and the hands had their breakfast washed down with beer then they mustered for the many tasks throughout the ship and more than one petty officer had to use threats and brute force to stop his men from peering outboard to see how much nearer the sloop had come when she had beaten as close as she could manage she went about and lay hove to under trojans lee and a boat was dropped smartly in the water to carry cunningham in person to make his report bolitho stood with the side party to receive the youthful commander and did not envy him at all he had seen coutts pacing the poop and staring at the spite and had also felt pears harsh reprimands more than once during the morning about matters which at any other time he would have thought too trivial for comment but cunningham showed no anxiety as he climbed through the entry port and doffed his hat to the quarterdeck and saluting marines his eyes passed over bolitho without even a blink of recognition and then he strode aft to meet the captain later bolitho was summoned to the great cabin where he found cairns already waiting with the flag lieutenant he was not really surprised at being called aft it was customary for the first lieutenant and his immediate subordinate to be invited if only to listen when some important manoeuvre was to be undertaken they could hear pears voice from the dining cabin loud and angry and cunninghams clipped almost matter of fact tone as he explained something cairns looked at lieutenant ackerman they seem to be in a sour mood today ackerman kept his face blank the admiral will have his way a screen door was thrust open and the three other men entered the cabin abruptly like late arrivals in a theatre bolitho looked at coutts gone was the uncertainty he said lightly well gentlemen major pagets piece of intelligence has proved its worth he nodded to cunningham tell them cunningham explained how he had discovered the little island and under cover of darkness had put a landing party ashore it had taken longer than expected but after sighting woodsmoke he had guessed there were people there and every care had to be taken to avoid detection bolitho guessed he had been rehearsing that part on his way over in the boat to forestall any criticism which once made might damage his chances of reward he said there is a good anchorage not large but well concealed from seaward there are several huts and plenty of evidence that ships put in to load and unload cargo even to refit if need be pears asked who did you send bolitho waited seeing courts brief smile as the sloops commander replied just as sharply i went myself sir i was not mistaken about what i saw coutts asked what else cunningham was still glaring at pears a sizeable schooner is anchored there privateer no doubt of it they exchanged glances and coutts said shell be waiting for another vessel ill lay odds that there are enough weapons to supply two regiments pears persisted but suppose theres nothing but the schooner he looked round the cabin with something like dismay like taking a cudgel to crack a small egg the first part of the information is correct captain pears coutts was watching him compelling insisting why do you still doubt the rest this island is obviously chosen for its access from the leeward or windward islands from as far south as the spanish main it would present an excellent place for exchange even for rearming a merchant vessel and changing her to a privateer he did not conceal his impatience this time well cut them off at the roots for good he started to move around the cabin as if unable to hold his excitement in check think of it all we have to do is trap them in their anchorage and seize whatever vessel tries to enter the french will think again about allowing their people to be laid so low a setback like that would also give their spanish friends something to ponder on before they run like jackals to sample the spoils bolitho tried to see it like an outsider to avoid considering coutts as his superior someone he had shared a few weeks of his life with was this discovery really that important or was coutts merely blowing it up like a bladder to make it appear so a few huts and a schooner did not sound very promising and it was obvious from pears resentful expression that he thought much the same when he looked again the mood had changed once more foley the cabin servant was here and glasses of wine were already being handed round as if to celebrate cunninghams news coutts raised his glass ill give you a sentiment he was smiling broadly to a victory gentlemen and let us make it as painless as we can he had turned to look through the stern windows and did not see pears place his glass on the tray untouched bolitho tasted the wine but like the mood it was suddenly bitter no more pretence captains acomin sir the boatswains mates whisper seemed unnaturally loud in the dawn stillness bolitho turned seeking out pears heavy figure as he moved to the compass murmured something to sambell the masters mate and then walked forward to the quarterdeck rail bolitho knew better than to say anything at this point it was early in the morning and as trojan ploughed a steady southerly course under her topsails and jib it was as if they were in the middle of a tropical downpour the rain had burst over the slowmoving ship with the fierceness of a storm advancing out of the darkness to thunder across canvas and decks and pass just as quickly across the opposite beam but now an hour later the water still trickled and thudded from sails and rigging from the tops and down through the scuppers in miniature cascades when the sun rose there would be so much steam it would be like a fireship bolitho thought but pears knew all this and required no telling he had watched too many dawns on so many seas to need some lieutenant to remind him it was still quite dark on the upper gundeck but bolitho knew that every cannon was manned and cleared for action within minutes of the galley fires being doused it was an uncanny sinister feeling this great ship moving like a shadow into deeper darkness the sails shaking occasionally to a tired wind the wheel creaking as the helmsmen sought to hold her on course somewhere up ahead lay coutts objective the tiny remote island where he hoped no intended to find so much isla san bernardo little more than a dot on erasmus bunces chart it was said to have been the last resting place of some exclusive order of friars who had landed there over a hundred years ago bunce had remarked scathingly that they had probably arrived there by accident imagining it to be one of the mainlands that seemed likely bolitho thought the passage between santo domingo and puerto rico was some ninety miles wide a veritable ocean for some tiny inexperienced boat the friars had long passed into history massacred it was said by pirates by marooned captives by one of a dozen scourges which still ravaged the length and breadth of the rich caribbean spite was there now in position and ready to seal the anchorage cunningham must be rubbing his hands seeing the citation in the gazette as if it were already written bolitho heard pears moving towards him it was time he said wind holding steady sir nor by west he waited sensing the mans responsibility his doubt pears muttered very well mr bolitho we shall get light to see our way before long he raised his eyes to the mastheads to the great rectangles of pale canvas and the fading stars beyond bolitho followed his glance wondering how it must feel to command to carry the final reward or blame cairns seemed exactly ready for it whereas he felt unsure too far removed to understand what pears must be feeling cairns would be leaving soon he thought would that bring him closer to pears he doubted it cairns came now out of the darkness without causing a stir as he always did he touched his hat to pears bulky shape and to bolitho said ive just been round the lower gundeck not enough hands there but i doubt well be fighting a fleet today bolitho recalled coutts excitement over a single schooner and smiled with spites aid i expect well give a good account of ourselves pears turned with sudden anger get aloft mr bolitho use some of your wit on the masthead lookout and report what you see he swung away unless your sickness at heights still prevails his sarcasm was clearly heard by the helmsmen and the quarterdeck gun crews bolitho felt both surprised and embarrassed by the outburst and saw a marine turning away to hide a broad grin cairns said quietly which gives you some idea of his own anxiety dick that simple comment helped to steady bolitho as he climbed up the mainmast ratlines purposefully disdaining the lubbers hole at the maintop to climb out and cling with fingers and toes to the futtock shrouds his body arched above the deck far below his resentment at pears words enabled him to reach the topgallant mast without even a stab of nausea and when at last breathless and sweating he clambered on to the crosstrees beside the lookout he realized he had climbed that far with more haste than his usual caution the seaman said it be lightenin now zur be a fine old day im thinkin bolitho looked at him drawing deep breaths to recover himself he recognized the man an elderly topman named buller elderly by naval standards but he was probably no more than thirty worn out by the endless demands of wind and sea of fighting maddened canvas in the teeth of a gale fisting and kicking until every nail was almost torn from his hands and his muscles strained and ruptured beyond treatment he would soon be relegated to safer work on the forecastle or with the afterguard but the important thing to bolitho was that the man was untroubled not merely by height and discomfort but by the unexpected appearance of his second lieutenant bolitho thought of the marines grin that too was suddenly important there had been no malice no pleasure at seeing him trodden on by the captain he replied it will be hot anyway he pointed past the foremast strangely bare without its topgallant set at the yard dyou know these waters buller the man considered it cant say i do zur but then cant say i dont one place is like another to a sailorman he chuckled lesses let ashore o course bolitho thought of the brothel in new york the woman screaming obscenities in his face the dead girls breast still warm under his palm one place like another that was true enough he thought even the merchant seamen were the same every ship was the last one more voyage just enough pay and bounty saved and it would be used to buy a little alehouse a chandlery a smallholding from some country squire but it never seemed to happen unless the man was thrown on the beach in peacetime or rejected as a useless cripple the sea always won in the end the outboard end of the foretopsail yard paled slightly and when he twisted round bolitho saw the first hint of dawn he peered down and swallowed hard the deck darkly ribbed around by the upper batteries of guns seemed a mile beneath his dangling legs he would just have to put up with it if the hatred of heights had plagued him since his first ship when he had been twelve years old it was not likely to relent now bolitho felt the mast and its spars trembling and swaying beneath him he had gone to sea as a midshipman in the year trojan had been launched he had thought of it before but this morning up here and strangely isolated it seemed like an omen a warning he shivered he was getting as bad as quinn on the quarterdeck unaware or indifferent to his second lieutenants fancies pears paced back and forth across the damp planking cairns watched him and aft on the raised poop desterre stood with his arms crossed thinking of fort exeter of bolitho and of his dead marines a door opened and slammed and voices floated around the quarterdeck to announce the admirals arrival he was followed by his aide ackerman and even in the poor light looked alert and wide awake he paused near the wheel and spoke to bunce then with a nod to cairns said morning captain is everything ready cairns winced where pears was concerned things were always ready but pears sounded unruffled aye sir cleared for action but guns not loaded the slightest hint of dryness or run out coutts glanced at him i can see that he turned away spite must be in position now i suggest you set more sail captain the time for guessing is done cairns relayed the order and seconds later with the topmen rushing out along the upper yards and the wet canvas falling and then billowing sluggishly to the wind trojan tilted more steeply to the extra pressure ive been looking at the chart again coutts was half watching the activity above the deck there seems to be no other anchorage deep water to the southrd and a shoal or two against the shore cunningham put his landing party to the southrd a clever move he thinks things out that one pears dragged his eyes from the lithe topmen as they slithered down to the deck again he said it was the only place id have thought sir really coutts moved away with his flag lieutenant the cut well and truly driven home a few gulls dipped out of the darkness and circled the ship like pieces of spindrift they seemed to tell of the lands nearness and their almost disinterested attitude implied they had other sources of food close by from his dizzy perch bolitho watched the birds as they floated past him they reminded him of all those other times different landfalls but mostly of falmouth the little fishing villages which nestled in rocky clefts along the cornish coast the boats coming home the gulls screaming and mewing above them he came out of his thoughts as buller said ell zur spites well off station he showed some excitement for the first time therell be the devil to pay now bolitho found time to marvel that the seaman should care and be so accurate in his opinions coutts would be furious and it might take trojan a whole day to beat back to her original station and allow cunningham a second chance id better get down and tell the captain he was thinking aloud why had he mentioned it even thought of it had it been to stop another wave of frustration throughout the ship or merely to protect coutts credibility buller grunted she probably lost a man over the side bolitho did not answer he hoped cunningham was the kind of man who would waste valuable time to look for a man overboard but that was as far as it went he swung the telescope over his arm and pressed his shoulders against the shivering mast ill leave this with you buller when i go down give us a hail as soon as you can make out what shes up to he tried not to think of the drop to the deck how long it would take if the ship gave a lurch before he could use both hands to hold on again it was like looking through a dark bottle a few hints of whitecaps a glassiness on the seas face to show that dawn was nearby then he saw the pale squares of canvas barely clear as yet but rising from the darkness like a broken iceberg spite must have changed tack considerably he thought she was standing in well towards the hidden anchorage but she should have been miles nearer by now buller was right but there would be more than the devil to pay after this there would be he stiffened momentarily forgetting his precarious position wot is it zur buller had sensed something bolitho did not know what to say he was wrong of course had to be he held the swaying blur of sails in his lens and then straining every nerve until the wound on his forehead began to throb in time with his heartbeats he lowered the glass just a fraction still deep in shadow but it was there right enough he wanted it to be a dream a fault in the telescope but instead of spites rakish single deck there was something more solid deep and hard like a double reflection he thrust the glass at the seaman and then cupped his hands to his mouth deck there sail on the starboard bow he hesitated a few moments longer imagining the sudden tension and astonishment below him then ship o f the line buller exclaimed slowly you done it proper now zur bolitho was already slithering downwards groping for a backstay his eyes still holding that menacing outline coutts was waiting for him his head thrust forward as he asked are you certain pears strode past them his eyes everywhere as he prepared himself for the next vital hours only once did he glance at bolitho then to coutts he snapped hes certain sir cairns said quietly now heres a fine thing dick shell not be one of ours the admiral heard him and said curtly i dont care what she is mr cairns if she stands against us then damn your eyes shes an enemy in my book he peered after the captain and raised his voice have the guns loaded if you please he seemed to sense pears arguments from the opposite side of the deck and let me see what this ship of yours can do today along either side of the upper gundedc the crews threw themselves on their tackles and handspikes and manhandled their heavy cannon up to the closed ports bolitho stood by the boat tier straining his eyes through the gloom as he watched one gun captain after another raise his fist to signify he was loaded and ready midshipman huss peered over the main hatch and yelled lower gundeck ready sir bolitho pictured dalyell down there with thirty great thirtytwopounders like everyone else in the wardroom he had risen in rank but his experience had altered little bolitho knew that if and when trojan was required to give battle it would test everyone to the limit quinn crossed from the opposite side and asked what is going on dick he was almost knocked from his feet as some ships boys hurried aft with carriers of shot for the quarterdeck ninepounders bolitho looked up at the mainmast through the shaking rigging and spread canvas recalling his feelings such a short while back when he had watched the other ship through the telescope it had been fifteen minutes ago but the daylight seemed reluctant to reveal the newcomer and only the lookouts and perhaps the marines in the tops could see the ship properly he replied maybe that ship is here on passage for another port in the caribbean as he said it he knew he was deluding himself or perhaps trying to ease quinns anxiety the ship was no english manofwar every large vessel was being held within a squadron just in case france openly joined in the fight unlikely to be a spaniard either they usually used their larger menofwar to escort the rich treasure ships from the main through the pirateinfested waters and all the way to santa cruz and safety no it had to be a frenchman bolitho chilled with excitement he had seen french ships in plenty well designed and built they were said to be equally well manned he looked around the tiered boats and saw coutts hands behind his back speaking with pears and old bunce they all appeared calm enough although with pears you could never be sure it was strange to see the quarterdeck so busy in the first light crouching gun crews on either side and further aft standing against the hammock nettings desterres depleted ranks of marines near one battery of ninepounders he could see libby onetime signals midshipman now acting fifth lieutenant what must he be thinking bolitho wondered seventeen years old and yet if a blast of canister and grape raked the quarterdeck with its bloody furrows he might find himself in temporary command until someone else could reach him frowd was there too from masters mate to acting sixth lieutenant it was mad when you considered it he was even older than cairns by a year or two he was standing quite near sambell the other masters mate but that was all before sparke had been killed and probyn captured it had been jack and arthur now it was sir and mr sambell he heard cairns call let her fall off a point then later the helmsmans cry steady as she goes sir soueast by sou the braces were manned the yards trimmed for the slight alteration of course apart from the rustle and grumble of the sails the ships own private sounds there was silence bolitho pictured the chart and beyond the bows the island as it must appear to those who could see a headland sliding out towards the starboard bow around which lay the entrance to the anchorage where spite presumably was on station after all god she would get a surprise when the newcomer showed herself around the shoulder of land cunninghams lookouts would probably mistake her for the trojan deck there buller s hoarse voice tother ships shortenin sail zur someone said shes sighted spite tis my guess the larboard battery dipped over slightly to the pressure of wind in the sails and bolitho saw the tethered guns glint suddenly as the daylight lanced through the shrouds and halliards colour was returning to familiar things faces emerged as people features became expressions again here and there a man moved to adjust a gun tackle or push loose equipment away from a carriage or breech to brush hair from eyes to make sure a cutlass or boarding axe was within reach the petty officers and midshipmen stood out at intervals little blue and white markers in the chain of command far above the deck at the highest point the long masthead pendant licked out ahead like a scarlet serpent wind was holding steady bolitho thought even so there was no chance of heading off the other ship quinn whispered what will the admiral do what can he do were not at war with france midshipman forbes scurried along the deck skipping over tackles and flaked halliards like a rabbit he touched his hat and said breathlessly captains compliments sir and would you bring the french lieutenant aft bolitho nodded very well forbes was really enjoying himself aft with the mighty too excited and too young to see the teeth of danger quinn said ill fetch him bolitho shook his head smiling at the absurdity of it he had to bring the french officer because cairns was busy on the quarterdeck and everyone else was too junior etiquette would be observed even at the gates of hell he thought he found the frenchman on the orlop deck sitting with the surgeon outside the sickbay while thorndikes assistants laid out the makeshift table with his instruments thorndike asked irritably what the hell are we doing now he glared at his helpers wasting time and dirtying my things they must be short of work to do bolitho said to contenay the captain wishes to see you together they climbed up through the lower gundeck a place in almost complete darkness with every port shut and only the slowmatches glowing slightly in the tubs by each division of cannon contenay said there is trouble my friend a ship one of yours it was strange bolitho thought it was easier to speak with the frenchman than the surgeon mon diem contenay nodded to a marine sentry at the next hatchway and added i will have to watch my words i think on deck it was much brighter it seemed impossible that it had changed so much in the time to go to the orlop and back again on the quarterdeck bolitho announced msieu contenay sir pears glared at him over here he strode across to the nettings where coutts and the flag lieutenant were training telescopes towards the other ship bolitho stole a quick glance at her he had not been mistaken she made a proud sight leaning over closehauled on the starboard tack her topgallant sails and maincourse already brailed up to the yards her bilge clearly visible as she tacked towards the entrance the prisoner sir pears too was looking at the other vessel coutts lowered his glass and regarded the frenchman calmly ah yes the ship yonder msieu do you know her contenays mouth turned down as if he was about to refuse an answer then he shrugged and replied she is the argonaute ackerman nodded thought as much sir i saw her once off guadeloupe a seventyfour fine looking ship pears said heavily she too wears a rearadmirals flag he glanced questioningly at contenay he said it is true contreamiral andre lemercier coutts eyed him searchingly you were one of his officers am i right i am one of his officers msieu he looked towards the other twodecker it is all i am prepared or required to say pears exploded you mind your manners sir we dont need to be told more you were aiding the kings enemies abetting an unlawful rebellion and now you expect to be treated as an innocent bystander coutts seemed surprised at the outburst well said captain but i think the lieutenant is well aware of what he has done and where he stands bolitho watched fascinated hoping pears would not notice him and order him down to the gundeck a private drama which excluded everyone else and yet which could decide their future cairns said quietly here is a problem for the admiral dick is it a real stalemate or shall we force our views on the frenchman bolitho watched coutts youthful profile he was no doubt regretting his shift of flag now his ninetygun resolute would be more than a match for the french seventyfour trojan had no such advantage about the same size and with just two more guns than the argonaute she was undermanned and lacking experienced officers if contenay was typical of argonautes wardroom she would be an adversary to reckon with what the hell was cunningham doing a sloopofwar was far too frail to match iron with the line of battle but an extra show of strength no matter how small would be doubly welcome take the prisoner down i may require him presently coutts beckoned to desterre attend to it to bolitho he said warn the masthead to report what spite is doing the instant he sights her bolitho hurried to the quarterdeck ladder the masthead lookout like everyone else above deck was probably more interested in the french twodecker than in spite trojan maintained her set course every telescope trained on the other ship as she moved at right angles across the bows nearer and nearer to the headland coutts must be worried he could not anchor and if he continued past the entrance he would lose the windgage and it might take hours to beat back again if he stood out to sea the same must apply his only course was to follow the frenchman who obviously intended to ignore trojans intentions to treat her as if she did not exist the headland was sloping more quickly now to reveal the one on the opposite side of the entrance two green arms reaching out to receive them bolitho felt the mounting glare from the sun the sudden dryness in his throat as the lookout yelled deck there spites aground zur something like a sigh ran along the trojans decks of all the bad luck this was it cunningham must have misjudged his entrance or had been deceived by the currents it was humiliating enough for coutts for cunningham it must be the end of the world bolitho thought stockdale whispered the frenchie can do as e pleases now sir the anchorage was opening up with every dragging minute bolitho could see the sheltered water beyond the turbulence at the entrance spites three masts slightly angled and stiffly unmoving beyond her the deeper shadows and a schooner at anchor close inshore the lookout shouted theyre tryin to tow er off zur bolitho could not see without a telescope and like the seamen around him fretted and waited for more news from aloft cunningham had boats down and would probably lay out an anchor to kedge his ship free from the ground quinn asked what is the frenchman doing he sounded beside himself with worry hell no doubt anchor james he has beaten us to the island to attack him there would be a sure way of starting a war he looked away confused and bitter whatever they did no matter how right the cause fate seemed to be against them the argonaute was quite likely bringing another great cargo of ordnance and powder some to be loaded into the schooner more to be stacked in a safe hiding place to await the next privateer or transport contenay must have sailed from here more than a few times no wonder he found fort exeter without any trouble as if to bear out his ideas another lookout shouted wildly sail on the starboard quarter sir figures bustled across the quarterdeck sunlight glinting on raised telescopes as the lookout continued brig sir shes goin about bolitho looked at quinns pale features ill bet she is james just the sight of us will be enough she must have been coming here to collect her cargo from the french is there nothing we can do quinn looked up startled as buller yelled again deck there spites come off zur shes shakin out er topsls quinn gripped bolithos arm as the news brought a wild burst of cheering from the watching seamen and marines they looked aft as midshipman westons signals party burst into life and sent a hoist of bright flags flying to the yards bolitho nodded in the nick of time coutts had signalled spite to leave the anchorage and give chase even the delay at hoisting her boats would not mean much to cunningham with a following wind and his honour very much at stake he would overhaul and take the brig before noon and there was still the schooner if she was a privateer the french could not prevent coutts taking action against her if she attempted to leave he shaded his eyes seeing more sails breaking out from the sloops yards imagining the excitement and relief pushing all disappointment aside spites acknowledged sir midshipman couzens bounded past on some mission or other his freckled face alive with anticipation now its the frenchmans turn to be an onlooker sir bolitho turned sharply as the anchorage echoed violently to the crash of cannon fire he saw the gunsmoke hit the calm water and burst skyward eddying across the pale sunlight like a cloud everyone was yelling and shouting at once stricken by the unexpected turn of events spite was turning to one side still reeling from a savage broadside at extreme range like a hurricane the argonautes iron had ripped through her masts and rigging reducing her to an unmanageable wreck in seconds her foremast had gone and while they watched her maintopmast fell alongside in a welter of spray and tangled cordage spite stopped moving and bolitho guessed she had run aground again on an extension of the same sandbar seeing her go from movement to sudden stillness was like watching something beautiful die the argonaute had made certain the brig would not be captured and even now was coming about her long jib boom swinging through the smoke of her one murderous broadside quinn said in a choking voice god theyre coming out bolitho looked aft as cairns voice boomed through his speaking trumpet hands aloft and shorten sail mr tolcher rig your nets a bright scarlet ensign rose to the gaff and stockdale spat on his hands coutts had shown his colours he was going to fight nets were already being spread above the gundeck the men working without thought as they had so often at their drills bolitho watched the argonautes shape shortening as she completed her turn towards the entrance she too had run up her colours the white flag of france no more pretence or bluff later higher authorities might argue over excuses and deceptions but now today each captain had his own clear rtason to engage an enemy open your ports tackles squeaked and along either side a double line of port lids lifted in time with the lesser quarterdeck batteries run out bolitho drew a deep breath forcing himself to watch as his own guns trundled noisily to their ports thrusting out their black muzzles like snouts in the strengthening sunlight two ships of the line without aid not even a spectator to watch their ponderous strength as they manoeuvred towards each other in no haste and in total silence another glance aft and he saw coutts lifting his arms to allow the captains coxswain to buckle on his sword for him bolitho realized that coutts would never give in he dare not it must be victory today or nothing starboard battery stand by bolitho tugged out his hanger and pulled his hat over his eyes ready lads he glanced to left and right the familiar faces passing his vision merging then disappearing as he faced the enemy on the up roll somewhere a man started to cough violently another was pounding a slow desperate tattoo on the deck beside his gun fire a very high price as the upper battery followed instantly by the thirtytwopounders on the lower gundeck roared out in a full broadside trojan gave a tremendous shudder as if she would wrench herself apart even though every man had been expecting it the deafening crash of gunfire was beyond imagination the sound going on and on as each cannon hurled itself inboard on its tackles bolitho watched the dense smoke being forced downwind from the starboard bow and stared towards the french ship as the sea around her became a mass of leaping white feathers the argonaute was steering on a converging tack her yards braced hard round to carry her away from the nearest spit of land without a telescope it was impossible to see if they had hit her although with such a massive broadside they should have found some targets but trojan had fired at the first possible moment and bolitho estimated the range to be at least eight cables on either side of him the gun captains were yelling like demons the crews ramming home charges and fresh balls while others stood with handspikes in readiness to control their ponderous weapons it sounded blurred unreal and bolitho rubbed his ears rapidly to restore his hearing the deck tilted very slightly as pears ordered an alteration of course towards the other ship how invulnerable she looked with topsails and forecourse flapping to retain the wind the french captain was trying to gain searoom to escape the blanketing shelter of the land across his quarter what was he up to he wondered what motive did coutts i i opposite number have in mind perhaps he wished to draw trojan away from the island to allow the schooner time to escape or maybe having put the spite out of action all he wanted to do was slip away himself and avoid further conflict perhaps he had other orders to find a second rendezvous and unload his cargo without delay it was incredible that he could think at all he peered along the deck seeing the captains raise their fists their faces masked in concentration he looked aft ready sir again the senior midshipman of the lower gundeck bobbed through the hatch and yelled ready sir couzens went past at the run carrying a message from the forecastle to cairns on the quarterdeck as he passed midshipman huss he shouted you were slow that time they grinned at one another as if it were a huge game bolitho turned towards the enemy again nearer now her deck angled over to the wind the lines of guns shining in the sunlight like teeth he knew in his heart that the french admiral had no inten tion of telling his captain to haul off he was going to fight what the world said later mattered little out here justification wouldbe sought and found by both sides but the winner would have the real say in things the side of the french ship vanished in a writhing bank of smoke broken by darting orange tongues as she delivered her reply to trojans challenge bolitho gritted his teeth expecting to feel the hull quiver to the crash of the broadside but only a few balls hit the tumblehome while above the decks the air became alive with screaming shrieking chainshot bolitho saw the boatswains hastily spread nets jumping with fallen blocks and severed rigging and then a marine fell headlong from the maintop struck the gangway and vanished over the side without even a cry bolitho swallowed hard first blood he looked aft seeing pears watching the enemy while his hand rose level with his shoulder bolitho said quickly ready lads the captains arm fell and once more the air was blasted by the thunder of guns stop your vents sponge out loadr the seamen who had cursed their captain and officers as they had drilled again and again in every kind of condition went through the motions without even pausing to watch some of their companions hurrying aloft to make repairs bolitho saw the great rent in the maintopsail spreading and ripping as it was pushed by the wind and knew that the enemy was following a reguar french tactic to cripple the adversary first render her useless and impossible to handle so that she would fall downwind and present her stern to another murderous broadside cleared for action a ship of the line was open from bow to stern and a welltimed bombardment through the poop and counter could change the gundecks into a slaughterhouse the argonaute was showing some signs of damage too shotholes in her canvas and a savage gash in her larboard gangway where two balls had struck home together five cables just half a mile between them and both ships gathering speed as they thrust clear of the land again the writhing bank of smoke and once more the shriek of chainshot overhead it was unbelievable that no spar was hit but the terrible sound made more than one man gasp with alarm as he worked at his gun stockdaie paused at his efforts and shouted were holdin the wind sir his battered features were stained with smoke but he looked unbreakable on the uproll bolitho heard midshipman huss repeating the order to dalyell below fire the deck rebounded as if the ship was driving ashore and then there was a ragged cheer as the enemys maintopgallant mast swung wildly on its stays before breaking away and plunging down like a lance a lucky shot and nobody would ever know who had aimed it pears harsh voice carried easily above the squeak of gun trucks and the clatter of rammers well done trojans hit em again more cheers quenched by the enemys return fire the terrifying crash of iron smashing into the hull and through some of the gunports below bolitho winced wondering why the frenchman had changed his tactics he heard the rumble of a cannon careering across the lower deck the sudden lurch as it hit something solid men were yelling down there their voices strangely muffled like souls in torment the argonaute seemed to be gaining drawing slightly ahead so that her jib boom appeared to be touching trojans bowsprit with the advantage of wind and position pears would probably let his ship fall off then spread more sail and try to cross the enemys stern he heard cairns voice through his speaking trumpet hands aloft loose tgansls bolitho found himself nodding as if in agreement the ship was turning again just a few points while her topgallant sails flapped and then hardened at their yards he watched the other ship his eyes smarting in the smoke one giant arrowhead of blue water and both vessels aiming for some invisible mark which would bring them together fire the seamen leapt aside as their guns crashed inboard groping in the funnelling smoke to sponge out the muzzles before a packed charge was rammed home bolitho felt the hull quiver and realized the enemy had fired again and saw part of a gangway splinter apart as if under an invisible axe a seaman ran screaming and stumbling past his companion his hands clawing at his face a marine seized him and pushed him to a hatchway and others reached up to drag him below bolitho glanced at quinn and saw him retching the seaman had taken a giant wood splinter in his eye as big as a marlinespike the sharper crack of the quarterdeck ninepounders told him that their crews had at last been able to bring them to bear on the enemy the noise was growing and spreading as the two ships moved inexorably towards each other wood splinters fragments of cordage and yet another corpse joined the tangle on the nets and from below bolitho heard a man screaming like a tortured hare a quick glance aft again pears still there unmoving and grimfaced as he studied the enemy coutts apparently untroubled by the din of battle one foot on a bollard as he pointed to something on the frenchmans deck for ackermans benefit fire the guns were recoiling more unevenly now the crews were getting tired stunned by the constant thunder and crash of explosions bolitho made himself walk along the deck ducking to peer through each port as the men hauled their guns back in readiness to fire a small world a square of hazy sunlight in which each crew saw just a portion of the enemy he felt unsteady his gait jerky as he moved behind them his face was stiff with strain and he imagined he must look halfway between laughing and squinting from shock stockdale glanced round at him and nodded another man bolitho recognized him as moffitt waved his hand and shouted hot work sir more powerful thuds into the lower hull and then a column of black smoke through an open hatch to bring a chorus of shouts and cries of alarm but the smoke was quickly brought under control and bolitho guessed that dalyells men had been ready for such an emergency cease firing as the men stood back from their smoking guns bolitho thought the silence almost as painful as the noise the enemy had moved further across the bows so that it was pointless to try to hit her cairns shouted put some men to larboard he gestured with his trumpet we will engage him as we cross his stern bolitho saw petty officers pushing dazed men across to the opposite side to help the depleted crews there pears had timed it well with the slight change of tack and extra canvas to give her more speed trojan would sweep across the enemys wake and pour a broadside gun by gun the length of her hull even if she were not dismasted she would be too crippled to withstand the next encounter he shouted ready james again he felt his jaw locked in a wild grin yours is the honour this time a gun captain touched quinns arm as he hurried past well show em sir hands to the braces there bolitho swung round as cairns voice echoed from the quarterdeck stockdale gasped the frenchie s luffed by god bolitho watched his body like ice seeing the argonaute swinging steadily up into the wind her reduced sails almost aback as she turned to face her enemy it was all happening in minutes yet bolitho could still find time for admiration at the superb seamanship and timing round and further still so that when she had finished her manoeuvre she would be on the reverse tack while trojan was still struggling to slow her advance hands aloft take in the tgansls masts and spars shook and creaked violently as the helm was put over but it was all taking too long as men ran wildly back to the starboard battery bolitho saw the enemys side belch smoke and fire felt the ship stagger as a carefully timed broadside smashed into the side from bowsprit to quarterdeck because of the angle many of the shots did little damage but others which burst through gunports or smashed through the flimsy defences of gangways and nettings caused terrible havoc three guns were upended their crews either crushed or hurled aside like rubbish and bolitho heard the splintering bang of more balls ripping through the boat tier and sending a wave of splinters across the opposite side like tiny arrows men were falling and stumbling everywhere and when bolitho glanced at his legs he saw they were bloody from the carnage at the nearest gun a great chorus of voices made him turn in time to see the foretopgallant mast fall across the bows and plunge over the side taking with it a writhing trail of rigging like maddened snakes spar and canvas and two screaming seamen momentarily out of control trojan swung drunkenly away from her enemy while all the time as her jubilant crews reloaded argonaute continued to go about until she had completed one great circle then as she settled down on a parallel course but slightly ahead of the trojan she opened fire with her sternmost guns blinded by smoke and fighting to free themselves from the mass of tangled rigging the forward gun crews aboard the trojan were able to return only half their shots bolitho found himself striding up and down yelling meaningless words until he was hoarse raw with the stench of battle around him men were fighting back dying or sprawled in the bloody attitudes of death others hurried past following the boatswain and his mates axes shining in the smoky glare to hack the wreckage away before it swung the ship stem on towards those merciless guns and aft his face like stone pears watched all of it giving his orders not even flinching as splinters whipped past him to bring down more of the crouching gun crews midshipman huss appeared on deck his eyes white with fear he saw bolitho and shouted frantically mr dalyells fallen sir i i cant find he spun round his face gaping with astonishment and freezing there as he pitched forward at bolithos feet bolitho shouted get below james take command of the lower gundeck but quinn was staring transfixed at the midshipman blood was pouring from a great hole in his back but one hand still moved as if it and nothing else was holding on to life a seaman turned the boy over and rasped done for sir did you hear bolitho gripped quinns arm huss and all else forgotten get below quinn half turned his eyes widening as more cries and screams came up from the other gundeck he stammered cant cant do it his head fell forward and bolitho saw tears running down his face cutting pale furrows through the grime of gunsmoke an unfamiliar voice snapped ill go it was ackerman the immaculate flag lieutenant i can manage he stared at quinn as if he could not believe what he saw the admiral sent me bolitho peered aft shocked by quinns collapse stunned by the horror and bloody shambles all around him through the drifting smoke and dangling creeper of severed rigging their eyes met then coutts gave a slight wave and what could have been a shrug the deck shivered and bolitho knew that the broken mast had been hacked free trojan was turning to windward laying her enemy in the sights again seemingly unreachable and beyond hurt fire the men sprang back groping for their rammers and spikes cursing and cheering like mad things from bedlam quinn stood as before oblivious to the hiss of iron overhead to the crawling wounded to the danger of his position as the enemys mizzen and then mainmast towered high above the nettings fifty yards certainly no more bolitho thought wildly both ships were firing blindly through the churning smoke which was trapped between them as if to cushion the hammer blows a seaman ran from his gun crazed by the din and slaughter trying to reach a hatchway to go deeper and deeper until he found the keel like a terrified animal going to ground a marine sentry raised his musket as if to club him down but let it fall as if he too was past reason and hope couzens was tugging bolithos sleeve his round face screwed up as if to shut out the awful sights yes bolitho had no idea how long he had been there what is it the midshipman tore his eyes from husss corpse the captain says that the enemy intends to board us he stared at quinn you are to take charge forrard he showed his old stubbornness i will assist bolitho gripped his shoulder through the thin blue coat the boys body was hot as if burning with fever go and get some men from below as the boy made to run he called walk mr couzens show the people how calm you are he forced a grin no matter how you may feel he turned back to the guns astounded he could speak like that when at any second he would be dead worse he might be lying pinned on the surgeons table waiting for the first touch of his knife he watched the set of the enemys yards the way the angle was more acute as both ships idled closer together the guns showed no sign of lessening even though they were firing at pointblank range some hurling blazing wads through the smoke which were almost as much danger as the balls there were new sounds now the distant crack of muskets the thuds of shots hitting deck and gangway or ripping harmlessly into the packed hammock nettings from the maintop he heard the bark of a swivel and saw a cluster of marksmen drop from the enemys mizzentop swept aside like dead fruit by a hail of canister individual faces stood out on the argonautes decks and he saw a petty officer pointing him out to another sharpshooter on the gangway but he was felled by one of desterres marines even as he raised his musket to shoot he heard men scrambling up from the lower gundeck the rasp of steel as they seized their cutlasses balleine the boatswains mate stood by the mainmast rack issuing the boarding pikes to anyone who came near him we will touch bow to bow bolitho had spoken aloud without knowing it not much time he drew his curved hanger and waved it over his head clear the larboard battery come with me a single ball crashed through an open port and beheaded a seaman even as he ran to obey for a few moments the headless corpse stood stockstill as if undecided what to do then it fell and was forgotten as swearing and cheering the seamen dashed towards the forecastle nothing in their minds but the towering bank of pockmarked sails alongside the crimson stab of musketfire bolitho stared watching the other ships great bowsprit and jib boom poking through the smoke thrusting above the forecastle and beakhead as if nothing could stop it there were men already there firing down at trojans deck brandishing their weapons while beneath them their fierceeyed figurehead watched the scene with incredible menace then with a violent shudder both hulls ground together harking and stabbing trojans men swarmed to repel boarders and from aft desterres men kept up a withering fire on the enemys quarterdeck and poop bolitho jumped over a fallen seaman and yelled here they come a french seaman tried to scramble on to the cathead but a blow with a belaying pin knocked him aside and a lunge from a pike sent him down between the hulls bolitho found himself face to face with a young lieutenant his swordarm came up the two blades circled warily and with care despite the surging press of fighting figures all around the french officer lunged his eyes widening with fear as bolitho sidestepped and knocked his arm aside with his hanger seeing the sleeve open up the blood spurting out like paint bolitho hesitated and then hacked him across the collarbone seeing him die before he hit the water alongside more men were hurrying to his aid but when he twisted his head he saw quinn standing by his guns as before as if he would never move again smoke swirled and then enveloped the gasping and struggling men and bolitho realized that the wind was strengthening pushing the ships along in a terrible embrace another figure blocked his path and again the clang of steel dominated everything else he watched the mans face detached without feeling meeting each thrust testing his strength expecting an agonizing blade through his stomach if he lost his balance there were others beside him raye of the marines joby scales the carpenter wielding a great hammer varlo the seaman who had been crossed in love dunwoody the millers son and of course stockdale whose cutlass was taking a terrible toll something struck him on the head and he felt blood running down his neck but the pain only helped to tighten his guard to make him examine his enemys moves like an onlooker a dying seaman fell whimpering against the other man making him dart a quick glance to his right just a second no more than a flash of his eyes in the misty sunlight it was enough and bolitho leapt over the corpse his hanger still red as he rallied his men around the forecastle he could not even remember driving the blade into flesh and bone somebody slipped in a pool of blood and crashed into his spine he fell sprawling only retaining his hanger because of the lanyard around his wrist as he struggled to rise he saw with amazement that there was a glint of water below him and as he stared down he could see it was widening the ships were drifting apart the french boarders had realized it too and while some tried to climb back on to the overlapping bowsprit others made to jump only to fall headlong into the sea to join the bobbing litter of corpses and frantic swimmers a few threw up their hands in surrender but when a marine was shot dead by an enemy marksman they too were driven bodily over the side bolitho felt the strength ebbing out of him and he had to hold on to the bulwark for support a few guns were still firing haphazardly through the smoke but it was over the argonautes sails were coming about and very slowly she began to stand away her stern turning towards trojans poop like the hinges of a gate bolitho realized that he was on his back looking at the sky which seemed unnaturally clear and blue so clean too far away his thoughts were drifting like the smoke and the two badly mauled ships a shadow loomed over him and he realized that stockdaie was kneeling beside him his battered face lined with anxiety he tried to tell him he was all right that he was resting a voice shouted take mr bolitho to the orlop at once then he did try to protest but the effort was too much and with it came the darkness bolitho opened his eyes and blinked rapidly to clear his vision as the pain returned to his head he realized he was down on the orlop deck a place of semidarkness at the best of times now with deckhead lanterns swinging to the ships heavy motion and others being carried this way and that it was like looking at hell he was propped against trojans great timbers and through his shirt he could feel the hull working through a deep swell as his eyes grew used to the gloom he saw that the whole area from the sickbay to the hanging magazine was filled with men some lay quite still and were probably dead others rocked back and forth crouching like terrified animals as they nursed their private pain in the centre of the deck directly below the largest number of lanterns thorndike and his assistants worked in grim silence on an unconscious seaman while one of the surgeons loblolly boys dashed away with a bucket from which protruded an amputated arm bolitho reached up and felt his head it was crusted in blood and there was a lump like an egg he felt the relief welling from his taut stomach muscles like a flood stinging the back of his eyes so that lie could feel tears running down his face as another figure was carried to the table and stripped of his blackened clothing bolitho felt ashamed he had been terrified of what would happen but compared with the man who was whimpering and pleading with the surgeon he was unhurt please sir the man was sobbing uncontrollably so that even some of the other wounded forgot their pain and watched thorndike turned from a locker wiping his mouth he looked like a stranger and his hands like his long apron were red with blood i am sorry thorndike nodded to his assistant and bolitho saw the injured mans shattered leg for the first time and realized it was one of his own gun crews who had been pinned under a cannon he was still pleading not me leg sir a bottle was thrust to his lips and as he let his head fall back choking and gasping on neat rum a leather strap was put between his teeth bolitho saw the glitter of the knife and turned his face away it was wrong for a man to suffer like this to scream and choke on his own vomit while his stricken messmates watched in silence thorndike snapped too late take him on deck he reached out for his bottle again nextv a seaman was kneeling beside bolitho while some wood splinters were plucked from his back it was the masthead lookout buller he winced and then said reckon im a lucky one today zur that was all he said but it spoke volumes you all right sir it was midshipman couzens i was sent by the first lieutenant he flinched as someone started to scream oh god sir bolitho reached out help me up must get out of here he staggered to his feet and clung to the boys shoulder like a drunken sailor ill not forget this ever stockdale strode to meet them ducking beneath the deckhead beams his face creased with worry let me take him the journey to the upper deck was in itself another part of the nightmare the lower gundeck was still wreathed in trapped smoke the redpainted sides only hiding some of the battles agony he saw lieutenant dalyell with his two remaining midshipmen lunn and burslem discussing with the gun captains what had to be done dalyell saw bolitho and hurried over his open face filled with obvious pleasure thank god dick i had heard you were done for bolitho tried to smile but the pain in his skull stopped it i heard much the same about you aye a gun exploded i was stunned by the blast but for the men nearby i would be dead he shook his head poor huss he was a brave lad bolitho nodded slowly they had begun with nine midshipmen one promoted one taken prisoner and now one killed the midshipmans berth would be a sad place after this dalyell looked away so much for the admirals strategy a very high price for what we have done bolitho continued with his two helpers to the upper gundeck and stood for several moments sucking in the air and looking up at the clear sky above the severed topgallant mast men were being carried below and bolitho wondered how thorndike could go on cutting sawing and stitching he shuddered violently others were being dragged beneath the gangwayslimp and without identity to await the sailmaker and his mates who would sew them up in their hammocks for the last journey how far had bunce said it was one thousand five hundred fathoms hereabouts a long dark passage perhaps there was peace there he shook himself and winced at the stabbing pain he was getting hazy again it had to stop cairns said good to see you dick he looked tired and drained i could do with some help he hesitated if you feel up to it bolitho nodded moved that this man who carried so much had found time to ask about him and how he was faring on the orlop it will be good for me he made himself look along the torn and splintered deck where he had been such a short while ago upended guns great coils of fallen cordage and ripped canvas men picking their way amongst it like survivors from a shipwreck how could any man have lived through it to see such chaos made it seem impossible ile asked how is james cairns eyes were bleak the fourth lieutenant is alive i believe he patted bolithos arm i must be off you remain here and assist the boatswain bolitho crossed to the first division of eighteenpounders where he had been for most of the battle he could see the argonaute stern on and a good three miles downwind even if they could complete some temporary repairs in time they would not catch the frenchman now stockdale spoke for both of them anyways we beat em off shorthanded though we was sir we gave as good as we got couzens said huskily but the brig got away the sailing master towered above the quarterdeck rail and boomed come now mr bolitho this will not do i have a ship to steer a course to lay to do that i need sails and more halliards than i can see at present his black brows descended over his deepset eyes and he added you did well today i saw he nodded firmly as if he had said far too much for the rest of the day the ships company went about the work of putting trojan to rights as best they could the dead were buried and the wounded made as comfortable as possible samuel pinhorn the sailmaker had kept plenty of spare canvas on deck knowing that more would die before reaching port it was amazing that men could work after what they had been through perhaps it was work which saved them for no ship can sail without care and constant attention a jurymast was hoisted to replace the topgallant and as the seamen bustled far above the deck the cordage dangled down on either side like weed hammers and saws tar and paint needles and twine the only thing which happened to make them stop to stare abeam and remember was the sudden appearance of the schooner from the anchorage at isla san bernardo spite had been abandoned as a hopeless wreck then set alight to make sure no pirate or privateer would lay hands on her in a short and savage boat action cunningham attacked and took the schooner the one reward of the whole operation but bolitho was certain of one thing the prize no matter what secrets she disclosed would not remove the ache from cunninghams heart as he had ordered his men to abandon his own command at sunset cairns ordered a halt a double ration of spirits was issued to all hands and after shortening sail for the night trojan was content to reflect and lick her wounds bolitho received a summons to the great cabin without curiosity like most of the company he was drained and too shocked to care but as he made his way aft ducking his head beneath the poop he heard pears voice clearly audible through two sets of screen doors i know your father otherwise i would have you stripped of your appointment at this very moment bolitho hesitated outside the door feeling the sentrys eyes watching him it was quinn of course poor broken quinn he could still see him standing on the gundeck amongst the litter of dead and dying stricken unable to think or move the sentry looked at him sir bolitho nodded wearily and the marine banged his musket on the deck and called second lieutenant sir the door opened and teakle the clerk ushered bolitho inside he had a bandage on his wrist and looked very shaken bolitho wondered why he had never thought of a clerk being in as much danger as any of them quinn came from the cabin his face as white as a sheet he saw bolitho and looked as if he were about to speak then with a gasp he blundered past him into the shadows pears strode to meet bolitho ah not too knocked about eh he was restless off balance bolitho replied i was fortunate sir indeed you were pears looked round as coutts came from the adjoining cabin the admiral said i will be leaving at daylight and transferring to the prize bolitho i intend to head for antigua and take passage from there in a courier brig or one of the frigates bolitho looked at him trying to guess where it was leading he could feel the tension between the two men see the bitterness in pears eyes like physical pain coutts added calmly trojan will follow of course full repairs can be carried out there before she returns to the squadron i will ensure that the people at antigua give full attention to it and to obtaining replacements for pears interrupted bluntly for all the poor devils who died today coutts flushed but turned to bolitho again i have watched you you are the right stuff with the ability and the steel to lead men bolitho glanced at pears grim features and was shocked to see his expression like a man under sentence thank you sir therefore the word hung in the damp air i am offering you a new appointment as soon as you reach antigua with me bolitho stared realizing what it would do to pears with coutts back in antigua or probably in new york before trojan reached harbour pears would have nobody to speak for him but cairns a scapegoat someone to use to cover coutts costly exercise he was surprised that he could answer without hesitation it was all he wanted the one opportunity to transfer to another ship smaller faster like vanquisher or one of the other frigates with coutts patronage it would be the best chance he would ever get i thank you sir he looked at pears but my appointment is under captain pears i would wish it to remain so coutts regarded him curiously what an odd fellow you are bolitho your sentimentality will do for you one day he nodded curt final good evening in a daze bolitho went down a ladder and found himself in the wardroom remarkably untouched by the battle cairns followed him a few moments later and took his arm beckoning to the wardroom servant as he did so mackenzie you rogue some good brandy for this officer desterre appeared with his lieutenant and asked what is happening cairns sat down opposite bolitho and watched him intently it has happened gentlemen i have just witnessed a misguided but honest man doing something which was right bolitho flushed i i didnt know cairns took a bottle from mackenzie and smiled sadly i was outside peering through a crack like a schoolboy lie became suddenly serious that was a fine thing you did just now hell never thank you for it in as many words cairns raised his glass but i know him better than most you gave him something to make up for what coutts did to his ship bolitho thought of the schooner steering somewhere under trojans lee tomorrow she would leave them and take with her his chance of promotion he got another surprise he no longer cared another chance bolitho stood in the shadow of the mainmasts massive trunk and watched the busy activity around the ship it was october and for two months trojan had been here in english harbour antigua headquarters of the caribbean squadrons there were plenty of ships needing repairs and overhaul but mostly because of the wear and tear of storms or old age trojans arrival had aroused plenty of excitement and curiosity as captain pears had brought her to rest with the ensign at halfmast for her many dead now looking around the taut rigging and shrouds the neatly furled sails and skilfully repaired decks it was hard to picture the battle which had raged here he shaded his eyes to look at the shore scattered white buildings the familiar landfall of monks hill a busy procession of boats yard boys water lighters and the inevitable traders offering doubtful wares to the inexperienced and the foolish there had been a lot of changes not only to the ship herself new faces from other vessels from england from ports up and down the caribbean all to be tested and worked into the rest of the company a lieutenant john pointer had arrived aboard and because of his seniority had been made fourth lieutenant as bolitho had once been a cheerful young man with a round yorkshire dialect he seemed competent and willing to learn young midshipman libby stripped of his acting rank had gone to the flagship on one fine morning to face his examination for lieutenant he had passed with honour although he was the only one to show surprise at the verdict now he had gone appointed to another twodecker without delay but his parting had been a sad occasion both for him and the other midshipmen there were two more of those as well fresh from england and in bunces view less than useless of coutts they had heard nothing other than he had returned to new york promotion or disgrace seemed unimportant in the face of the latest news which even now seemed impossible to grasp in america general burgoyne who had been operating with some success from canada in the earlier stages of the revolution had been directed to take control of the hudson river he had advanced with his usual determination with some seven thousand troops expecting to be reinforced by the new york regiments someone had decided that there were insufficient soldiers in new york and barely enough to defend the city general burgoyne had waited in vain and this month had surrendered with all his men at saratoga there had been news of greater activity by french privateers encouraged and with good cause by the military defeat trojan would soon be ready to rejoin the fight but bolitho could see no way of retaining a grasp of a rebellious colony even if britain commanded the sealanes and with more french involvement that was no certainty either bolitho moved restlessly to the netting to watch another trading boat passing trojans glittering reflection it was hot but after the earlier months and the torrential tropical downpours it seemed almost cool he glanced aft at the flag which hung so limp and still it would be even hotter in the great cabin he tried to see quinn as a stranger someone he had just met but he kept recalling him as the most junior lieutenant when he had just come aboard eighteen years old and straight from the midshipmans berth beginning as libby was now for himself then again gasping in agony from the great slash across his chest after all his quiet confidence his determination to be a sea officer when his wealthy father wished otherwise these last weeks must have been hell for him he had been released from his duties and even if he retained his appointment would now be junior to the new officer pointer because of the activity within the local squadrons and the general air of expectancy of a french intervention in strength uinns troubles had taken a low position in priorities now in this october of he was being examined by a board of inquiry in pears cabin just one short step from a court martial bolitho looked at the other ships so still in the sheltered harbour each paired above her image in the water awnings spread ports open to catch the slightest breeze very soon these vessels and more beside would endure what trojan had suffered under argonautes guns they would not be fighting brave but untrained rebels but the flower of france discipline would be tightened failure not tolerated it made quinns chances seem very slim he turned as lieutenant arthur frowd officer of the watch crossed the deck to join him like libby he had gained his coveted promotion and now awaited an appointment to a more suitable ship the most junior lieutenant he was still the oldest in years in his bright new uniform with his hair neatly tied to the nape of his neck he looked as good as any captain bolitho thought admiringly frowd said uneasily what dyou reckon about him he did not even mention quinn by name like a lot of other people he was probably afraid of being connected with him in any way im not certain bolitho fidgeted with his sword hilt wondering why it was taking so long cairns had gone aft as had desterre and bunce it was a hateful business like seeing the court martial jack on a manofwar the ritualistic procession of boats for a flogging around the fleet or a hanging he said i was afraid so it must have been a lot worse for him but frowd said vehemently but aye sir that small word makes a world of difference any common seaman would have been run up to the mainyard by now bolitho said nothing and waited for frowd to walk away to speak with the guardboat alongside frowd did not understand how could he to reach a lieutenants rank was hard enough for any youth by way of the lower deck it was much much harder and frowd had done it with his own sweat and little education he would see quinns failure as a betrayal rather than a weakness sergeant shears marched across the quarterdeck and touched his hat smartly bolitho looked at him me yessir shears glanced quickly at the men on watch the sideboys and the sentry not doin very well sir he dropped his voice to a whisper my captain give is evidence and one of the board says all aughtylike wot does a marine know about sea officers shears sounded outraged never card the like sir bolitho walked quickly aft gripping his sword tightly to prepare himself pears day cabin had been cleared the furniture replaced by a bare table at which were seated three captains there were others present too seated on chairs to either side mostly strangers to bolitho but he saw the earlier witnesses cairns desterre and alone with his hands folded in his lap captain pears the senior captain looked at him coolly mr bolitho bolitho tucked his hat under his arm and said aye sir second lieutenant the captain to the right a sharpfaced man with very thin lips asked were you present on deck when the events which led to this investigation took place bolitho saw the clerks pen poised above his pile of papers then for the first time he looked at quinn he was standing very stiny by the door of the dining cabin he looked as if he was finding it hard to breathe i was sir how absurd he thought they all knew exactly where everyone was probably right down to the ships cook i was in charge of the upper gundeck when we engaged the enemy to starboard the president of the court a captain bolitho remembered seeing in new york said dryly forget the formality if you can you are not on trial here he glanced at the captain with the thin lips it would do well to remember that his level gaze returned to bolitho what did you see bolitho could feel those behind him watching and waiting if only he knew what had been said already especially by the captain he cleared his throat wed not been expecting to fight sir but the argonaute had dismasted spite without any challenge or warning we had no option we the question was mild bolitho flushed and felt clumsy under the three pairs of eyes i heard the admiral express the view that we should fight if need be sir ah a small smile continue it was a bloody battle sir and we were sorely short of good hands even before it began he sensed the scorn in the thinlipped captains eyes and added quietly that was not meant as an excuse sir had you seen the way our people fought and died that day you would have known my meaning he could sense the silence like the terrible calm before a hurricane but he could not stop now what did they know about it they had probably never had to fight with such inexperienced officers and so few seasoned hands he thought of the man on the surgeons table pleading for his leg the marine who had been the first to die falling from the top to drift in the sea alone there were so many of them too many he said the frenchman came up to us and drove hard alongside they boarded or tried to he faltered seeing the french lieutenant falling between the grinding hulls his own sword red with blood but we fought them off he turned and looked directly at quinns stricken face mr quinn was assisting me up to that moment and stood under the enemys fire until action was broken off the president added then you were taken below correct he looked at bolithos terse features and asked how old are you twentyone sir this month he thought he heard someone snigger behind him and you entered the navy at the age of twelve i understand as did most of us in addition you come from a distinguished seafaring family his voice hardened suddenly in your experience as a kings officer mr bolitho did you at any time during this series of unfortunate events consider that y quinns behaviour was lacking in skill or courage bolitho replied quietly in my opinion sir he got no further the president persisted in your experience bolitho felt desperate trapped i do not know how to answer sir he expected to be rebuked even dismissed from the court but the president merely asked he was your friend is that it bolitho looked across at quinn suddenly hating the three captains the gaping spectators everything he said firmly he is my friend sir he heard the murmur of surprise and expectancy but added maybe he was afraid but so was i as were many more to deny it would be foolish before he turned back to the table he saw quinn lift his chin with pathetic defiance bolitho said his record has been a good one and i have had him with me on several difficult missions he has been badly wounded and the thinlipped captain leaned over to look at his corn panions i think we have heard enough this witness has little to add he glanced at bolitho i understand that you declined a new appointment which rearadmiral coutts was prepared to offer tell me was that lack of ambition on your part the president frowned and then turned as feet moved heavily on the deck without looking bolitho knew it was pears the president asked you wished to say something captain pears the familiar harsh voice was remarkably calm the last question i feel i should answer it was not lack of ambition sir in my family we call it loyalty dammit i the president held up his hand to still the sudden excitement quite so he looked sadly at bolitho however i am afraid that in the case of lieutenant quinn loyalty is not enough he stood up and throughout the cabin the spectators and witnesses lurched to their feet the inquiry is adjourned outside on the sunlit quarterdeck bolitho waited for the visitors to leave dalyell and the new lieutenant pointer were with him when quinn appeared on deck he crossed over to him and murmured thank you for what you said dick bolitho shrugged it didnt seem to help much dalyell said quietly you have more courage than i dick that coldeyed captain scared hell out of me just looking at him quinn said anyway the president was right i could not move it was like being dead unable to help he saw cairns approaching and added quickly i shall go to my cabin the first lieutenant leaned over the rail and watched the boats alongside then he said i hope we can get back to sea soon the others moved away and bolitho asked did the captain kill quinns chances neil cairns eyed him thoughtfully no i did i witnessed it but was less involved than you suppose you had been marked down by one of the frenchmans sharpshooters or broken by chainshot do you think quinn could have held the focsle and driven off the boarders he smiled gravely and gripped bolithos arm ill not ask you to betray a friendship but you know as well as i that we would have been made to strike to the argonaute if quinn had been left in charge forrard he looked along the deck probably remembering it as bolitho was he said there are more lives at stake than the honour of one man bolitho felt sick knowing cairns was right but feeling only pity for quinn what will they decide cairns replied the admiral who commands here will be aware of this it has taken long enough to come to light he will also know of quinns father his power in the city bolitho could feel the mans bitterness as he added hell not hang after lunch the court was recalled and cairns was proved correct the court of inquiry had decided that lieutenant james quinn had been rendered unfit by cause of injury in the kings service to continue with active duty upon confirmation from the commanderinchief he would be sent ashore to await passage home to england after that he would be discharged from the navy nobody outside would know of his disgrace except the one man who really cared and bolitho doubted very much if quinn could carry that final burden for long two days later with quinns fate still unconfirmed trojan weighed and put to sea it would it appeared take a little longer two and a half days after leaving english harbour trojan was steering due west under reefed topsails and forecourse in a stiff following wind it was a good opportunity to exercise the old and new hands together in sail drill as with spray bursting over the poop and quarterdeck the twodecker pointed her jib at the misty horizon apart from a few tiny islands far away on the starboard bow the sea was empty an endless deep blue desert with long cruising rollers and white crests to display the power of the wind bolitho waited on the larboard gangway the taste of strong coffee warming his stomach while he prepared to take over the afternoon watch in fifteen minutes time with so many new faces and names to grapple with the constant efforts to discover the skilled hands from the clumsy ones all of whom seemed to have five thumbs on each fist bolitho had been kept very busy but he could sense the atmosphere in the ship all the same confused acceptance by the lower deck and an air of bitterness from aft trojan was ordered to jamaica her lower decks crammed with a contingent of marines which the admiral was sending to enforce law and order at the governors urgent request bad weather had wrecked many of jamaica s local trading vessels and to make matters worse there had been news of another slave uprising on two of the larger plantations rebellion seemed to be in the air everywhere if britain was to hold on to her caribbean possessions she must act now and not wait for the french and possibly the spanish to blockade and occupy some of the many islands there but bolitho guessed that pears saw his role through different eyes while the fleet was preparing for the inevitable spread of war when every ship of the line would be desperately needed he was being ordered to jamaica his trojan had taken on the task of transport and little more even the admirals explanation that trojan needed no escort and was therefore releasing other vessels for work elsewhere had had no effect daily pears walked his quarterdeck still watchful for his ship and the routine which ran her but alone and quite removed from everyone else it could rot be helping him now bolitho thought to realize that hidden just below the horizon was the southeastern shore of puerto rico so near to where coutts had committed all of them to a hopeless battle in some ways it would have been better if the argonaute had not broken off the fight at least there would be a total victory to hold on to maybe the french had used their captain as a scapegoat too but as cairns had said it was better to be at sea and be kept busy than to swing at anchor moping over what might have happened he looked down at the gundeck at the milling scarlet uniforms and piled weapons as desterre and the captain in charge of the marine contingent inspected and checked everything for the hundredth time deck there bolitho looked up the sun searing his face like sand sail sir on the starboard bow dalyell had the watch and it was at moments such as this that his inexperience showed through what where he snatched a telescope from midshipman pullen and rushed to the starboard shrouds the lookouts voice was drifting with the wind small sail sir fisherman mebbee sambell who was masters mate of the watch remarked sourly lucky admiral coutts aint here hed have us chasm the bugger dalyell glared at him get aloft mr sambell tell me what you see he saw bolitho and smiled awkwardly so long with out sighting anything i was off guard so it would appear sir pears strode on to the quarterdeck his shoes squeaking on the seams he glanced at the set of the sails and then moved to the compass hmm dalyell peered up at the masters mate who seemed to be taking an age to make the long climb pears walked to the rail and watched the marines fisherman maybe so there are plenty of small islets there good places for water and firewood not too dangerous if you keep one eye open he frowned as sambell yelled shes sheered off makin for one of the islands dalyell licked his lips and watched the captain sighted us dyou suppose sir pears shrugged unlikely our masthead has a far greater vision than some lowlying hull he rubbed his chin and bolitho thought he saw a sudden gleam in his eyes then pears said harshly hands to the braces mr dalyell we will alter course three points steer norwest by north he banged his big hands together well jump to it sir pon my soul youll have to do better than this the shrill of calls and the immediate rush of seamen brought cairns on deck his eyes everywhere as he looked for a ship pears said vessel on starboard bow mr cairns could be a fisherman but unlikely they usually keep in company in these hard times another privateer sir cairns was speaking very carefully and bolitho guessed he had taken much from pears tongue in the past few weeks possibly pears beckoned to desterre who was being pushed and jostled by the extra marines as they sought to avoid the seamen at the braces and halliards captain desterre pears peered aloft as the yards squeaked round and the deck heeled over to the change of course how dyou propose to land your men at jamaica if there has been a further uprising desterre replied in boats sir land by sections above the port and take the high ground before seeking the local commander pears almost smiled i agree he pointed at the boat tier we will exercise landing the contingent at dusk he ignored desterres astonished stare on one of those islands yonder bolitho heard him say to cairns if there is some damned pirate there we will swamp him with marines anyway it will be good practice for them if trojan is to act as a troop transport then she will do it well no better than well cairns smiled grateful to see a return of pears old enthusiasm aye sir the helmsman shouted norwest be north zur steady as you go man cairns waited impatiently for bolithos watch to relieve dalyell and then said i wish to god we could catch one of them again just to show rearadmiral bloody coutts a thing or two pears heard him and murmured now now mr cairns that will do but that was all he said bolitho watched his men settling down to their duties while the rest went below to eat he still believed that what coutts had tried to do had been right but his reasons were less certain why was pears taking the trouble to land marines for so trivial a sighting hurt pride or did he expect to face an eventual court martial at coutts instigation over the argonaute encounter he heard pears say to bunce i intend to stand off as soon as we have landed the marines i know these waters very well ive an idea or two of my own bunce gave a rough chuckle that you do know em capn i think it may be gods will that we be here today pears grimaced most probably mr bunce we shall have to see he turned away and pray bolitho looked at cairns what does he mean cairns shrugged he certainly knows this part of the world as much as the sage i would think i have studied the chart but apart from reefs and currents i see no cause for excitement they both faced pears as he strode across the quarterdeck he said i am going aft to take lunch this afternoon we will muster all hands and prepare the boats swivels in the bows of cutters and launches only handpicked men will go he glanced at bolitho you can supervise the landing arrangements and will take mr frowd as your second captain desterre will command the land force he nodded and strode aft hands behind his back cairns said softly im glad for him but im not so sure he is acting wisely bunce muttered my mother used to ave a saying zur about too wiseeads on too young shoulders not good forem shed say he went to the chart room chuckling to himself cairns shook his head didnt know the old bugger ever had a mother trojan closed to within a mile of the nearest island and then lay hove to while the business of lowering boats and filling them with marines was begun most of the marines had been in antigua for a long time and had only heard about the war in america from visiting ships although few of them knew why they were being sent across to the island and those who did regarded it as something of a joke they carried out their part willingly and in good humour the cheerful atmosphere made seargeant shears exclaim angrily my gawd sir youd think it was a bloody oliday an no mistake the sea was still very choppy and lively and it took more time than calculated to get the boats fully loaded and headed for the shore it was growing dark and the sunset painted the wave crests amber and dull gold bolitho stood in the sternsheets of the leading cutter one hand on stockdales shoulder as he controlled the tillerbar it was difficult to see the cove where they were supposed to land although it had looked clear enough on the chart the grim truth was that nobody really knew the exact position of every reef and sandbar already they had seen several jagged rocks shining in the strange light and bringing a few anxious remarki from the crowded marines in their heavy boots and hung about with weapons and pouches they would go to the bottom before anything else if the boats were capsized desterre was saying fact is dick we may have been sighted already theyll not stop to fight all hose marines but well not find them either another seething rock passed down the starboard oar blades and bolitho signalled with a white flag to the boat astern and so on down the line trojan was only a blurred shadow now and she had been making more sail even as the boats had pulled clear she would use the prevailing wind to ride in the island s lee for some sign of results land ahead sir that was buller in the bows a good hand as he had shown his wood splinters apparently forgotten he was lucky to be able to forget so easily bolitho thought like darkly hooded monks some tall rocks rose on either side of the boat while directly across the bows and the loaded swivel gun lay a bright strip of sand easy all boat yer oars seamen were already leaping and splashing into the surf on either beam to steady the boat as she drove ashore desterre was out waistdeep in water and calling his sergeant to lead the first pickets to the higher ground it was a tiny island no more than a mile long most of the others were even smaller but there were rock pools for gathering fresh water and shellfish and wood to burn for any small and selfsufficient vessel bolitho waded ashore thinking suddenly of quinn ile had heard him asking pleading with cairns to be allowed to come with the landing party cairns had been coldly formal almost brutal we want experienced picked men mr quinn the last part had been like a slap in the face reliable too midshipman couzens was arriving with the next cutter and the trojans redpainted barge was following her bolitho smiled tightly frowd and the other marine captain were in her being held back in case the first boats had fallen under a deluge of shot and fire take your positions boathandling parties stand fast stockdale strode from the shallows his cutlass across one shoulder like a broadsword from tumbling confusion and whispered threats from the sergeants and corporals the marines formed into neat little sections at a further command the moved up the slope boots squelching on sand and then on rough sunhardened earth an hour later it was dark and the air was heavy with damp smells of rotten vegetation and seabird droppings while the marine skirmishers hurried away on either side bolitho and desterre stood on a narrow ridgebacked hill the sea ahead and behind them invisible but for an occasional gleam of surf it seemed deserted dead the unknown vessel had gone to another island or had sailed northwest towards the bahamas if sambell had not seen her for himself bolitho might have thought the lookout mistaken by a trick of light and haze this is no fort exeter dick desterre was leaning on his sword his head cocked to listen to the hiss of wind through fronds and bushes i wish we had those canadian scouts with us bolitho saw some seamen lying on their backs staring at the sky they were quite content to leave it to others they merely had to obey to die if need be they heard a nervous challenge and then shears strode up the hill towards them he carried a clump of grass or creeper to cover his uniform which was why the sentry had been so startled it reminded bolitho of major pagets little cape well desterre leaned forward shears sucked in gulps of air shes there right enough sir anchored close in small vessel yawl by the looks of er desterre asked any signs of life theres a watch on deck an no lights sir up to no good if you ask me he saw desterres smile and added firmly one of the marines from antigua says theyd have lights lit and lines down right now sir theres a special sort of fish they goes after no real fisherman would lie an sleep desterre nodded that was well said sergeant shears ill see that the man has a guinea when we get back aboard and you too you must have something about you to inspire an unknown marine to offer his confidences he became crisp and formal fetch mr frowd we will decide what to do pass the word to watch out for anyone coming ashore from the yawl shears said cheerfully they got no boats in the water sir well watch anyway as the sergeant hurried away desterre said well dick are you thinking as i am a surprise attack on them aye he tried to picture the anchored vessel the sight of all your marines should do it but two armed cutters would be safer in case they are unimpressed by your little army i agree you and mr frowd take the cutters ill keep the midshipman with me and send him with a message if things go wrong so work your way round no risks mind not for a damned yawl bolitho waited for frowd to join him thinking back to pears casual reference to these small islands it had all been clear to him if the vessel was an enemy or up to no good she would run at the first hint of trouble towards the land and the marines or more likely use the prevailing wind and put to sea again or hide amongst the islands either way she would find trojan lying there using the offshore current and wind waiting like a great beast to overwhelm her in a matter of minutes at sea in open waters there was hardly a vessel afloat which could not outsail the slowmoving trojan but in confined space where one false turn of the helm could mean a grounding at best trojans massive artillery would make escape impossible frowd remarked dourly boat action then bolitho watched him curiously frowd could probably think of nothing but his next appointment getting away from the ship where so many had been his equals and were now expected to knuckle their foreheads to him yes pick your men and lets be about it he noticed the sharpness in his own voice too why was that did he see frowds attitude as a challenge as i owhurst had once vied with quinn with muffled oars the two cutters pulled away from the other moored boats and turned east towards the far end of the island the wind making each stroke of the oars harder and more tiring but bolitho knew his men by now they would rally when the time came they had done it before it was strange to be pushing through the choppy water without doubts of these silent straining men he hoped they held some trust in him also it would be funny if after all this stealth they found only terrified traders or fishermen rising to the marines rough awakening it would not seem so amusing when they had to tell the captain about it somebody must be comin sir bolitho scrambled through the cutter to join the lookout in the bows he could see the two seamen he had put ashore framed against the sky one moving his arm above his head very slowly ilow loud everything sounded the water sluicing around the two moored boats the distant boom of surf and the hissing roar as it receded from some hidden beach they had reached this tiny inlet several hours ago and had made fast to get as much rest as possible most of the seamen appeared to have no trouble they could sleep anywhere indifferent to the rocking boats the spray which occasionally spattered across their already damp clothing frowd in the boat alongside said its gone wrong i expect bolitho waited realizing that the men on the shore were easier to see more sharply defined against the dull sky it would be dawn soon stockdale said feelingly its mr couzens not the enemy couzens came slithering down the slope and then waded and floundered towards the cutters he saw bolitho and gasped captain desterre says to start the attack in half an hour he sounded so relieved that bolitho guessed he had got lost on his way here very well attack that sounded definite enough what is the signal stockdale hoisted the midshipman unceremoniously over the gunwale one pistol shot sir couzens sank down on a thwart his legs dripping on the bottom board good recall those men bolitho rriade his way aft again acid held his v atch against a shaded horn lantern there was not much time rrouse the hands make ready to cast off men stirred and coughed groping around to get their bearings from the set of the current bolitdio could picture how the yawl would be swinging to her cable he thought suddenly of sparke deciding on his attack pushing sentiment aside after he bloody fighting was over load your pistols take your tune if he hurried them or shared his own anxiety over the brightening sky somebody was bound to get muddled and loose off a ball it only took one stockdale swayed through t e boat and then returned all done sir mr frowd the lieutenant waved to him ready sir in spite of his tense nerves bolitho felt he wanted to smile sir frowd would never call him by his frst name in a hundred years out oars he raised his arm ersy lads like f eld mice stockdale sounded approving shove o f forrard give way larboard very slowly with one set of oars pulling the boat round like a crab they moved away from their tiny haven frowd was following and lolitho saw the bowman training the swivel from side to side as if to sniff the way couzens whispered theres the corner sir bolitho watched the jutting sour of rock couzens corner once round it they would be en exposed water and visible to my vigilant sentry it was brigltei ng so rapidly that he could see a touch of green on the land the l ter of spray over some fallen stones weapons too and in the bows leaning forward like a figurehead the topman buller christ there she be sir bolitho saw the swaying mainmast and the smaller one right aft on the anchored yawl stark against the sky even though the hull was still in shadow a yawl or dandy as they were usually termed would be just the thing for using amongst the islands he heard the gurgle of water around the stem and from astern the regular muffled beat of frowds oars stockdale eased the tiller over allowing the cutter to move away from the island to lay the yawl between him and desterres marines soon now it had to be bolitho held his breath drawing his hanger carefully although he knew from past experience that a tired lookout would hear little but his own shipboard noises an anchored vessel was always alive with sound and movement but there was a long way to go yet he said roundly lads put your backs into it the cutter was moving swiftly and firmly towards the yawls larboard bow bolitho saw the anchor cable beneath the polelike bowsprit the casual way the sails were furled and brailed up the crack of a pistol shot was like a twelvepounder on the morning air and as somebody gave a startled cry aboard the yawl an undulating line of heads closely linked with muskets and fixed bayonets appeared along the top of the island then touches of scarlet as the marines continued to march in a long single rank up and then down towards the water pull all youve got bolitho leaned forward as if to add weight to the fastmoving cutter figures had appeared on the yawls deck and a solitary shot lit up the mainmast like a flare across the water they all heard desterre shouting for the yawl to surrender and more confused cries followed by the sound of cordage being hauled madly through blocks bolitho momentarily forgot his own part in it as with unhurried precision the line of shadowy marines halted and then fired a volley across the vessels deck there was no movement aboard after that and bolitho shouted stand by to board grapnel ready there from a corner of his eye he saw frowds boat surging past a grapnel already streaking towards the yawls bulwark while the selected men charged up with drawn cutlasses yelling and cheering the seamen clambered on either side of the bowsprit seeing the crew crowding together near the mainmast too shocked by what had happened to move let alone resist a few muskets had been thrown down on the deck and bolitho ran aft with stockdale to ensure that no more men were hiding below and even now attempting to scuttle their vessel not a plan lost and across the water he saw the marines waving their hats and cheering i frowd snapped privateers right enough he dragged a man from the crowd he had thrown his weapons away but was so loaded with pouches of shot and cartridges that he looked like a pirate bolitho sheathed his hanger well done lads ill send word across to the marines and it was couzens who had shouted with alarm he was pointing across the bows his voice breaking ship sir coming round the pointv he heard desterre calling through his speaking trumpet his voice urgent and desperate abandon her man your boats frowd was still staring at the neat array of braced yards and sails as the approaching vessel tilted suddenly to a change of tack he asked what the hell is she bolitho felt fingers tugging his sleeve and he saw buller his eyes on the newcomer its er th one i saw zur th brig which went about when spite were dismasted it was all tumbling through bolithos mind like a tide in a millrace the brig the yawl waiting to load or unload more weapons and powder desterres last order his own decision which lay frozen in his reeling thoughts there was a flash followed by a dull bang and a ball whipped overhead and smashed down hard on the island the marines were falling back in good order and bolitho could sense the change in the yawls crew fear to hope and then to jubilation at their unexpected rescue whatll we do frowd was standing by the capstan his sword still in his hand shell rake her as she passes with every gun shes got bolitho thought of pears of coutts disappointment of quinns face at the court of inquiry he yelled cut the cable stand by to break out the mainsi mr frowd take charge there stockdale man the helm another ball came out of the misty light and smashed into one of the cutters which was bobbing beneath the stem before it heeled over and sank its loaded swivel gun exploded and a blast of canister cut down a seaman even as he ran to sever the cable with only one boat there was no chance to obey desterres order bolitho stared at the brig his heart chilling with anger and unexpected hatred and he knew deep down that he had had no intention of obeying the great mainsail swung outboard on its boom thundering wildly as the anchor cable was hacked away to allow the yawl to fall downwind out of command put up your helm men were slipping and stumbling at the halliards ignoring the dumbfounded crew as they fought to bring the yawl under control bolitho heard a ragged crash of gunfire and turned in time to see the small after mast pitch over the rail missing stockdale by a few feet hack that adrift another crash shook the hull and bolitho heard the ball slamming through the deck below she could not take much of this put those men on the pumps he thrust his pistol into couzens hand shoot if they try to rush you ive got er sir stockdale stood legs wide apart peering at the sails and the freshly set jib as the land swam round beneath the bowsprit he looked like an oak but the brig was gaining her deck tilting as she tacked round to hold the wind and overreach her adversary the yawl had two swivels but they were useless like a pike against a charge of cavalry and all the hands were better employed at sheets and braces than wasting their strength on empty gestures a bright ripple of flashes again and this tine the balls battered into the lower hull like a fall of rock bolitho saw the flag at the brigs gaff the one he had been hearing about red and white stripes with a circle of stars on a blue ground she looked very new and was being handled by a real professional wem makin water fast sir bolitho wiped his face and listened to the creak of the pumps it was no use they could never outreach her small vicious sounds sang past be helm and he knew they were in musket range somebody screamed and then he saw frowd stagger and fall against the bulwark both hands clutching a shattered knee couzens appeared at the hatch his back towards the deck as he trained the pistol down tile companion ladder were sinking sir theres water bursting into the hold a ball burst through the mainsail and parted shrouds and stays like an invisible sabre frowd was gasping run her ashore its our only chance bolitho shook his head once on firm sand the yawls cargo and he had no doubt now that she was loaded with arms for the brig would still be intact with sudden fury he climbed on to the shrouds and shook his fist at the other vessel his voice was lost on the wind and the answering crash of cannonfire but he found some satisfaction as he yelled ill sink her first damn you stockdale watched him while beyond the bows and the sea which was being churned by falling shot he saw the headland sliding away please god shell be there he thought despairingly too late for us but theyll not live neither orders as she floundered further from the islands shelter and into open water the yawl rapidly became unmanageable with so much damage below and the deadweight of weapons and iron shot she was destroying herself on every wave the brig had changed tack again sweeping away sharply to run almost parallel while her gun crews settled down to pound the smaller craft into submission there was no thought left of saving anything or anybody and even the terrified prisoners were falling under the murderous cannonfire bolitho found time to notice that the brig obviously new from some masterbuilders yard was not fully armed otherwise the fight would have been over long since only half her ports were firing and he guessed the remainder were supposed to have been filled fromm the yawls cargo and this was her masters second attempt the first had cost many lives and the loss of the spite it seemed as if the brig had a charmed life and would escape yet again the deck gave a tremendous lurch and the topmast and upper yard fell in a mess of rigging and flapping canvas immediately the deck began to lean over throwing men from their feet and bringing down more severed rigging from the open hatch bolitho heard the violent inrush of water the cries of the prisoners as the sea pushed through the frail timbers into the hold bolitho clung to the bulwark and shouted release those men mr couzens the rest of you help the wounded he stared at stockdale as he released the useless tiller lend a hand he winced as more shots whistled low overhead we must abandon stockdale threw an unconscious seaman over his shoulder and strode to the side peering down to make sure the remaining cutter was still afloat into the boat pass the wounded down bolitho felt the deck tilt and begin to settle more steeply she was going by the stern and the taffrail with the stump of the after mast was already awash if only the brig would cease firing it needed just one ball to fall amongst the wounded and they would sink with the cutter he looked at the swirling water and lively white crests they would have a poor chance of survival in any case on the island which seemed to have moved a mile astern he could see a few red coats and guessed that the majority of the marines were running back to man the other bogs but marines were not seamen by the time they managed to draw near it would be over fcouzens staggered towards him and gasped the bows are out of the water sir he ducked as another shot ripped through the mainsail and tore it away to rags stockdale was trying to climb back on deck but bolitho shouted stand away shes going down fast with his face like a mask stockdale cast off the painter and allowed the current to carry him clear bolitho saw frowd struggling aft to watch the sinking yawl his fingers bloody as he waved his sword above his head the brig was shortening sail the forecourse vanishing to reveal the rest of her neat hull will they try to save us or kill us bolitho said we will swim for it mr couzens the boy nodded jerkily unable to speak as he kicked off his shoes and tore frantically at his shirt a shadow moved below the open hatch and for a moment bolitho imagined a wounded or trapped man was still down there but it was a corpse drifting forward as the water pounded between the decks it was as high as that couzens stared at the water and murmured im not much of a swimmer ssir his teeth were chattering in spite of the sunlight bolitho looked at him why in hells name didnt you leave with the cutter then he realized the answer just as quickly and said quietly we will keep together i see a likely spar yonder the brig fired again the ball skipping over the wave crests past the swaying cutter and between some floundering swimmers like an attacking swordfish so that was why they had shortened sail to make sure the british force was totally destroyed so that every officer would think again if in the future he saw a chance of seizing much needed supplies the yawl lurched over tipping loose gear and corpses into the scuppers bolitho watched the brig but for couzens he would have stayed and died here he knew it if he had to die anyway it were better to let them see his face but couzens did not deserve such a death for him there must always seem a chance the brig was putting her helm over her yards in confusion as she swung away from the drifting wreck he could even see her name on the broad counter white hills and a startled face peering at him from the stern windows hes going about bolitho spoke aloud without knowing it what is he thinking of hell be in irons in a minute the wind was too strong and the brigs sails too few in no time she was rendered helpless her sails all aback in flapping disordered revolt there was a muffled bang and for an instant bolitho thought she had sprung a mast or large yard with disbelief he saw a great gaping hole torn in the brigs maintopsail the wind slashing it to ribbons against the mast even as he watched he felt couzens clutching his arm and shouting its trojan sir she is here v bolitho turned and saw the twodecker standing as if motionless in the haze like an extension to the next pair of islets pears must have judged it to the second biding his time while the same wind which was hampering the brig carried him slowly across the one safe channel of escape two bright tongues stabbed from the forecastle and bolitho could see the gun captains as if he were there with them probably bill chimmo trojans gunner would personally be supervising each careful shot he heard the splintering crash as an eighteenpound ball blasted its way into the brig then below his feet the deck started to slide away and with couzens clinging to him like a limpet he plunged over the bulwark but not before he had heard a wild cheer or before he had seen the bright new flag being hauled down from the brigs gaff even at that range trojans starboard broadside could have smashed the brig to pieces in minutes and her master knew it a bitter moment for him but many would thank him all the same gasping and spluttering they reached the drifting spar and clung on to it bolitho managed to say i think you saved me for unlike couzens he had forgotten to remove his clothes or even his hanger and he was grateful for the spars support as he tried to hold his head above the choppy wave crests he saw the cutter turning towards him the oarsmen leaning outboard to pull some of the swimmers to safety or allow them to hang along either side of the hull further beyond them the other boats were coming too the marines and the small party of seamen left to guard them doing better than bolitho had expected he called how is the brig couzens stared across the spar and answered shes hove to sir theyre not going to make a run for it bolitho nodded unable to say anything more the white hills had no choice especially as desterres boats were being careful not to lay themselves between him and trojans formidable artillery the brigs capture might not make up for all those who had died but it would show trojans company what they could do and give them back some pride trojans remaining boats had been lowered and were coming to join in the rescue bolitho could see the two jolly boats and even the gig bouncing over the water it took a full hour before he and midshipman couzens were hauled aboard the gig by a grinning midshipman pullen bolitho could well imagine what the delay had done to stockdale but stockdale knew him well enough to stand off with his overloaded boat of wounded and halfdrowned men rather than to show preference for a lieutenant who was to all intents safe and unhurt the eventual return aboard the trojan was one of mixed feelings sadness that some of the older and more experienced hands had died or suffered wounds but riding with it a kind of wild jubilation that they had acted alone and had won when the smartly painted brig was put under the command of a boarding party and the seamen lining the trojans gangway cheered the returning victors it felt like the greatest triumph of all time small moments stood out as they always did a seaman shaking his friend to tell him they were alongside their ship again the stunned disbelief when he discovered he had died the cheers giving way to laughter as couzens as naked as the day he was born climbed through the entry port with all the dignity he could manage while two grinning marines presented arms for his benefit and stockdale striding to meet bolitho his slow lopsided smile of welcome better than any words yet somehow it was pears who held the day tall massive like his beloved trojan he stood watching in silence as couzens tried to hide himself pears called harshly that is no way for a kings officer to disport himself sir pon my soul mr couzens i dont know what you are thinking about and thats the truth then as the boy ran flushing for the nearest companionway he added proud of you all the same bolitho crossed the quarterdeck his feet squelching noisily pears eyed him grimly lost the yawl i see loaded was she aye sir i believe she was to arm the brig he saw his men limping past tarred hands reaching out to slap their shoulders he said softly our people did well sir he watched the brig spreading her sails again the torn one little more than rags he guessed that pears had sent a masters mate across while the marines searched and sorted out the captured crew frowd might be made prizemaster it might make up for his badly shattered knee whatever thorndike did for him now or some hospital later on he would have a bad limp for the rest of his life he had reached the rank of lieutenant frowd would know better than anyone that his wound would prevent his getting any further it was late afternoon by the time both vessels had cleared the islands and had searoom again it was no small relief to see the reefs and swirling currents left far astern when desterre returned to the trojan he had another interesting find to report the white hills captain was none other than jonas tracy the brother of the man killed when they had seized the schooner faithful he had had every intention of fighting his way from under trojans guns hopeless or not but the odds had been against him his company were for the most part new to the trade of a fighting ship which was the reason for a seasoned privateersman like tracy being given command in the first place his reputation and list of successes against the british made him an obvious choice tracy had ordered his men to put the white hills about to try and discover another narrow passage through the islands his men already cowed by the trojans unexpected challenge were completely beaten when that second carefully aimed ball had smashed into the brigs side it had shattered to fragments on the breech of a gun on the opposite bulwark and one splinter the size of a block had taken tracys arm off at the shoulder the sight of their tough hardswearing captain oat down before their eyes had been more than enough and they had hauled down their flag bolitho did not know if tracy was still alive it was an ironic twist that he had been firing on the man who was responsible for his brothers death without knowing it bolitho was washing himself in his small cabin when he heard a commotion on deck the distant cry that a sail was in sight the other vessel soon showed herself to be a frigate under full sail she bore down on trojan and with little fuss dropped a boat in the water to carry her captain across bolitho threw on his shirt and breeches and ran on deck the frigate was called kittiwake and bolitho knew she was one of those he had seen at antigua with as much ceremony as if they were safely anchored in plymouth sound trojan received her visitor as the guard presented muskets and calls shrilled pears stepped forward to greet him bolitho realized it was the postcaptain who had been on quinns court of inquiry not the president nor the one with the thin lips and vindictive manner but the third officer who had as far as bolitho recalled said nothing at all sunset was closing in rapidly when the kittizvakes lord and master took his leave his step less firm than when he had come aboard bolitho watched the frigate make sail again her canvas like gold silk in the dying sunlight she would soon be out of sight her captain free of admirals and ponderous authority he sighed cairns joined him his eyes on the duty watch who were preparing to get the ship under way again he said quietly she was from antigua with despatches she has been realeased from her squadron to go ahead of us to jamaica we are not outcasts after all he sounded different remote is something wrong cairns looked at him his face glowing in the sunset captain pears thinks that the sea war will end in the caribbean not america bolitho did not understand this mood like me i think he believes that the war is already finished victories we will have must have if we are to meet the french when they come out but to win a war takes more than that dick he touched his shoulder and smiled sadly i am detaining you the captain wants you aft he walked away calling sharply now then mr dalyell what is this shambles send the topmen aloft and pipe the hands to the braces it is like a fish market here bolitho groped through the shadowed passageway to pears cabin pears was sitting at his table studying a bottle of wine with grim concentration he said sit down bolitho heard the pad of bare feet overhead and wondered how they were managing with the captain away from his familiar place by the rail he sat the cabin looked comfortable and content bolitho felt suddenly tired as if all the strength had drained out of him like sand from an hourglass pears announced slowly we shall have some claret presently bolitho licked his lips thank you sir he waited completely lost first cairns now pears captain viney of the kittiwake brought orders from the flagship at antigua mr frowd is appointed into the maid o f norfolk armed transport with all despatch but sir his leg i know the surgeon has patched him as best he can his eyes came up and settled firmly on bolithos face what does he want most in the world a ship sir perhaps one day a command of his own he recalled frowds face aboard the yawl perhaps even then he had been thinking of it a ship any ship like the armed transport written in his appointment would have done i agree if he languishes here it will be too late if he returns to antigua he shrugged his luck may have changed by then bolitho watched him fascinated by pears authority he had fought in battles and was now taking his command to deal with god alone knew what in jamaica and yet he had time to think about frowd then there is mr quinn pears opened the bottle his head to one side as the hull shivered and rolled before settling down on a new tack he was not forgotten bolitho waited trying to discover pears true feelings he is to be returned to antigua for passage to england the rest we already know i have written a letter for his father it wont help much but i want him to understand that his son only had so much courage when it left him he was as helpless as frowd with his leg pears nudged a heavy envelope with the bottle but he tried and if more young men were doing that instead of living in comfort at home we might be better placed than we are bolitho looked at the bulky envelope quinns life pears became almost brisk but enough of that i have things to do orders to dictate he poured two large glasses of claret and held them on the table until bolitho took one the ship was leaning so steeply that both would have slithered to the deck otherwise it was strange that no one else was here he had expected desterre or perhaps cairns once he had completed his duties with the watch on deck pears raised his glass and said i expect this will be a long night for you but there will be longer ones believe me he raised his glass like a thimble in his massive fist i wish you luck mr bolitho and as our redoubtable sailing master would say gods speed bolitho stared at him the claret untouched i am putting you in command of the white hills we will part company tomorrow when it is light enough to ferry the wounded over to her bolitho tried to think to clear the astonishment from his mind then he said the first lieutenant sir with all respect pears held up his glass it was empty like probyris had once been i was going to send him i need him here now more than ever but he deserves an appointment even as a prizemaster ile eyed him steadily as you did to rearadmiral coutts so did he refuse my suggestion he smiled gravely so there we are bolitho saw his glass being refilled and said dazedly thank you very much sir pears grimaced so get the claret down you and say your farewells you can bother the life out of someone else after this bolitho found himself outside beside the motionless sentry again as if it had all been a dream he found cairns still on deck leaning against the weather nettings and staring across at the brigs lights before bolitho could speak cairns said firmly you are going as prizemaster tomorrow it is settled if i have to send you across in irons bolitho stood beside him conscious of the movements behind him the creak of the wheel the slap of rigging against spars and canvas i expect this will be a long night for you what has happened neil he felt very close to this quiet softspoken scot the captain also received a letter i dont know who from it is not his style to whimper it was a friendly piece of information if you can call it that to tell captain pears he has been passed over for promotion to flag rank a captain he will remain he looked up at the stars beyond the black rigging and yards and when trojan eventually paysoff that will be the end for him coutts has been ordered to england under a cloud he could not hide his anger his hurt but he has wealth and position he turned and gestured towards the poop he only has his ship thank you for telling me cairns teeth were very white in the gloom away with you man go and pack your chest as bolitho was about to leave him he added softly but you do understand my friend i couldnt desert him now could i the next morning bright and early with both vessels hove to trojans boats started to ferry the wounded seamen across to the brig on their return trips they carried the white hills crew into captivity it must have been one of the shortest commissions in sea history bolitho thought nothing seemed exactly real to him and he found himself forgetting certain tasks and checking to discover if he had completed others more than once each time he went on deck he had to look across at the brig rolling uncomfortably in steep troughs but once under sail again she could fly if need be it was too close a memory to forget how she had been handled cairns had already told him that pears was allowing him to select his own prizecrew just enough to work the brig in safety or run before a storm or powerful enemy he did not have to ask stockdale he was there a small bag already packed his worldly possessions pears had also instructed him to take the badly wounded captain jonas tracy to antigua he was too severely injured to be moved with the other prisoners and should be little trouble as the time drew near for him to leave bolitho was very aware of his own tore emotions small incidents from the past stood out to remind him of his two and a half years in the trojan it seemed quite unbelievable that he was leaving her to place himself at the disposal of the admiral commanding in antigua it was like starting life all over again new faces fresh surroundings he had been surprised and not a little moved by some of the men who had actually volunteered to go with him carlsson the swede who had been flogged dunwoody the millers son moffitt the american rabbett the exthief and old buller the topman the man who had recognized the brig from the start he had been promoted to petty officer and had shaken his head in astonishment at the news there were others too as much a part of the big twodecker as her figurehead or her captain he watched frowd being swayed down to the cutter in a bosuns chair his bandaged and splinted leg sticking out like a tusk and hating it all the indignity of leaving his ship in this fashion quinn had already gone across it would be difficult to stand between those two bolitho thought bolitho had already seen frowd looking bitterly at quinn he was probably questioning the fairness of it why should quinn who was being rejected by the navy be spared while he was a cripple most of the goodbyes had been said already last night and through the morning rough handshakes from gunner and boatswain grins from others he had watched change from boys to men like himself desterre had sent some of his own stock of wine across to the brig and sergeant shears had given him a tiny cannon which he had fashioned from odd fragments of silver cairns found him checking over his list of things which he was required to do and said the sage says that were in for a blow dick youd better be going now he thrust out his hand ill say my farewells here he glanced around the deserted wardroom where they had shared so much it will seem emptier with you gone ill not forget you bolitho gripped his hand hard ever they walked forward to the companion ladder and cairns said suddenly one thing captain pears thinks you should take another officer to stand watches with you we cannot spare a masters mate and lieutenants are as rare as charity until our replacements arrive so it will have to be a midshipman bolitho thought about it cairns added weston will be actinglieutenant as of now and both lunn and burslem are better left here to finish their training that leaves forbes and couzens who are young enough to begin again anywhere bolitho smiled i will put it to them watched by the lieutenants and marine officers erasmus bunce the master beckoned to the two thirteenyearold midshipmen a volunteer is needed young gentlemen bunce glared at them disdainfully though what use either o you will be to mr bolitho i cant say they both stepped forward couzens with such a look of pleading on his round face that bunce asked is your gear packed couzens nodded excitedly and forbes looked near to tears as he shook his head bunce said mr couzens off you go and lively it must be the lords blessing to clear the ship of your high spirits and skylarking he looked at bolitho and dropped one eyelid like a gunport satisfied aye bolitho shook their hands trying to hold back his emotion desterre was the last good luck dick well meet again i shall miss you bolitho looked across at the white hills seeing the wave crests rolling along her hull making her sway more and more steeply his orders were in his pocket in a heavily sealed envelope he waited to go but the ship held on to him he walked towards the entry port seeing the gig rising and falling alongside in for a blow bunce had said perhaps it was just as well to hasten the break and keep him too busy for regrets cairns said quietly here is the captain pears strolled across the quarterdeck his coattails flapping out like studding sails while he held on to his goldlaced hat with one hand prepare to get under way mr cairns ill not lose this wind he seemed to see bolitho for the first time still here sir his eyebrows went up pon my soul for once he did not finish instead he walked across and held out his big hand be off with you now my regards to your father when next you see hiss he turned away and moved aft towards the compass bolitho touched his hat to the quarterdeck and clutching his hanger to his hip hurried down into the boat the oars dipped into the water and immediately trojan fell away the men on the gangways turning to continue with their work while others ran up the ratlines to loose the topsails again couzens stared back at the ship his eyes watering in the wind it looked as if he was crying unknown to bolitho it was the happiest day in the midshipmans short life bolitho raised his hand and saw cairns doing the same of pears there was no sign like the trojan he was letting go bolitho turned his back and studied the white hills his for so short a time but his as bunce had predicted the wind rose rapidly to gale force and with it the sea changed its face from cruising white horses to long violent troughs with ragged yellow crests the prizecrew got down to work in grim earnest bringing the ships head to the south as the wind backed and pushed them hard over the yards braced round until they would not shift another inch bolitho discarded his hat and coat and stood beside the unprotected wheel his ears ringing to the roar of wind and sea his whole body soaking with spray it was lucky the white hills carried a spare maintopsail he thought the one which had been torn apart by trojans first shot had been saved for patching but was useless for anything more under reefed topsails and jib the white hills ran closehauled to the south away from the islands and danger quinn stifffaced and barely speaking worked with the hands on deck and without him bolitho wondered what he would have done couzens had the determination and loyalty of ten men but experience in handling rigging and sails in a full gale he had not stockdale came aft and joined the two hands at the wheel like bolitho he was drenched to the skin his clothing stained by tar and salt he grinned through the drifting streamers of spindrift and bobbed his head at bolitho real little lady aint she for most of the day they ran with the wind but towards sunset the strength fell away and later still the bruised and breathless seamen managed to get aloft and set both mainsail and forecourse the additional bulging area of canvas pushed the hull over further still but held her steadier and more firmly on course bolitho shouted to quinn take over im going below after the noise and confusion on deck it seemed almost quiet once he had lowered himself through the companionway how small she seemed after trojans great girth he groped his way aft to the cabin a miniature of pears quarters it was barely large enough to contain pears table he thought but it looked inviting and too new to show signs of a previous owner he reeled as the sea boiled and thundered along the quarter and then managed to reach the stern windows there was nowhere in the cabin apart from a batteneddown skylight where he could stand upright what it was like in the messes he could well imagine as a midshipman he had once served in a brig very similar to this one fast lively and never still he wondered what had happened to tracys other command the captured brig which he had renamed revenge still attacking british convoys and stalking rich cargoes for ready prizemoney the cabin door banged open and moffitt lurched through it carrying a jug of rum he said mr frowd thought you might like a drop sir bolitho disliked rum but he needed something he swallowed it in a gulp almost choking mr frowd is he all right he must visit him soon but now he was needed and would have to return to the deck moffitt took the empty goblet and grinned at it admiringly aye sir ive got him propped in a cot in his cabin hell be safe enough good get buller for me bolitho lay back feeling the stern rising and then sliding down beneath him the sea shaking the rudder like a piece of driftwood buller came into the cabin his head lowered to avoid the beams zur you take charge of the victuals find someone who can cook if the wind drops some more well get the galley fire relit and put something hot into our bellies buller showed his strong teeth right away zur then he too was gone bolitho sighed the aroma of rum around him like a drug chain of command and he must begin it no one else was here to goad or encourage his efforts his head lolled and he jerked it up with sudden disgust like george probyn that was a fine beginning he jumped up and gasped as his head crashed against a beam but it sobered him even more quickly he made his way forward swaying and feeling his balance with each jubilant lunge of the brigs bowsprit tiny cabins on either side of a small square space the wardroom stores and shot garlands swaying ranks of podlike hammocks the ship smelt new right down to her mess tables her great coils of stout cable in the tier forward he found the wounded tracy in a cot swinging in a tiny cabin which was still unfinished a redeyed seaman sat in one corner a pistol between his feet politho peered at the figure in the cot about thirty a powerful hardfaced man who despite his terrible wound and loss of blood still looked very much alive but with his arm torn off at the point of the shoulder he would not be much trouble he glanced at the sentry and said watch him all the same the other wounded men were quiet enough bandaged and cushioned from the fierce motion by spare hammocks blankets and clothing from the brigs store ire paused by a wildly swinging lantern feeling their pain their lack of understanding again he was ashamed for thinking of his own reward they on the other hand knew only that they were being carried away from their ship which good or bad had been their home and to where some homebound vessel and then what put ashore just another cluster of crippled sailors heroes to some figures of fun to others therell be some hot food along soon lads a few heads turned to look at him one man he recognized as gallimore a seaman employed as a painter aboard the trojan he had been badly injured by canister during the attack on the yawl he had lost most of his right hand and had been hit in the face by wood splinters he managed to whisper where we goin sir bolitho knelt down on the deck beside him the man was dying he did not know how he knew or why others nearby were more badly hurt yet bore their pain with defiant even surly resignation they would survive he said english harbour the surgeons there will help you youll see the man reached out seeking bolithos hand oi dont want to die sir oi got a wife an children in plymouth he tried to shake his head oi mustnt die sir bolitho felt a catch in his throat plymouth it might just as well be russia rest easy gallimore lire withdrew his hand carefully you are with your friends he walked aft again to the companionway bent almost double in the space between decks the wind and spray were almost welcome he found couzens with stockdale by the wheel while quinn was groping along the forecastle with two seamen stockdale said gruffly all oldin firm sir mr quinn is lookin at the weather braces he peered up at the dark sky winds backed a piece more fallin off too the bows lifted towards the sky then came down in a trough with a shuddering lurch it was enough to hurl a man from the yards had there been one up there stockdale muttered must be bad for the lads below sir bolitho nodded gallimores dying i think i know sir stockdale eased the spokes and studied the quivering maintopsail the canvas ballooning out as if to tear itself from the yard bolitho glanced at him of course stockdale would have known he had lived with suffering for most of his life death would seem familiar recognizable quinn came aft along the pale deck staggering to each swooping dip across the troughs he shouted the larboard anchor was working free but weve tatted it home again bolitho replied get below work out two watches for me and ill discuss it with you later quinn shook his head i dont want to be on my own i must do something bolitho thought of the man from plymouth go to the wounded james take some rum or anything you can find in the cabin and issue it to those poor devils there was no sense in telling him about gallimore let the dying man join his companions in a last escape the sailors balm for everything a seaman accompanied by buller ducked down the companion ladder and bolitho saw it was a swarthy italian named borga it seemed as if luller had already chosen a cook and bolitho hoped it was a wise decision hot food in a seamans belly after fisting canvas and trying to stay inboard was one thing but some foreign concoction might spark off a brawl he glanced at stockdale and smiled to himself if so it would soon be dealt with another hour and the stars appeared the scudding clouds driven off like fleeing vagrants bolitho felt the deck becoming steadier and wondered what tomorrow would be like how bunce would have predicted it as promised a hot meal was produced and issued first to the wounded and then to the seamen as they were relieved from watch in small groups bolitho ate his with relish although what he was having he did not know boiled meat oatmeal ground biscuit it was also laced with rum it was like nothing he had ever had but at that moment would have graced any admirals table to couzens he said are you sorry for your eagerness to join the white hills couzens shook his head his stomach creaking with borgas first meal wait till i get home sir theyll never believe it bolitho pictured quinn sitting below with the wounded and thought of pears writing a letter to his father he tried he thought too of the despatches he was carrying from captain pears to the admiral at antigua it was probably safer not to know what pears had said about him although it would certainly affect his immediate future but he still did not really understand pears only that under his command he had learned more than he had first realized bolitho stared up at the sky i think weve seen the worst of it better fetch mr quinn on deck couzens watched him and blurted out i can stand watch sir stockdale grinned lazily aye sir he can at that ill be on deck too he hid his grin from the midshipman though ill not be needed im thinkin very well bolitho smiled call me if youre in any doubt he lowered himself through the companionway glad he had given couzens the opportunity to face responsibility surprised too that he had been able to trust him without hesitation as he found his way to his small cabin he heard frowd snoring loudly and the clatter of a goblet rolling back and forth across the deck tomorrow would be a lot of hard work first to try to estimate their position and drift then to set a new course which with luck would carry them to the leeward islands and antigua on the chart it did not seem so far but the prevailing winds would be against them for much of the passage and it could take days to make good the loss of being driven south and once in antigua what then would the french lieutenant still be there taking lonely walks in the sun on his honour not to try and escape he laid down on the bench beneath the stern windows ready to run on deck at the first unusual sound but bolitho was fast asleep in a matter of seconds it was noon two days after leaving the trojan but a lifetime of new experiences and problems the weather was less demanding now and the white hills was leaning over on the larboard tack with even her big spanker set and filled by the wind the vessel felt clean and dry after the storm and the makeshift routine which bolitho had worked out with quinn and frowd was performing well frowd was on deck seated on a hatch cover his leg propped before him as a constant reminder couzens stood by the wheel while bolitho and quinn checked their sextants and compared calculations he saw the seaman dunwoody walk to the lee bulwark and hurl a bucket of slops over the side he had just emerged from the forecastle so had probably been with gallimore he had still not died but had been moved to the cable tier the only place where the stench of the great slimy rope was matched by his own his wound had gone gangrenous and it seemed impossible for any man to stand the misery of it quinn said wearily i think we are both right sir with the wind staying as it is we should make a landfall the day after tomorrow bolitho handed his instrument to couzens so it was sir again he last link broken he said i agree we may sight the island of nevis tomorrow and after that it will be a hard beat all the way across to antigua he felt a sharp sense of loss the thought of losing the white hills seemed unbearable it was ridiculous of course just a few days but what confidence she had given him or had discovered in him bolitho glanced along the sunlit deck even that no longer seemed so narrow and confined after trojans spacious gundeck some of the wounded were resting in the shade chatting quietly or watching the other hands at work with professional interest bolitho asked quietly what will you do james quinn looked away as my father pleases i expect i seem to have the knack of obeying orders he faced bolitho suddenly one day if you want to i i mean if you have nowhere to go would you care to see me bolitho nodded wanting to strip away his despair it was killing him with no less mercy than gallimores wounds i will be happy to james he smiled although ive no doubt your father will think badly of a mere lieutenant in his house i expect youll be a rich merchant by the time i get to london quinn studied him anxiously something in bolithos tone seemed to comfort him and he said i thank you for that and much mdre deck there sail on the weather bow bolitho stared up at the lookout he tried to see the white hills like a cross on a chart there were so many islands french british dutch this sail could be any kind of ship since the kittiwake had left antigua anything might have happened peace with the american rebels war with france with a start he realized they were all looking at him he said get aloft mr quinn take a glass and tell me what you see frowd groaned as quinn hurried past god damn this leg i should be up them not not by the time he had thought of a suitable insult quinn was already hurrying up the shrouds bolitho paced rapidly back and forth trying to stay calm and unmoved she was quite likely a spaniard southward bound for the main and all its treasures if so she would soon haul off she might think white hills to be a pirate in these waters you could choose from a dozen sorts of enemy deck sir shes a brig one of the wounded men gave a thin cheer shell be one of ours lads but frowd rasped painfully you know what im thinking dont you bolitho looked at him his brain suddenly icecold of course it made sense cruel sense and they had got so far this time he had believed with success there was still a chance he held his voice steady as he called keep watching her to couzens he added more quietly ire shall have a closer look at her soon enough i imagine he saw the understanding clouding couzens eyes clear for action if you please then load but do not run out he glanced along the deck at the brigs small defences enough guns to rake the defenceless yawl but if the oncoming vessel was captain tracys previous command they would be all but useless none so gallant bolitho waited for the deck to steady again and then trained his telescope across the larboard bow he could see the other brigs topsails and topgallants sharply etched against the blue sky but the rest of the vessel was lost in distance and haze if the vessel was the revenge her master would recognize the white hills as soon as she was within reasonable distance he might have done so already to alter course away to wear completely and fly with the wind would tell him what had happened quicker than any challenge bolitho looked up at the masthead pendant the wind had backed a point or so further it was tempting to turn and run but if the wind went against them again and they were repeatedly made to change tack the other brig would soon overhaul them with only a small prizecrew to work the ship bolitho knew it would be asking too much of any man he said let her fall off a point stockdale from the mainmast he heard quinn call i can see her better now shes the old mischief im almost certain frowd swore bloody hell wed better show her a clean pair of heels y stockdale said noreast by east sir bolitho cupped his hands man the braces you buller put more men on the weather forebrace he watched narrowly as the yards moved slightly to allow each sail to fill to capacity but not enough to betray an attempt to escape couzens came running aft his hands filthy his shirt torn in several places cleared for action sir all guns loaded bolitho smiled tightly by all guns couzens meant the white hills eight sixpounders she was designed to carry fourteen and some swivels but the sinking of the yawl had put paid to that eight guns and only four on either beam to try and shift a full battery to one side would certainly be seen by the other brig she was growing in size at a surprising speed and bolitho could see the sun reflecting on metal or perhaps the glass of several telescopes she was closing with the white hills on a converging tack bowsprit to bowsprit the white hills original crew had been new and raw but the revenges master would certainly know tracy by sight they must try and stand off keep up some sort of bluff until dusk land on the lee bow sir the lookout had been keeping his eyes open too while quinn watched the other brig bolitho looked at frowd seeing his despair the land was most likely to be one or more of the tiny islands which marked their course past nevis and then fifty miles on to antigua it made it seem much worse so near yet so far brigs altered course sir then another cry shes run up her flag bolitho nodded grimly hoist the same one mr couzens he watched as the red and white striped flag ran up to the gaff and broke to the wind frowd was straining up on the hatch cover no use blast his eyes hes closing and making sure he can keep the windgage hell want to speak with us to find out if we got the guns and powder this brig was probably meant to join with him at some point bolitho was thinking aloud and saw frowd nod in agreement stockdale pulled at couzens sleeve get the real flag ready mr couzens i cant see our lieutenant fighting under false colours not today frowd said despairingly how can we fight you fool these privateers are always armed to the gills they need to smash an enemy into submission as fast as they can and before help can be sent to drive em off he groaned fight you must be mad bolitho made up his mind we will begin to shorten sail directly as if we are about to speak with him if we can get near enough without rousing suspicion well rake his poop do for as many of the afterguard as possible and then run for it stockdale nodded later we could shift two guns aft sir a stern chase is bettern nothin bolitho made himself stand quite still to give his mind time to work he had no other choice and this was not much of one but it was either a sudden act of daring or surrender take in the mainsl bolitho watched the few spare hands swarming up the ratlines the other master would see tine depleted crew and might imagine they had been in a battle the gash through the bulwark made by trojans eighteenpounder must be plain enough to we he levelled his glass on the other vessel ignoring the shouts and curses as his men fought with the rebellious canvas frowd was right she was heavily armed and there were plenty of men about her deck too he wondered what had happened to her original captain when she had been captured from under him fourteen guns and a determined company would make her a formidable enemy bolitho watched her tilting towards him revealing her maindeck the line of guns on the opposite side none was manned but on this side he could see a few heads peering over the sealed gunports and guessed they were probably loaded and ready moffitt crossed the deck and said dourly youll be needin me sir i know how to speak to them bastards be ready he studied the set of each sail the lively froth around the privateers stem as she edged over even furtaer her yards moving as if controlled by one hand half a mile not long now he shifted his glance inboard seing the quick anxious gestures of his small company even the wounded were craning their heads and trying to see above the weather bulwark come down mr quinn bolitho looked at stockdale and butler see that our people beep their weapons out of sight when i give the word i want those four ouns run out as smartly as you like and are at will if we can mark down her officers we may use the surprise to fight clear quinn arrived beside him breathing fast his eyes towards the enemy dyou think they are on to us no bolitho folded his arms hoping that across the glittering pattern of waves and spray he would appear more relaxed than he felt they would have run down on us before now they have all the advantage if the wind chose this moment to change he shut his mind to the possibility and concentrated on the sails and masthead pendant the wind which was fresh and steady came from the northwest the white hills had her yards well braced heeling on the larboard tack the wind across her quarter if they could just delay the other captains suspicions and then hold him off until dark they might well lose him amongst the islands when daylight returned and even then if the privateers captain was so set on another victory and made further contact they might be able to give him the slip further north or in the narrows between nevis and st christophers in those treacherous waters off some deadly place like the scotch bonnet they might even tempt their pursuer aground the only ally at this precarious stage was the wind both brigs were carrying the bulk of their sails so either could tack or come about with agility if need be stockdale observed she must be steerin almost soueast sir the wind right astern of er bolitho nodded knowing stockdale wanted to help if only by making a professional comment the range had dropped to a mere quartermile and it was possible to see the watching figures on the other vessels poop and forecastle when she tries to hail us moffitt tell her captain that tracy is sick badly wounded after a brush with the british he saw the man tighten his lips its no lie so keep it simple eh moffitt said coldly ill see that he dont recover if them buggers board us sir along the weather side the seamen were crawling on their hands and knees like strange worshippers around the four small cannon ball and grape to each gun it would not even be felt by a stately twodecker like trojan but one good blast across the enemys quarterdeck might do the trick time time time it was like a hammer on an anvil two small shadows moved on the revenges side and bolitho heard a murmur of anxiety from some of the wounded seamen revenge had raised two of her forward port lids and as he watched he saw the sunlight touch a pair of black muzzles as she ran out the guns frowd muttered uneasily he knows the bugger bolitho shook his head i think not he would run out a broadside if he was sure of an enemy and maybe tack across our stern again it was like sharing his thoughts with those around him hell have been watching us all this time as we have him tracy s absence from the deck will have been noted if revenges captain is newly appointed hell be wary of taking a chance but unwilling to show fear or uncertainty to his men following a man like tracy must be quite a task he saw some of his seamen glance at each other for support to discover a new confidence but he knew he was only guessing out of sheer hope revenges captain might be even more experienced than tracy and at this very moment was using the white hills unchanged tack for one terrible bombardment his guns already manned and ready to fire moffitt took a speaking trumpet and climbed casually into the weather shrouds it was far too early but it might lull the enemys caution if not the fight would explode across this deck within fifteen minutes bolitho said evenly you men carry mr frowd and the other wounded below if we have to abandon the quarter boat will be used for them only frowd swivelled round on his hatch cover like an enraged terrier damn your eyes ill not die like a sick woman he grimaced as the pain stabbed through him and he continued in a more controlled tone i meant no disrespect sir but try and see it my way and which way is that frowd swayed about like a bush in a wind as the hull lifted and sliced through the choppy water if your plan works sir and i pray to god it does it will be a chase which only luck and superior seamanship can wim bolitho smiled perhaps but as i suspect we may have to fight for gods sake let me play my part i have been in the navy all my remembered years to end my time cowering below when the metal flies overhead would make my life as worthless as that of any gallowsbird very well bolitho looked at couzens help the lieutenant aft and see that he is supplied with enough powder and shot to reload the pistols and muskets to give an impression of strength and greater numbers frowd exclaimed thats it sir i ask for nothing more those devils will outnumber us four to one maybe more we can take a few with us if we can maintain rapid fire it was incredible bolitho thought the prospect of sudden death had been made suddenly stark and inevitable by frowds words and yet the previous apprehension seemed to have gone the waiting had been the worst part the simple task of fighting and dying was something they all understood it was like hearing sparke all over again keep them busy no time to moan and weaken he turned to watch as the revenges jib and staysails quivered and flapped like tapered wings and knew she was falling off a little more to run even closer to the white hills nearer she looked impressive and well armed her hull was weatherbeaten and the sails stained and patched in several places she must have been made to work and fight hard against her previous owners bolitho thought grimly we will give her a few more minutes stockdale and then you can bring her round to steer due east it will be the obvious thing to do if we are to draw close enough to speak he winced as a handspike clattered across the deck and a other vessel moffitt had seen what he had not even dared to hope for maybe it was gallimores screams which added to moffitts outward confidence and the fact that the white hills was the right vessel in almost the right place had convinced revenges captain that all was well but there was still the matter of tracy s new orders probably details of the next rendezvous or news of a supply convoy left open to attack in a few moments revenges captain would have to face the fact he was now in the senior position he was the one who would have to decide what to do bolitho said quietly hell suggest we both heave to so that he can come over to us and speak with tracy and see how he is quinn stared at him his face like a mask will we go about then sir aye bolitho stole a quick glance at the masthead pendant the moment he decides to shorten sail and head into the wind well use our chance he called to the nearest gun crew be ready lads he saw an overeager seaman struggling off his knees and reaching for a slowmatch belay that wait for the word the revenges captain called well heave to ill be over to you as soon as he got no further like some terrifying creature emerging from a tomb captain jonas tracy lurched through the forehatch his eyes bulging from his head with agony and fury he carried a pistol which he fired at a seaman who ran to restrain him the ball smashing the man in the forehead and hurling him on his back in a welter of blood and all the time he was bellowing his voice stronger than most of the men around him rake the bastard its a trick you damn fool from the other brig came a series of shouts and confused orders and then like bewildered hogs the guns began to run out through the ports along her side another seaman hurried towards the swaying figure by the hatch only to be clubbed senseless by the pistol that last effort was more than enough blood was spurting through the wad of bandages around his armpit and his stubbled face seemed to be whitening even as he tried to drag himself to the nearest gun as if the life was flooding out of him bolitho saw it all as in a wild dream with events and sequences overlapping yet totally separate gallimores sudden cries had lured tracy s guard from his post and who could blame him tracy s terrible wound should have been enough to kill almost anyone and revenges captains voice calling across to moffitt must have somehow dragged tracy from his unconscious state to sudden violent action whatever had begun it bolitho knew there was no chance at all of completing his flimsy plan he yelled run out he watched his men hurling themselves on their tackles the four guns squeaking to the open ports with desperation matched only by despair fire as the guns crashed out in a ragged salvo bolitho shouted stockdale put the helm down as stockdale and a helmsman spun the spokes bolitho dragged out his hanger knowing that nothing nothing on earth could change this moment he heard startled shouts from his own men and musket shots from the revenge as like a wild animal the white hills responded to the helm and swung up into the wind sails shaking and convulsing as the other vessel appeared to charge right across her bowsprit there were several isolated shots his or theirs bolitho did not know he was running forward his feet slipping on blood as he tore past the dying tracy towards the point of impact like a great tusk the jib boom smashed through revenges rigging and stays the impact shaking the hull and deck with the force of going aground and still the wind and the white hills impetus drove them harder and faster together until with a tremendous crash followed by the sounds of spars splintering in half the two brigs came together in a brutal embrace bolithos ears were ringing to the sounds of falling rigging and thrashing sails of revenges topmast complete with topgallant and a mountain of uncontrollable canvas plunging down through the drifting gunsmoke to add to the destruction but he was angry wildly so and could not control himself as he waved his hanger and shouted come on lads at em he saw the dazed faces change to maddened excitement as they responded in a small tide they charged towards the bows while from aft bolitho could hear frowd and his collection of cripples firing across the arrowhead of water with every weapon they could lay hands on and here was the enemys deck right beneath his legs staring eyes and wild shouts while others struggled and kicked beneath the severed rigging and splintered woodwork a bayonet lunged out and sent a seaman screaming down into the smoke but bolitho let himself drop felt his feet find their balance on the other deck while on either side of him his boarding party surged forward to the attack the man with the bayoneted musket swung wildly to face him but stockdale seized him and smashed the cutlassguard in his mouth as the man toppled away stockdale hacked him across the neck and finished it the first shocked surprise at seeing the white hills turn towards them and deliberately force herself into a collision would soon give way to a rage and determination to overwhelm that of the boarders this bolitho knew but at a distance as if it were already beyond his reach once as he ducked beneath a fallen yard to slash a man across the arm who was aiming a pistol at somebody bolitho caught a glimpse of his brief command with her big mainyard sprung in two like a giants longbow and with the canvas and rigging piled over her forecastle like so much rubbish she looked almost a wreck beyond the debris and licking above the thinning smoke he saw a patch of scarlet and realized that despite everything which had happened he had given the order to run up the colours and yet could remember nothing about it this way lads it was buller brandishing a boarding axe and a pistol fight yer way aft then he fell his face set in an expression of complete surprise now so gallant z bolitho gritted his teehh time which they had won with such care had run out from the revenges quarterdeck came the crash of a swivel gun and bolitho realized that someone was still firing at the white hills above the din of clashing steel screams and curses he heard answering shots ad could picture frowd yelling defiance and waiting to die somehow they had fought their way to the midships part of the deck where the piled debris of cordage and broken spars made every move doubly hard but where if you hesitated it was asking to be killed he saw dunwoody rolling over and over on the bloodied deck struggling with one of the revenges seamen one hand cut to shreds as he tried to hold off the mans dirk while he groped for his fallen cutlass another man ran from the smoke raised a boarding pike and drove it through dunwoody s neck pinioning his kicking body to the planking until the dirk stabbed him into stillness bolitho saw it all and as he struggled over an upended gig he found himself face to face with the revenges captain beyond him he could see the abandoned wheel and the torn splinters standing up from the quarterdeck like quills the sprawled bodies and crawling wounded who had fallen to the four doubly loaded sixpounders bolitho ducked as the mans blade sliced above his head caught his foot in a trailing rope and fell heavily on his side he watched the blade rise and plunge towards him again and held up his hanger to take the brunt of the blow the numbing shock jarred his shoulder like a kick and he saw the other officer turn and run aft leaving bolitho rather than face a sudden rally of the boarding party rabbett his cutlass bloody to the hilt carlsson the swede with a bayoneted musket he must have snatched from one of the brigs men even borga the roman cook who held a dirk in either hand like one of his ancestors in the gladiators arena were still here and ready to fight on the far side of the deck he saw quinn with the rest of the boarders whitefaced and with blood running from his forehead locked in combat with twice his own number bolitho saw couzens and yelled hoarsely get back aboard i told you to stay with mr frowd he gasped and ducked as a shadow passed in front of him then with a sharp twist of his arm he brought the hanger round to lock with his attackers cutlass the man was a petty officer of sorts and he guessed as english as himself youve bitten off too much this time sir bolitho felt the mans strength forcing him back the blade inches from his chest it was not that he was a better swordsman but his voice if not cornish was certainly from bolithos own west country moffitt rose shaking his head like a prizefighter the blood of another victim glittering on his cutlass and you bolitho fell back with the petty officer on top of him moffitts blade had been driven into his spine with such force it was a wonder it had not pinioned both of them couzens was ducking and sidestepping wildly as figures staggered and kicked around him like madmen steel on steel and from right aft a chorus of screams as a swivel exploded and burst apart amongst its own crew but he managed to shout i came to help bolitho shook his arm feeling him cringe as he said take two men and get below tell them i want this brig set alight he knew the boy was terrified of him his wildness and his despair do it shots were hitting the deck around him and making the corpses jerk to their impact the revenges captain had sent marksmen aloft to mark down frowds puny challenge and to kill any of the boarders who looked like an officer or a leader stockdale bellowed watch out sir he lunged forward as a man rushed at bolitho with a cutlass but was not quick enough bolitho saw the fury on the seamans contorted features and wondered if he himself looked like that if that was why couzens had seemed so frightened of him the heavy cutlass grated across bolithos swordbelt scoring the brass plate like a musketball bolitho saw the mans expression change to fear then to nothing as the hanger opened his face from eye to jaw and threw him screaming into the men behind him bolitho felt sick worn out and stunned by the savagery of battle couzens would not be able to fire the brig and in any case they had started to cheer the battle was nearly done like quinn he had tried there it was again wild and uncontrolled huzza huzzaf bolitho stared at stockdale that was no enemy he swung round dropping his guard for the first time as through the forehatch came a sudden rush of dirty unshaven figures couzens was running with them beside himself with ecstasy as he shouted prisoners sir he was pushed away by the released men as they snatched up fallen cutlasses belaying pins anything which could hit or maim their old captors bolitho thought he must be going mad and yet it was happening they were obviously seamen captured in previous battles maybe some from this very brig but they charged through the dwindling boarding party like an avenging tidal wave beating down the privateers crew and hurling some of them over the side in their determination to seize the poop bolitho shouted come on lads one last effort then cheering and yelling meaningless words he ran with the rest his arm like lead as he hacked and parried cat and pushed his way aft a few shots were still hitting the deck nearby and without warning a seaman slithered down a stay and snatched a pistol from his belt his face frozen in concentration as he stared at the onrushing figures he must have known that nothing could save him and yet some last spark of anger or pride held him there couzens found himself face to face with him bolitho saw what was happening but was several paces away and stockdale further still bolitho shouted hoarsely you shoot and i will kill you the mans eyes did not even flicker and bolitho knew he was going to fire he could even see the trigger starting to give under his finger a figure bounded over a pile of tangled sails and threw himself between the pistol and the stricken couzens so that the shot was almost muffled bolitho ran and caught quinn as he fell he did not see stockdales big cutlass swing but heard just a sharp grunt as the other man died bolitho held quinn and lowered him to the deck he knew he was dying and there was nothing he could do the ball had entered his stomach and there was blood everywhere quinn gasped sorry to leave you sir bolitho held him firmly knowing stockdale was guarding his back and that couzens was kneeling on the deck beside him sobbing uncontrollably dick he said remember eh he felt near to tears himself what made it worse if that were possible was the cheering aft in another world his jubilant sailors and the released captives were hauling down the flag watched by the revenges captain who had been badly wounded in the last charge bolitho said quietly we won james its done quinn smiled his eyes looking up through the torn rigging and sails you did he was finding it difficult to speak and his skin looked like damp wax bolitho unbuttoned his shirt seeing the great cruel scar from quinns first battle with his free hand he loosened his crossbelt and said gently and you were supposed to be a passenger but for you young couzens would be dead ill see they know about it in england about your courage quinns eyes shifted to bolithos face im not afraid any more he coughed and some blood ran down his chin dick bolitho was about to speak when he saw the light go from quinns eyes like a candle being snuffed out very carefully he lowered quinns shoulders to the deck and then stood up stockdale touched his elbow be easy sir the people are watchin bolitho nodded his eyes almost blind with strain and emotion thank you yes he faced the weary but triumphant seamen it had been a near thing but these men had done as well as anyone could they deserved every last effort no matter how he was feeling he said quietly that was well done for a company so small there could be none so gallant three days later the two prizes sailed into english harbour under the eyes of the whole squadron it had been a hard three days repairing damage just enough to carry them to antigua selecting the released prisoners and sharing them between the two brigs it should have been a proud moment for bolitho but the sadness of quinns death was still with him when the lookout reported land in sight he had taken command of the revenge and one of the first jobs he had ordered after rigging the jurymast and burying the dead of both sides had been the removal of her new name beneath which jonas tracy had painted the favoured motto dont tread on me with the serpent insignia for good measure as the land had grown out of the sea haze and the two brigs had tacked carefully towards the harbour a patrolling frigate had run down on them to investigate couzens had called what shall i tell them sir stockdale had looked at bolithos features and had thought he had understood he had said ill do it mr couzens then he had cupped his big hands and had shouted across for all to hear his majestys brig mischief is rejoining the fleet it had been a very special moment for him as he had added lieutenant richard bolitho in command
