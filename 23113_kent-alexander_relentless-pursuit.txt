alexander kent relentless pursuit bolitho for you kim with all my love and a yellow rose the sheets were frozen hard and they cut the naked hand the decks were like a slide where a seaman scarce could stand but all i could think of in the darkness and the cold was just that i was leaving home and my folks were growing old robert louis stevenson from christmas at sea no turning back plymouth always one of england s most important and strategically situated seaports seemed strangely quiet subdued even plymouth sound notorious for its fast tides and unexpectedly fierce squalls was almost still but for some cruising cats paws from a light offshore breeze but it was cold the air bitter like a knife edge and only a few small local craft seemed willing to contest it it was middecember six months to the day since the news had broken of the victory at waterloo and the final surrender of the corsican tyrant who had held power for so long boys had grown to manhood in the course of that same conflict plough hands and stable lads alike had been transformed into sailors and soldiers now it was over and seaports like plymouth which had given so much and so many were still numbed by the reality of peace and its aftermath even when the noon gun shattered the silence and rolled its echoes from the hoe to the old battery at penlee point only a few gulls rose screaming from the water the spirits of dead jacks the sailors called them maybe they felt it too from here great fleets and powerful squadrons had weighed anchor and had headed out to every part of the world where englands enemies were at large and famous names the nile copenhagen trafalgar had filled the hearts and minds particularly of those who did not have to fight and had no loved ones facing the merciless broadsides which took the lives of volunteers and pressed men without discrimination at the end of the war the fleet had been at its strongest with ships of the line some frigates and countless other smaller vessels ready and able to perform whatever task their lordships of admiralty might dictate there were ships here now plenty of them it was a sunday but in those other times it would have made no difference when the noon gun was fired there had been signals to be exchanged chronometers to be checked the daily routine continued but today many of those same ships were like ghosts some with upper yards sent down and boats removed for storage ashore and in some cases the scars of a last desperate sea fight still unrepaired as if their companies had been spirited away ships already laid up in ordinary some waiting to be hulked or used for storing unwanted equipment a few would become floating prisons and some perhaps would live on to fight again only one small craft moved with any apparent purpose and direction it was a gig oars rising and falling precisely and unhurriedly the crew smartly turned out in tarred hats and matching blue jackets a coxswain with one hand on the tiller bar a midshipman beside hire eyes on the passage among the silent ships the phantom fleet and in the sternsheets boatcloak thrown back over his shoulders to reveal his gleaming epaulettes was the captain who needed no reminding of the significance of this day captain adam bolitho did not glance at the passing ships but it was a moment he would never forget he would know the names of some even of many of them silent and deserted now their gun ports empty like staring eyes but he would hear the cries and the wild cheering still audible amidst the darker memories of war at sea the seaports were full of reminders men crippled and blinded and others left to beg on the streets and there would be many more now thrown on the beach while the fleet was cut to the bone their courage and sacrifice forgotten adam gripped the old sword beneath his cloak until his fingers throbbed emotion pride anger it was all there on this bitter cleansing day he turned and looked up as the gig passed through the shadow of an anchored seventyfour an old twodecker like hyperion against the bleak cloudless sky he saw a solitary figure standing on a gangway to watch the gig as they pulled past then very slowly he raised his hat and held it above his head in salute until the jutting stern hid him from view a watchman someone still finding refuge in the world which had rejected him or just another ghost he heard the midshipman clear his throat he was new they had met for the first time when the gig had picked him up at the queens stairs another young hopeful nervous with his captain in his care adam had seen the wary glance from luke jago his coxswain he would allow nothing to go wrong no matter what he thought or said he would know what this day meant to his captain just as jago would have known where and when to collect him without a signal having been made or any instructions given he felt the tiller move slightly and looked along the boat over the heads of the oarsmen their breath hanging in the cold air like steam like that first day just over a year ago in this same place he stared at his ship when i took command he had been away from the ship for two weeks and had barely had time to think over and remember that past year the sea fights the triumphs and the pain official visits and others no less important to him at least and all the while he had looked forward to this moment coming back like being made whole again it was something like a shock nevertheless the ship had been moved during his absence and now lay at her cable well clear of all the other vessels and even her appearance came as a surprise the familiar huff paint around her hull had been replaced by white so that her strakes and black gun ports along either side made an even sharper chequered pattern clean and fresh against the stained and deserted hulks nearby his britannic majestys frigate unrivalled of guns was one of the first to wear the new peacetime colours she was also the first ship of her name on the navy list he stood up in the boat as the hull rose above the tossed oars and he was her first captain it was enough there was nothing else the bowman had hooked on and the side party would be waiting faces new or old ready to receive him what had i expected that they would take her from me he glanced at the midshipman but the youths name would not come that was well done the boy blushed and jago remarked mr martyns is learning fast sir adam nodded it was jagos way he would remember next time the calls squealed and he heard the slap of muskets as the royal marine guard presented arms in salute it was all as he had expected the ensign curling against the cold sky the seamen faces still tanned from unrivalleds service in the mediterranean the smell of fresh paint like that other december day a year ago he saw none of it being hack was enough lieutenant leigh galbraith strode in from beneath unrivalleds poop and ran his eyes over the main deck everything was in order he had made certain that nothing had been left to chance today the captain was returning his own period of temporary command would soon be over he frowned as the hard light reflected from the water he had been pulled around the ship as soon as the hands had been piped to work and had still been surprised by her appearance the white paint took some getting used to almost frivolous compared with the moored hulks nearby and only the experienced eye could discern the new timbers which had repaired damage suffered in their savage exchange with the frigate triton only months ago some of the repairs had been carried out at gibraltar and the rest here at plymouth where unrivalleds life had begun where galbraith himself had been given another chance he was lucky and he knew it and with the whole fleet being cut down halved some said he should count his blessings and leave the bitterness to others less fortunate galbraith was and he had spent nineteen years of his life in the navy he knew and had wanted nothing else except a command of his own and that he had been granted his previous captain had given him the highest recommendation and his reward had been the little brig vixen not a fifthrate like unrivalled but his own and the first step to the coveted post rank he saw partridge the boatswain big fists on his hips as he explained forcefully what work he needed done in the foretop thank god for men like partridge he thought the backbone of any manofwar they were the true professionals partridge stranace the gunner probably the oldest man aboard and joshua cristie the sailing master the best galbraith had known a man who never wasted words but when he spoke it was with authority and a complete understanding of the tides stars and winds which were his world as the frigates first lieutenant galbraith was most aware of and concerned with the shortages they were more than fifty men under strength despite their presence in this naval harbour he smiled grimly or perhaps because of it apart from those they had lost killed or badly wounded in the last battle some had been paid off or had gone to other ships but a few of the old hands had remained even some of the hard men like campbell who had paid for his insolence and contempt for authority with several floggings in this commission alone he seemed to find some brutal satisfaction in displaying his scarred back which looked as if it had been clawed by some savage beast a dangerous man and yet he had been one of the first to volunteer for the attack on the corsairs chehecks when they had pulled alongside with enough explosives to kill every one of them campbell had been a tower of strength but he would sneer openly at anyone who suggested he had acted out of a sense of duty or discipline there were others like campbell men who claimed to hate everything the navy represented and more especially the officers who upheld it so why did they stay when they now had the chance to quit galbraith saw luxmore the captain of the royal marine detachment speaking with one of his sergeants whatever went on around them no matter how cramped the ship they somehow remained a separate entity even their quarters were called the barracks luxmore had seen plenty of fighting and he had a good rapport with his marines maybe that was enough galbraith looked away or was he congratulating himself on his advanced promotion the debonair captain bosanquet had been killed that day like me then thankful to have survived and to have a ship because of fear of the unknown he saw the boy napier the cabin servant pausing to stare at the land he probably knew the captains thoughts better than anyone fourteen years old serious and hardworking and obviously devoted to captain adam bolitho an unusual relationship he thought bolitho was not always the easiest man to understand and had sometimes apologised for his own intolerance as if something or somebody was driving him forcing him on and yet with napier he always seemed to have time to explain to describe to elaborate the only way hell learn he once said as if he saw something of his own youth in him that must have been stormy enough from what galbraith had heard and had seen for himself like that last engagement when bolitho had given chase to the enemy frigate captained by the renegade spaniard martinez he had deliberately misinterpreted their admirals signal to remain on station and leave the pursuit to a smaller frigate which had been outgunned and outsailed from the start and they had saved the merchantman aran more which had been carrying important passengers he glanced at the companion ladder and remembered bolitho holding the womans hand kissing it they could have been quite alone galbraith began to pace the deck his hands clasped behind him was it that as well had she reminded him yet again of the girl he had hoped to marry and had lost when he had put his brief command first he thought too of bolithos reluctance to become close to anyone in his new command he had lost a frigate anemone fighting a more powerful american ship had been taken prisoner and had escaped it was as if he had found it impossible since then to reach out to accept and to trust and there was yet another side to the man a stark contrast cristie had told galbraith about the day when he had openly disagreed with his captain for cristie it was a thing almost unheard of galbraiths raiding party had been amongst littleknown islands and the master had advised that it was unsafe to take unrivalled through a channel which was virtually uncharted and which might rip out the ships keel a captains total responsibility cristie had confided after the successful recovery of the raiding party fair mad he was ill roust in hell htfore i leave galbraith to die in their hands he said i dont go much for praying but i tell you i nearly did that time and when they had stood together in the church at falmouth the first time unrivalled had dropped anchor there the church full of people the streets also and total silence for the man who had died at sea the captains famous uncle sir richard bolitho lady catherine somervell had been there with them so beautiful so alone despite the crowds where was she now what would become of her the woman who had defied society and had been sir richards lover and inspiration and had won the heart of the country the deck moved slightly and he saw the ship in his thoughts as clearly as he had this morning a thoroughbred like the carved inscription beneath her figurehead second to none unrivalled was eager to move the first and perhaps the last of her kind in the yard where she had been laid down built and launched galbraith had seen her only sister ship the same fine lines the pride of any craftsman but abandoned unfinished dead lie stared along the deck at the two lines of eighteenpounders their tackles and hreechings taut and neat and recalled massie who had been the next senior in the wardroom a flag officers son and a gunnery man to his fingertips not one you would ever know quiet and selfcontained even on the day he had been killed shot down as he had rallied his people he had been replaced here in plymouth by lieutenant george varlo a complete contrast lively talkative and in his midtwenties he must have had some influence every appointment now was like pure gold galbraith had decided that he would hide his time with varlo i le almost smiled maybe he had got that from the captain he turned in his pacing as the noon gun echoed mournfully across the water and the watching veterans even without the large oldfashioned watch he had always carried captain bolitho would be right on time he heard midshipman sandells sharp petulant voice berating one of the new men they were over fifty hands short of approved complement petty tyrants like sandell would be no loss at all gigs in sight that was bellairs the third lieutenant who had been the senior midshipman when unrivalled had commissioned it would be a challenge to him galbraith thought some of the old jacks would recall him as just another young gentleman neither fish nor fowl and still look for some weakness to exploit but he was a popular choice and had settled into the wardroom well and seemed grateful for his change of circumstance he smiled again and walked to the entry port the marines were fallen in and dressed in two impeccable ranks swaying very gently to the ships quiet motion he saw obeirne the portly surgeon hurrying to the companion down to his own world on the orlop where some had died and others had survived he watched the gig returning pulling around one of the abandoned ships bolithos coxswain was another rebel or so it had first appeared the boat was turning toward the main chains the bowman already standing with his hook raised royal marines ready the boatswains mates moistened their silver calls on their tongues and gazed at the entry port galbraith gripped his sword and pressed it to his side for two weeks he had been in charge of this ship and every hour of her routine completing repairs taking on stores and fresh water powder and shot men to be sworn in and issued with clothing it was a far cry from some ships he had known when some of the poor wretches dragged aboard by the press gangs had worn their own clothes to shreds before a grasping purser could be persuaded to dole out garments from his slop chest and now that responsibility was over the captain had returned galbraith stepped forward his hand to his hat as the calls shrilled in salute and the marines went through their drill he watched the captain as he climbed through the entry port eyes moving quickly over and above his ship at moments like this a stranger again adam took his hand and shook it a long two weeks i le glanced at the other officers and then forward the length of the ship galbraith waited feeling it all again they had done so much in a year of action and triumph disappointment and grief he was surprised ashamed even this man who could be so youthful one moment so grimly determined when he had made a decision which might affect each one of them was still so distant so unknown galbraith recognised it the old enemy which he had thought laid to rest envy welcome aboard sir it was done adam bolitho walked to the sloping windows of the stern cabin and stared out at the anchorage the other ships looked even more desolate through the wet misty glass and it was cold only to be expected in december but a far cry from the mediterranean malta or algiers unrivalled was a big frigate but the only heat came from her galley stove he should he used to it able to accept or ignore it he knew galbraith was watching him his tall frame slightly angled between the deck beams the boy napier was just inside the sleeping compartment he could see his shadow moving up and down as he unpacked one of his captains chests doubtless with a ready ear cocked in case he was needed youve done well leigh he turned away from the damp glass in time to catch the expression on the strong features galbraith still found it hard to accept a captains use of his first name in his absence the barrier had returned perhaps it had never truly gone away are the new people settled in galbraith seemed to consider it as if taken aback by the question when all he and most of the others had been concerned about were their orders their place in things their world ive warned the officers to be ready in the wardroom yes i shall want to speak with them he shivered and moved restlessly to the opposite quarter strain excitement or the fact that he had not had more than a few hours sleep for days he thought of galbraiths words in the wardroom he had noticed the plume of smoke from the galley funnel had caught the heavy smell of rum even as he had been piped aboard small real things they also reminded him that he had not eaten since yesterday he said abruptly men we must get more hands we can train them almost bitterly it came out we shall have all the time we need ive done what i can with the watch bills sir a mixture of old and new hands in each part of ship adam said i am told that we may attract some experienced hands in penzance he looked at the stern windows again trying to accept it one of the big packet companies has been forced to give way to competition with so many trained seamen tossed on the beach they can pick and choose it would seem he made another attempt i have obtained some posters usher can deal with it he stared at the small empty table by the screen door where usher his clerk had always sat quiet and attentive making notes and copying letters and orders a handkerchief always balled in one fist trying valiantly to stifle the coughs a nervous man who had once been a pursers assistant he had seemed totally out of place in the crowded confines of a fighting ship his lungs had been diseased all too common in a manofwar as the surgeon had put it usher had been dying a day at a time forgive me it was as if he had spoken to the little clerk who had finally died on their passage hack from gibraltar within a days sighting of the cornish coast they had buried him at sea there were no details of home or relatives lie stared at the curved beams and the reflection of the black and white checkered deck covering this ship had been ushers home too lie thought suddenly painfully of the big grey house in falmouth people crowding around kindness warmth and curiosity i le touched the sword at his hip and then unclipped it the constant reminder if he had needed one like all the old portraits in the house the watching faces some with ships in the background some not but always the sword flow empty the house had seemed bryan ferguson had been overjoyed to see him and had tried not to disturb him with the signing of papers relating to the estate and the farms the people who had always known there was a bolitho to care for them or his lady when he was at sea now there were only memories he had intended to make the journey to fallowfield to visit the little inn the old hyperion but ferguson had persuaded him against it the roads were deeply rutted unsafe he had seen ice for himself in the place where roses would bloom again in the new year catherines roses or had ferguson been afraid of the effect on alldav if the had met so unexpectedly or on me galbraith saw the play of emotions on his captains face like a young colt someone had once described him hair so dark that it was almost black a mouth which could be determined even hard equally it could show a rare sensitivity as it had now at the mention of ushers name that was the true difference he cared for these people he led and commanded in some ships galbraith had known it was not always the same thing abrupt impatient stubborn adam bolitho had revealed each mood throughout the months they had served together but galbraith felt privileged to have sometimes seen the other side to this youthful copy of the famous richard bolitho and to have shared it adam said i shall leave you to take charge of recruiting parties remember we are looking for men not begging for them he smiled quickly that was unnecessary leigh i am bad company today galbraith was about to reply when he sensed something like an unspoken warning adam bolitho had originally come from penzance or very close to it was that the reason for his dismissal of the task he said i can deal with it sir our marines will put on a good display adam scarcely heard him i saw the flag officer plymouth twice in fact viceadmiral keen sir you have known him a long time i believe yes he saw the boy watching from the screen and said fetch me something hot will you he laid the sword on the bench seat some cognac too i think the door closed only the marine sentry stood between them and the whole ship in confidence he raised his hand as if to dispel something but it must be between ourselves he glanced toward the table again as if expecting the cough or one of ushers usual meticulous explanations of what he was doing we shall leave plymouth tomorrow he gazed at galbraith directly does that present a problem galbraith said no sir and saw the dark restless eyes return to the old sword after penzance where additional orders will be waiting for us we shall proceed to gibraltar he attempted to smile better weather with good fortune but it eluded him galbraith was suddenly tense no routine orders they were not rejoining the fleet or one of the local squadrons he considered all the laidup ships what was left of them adam said quietly sierra leone i shall receive full instructions when their lordships believe me fit and ready to proceed galbraith waited like a burning fuse that day among the islands the charges exploding in what might have been a suicide attack a reckless and ambitious operation he recalled once more what cristie had told him ill roast in bell before i leave galbraith to die in their hands sierra leone to galbraith and most other sea officers it meant the slave trade he could dismiss that idea unrivalled was too big and powerful to he wasted on hitandmiss antislavery patrols schooners and brigs were the usual choice he was surprised to find that he did not care the ship their ship was to go into service again they were fully repaired and supplied and if they could get a few volunteers they would be ready a fighting ship once more i would sail her singlehanded sir just to get away from this graveyard adam smiled it was far better to be like galbraith he was reminded suddenly of keen in that spacious house commanding the sea and the countryside in one unending panorama where he himself had walked with keens wife zenoria for so short a time before her tragic death keens second wife gilia had been there this time and had made him more than welcome and her pleasure had matched only keens pride in the revelation that a child was expected in the spring it was obvious that gilia had never told valentine keen what she knew of adams love for her predecessor who had thrown herself from a clifftop after her son by keen had died if keen suspected he hid it well he had confined their conversations to unrivalleds return to duty and her performance against the renegade frigate triton only once adam had sensed something as keen had remarked on the fine piece of work when they had caught and destroyed the big exdutchman by rescuing aranmore the government had been saved the embarrassment of having to parley with the dey of algiers for the release of hostages one glowing report of the chase and action had been sent by sir lewis bazeley one of the passengers and it was said a friend of the prime minister keens wife had commented bazeley he has a very pretty young wife i believe and keen had said you carried them earlier to malta adam an admirals discretion or was he still a friend once sir richard bolithos flag captain and one of his midshipmen like me galbraith probably knew or had guessed some of it he made up his mind i recommended you for a command again leigh i did not know sir adam shrugged someone might take notice he glanced at the door as napier opened it with one foot he had even discarded the squeaky shoes for this special day ill come to the wardroom in an hour galbraith strode from the cabin and gasped as his head banged against a deckhcad beam as if someone had shouted at him the captain needed every trained man that he could get the second lieutenant was as yet an unknown force bellairs had scarcely settled into his rank the most important officer in the ship to any captain under these circumstances was the first lieutenant especially one so experienced galbraith rubbed his head and grinned ruefully but hed have let me go if a ship was offered the marine sentrys eyes moved briefly beneath the brim of his leather hat officers talking aloud to themselves and they had not even upanchored yet he relaxed again it was something to tell the others galbraith thrust his way into the wardroom and tossed his hat to a messman they were all looking at him while pretending to be disinterested i will never be of erect a command he repeated it in his mind but the envy was gone viceadmiral valentine keen pulled the heavy curtain aside and stared out at the restless waters of the sound the sea would be livelier beyond in this steady northeasterly and it would still be light when unrivalled cleared the anchorage and found her way into open water fie thought of the growing ranks of paidoff ships and men she would be better off at sea any sea somewhere in this big house he had heard voices laughter people to be entertained encouraged or held at hay as circumstances dictated there were still times when it was almost impossible to accept he was the youngest viceadmiral since nelson with two captains six lieutenants and a veritable army of clerks and servants to do his bidding probably more if he raised the matter with the admiralty but like the captain who was uppermost in his thoughts on this cold december afternoon the final responsibility was his and his alone it was to be hoped that unrivalleds visit to penzance would bring a few more men forward to be signed on men who had possibly imagined that the only life worth living was outside the harsh and demanding world of a kings ship he thought of sir graham bethune who held the same rank as himself they had both served as midshipmen under sir richard bolitho keen had been promoted lieutenant aboard bolithos frigate undine when they had set sail for india and a world unknown to him without question or hesitation like the newly commissioned officer he had seen aboard unrivalled his mind fastened on the face and name bellairs he should do well if adam bolitho could put the pain behind him he had much to live up to he thought of penzance what it might mean to adam and much to live down the navy would have to change adapt to this new uneasy peace and brittle relationship with allies who had been enemies for so long he felt the wind buffet the windows but it was warm even in these huge rooms warm and safe he thought of the countless reports and accounts he had studied since he had become a flag officer it was still impossible for him to remain uninvolved always he had felt himself to be a part of it fleet action or shiptoship like adams fight with the renegade triton he had defied rhodes orders but success protected the brave sometimes admiral rhodes attempt to destroy the deys batteries had been a costly failure the capture of hostages would have made future dealings with the dey impossible a fresh attack was already being planned by a fleet this time and a horn fighter lord exmouth had already been selected to command it if rumour was to be believed but rhodes would not forget like an evil web rhodes cousin had died in an asylum driven mad by the syphilis which had destroyed his chance to be sir richards flag captain in frohish er keen frowned it had all been buried rhodes had seen to that but he would never forget and the admiral whose son had been it midshipman under adams first lieutenant during his first and only command the youth had caused the death of a seaman and galbraith had put him ashore to await an enquiry that too had been buried and the midshipman appointed to another ship forgotten except by his father but galbraith would never get another ship of his own now unless some miracle happened he recalled the intensity of adams eyes his plea for galbraith as a captain in these circumstances would i have done it he heard a door open the rustle of her gown against the furniture and felt her hand on his arm so much a part of it and now there was the child to consider she asked have you seen her yet val few called him that only richard and his catherine and zcnoria he covered her hand with his own and smiled is it so obvious gilia she looked toward the sea that too she could share she had sailed many miles with her father a renowned ship designer it was good that he was not here to see all those fine vessels like veterans begging on the streets he will be all right val i feel it i know one of our best frigate captains and a fighter he tried to dismiss it adam would have to learn we all did i am no longer sure myself any more he felt her fingers tighten on his arm look val there she is they waited in silence watching the cruising patterns of whitecaps hearing that same wind probe beneath the eaves of boscawen house and there she stood her topsails and courses almost pink in the fading light adam was taking advantage of the wind to carry him clear of the headland before he set more canvas even from here the occasional feathers of spray were visible bursting up and over her beakhead and jib sails but keen saw it all with great clarity as if he were there the lovely figurehead the naked girl with her hands locked behind her head and mane of hair her breasts thrusting toward the horizon he would have liked to have seen the anchor break from the ground and rise swiftly to her cathead there would probably have been a fiddler keeping time for the stamping feet some inexperienced on that slippery planking as we did together so many times so many seas the greatest moment until the landfall some out there would be feeling the first pangs of regret it would be christmas before they knew it he could feel her hand gripping his arm and knew what she was thinking that they were together and with gods grace she would never have to watch his ship leaving like this never knowing when or if he would return like so many others like richard and catherine and now adam who was alone there were more voices intruders ill go down val you stay a while longer he hugged her she always knew just as she had taken over this great house as if she had been bred to it lie looked again no unrivalleds cleared the point adam will be eager to make more sail now they walked arm in arm to the door past the great dark paintings of ships at war smoke flames and proud flags but no pain no blood the viceadmiral the youngest since nelson and his lovely wife ready and prepared for another kind of duty but once as the wind rattled a shutter keen did look back although he knew that unrivalled was now out of sight and he was with her the finest in the fleet captain adam bolitho loosened the collar of his heavy boatcloak and tugged his hat down more firmly on his dark hair as he paused at the street corner to recover his bearings or to prepare himself he was not certain which the wind off mounts bay was still like ice but had dropped considerably since unrivalled had made her final approach two days earlier buffeted this way and that her reefed canvas cracking and banging in protest it had been a relief to hear the anchor splash down and see the town of penzance bright and sharp in the wintry glare a relief or a warning he shook himself angrily ile would go through with it lie could hear his coxswain breathing heavily as if unused to the exercise and the steep ascent from the harbour curious or secretly amused it was hard to tell with luke jago the man who had always hated the navy in general and officers in particular and yet he was still here after the fighting and the madness of battle he had stayed and he was a friend a good one adam turned as two young boys ran past one carrying a crudely fashioned model boat the other a pirates flag laughing and pushing each other without a care in the world on this bitter forenoon with christmas only a week away one paused staring at the two blueclad figures hats tilted against the wind he called you want a good ship capn zur jago shook his fist little buggers and they both ran off adam gazed after them seeing himself more ghosts like this street so strange and yet so familiar he had almost expected to see faces hear voices he knew he should turn and leave right now galbraith was ashore with his recruiting parties not an enviable task at the best of times everybody remembered the press gangs men being snatched from the streets even from their homes if an officer was afraid to return to his captain emptyhanded like falmouth penzance lived off and from the sea you could smell the fish and on hot days the nets hanging out to dry hemp tar and always the sea waiting he had been only a boy like those who had just passed when he had left penzance clutching a scrap of paper which he was to give to the people he must find in falmouth he had never returned except once when he had ridden here on one of the bolitho estates horses twenty miles from falmouth and back again as that young boy the twenty miles had been endless and punishing and two days ago with the proud silhouette of st michaels mount across the starboard bow he had returned once more not the nervous boy but as the captain of a frigate he thought of the orders he had received almost as soon as unrivalleds anchor had hurled spray over the beakhead so why waste time why rouse the old doubts and painful memories he turned and was about to speak when he saw the tall steeple clear and sharp against the washedout sky st marys chapel like feeling a hand on the shoulder he remembered hearing the old men talk about that steeple so fine and slender so delicate on this stormlashed coast of england they used to wager on its chances when every new season of gales arrived the old men were long dead st marys chapel and its steeple were still standing there were not many people about it was market day so most of those who ventured out would be hunting for bargains in jew market street this way he glanced at the nearby houses small details apparent recalling what he had heard and what his mother had told him in childhood ships had come to penzance to load cargoes of copper tin and granite they had frequently come from holland and unloaded their ballast of dutch sandstone before their return voyages nothing was wasted and even now he saw the facings of houses built with dutch sandstone and not the usual granite on his way from the harbour he had seen few of the notices galbraith had posted some had been torn down others removed perhaps as souvenirs he had caught the glances too this was a seaport and every one would know of the powerful frigate lying at her cable looking for men had it ever been different and they would know he was her captain he should have remembered that it was market day a most unlikely time for a man to sign his life away in a kings ship and an army recruiting party had been here also he had seen a sergeant outside one of the local inns persuading men who had already drunk too much ale for their own safety to make their marks to be gone for a soldier galbraith had found twenty new hands so far almost half of them from the local magistrates court better than prison or deportation seemed to be their reasoning reality might come as something of a shock he had heard cristie the sailing master say scornfully gallows bait the whole lot of em he stopped outside the church and looked up at the weather vane southeasterly wind perfect for sailing leaving here jago hesitated and then removed his hat as adam stepped through the tall weatherworn doors shall i come sir adam hardly heard him if you wish the church was empty but for two old women sharing a pew they both wore the traditional cowls he remembered from his childhood young or old women carried huge baskets of fish supported by strengthened bands around their heads to settlements around the town or sold it fresh from the sea from little donkeys in the streets neither of the women looked up as their shoes rang on the tiled floor jago paused by a bust of what he supposed was some local dignitary and watched and waited adam halted beneath one of the windows and stared at the memorial plaque he knew now that she had been beautiful but for years he had remembered only that final day when she had pushed him away pleading with him to leave her and find his way to falmouth sick dying but as always she had put him first just as she had sold herself for him he shivered aware of the silence of the streets he had just walked like the houses they seemed so much smaller than he had remembered he reached out impetuously as jago had seen him do many times to a friend to a subordinate to me the plaque was plain and simple even that had been something of a struggle with the stonemason and the church but it was done in loving memory of kerenza pascoe who died in waiting for his ship that was all the most they would condone for a woman of her reputation adam touched it and smiled surprised that it was not difficult i came mother god bless you then he turned and walked toward the doors again jago glanced at the tablet no title no details just a womans name and something about a ship he was sometimes glad that his father had forced him to learn to read and write when he had been a boy working in the schooner running out of dover with clips around his ears if he did not apply himself looking back now it was all he could find to thank his father for a bully who had died after falling drunk into a dock so they said but reading gave you an edge as the captains coxswain he was privileged to walk the decks as much as he chose to the annoyance he knew of some of the senior rates and little squirts like midshipman sandell a glance at the chart or one of the log books kept him informed when where how some of the hands aboard ship were just ignorant hawbucks bumpkins the ship could be on the moon for all they knew he thought of the two old women at prayer fishwives as they were called round here and wondered what comfort it gave them he had heard prayers at sea when some poor jack was stitched up in his hammock and tipped over the side like so much rubbish where was the sense in that he felt the breeze across his face as they stepped on to the street once more and saw the captain square his shoulders but not he guessed against the wind the woman who was remembered in the church had been captain bolithos mother jago knew much of the story and guessed the rest bolitho was a lucky man a good family and an uncle who would live in sailors legends as long as nelson some said but lucky above all else he had risked his ship his reputation maybe his career by flying in the face of an admirals orders and all because of that woman they had carried in unrivalled he had seen her crossing swords and glances with the captain and lucky to have a ship with the navy being cut down in numbers daily their companies thrown ashore to fend as best they could until the next bloody war he thought then it would be soft words and the like to get poor jack back to sea again he looked up at the houses as they walked most captains would try to forget their pasts if it left a gap in their defences like sir richard and his lady and his brother who had deserted the navy to fight for the americans hugh bolitho who had fathered unrivalleds captain the last of the family they said but not this one he shied away from any sort of unfounded trust it was something he could never accept adam bolitho had taken him to the church with him and for some reason it mattered they had reached a place where the sea opened up to greet them again like polished pewter hard on the eyes adam thought even for men like unrivalleds most experienced lookout joseph sullivan whose uncanny skill had found him the triton sullivan was one of the older hands respected by everyone not least because he had been at trafalgar although he rarely spoke of it and adam was grateful that he had stayed with the ship sullivan had regarded him with those clear eyes like the eyes of a much younger man looking out of his weathered face where else would i go capn and there was the ship like glass from this vantage point strange to think that bellairs the youngest lieutenant was the only officer aboard until the recruiting venture was over and the anchor was hove short again doing what he had always dreamed of like most of us luck dead mens shoes who could say massie the second lieutenant had been killed the third lieutenant daniel wynter had left the ship to follow his late father into politics the member of parliament had always hated his sons career in the navy and had made no secret of it in death he had apparently succeeded in getting his own way the new lieutenant varlo seemed experienced and came from a naval background he had also been flag lieutenant for a few months to a rearadmiral at the nore galbraith had had little to say about him other than mentioning his duties he was keeping his distance until matters had settled down as his captain had once tried to do it was impossible adam turned and stared at the ship until his eyes watered he should have remained on hoard there was more than enough for him to do before sailing so why he heard jago say casually now whos this then something in the tone even the suggestion of a hand loosening the short widebladed dirk he always wore a hint of danger like those other times but he was mistaken there was no threat in the two figures who were waiting by a pair of opened gates the man was tall and well built but for the way he twisted his shoulders about his own age but wearing an eye patch which did not conceal the terrible scar that clawed down his face and neck one eye must have been torn out and the flesh opened to the bone he had only one arm his companion was a young woman who wore a cap and apron she was holding the mans arm and her face was hostile jago said what is it matey he stood as if very relaxed one hand resting on his belt the man took half a pace forward and tried to say something his voice was confused almost strangled but he would not stop the girl cut in i said you should stay away they dont care i told you but she was sobbing the anger a mask for something else adam said its all right my faulti was many miles away just then he moved nearer but felt as if he were frozen to this place a man of his own age crippled halfblind barely able to speak not just a survivor but a victim he said quietly john powers foretopman he held out his right hand but changed it to suit the onearmed man the head twisted round still further so that the eye seemed to fill his face then he spoke slowly with painful gaps between each word and all the while the girl held his arm watching his face sharing the anguish as she must do every day not killed sir he nodded slowly remembering it seeing it i was told you was ere there were more deep scars on his throat ad to come an be sure adam said to jago john powers served in my anemone when we lost to the yankee a day ill never forget the girl reached up to brush her companions hair from his face she pleaded lets get back johnny they will be lookin fer us eh adam said where do you work she gestured over her shoulder at the inn we got a place to sleep dont need nobody else the crippled man who had been one of the best topmen in anemones company said wash pots an things sir adam put his hand to his pocket but she snapped i brung em cause he wanted it we dont need yer money sir she dragged him round and pushed him towards the opened gates from a small window adam could see faces watching tankards poised with interest the man named powers tried again anemone was the finest in the fleet he did not stammer once jago stared after them and then at his captain and shrugged his hand slipping away from the dirk it happens sir well always see it its the way of things he felt he wanted to reach out to touch his arm as he had seen him do so often and reassure him in some way adam looked at him his dark hair blowing in the wind although he did not recall having removed his hat sometimes we need to be reminded he stared up at the old steeple pride one word it was all that was needed lieutenant galbraith held his hands out to a crackling log fire it was about noon but he felt as if he had been on his feet for days and he was tired frustrated and disappointed he nodded to the inns landlord and took the proferred glass felt it run like fire across his tongue and wondered where it had come from smugglers would be busier than ever now that the war with france was over for the moment he heard the small squad of royal marines which had accompanied the recruiting party voices loud and untroubled in the other long room corporal bloxham would make certain that none of his men got drunk or misbehaved he had an eve for such things he was the detachments crack shot galbraith recalled that last hour aboard the tritons scarred and bloodied deck the captain trying to assist his servant who had been hit by a wood splinter and unable to reach the enemy commander who was aiming to kill him like a little tableau the injured boy cradled in bolithos arms the old sword pointing impotently across the deck and then bloxham quite calm as if he had been on the range somewhere with his faithful musket yes corporal bloxham would keep an eve on things he would be thinking of a sergeants stripes before too long he stared around the lowbeamed room with its smokestained pictures and pieces of polished brass he sighed one more stop and it was over he glared at the empty glass a bloody waste of time three men one man and two boys was closer to the truth waste of time the door banged open and he tried to relax his mind and body there was something about lieutenant george varlo which seemed to unsettle him he scarcely knew him and accepted that that was mostly his own fault and yet varlo was alert keeneyed efficient very light on his feet like a dancer or one used to matching swords for pleasure or in earnest fair hair short and fastidiously kept like his clothing the perfect officer galbraith was not normally an intolerant man but varlo made him feel clumsy and awkward in almost everything maybe it was because he had served as flag lieutenant to some senior officer or maybe you were chosen because of those qualities but he considered george avery who had died when they had boarded the enemy and his own words to captain bolitho i think he knew he was going to die he had given up the will to live no not like avery at all varlo glanced around a small smile on his lips ive told mr rist to watch the others until were ready to move galbraith said rist knows what to do he was being stupid unfair how could varlo know what rist the best masters mate in the ship was like how on that day when they had launched a boat attack amongst the islands rist had been a tower of strength even when they had landed on the wrong beach the landlord had reappeared a glass zur varlo shook his head later galbraith said i will he sensed the mans resentment and added sharply just what i needed he made another attempt the next place is in market jew street he opened his notebook must have had a jewish community at some time varlo studied him amused actually no its the old cornish tongue marhas you which means thursday market the smile widened or close enough galbraith said curtly i didnt know varlo shrugged elegantly why should you not really our concern is it there were shouts and cheers from the street the army recruiting sergeant was returning to his barracks with his haul probably too drunk to know what they had done he said we might have better luck tomorrow varlo said directly youve been with unrivalled since she was first commissioned with her captain too the little smile again a cornishman no less yes what is he like one hears so many things as you well know but if we are to be away from england and the fleet it is sensible to be prepared he was goading him drawing him out into the open and enjoying it galbraith said the best captain ive yet served he has high standards and expects them acted upon he tried to smile to put it in perspective even from cornishmen varlo nodded thoughtfully thank you for the warning if it was so intended rist the masters mate peered in at them ready sir galbraith picked up his hat and straightened his sword against his hip varlo probably had some influence behind him a flag lieutenant and now appointed to a fine frigate when so many were being laid up influence with a view to getting a command of his own he nodded his thanks to the innkeeper like me he felt the salt air on his lips back to sea he was eager to leave adam bolitho ran his hand along the smooth cold stone of the sea wall worn away by every sort of weather peace or war it made no difference here he felt for his watch and remembered and thought of the boy who had asked his permission to keep the pieces after the musket ball had smashed it to fragments it had saved his life the little mermaid tomorrow they would be leaving here it was not the voyage to west africa which disturbed him or the countless demands and challenges of a ship still undermanned it was not that he had held a command since he was twentythree he was prepared for most difficulties tomorrow was the problem leaving here where he had been born and brought up by the woman whose name he had touched in the church a place where he had learned to take care of himself even as a child and yet he had never considered it his home falmouth and the great house which was now his by right no matter what legal arrangements still had to be made was home falmouth and the ocean wherever it beckoned him but not today with unrivalled at sea again he would find time to laugh at himself and his sentimentality it happens sir he thought of jagos words at the church its the way of things he was down there mustering the gigs crew now and probably questioning his own decision to stay on as coxswain if he had ever stopped doing so he sighed galbraith would be returning very soon they would share a glass once they were aboard he thought of the cases of wine from the address in st jamess street catherines gift when unrivalled had been commissioned a lifetime ago he heard jagos footsteps on the stone stairs it was time but jago shook his head thought id better come and tell you sir theres a gentleman who wants to see you he added bluntly insists more like adam bit his lip another one like the crippled extopman and the spectre on the moored hulk too many reminders jago watched him grimly hes in the coastguard post yonder sir i can tell him to shove off if you like no ill come the room was almost dark a fire dying in the grate adam stepped into a patch of light from the solitary window and said i understand sir the figure sitting by the window was roundshouldered portly there were small gold spectacles propped on his forehead adam held out both hands daniel yovell of all people yovell got to his feet and came to him dropping his spectacles into place with the gesture adam remembered a man of learning who lived with and by his bible once his uncles clerk and then his secretary and friend catherines too yovell said when you visited falmouth i was away on business in bodmin i only heard when i returned there bryan ferguson was very upset that your stay was curtailed there was so much you see he did not continue it is good to see you old friend even that reminded him again of allday i heard that your ship was calling here you know how news travels sir especially amongst sailors anybody less seamanlike was hard to imagine stooped devout and gentle yovell had been one of sir richards little crew as he had called them he had been given a cottage adjoining the big house and had become a great help to ferguson the estates onearmed steward another veteran how can i help you yovell smiled and it was like a cloud clearing from the sun he said i have a letter for you i fear it has taken its time finding its way to falmouth adam took it seeing the marks and the official signatures from catherine i thought to send it across by the boat but i judged it best to see you first adam turned the letter over in his hands she hadnt forgotten jago was still standing by the door arms folded face expressionless yovell regarded him sternly this fellow said i should take cover in here better for one of my age indeed jago grinned no disrespect sir adam turned angered by the interruption galbraith was shouting to his men and there were other voices loud and excited jago said patiently i was about to say capn we seem to have gathered some recruits volunteers yovell was watching him his eyes both warm and sad i meant no harm but these men came across in the packet from falmouth with me do i know any of them perhaps not all of them served under sir richard my god adam looked past him knowing understanding what it must have cost yovell a man closer to his uncle than almost any one and now there was a letter from the woman who had loved him he said i shall go out to them and walked blindly across the familiar cobbles like part of a dream the lifeline yovell polished his spectacles with a handkerchief and remarked it seemed the thing to do you see the letter gave me the idea he didnt add that allday had known nothing about it adam came back inexplicably disturbed and moved hard hands reaching out as he had passed among them tattoos and weathered faces every one a prime seaman it was as if he had known all of them but in his heart he knew that they had seen and heard another bolitho when he had spoken to them he said quietly that was a fine thing you did and to jago gig ready jago nodded say the word sir adam looked at the roundshouldered man who in his own quiet way had changed everything will you stay in penzance a while yovell shrugged and seemed almost apologetic i have some things with me sir i had heard that you lost your clerk recently so i thought i would offer my services until something better presents itself he was smiling but there was no doubt of his sincerity his need are you sure man shes no ship of the line you know yovell said severely i was sir richards clerk before becoming his secretary i can adapt even for one of my age jago picked up the newcomers chest and followed them out into the keen air lie had seen his captains face when those men had crowded around him as if it was the start of some big and glorious venture just as he had seen it in that church nearby he was reminded of the handshake which for him had decided things and he was glad of it adam rested his hand on the breech of one of the eighteenpounders which shared his quarters and sensed the movement under his palm something he had never grown used to never truly accepted that a ship was alive and responding in her own way he shook his head dismissing the notion and glanced around the cabin young napier had been busy there was nothing lying about everything was in its place how many in unrivalleds company were feeling regret and anxiety he wondered it was easy to laugh it off for the old hands to brag about it after a few tots of rum on their messdecks but that was then unrivalled was ready to leave alive the wind had backed a little which might allow some of the new men time to become accustomed to the complications of getting under way you never forgot the first time everyone else seemed to know exactly what was expected of him he heard the shrill of a call the ship was restless straining at her cable her fully laden hull matched against the men labouring at the capstan bars yes there would be a few faint hearts on this cold december forenoon he stood away from the gun as if he had heard someone speak and patted his worn seagoing coat to make certain he had everything he needed and glanced at the small desk where he kept his personal log book he had placed catherines letter carefully between its pages to press out the wear and tear of its journey my dear adam he could hear her voice had tried to picture her writing it how she felt what she was doing how she looked she had mentioned george avery and had thanked him for writing to her of his death she had touched only briefly on its effect on sillitoe averys uncle but it was clear enough she was with sillitoe she had spoken of his strength his protection and that she was accompanying him on some business venture adam was still surprised by his own foolishness his naivete after what she had endured the grief and the enmity it was a wonder she had written at all he halflistened to the sudden thud of feet overhead the shouts as a petty officer chased some confused newcomer to his right station they would learn they had to fie recalled the dry wording of his final orders you are to repair in the first instance to freetown sierra leone and avail yourself of the latest intelligence concerning the forts and settlements on that coast you will reasonably assist the senior officer of the patrolling squadron in whatever way you consider conforms with these said orders but on passage unrivalled would call into funchal madeira to replenish stores and perhaps make more sense out of such vague instructions the slave trade was a fact although banned officially by britain a felony to the delight of the antislavery movement in parliament and elsewhere a show of strength then he wondered how galbraith and the others regarded it they were safe lucky to be employed they had seen that for themselves in plymouth and penzance for the practical ones like cristie the master it was all a matter of seamiles logged favourable winds and faith in the stars to tregillis the purser it was food drink and a minimum of waste for every one of those miles with enough left over for emergencies he plucked at his shirt and felt the locket against his skin the bare throat and shoulders the high cheekbones it was over because it had never begun nor would it they might never meet again perhaps she only truly existed in this locket napier came in from the sleeping quarters careful he noticed to walk lightly on the restless deck he could see it now the boy on tritons deck falling with a jagged splinter deep in his thigh like some obscene dart triton was like many dutch vessels her builders had used a lot of teak something hated by english sailors the splinters were known to poison and cause gangrene to spread at an alarming rate even obeirne had been troubled about it and had wanted to put the boy ashore at gibraltar where he might have received better attention napier had insisted that he wanted to stay with the ship he had suffered for it and would carry the scars of obeirnes surgery until his dying day obeirne had said severely youll always have a limp my boy napier had been equally stubborn and he seemed to be overcoming his limp adam had written to the boys widowed mother she should be proud of the child she had allowed to be signed on without it seemed much hesitation he touched the locket again and carefully released it catherine had sent no address it was as if she simply needed him to know that she was there like the day at the memorial service at falmouth when galbraith had asked to join him he looked at napier its time he had heard the muffled chimes of eight bells and beyond it the slow regular clank of the capstan pawls he thought of the men who had come with yovell to sign on how were they now and yovell himself he had settled down as if he had never left the sea he was sharing a tiny cabin space which also served as a store for the pursers records with ritzen the pursers assistant a dutchman who had played an unlikely but vital part in discovering the role and purpose of triton in that last battle adam sensed that yovell had needed to get away from his hardwon security if only to hold on to something far more precious napier said can i come up with you sir adam smiled regrets the youth thought about it his face serious my place sir they walked through the screen door where the marine sentry was already stiffly at attention and probably wishing he was on deck with his mates adam touched his hat to the figures by the quarterdeck rail and looked at the slowly revolving capstan its twin would be keeping time below decks the fiddle was going the shantyman beating time with his foot his voice all but lost in the creak and rattle of blocks and rigging they were all here cristie with his masters mates galbraith by the rail and young bellairs at the foot of the towering mainmast here the marines their coats very bright in the hazy light waited with the afterguard to control the mizzen sheets and braces the simplest mast in the ship all they were any use for as the old jacks proclaimed and right forward one arm outstretched and dwarfed by the beautiful figurehead was the new lieutenant varlo watching the jerk of the incoming cable and young midshipman cousens with the big signals telescope turned toward the land he was bellairs successor and the next obvious candidate for promotion when the opportunity offered itself if he was lucky adam nodded to galbraith the winds steady stand by he even recalled his own words that day before the fight trust me so many times another midshipmans voice that was martyns the one who had been with jago in the gig anchors hove short sir repeating varlos call from the beakhead his voice broke in a shrill squeak adam saw one of the helmsmen glance away from the flapping masthead pendant just long enough to grin at his companion stand by the capstan more calls and running feet loose th headsls adam tensed this was the moment hands aloft and loose topsls the cable was coming home much faster now or was it his heart he looked toward the shore hardly another sail moving but many eyes would be watching today some relieved others already feeling the ache of separation he thought of the crippled seaman who had served with him in anemone the ship which had begun so much and had opened the way for him a shattered man who lived from day to day with his woman two lost souls each needing the other they would be there today men scurried past him one pausing to stare at him the captain whats he like the yell from forward nchors aweigh sir he felt the deck stagger and dashed spray from his face as the ship appeared to ride her bowsprit up and over the timeless barrier of st michaels mount small details stood out cristies hand gesturing at an extra man to throw his weight on the wheel as the helm went down hoarse cries from overhead as the sails broke free then filled and bellied out to the wind blocks squeaking men hauling on the braces to drag the great yards round still further to capture the wind so that the rudderhead sounded like a drumbeat steady she goes adam looked again that would be newlyn village over there as unrivalled continued to pivot round but it was lost in haze and drifting spray souwest by south sir galbraith his hands cupped to make his voice carry more men on the weather forebrace mr partridge lively there adam gripped the quarterdeck ladder rail reminded of the night napier had come to tell him of the girl who was lying just there and what had happened later in malta a dangerous madness potentially no less lethal than a teak splinter or the shots which had cut down so many over the months the years he pushed away from the rail and walked stiffly up to the weather side tic knew jago was watching him standing near the signals party in case he was needed but careful not to show it perhaps that was his strength he said steer souwest until we weather the headland mr cristie and saw his approval to galbraith he shouted well get the fore and main courses on her directly the ship heeled still further some bare feet sliding a few men sprawling too concerned with watching the land which was already fading away there were kicks and curses too leadership and knowledge would follow steady she goes sir full an bye he considered the calculations he had made and compared with the taciturn sailing master with a pause at funchal unrivalled could complete her passage to the windward coast in about a month less he looked up as more shouts came from the maintop galbraith was peering aloft also but seemed satisfied drill drill and more drill there were no passengers in a kings ship time to train and to prepare adam shaded his eyes and stared across the quarter but the land was just a blurred misshapen barrier he touched the locket beneath his sodden shirt and time to forget he was free to serve this ship lieutenant leigh galbraith paused at the foot of the companion ladder and clung momentarily to the handrails gauging the mood and energy of the ship and the deck which awaited him it was four in the morning or very soon would be but time seemed to have lost all meaning even during the middle watch he had been summoned from his cabin in response to the call for all hands to shorten sail yet again the sea a wilderness of leaping spectres and waves surging along the hull like a tide race his whole body ached and he could not remember being dry and warm five days of it not long when you considered what they had already achieved in this ship he smiled bitterly hearing his captains words that was then even the handrail was clammy and his stomach contracted as he heard somebody retching uncontrollably he climbed the rest of the ladder and waited for the wind to greet him a few moments more while his eyes grew accustomed to it the wet huddled shapes of the watchkeepers the three helmsmen joined like statuary as they clung to the big double wheel eyes seen occasionally in the compass light as they peered aloft at the ironhard canvas tightly reefed though it was fighting their own war with sea and rudder varlo was waiting for him slim figure angled to the deck as if nothing could shift him galbraith listened to his report although the chart had been engraved on his mind even in the discomfort of his swaying cot the boom of the sea alongside nine hundred miles since they had tacked clear of mounts bay it felt ten times that beating clear of brest and then down into biscay the weather following them with barely a letup it was surprising that they had got this far without losing a man or sustaining any serious damage there were injuries aplenty especially amongst the landmen who had never set foot in a ship of any kind before brave lunatics the surgeon obeirne had called them men thrown from their feet by water surging over the gangways or flung against stanchions or worse one of the guns others caught by the unexpected rush of a line snaking through a block to catch the unwary in a noose like a trap a man could lose fingers in a block or have the skin scored from his bones by the deadly cordage varlo said south by east sir clipped and formal perhaps to remind galbraith that his watch was waiting to be relieved winds steady as before galbraith winced as spray dashed against his face on the chart it was clear certain unrivalled was eighty or ninety miles to the northwest of lisbon across the fortieth parallel but even cristie seemed doubtful and had muttered ill feel better when we can see something it was quite an admission for him galbraith said its easing water was still splashing down from the shrouds but not cutting across the deck like the last time he groaned was that only three hours ago he waited for the moment and seized the quarterdeck rail his eyes could make out details now the deck and rigging was stark against the seething water as it surged abeam he pointed suddenly those men what are they doing varlo replied offhandedly bailing the boats idle bastards theyll know in future not to drag their feet on my watch rist the masters mate of the morning watch called the watch is aft sir a good man astute too and wise enough to have marked the friction between his officers galbraith said most of them are raw untrained you cant expect them to learn it all in five days man i see no sense in being soft with them sir ill be the judge of that mr varlo now carry on and dismiss those hands they faced one another like enemies all else forgotten or bring them aft and charge them make it official varlo turned and walked to the companionway without another word galbraith peered at the swaying compass card giving himself time angry because he knew he had overreacted or because varlo had seemed unmoved by it rist said we can get some ands aloft at first light sir therell be a bit o fancy splicing to be done after this little lot doing his best bridging the gap galbraith nodded aye well do that and thank you he walked to the opposite side alone again rist sighed a warrant officer was always in the middle had to be galbraith was a good first lieutenant brave too but varlo he was just plain dangerous but still a couple more days and they should sight madeira or mr cristie would be wanting to know why not that would take the edge off things for a while anyway some of that heavy red wine and bold stares from the women someone called to him urgently and he turned away the sailors dream adam bolitho put his signature to yet another letter and stared at the pile beside it on the desk all in yovells effortless round hand he was sitting opposite gold spectacles perched once more on his forehead i thought you were over hasty in offering your services in penzance i thought you might well live to regret it he smiled the strain already gone now i am only thankful his mind returned to falmouth the big grey house bryan ferguson will be cursing me for taking you yovell regarded him thoughtfully it was time sir i knew that within a few days of my return i did manage to complete a few details with the lawyers and glanced away it is their world not mine i fear adam leaned hack in the chair and felt the sun across his cheek from the stern windows the glass was thick and the warmth an illusion but it was enough after days of wind and angry sea he heard muffled shouts from the deck and the sound of fresh cordage being hauled over the planking ready to be spliced and then hoisted to the upper yards to repair some of the storm damage and tomorrow they would sight madeira a first landfall for many of unrivalleds people it might make up for the hardship the knocks and the bruises along the way at least they had not lost a single man a real risk on any first passage he thought of the letters which would he landed in funchal to await the next courier to england yovell had advised him on some of them was there nothing he could not do or understand their world not mine the estate had to be run the farms overseen and encouraged in his mind he had often seen that room overlooking the sea with its portraits of cheney and catherine a place full of memories and hopes but an empty house for all that yovell watched him seeing the changing emotions recognising some of them as he had known and perhaps feared he would it had not been easy and on more than one occasion he had found himself questioning his own common sense for putting himself in this position as adam had warned him unrivalled was no liner and in the long nights as the ship had reeled and plunged in that invisible sea he had been close to despair he had been surprised how easily he had been accepted in the ship perhaps because he was a stranger he saw adam glance at the skylight and tense again his ear catching some false note in the constant chorus of wind and rigging others saw him as the captain the final authority as far as sailors were concerned the one man who could promote reward flog or destroy any of them if he chose it was only at moments like this that one glimpsed the real man the uncertainties and doubts that rare wistfulness in his dark eyes when his mind had slipped away from the role he was expected to play at all times yovell was a patient man and had always been prepared to wait before forming his true opinions he turned his head as the door opened and the young servant napier padded into the cabin of napier adam had said almost casually he has no father and ive never been able to discover his mothers thoughts about his future if she has any he can read and write and he has courage true courage yovell had seen that look just now when adam had been thinking about falmouth he had added see what you can do for him will you just like that few would ever see that side of their lord and master napier said ive got out your best coat sir adam looked at him his mind clearing i had all but forgot i am to sup in the wardroom tonight mr cristie assures me it will remain calm enough for that he glanced at the two of them you may make use of these quarters while i am being entertained he walked to the stern bench and leaned both hands on it watching the sea fling spray up from the rudder a flock of gulls rose and dipped soundlessly their shapes distorted by the saltstained glass waiting for scraps from the galley they probably nested in madeira the youth placed two goblets on the desk beside a bottle and then quietly departed to the adjoining cabin yovell waited somehow he knew this was the real cause of the tension the quick changes of mood the eagerness to find some kind of solution in routine ships affairs like all the letters and reports they had gone through together he had felt it even then something which was holding them apart like a barrier and it was the one thing which had first drawn them together adam said quietly this is a good ship i am a lucky man to command her for so many reasons but most because i need her he smiled but only briefly so that yovell saw the youth again the image of his uncle there were so many who were there that day i was not one of them yovell sat very still in the chair feeling it seeing it adam continued sometimes i feel he is still very close to me he nodded i have known it several times always the hand reaching out i have spoken of this to no one else except he turned away from the glass e me i was not there either yovell was polishing his spectacles again probably without realising he had removed them i was assisting the wounded i prayed with some of them but something made me go on deck although he always ordered me to stay clear of the guns he looked at adam but his eyes were very distant they were all cheering and some were firing their muskets to signal a victory but on that deck there was utter silence all the din was outside somewhere else adam nodded but did not interrupt it was over i knelt down on that bloodied deck and i prayed not for him but for us i shall never forget in the adjoining sleeping cabin napier crouched with his ear against the slats of the screen partition one hand resting on the fine dress coat which had been brought aboard in plymouth to replace the one the captain had been wearing when they had boarded the enemy ship and the splinter had pierced napiers leg the captain could have been killed that day like the uncle they had just been talking about but he came to help me he put me first he glanced at the swaying cot where the rebel captain lovatt had died thinking i was his son captain bolitho had even cared about that just as he had been concerned about his mothers failure to reply to his letters she had other things on her mind now that he was here in unrivalled a man it had not taken her long to forget but how could captain bolitho be expected to understand anything so cheap so heartless it could not last forever nothing did his mother had said that often enough other ships and perhaps one day he almost ran from the screen you called sir they did not move and napier realised they had neither heard nor called out for him he stood quite still feeling the regular rise and fall of the cabin around him and he was a part of it lieutenant james bellairs turned his shoulders into the wind and peered at his list it had been handed round from watch to watch and was barely readable fortunately there were only a few more names left on it midshipman deighton stood close by frowning with concentration learning listening or merely pretending to be interested it was hard to tell bellairs had been a midshipman himself so recently that he often found himself thinking like one especially when he was left to explain something he knew the old arguments we had to learn the hard way so why not them he might even become like that himself one day he tried again the first lieutenant wants to reduce the number of idlers before we reach our destination and more hands are needed for gun drill ieighton asked what is sierra leone like sir bellairs tapped one foot impatiently deighton was new to the ship but experienced and had served in another frigate which had since been paid off for refit at fifteen his previous service put him ahead of most of the others reserved almost withdrawn he had proved what he could do under fire but he rarely smiled and bellairs knew it was because of the rumours which surrounded the death of his father an actingcommodore killed in action he had heard the others talking about it but it was now said that he had in fact been shot down by one of his own men another ship but captain adam bolitho had been in command of her also ile recalled deightons question oh one of those roughandready places you know he had never been there deighton saw some figures below the poop there they are sir bellairs waited for the gunners mate williams to hustle them over two men and a youth the last was not merely pale his skin was white williams reported cooper dixon and ede sir bellairs surveyed them just three new hands nothing out of the ordinary except ile glanced at williams but his face gave nothing away you will report to mr varlo in the first division tomorrow gun drill is essential to a manofwar and he looked at the whitefaced youth are you unwell cooper the man at the other end of the group called im cooper sir the third one grinned broadly it was a bad start bellairs said sharply i asked you a question ede isthat right landmen untrained and somehow out of place bellairs tried to put it to the back of his mind he was a lieutenant now he must look at everything firmly but fairly even in his own service he had seen most of them the hard men and the cowards volunteers and pressed hands the godly and the liars but these men stood apart they had been released from prison only on the understanding that they would redeem themselves by serving in a kings ship there had been about twenty of them all told but these last three were still without a proper station in the ship ede said i was sick sir williams said speak up boy bellairs peered at his list the surgeon has passed you as fit for work yes sir well then bellairs looked past him do your work with a will and attend your duties and youll have nothing to fear he strode aft and added hell soon learn mr deighton he caught himself in time he had almost said we all had to deighton glanced back at the three figures with williams it was strange that the third lieutenant had not noticed it he thought the youth called ede was not merely sick or feeling out of place he was terrified he put it from his mind they were heading for sierra leone and there was talk of the slave trade and today he midshipman richard deighton was being invited to the wardroom perhaps the first step he thought of ede again even when these same guns had roared out and men had been cut down in front of him he had not been afraid not as he might have expected a need to prove something maybe no it went even deeper than that but not like the youth named ede deighton had been afraid of only one man his own father he thought suddenly of the way the captain had treated him when he had joined the ship at malta it had been like sharing something as if i trust i am not tiring you too much mr lleighton bellairs had turned to watch him deighton touched his hat ready sir bellairs strode on he felt more like a lieutenant again the meal in unrivalleds wardroom was a surprisingly good one the centrepiece was a saddle of mutton which had been brought aboard at the last moment before sailing with a remarkably strong sauce which was one of the cooks own inventions the fresh bread from devon and cornwall had already been consumed but ships biscuits cheese and a variety of wines made it a lively occasion as a young lieutenant adam had often wondered how a captain felt when he was invited to the wardroom aguest in his own ship even now he was not sure nor was he used to it a small brig like his very first command or an ugly bomb like those he had seen off algiers was a much closer community a frigate despite the lack of space preserved the same barriers and distinctions as a lordly ship of the line only at times like these with the wine flowing at will did you see the other side of the coin the men behind the allotted ranks and roles as varied as cristie the sailing master the true professional whose family had been raised in the same humble street as lord collingwood obeirne the surgeon stabbing the air through the drifting pipe smoke to emphasise the point in some irish story he had been telling he was a good surgeon who had proved his worth several times over after and during action at sea or when dealing with the hundred and one accidents that befell even the most experienced seaman going about his work adam eased his back against the chair and knew he had eaten too much it was nothing compared with his companions more out of habit as captain he could choose what and when he ate consuming too little was as dangerous as drinking too much when there was nobody to enchourage or restrain you he glanced down at his new coat made by the same plymouth tailor as the one hed worn when unrivalled had been commissioned the one he had worn for that last fight with triton part of the bolitho legend or a reckless indifference which might one day kill him either way it was loose around his body even though the softtongued tailor had insisted it had been cut to the original measurements he had made it sound almost inconvenient he heard shrill laughter from one of the three midshipmen who had been invited for this special evening while their captain was present it was the youngest hawkins who was twelve years old unrivalled was his first ship the son of a postcaptain grandson of a viceadmiral he thought of napier at least hawkins would have no doubts about his future he stared at his goblet but could not recall when it had last been filled it would soon be time to make his excuses and leave galbraith would go on deck and check the watchkeepers wind and weather and that would give the others a chance to speak out to discuss what they chose without fear of crossing that forbidden bridge the chain of command may i ask you something sir it was varlo who had been silent almost detached for most of the evening he kept a good watch and had never failed to request permission to reef or shorten sail if he considered it necessary some lieutenants would rather tear the sticks out of a ship than disturb their captain for fear of showing a lack of ability or confidence and yet he said fire away mr varlo varlo leaned forward his neat hair glossy in the lantern light slavery is illegal sir most of the world powers are agreed on it i read in the gazette that even the portuguese have accepted that the equator shall be the boundary line of the trade he glanced along the table one hand in the air but how can we enforce such a ruling we shall have fewer ships and less senior officers with the authority and experience to carry out anything so widespread adam said that is what we must discoverthe purpose of this mission as i see it varlo smiled quickly many people in england do not agree with the ruling sir they were and still are against the bill as it went through parliament captain luxmore leaned forward and slopped some wine down his sleeve fortunately it matched the scarlet well no more speeches george leave that to the damned politicians adam said i take your point mr varlo some people do not understand others perhaps see slavery as the only way to work and produce from those lands for which we are responsible it is an old argument but loses its strength when set against the act of enslavement itself galbraith said i have heard it said that negroes are far better off working in a christian country than being left in their native barbarism his face was troubled but it will be hard to contain no matter what the true rights and wrongs of it varlo nodded satisfied an enormous task as i have said and a proportionate responsibility for any captain he stopped his hand still in midair as adam brought his knife down on the table we have a proud ship mr varlo he looked along the table this was not as he had intended it to be and now thanks to all your efforts we have men to serve her it can be said that conditions in the navy have at times been little better than slavery he glanced at his goblet it was empty but he could not stop now things will be different eventually a man becomes a sailor for all sorts of reasons because he is hungry and unemployed or unemployable he may be on the wrong side of the law he saw cristie nod he may even be driven by dreams of glory our company is probably no better and no worse than any you have known but it will be up to us to mould them into something of true value to serve this ship varlo smiled thank you sir adam held his hand over the goblet as a messman hovered beside him it was time varlo by design or accident had made his point few people today cared about the rights and wrongs of slavery it was a fact of life so long as they were not ill treated he had heard james tyacke on the subject he was back on antislavery patrol duty where it had all started for him where he had first met richard bolitho and his life had been changed he could hear him now he gave me back my pride my will to live another face another unbroken link with the past he was at the wardroom door faces were beaming some shining in the damp air all the toasts the stories the small tight world which was theirs and mine galbraith followed him and said it was good of you to come sir he gave a crooked smile sorry about the second lieutenant some of it was my fault he did not explain ill be glad when weve got some real work to do adam nodded to the marine sentry and entered his cabin only two lanterns were still alight he saw his boatcloak hanging near the sleeping quarters and remembered the girl who had left a lock of hair in the pocket where was she he wondered laughing now at that brief but dangerous liaison in malta he must have been mad it could have cost him dearly cost me this ship but he had kept the lock of hair he saw a goblet wedged in a corner of the desk the dark cognac tilting and shivering to the thrust of wind and rudder he touched the locket beneath his shirt before looking around the cabin as if he expected to see or hear someone then he raised the goblet to his lips and thought of the toast they had avoided calling in the wardroom to absent friends dont leave me but the voice was his own the afternoon sun was poised directly above the mainmast truck the glare so hard that it seemed to sear the eves the forenoon watch had been relieved and were now below in their messes for a meal and the smell of rum was still heavy in the air during the day the wind had veered slightly and dropped so that the ship appeared to be resting her decks quite dry for the first time since leaving england to any landsman the activity on the upper decks might appear aimless and casual after the urgency and constant demands which time and time again had dragged all hands to their stations for shortening sail or for repairing damage aloft but to the professional sailors the deck was often the marketplace and any trained eye would soon pick out the many and varied activities which were all part of a ships daily life the sailmaker and his crew sat crosslegged like tailors needles and palms rising and falling in unison no canvas was ever wasted sails had to be repaired and wind damage made good before the next gale or worse scraps were used for patching for crude but effective pouches for making new hammocks for burying the dead the boatswains various parties moved through the hull greasing block sheaves replacing whipping on strained or worn ropework repairing boats touching up paintwork wherever needed occasionally men would shade their eyes and peer across the bows to the low undulating humps purple and dark blue against the horizons hard edge like very low clouds except that there were no clouds it was land the shift of wind with courses and topsails hard put even to remain filled had changed things the old hands understood well enough no captain would want to skulk into a foreign port under cover of darkness without showing his flag the wiser ones realised that madeira consisted of five islands with all the extra hazards of a final approach for the captain to consider it would be tomorrow stand to your guns in the meantime work and drill would continue only two guns were being used to instruct some of the new hands the first pair right forward on unrivalleds larboard side she carried a total of thirty ipounders her main armament divided along either beam they also made up the biggest topweight quick to make itself felt in any sort of heavy swell when the ship had first been laid down the designers in their wisdom had ordered that the eighteenpounders be cast a foot shorter than usual in the hope that the decreased weight would assist stability in bad weather and more important to their lordships in action at the first gun its captain isaac dias wiped his mouth with the back of his wrist and glared at the next group of men dias was thickset and deepchested a gun captain of long standing both in unrivalled and in other ships before that his gun was in the first division and as such was usually the earliest to engage the enemy he wore his shaggy hair in an oldstyle pigtail and stripped of his shirt his body was scarred in several places from splinters and from brawls ashore and afloat and like his massive arms was thick with hair fiercesome and incredibly ugly he was also the best gun captain in the ship and he knew it he squinted up at the topgallant mast and noted the lie of it toward the horizon the windward side of the ship not much of a blow but still a muscletearing sweat to haul the gun up to the open port lie ran his eyes over the waiting hands you were born a gunner you didnt just become one because some poxy officer said it was to be someone murmured ere comes trouble isaac dias grinned it made him look even uglier goin to tell us what to do ch the trouble in question was midshipman sandell walking as he always did with his dragging springy step as if he was already strutting his own quarterdeck dias thought but dias was an old hand he knew about the young gentlemen and how far you could go not like some of them sandell actually enjoyed being hated and hated he was when he was eventually commissioned lieutenant he would make life hell for everyone it was to be hoped he would be killed before that happened sandell stood hands on hips his lips pursed in what might have been a smile you know your places when i give the word go to them roundly so the last words came out sharply and he turned to point a finger at one who had been startled name it was the youth ede even paler in the harsh glare ede sir sandell regarded him keenly i remember yes the one who would not go aloft when ordered ede shook his head no sir i was excused at that time sandell nodded of course afraid of heights someone said he glanced round some men had stopped work to watch or listen and midshipman deighton was at the second gun with more untrained hands sandell was beginning to enjoy the audience he snapped gun captain take your station now facing the port dias said i know my station mr sandell sandell flinched sandell damn you i shall be watching you dias old jack or not dias looked away to hide his grin it was so easy with this little maggot sandell cleared his throat now take stations he flicked the starter he always carried across a mans bare shoulder and added in action you might find yourself in charge everyone else killed think on that you oaf the mans name was cooper he had been picked from bellairs list along with ede they had been in the same prison together cooper ducked down and seized the handspike nearest him sandell was already snapping at someone else and did not see the fire in his stare almost to himself he muttered and youll be the first to get it the drill continued with some of the regular gun crews going through every move before handing over to the others sandell had seen dias looking at the foremast and said prepare to run out dias stooped over to add his weight but stood aside as sandell shouted not you dias you were just killed it was heavy going backs and muscles unused to handling a great gun bare feet slipping on the deck as it tilted over yet again the eighteenpounder dragging at its tackles to make their efforts seem puny at the second gun deighton shouted together lads heave the two guns trundled up to their ports and groaned into position point ready fire sandell was beating time with his starter as if he alone could see and hear this empty gun in action he lashed out again at the one named ede dont let go you idiot put your weight on it he struck him again and ede slipped and fell his legs beneath the truck belay that the voice was sharp incisive secure the gun it was lieutenant varlo his eyes everywhere as he walked along the gangway and stopped directly above the first gun sandell exclaimed it was deliberate sir he gestured towards ede nothing but trouble since we began varlo said stand up ede then had this gun been in action it would have recoiled inboard when fired and you would have had both legs crushed he watched him calmly but his voice was meant for the midshipman do you understand ede nodded shakily yes sir varlo looked at the foremast afraid of heights eh that wont do this is a fighting ship we depend on one another he glanced coldly at sandell we have no choice a boatswains mate touched his forehead capns compliments mr varlo sir you can dismiss the drill now varlo nodded carry on he looked at ede again no choice remember that the others gathered round the regular gun crews peering at everything as if their own smartness and efficiency was being questioned isaac dias spat on his hands come on show em how its really done eh the laughter seemed to break the spell although nobody looked at sandell as he strode aft barely able to contain his fury only ede remained one hand on his arm where sandells rope starter had left its mark deighton was about to leave when something made him say i was scared of going aloft he checked himself what was the matter with him but he added for a long time but i learned a lot from the old jacks watched how they did it one hand for the king they always said but keep one for yourself ede was staring at him as if he had just realised he was there but youre an officer sir he stared aft watching for sandell deighton said it makes no difference up there he thought suddenly of his fathers intolerance come up with me in the dog watches the youth was still staring at the crisscross of rigging the aimlessly flapping foretopsail and he recognised the fear and something more would you sir almost pleading almost desperate just the two of us deighton grinned relieved but for whom he did not know ill try sir if you think he did not go on deighton touched his arm im sure then he walked away into the marketplace he did not know how gratitude would look but now he knew how it felt he thought of the captains words in the wardroom things will be different eventually for both of them it was a challenge after the blinding glare of the sun the dazzling reflections thrown up from a clean blue sea the night was like a cloak galbraith moved occasionally from one side of the quarterdeck to the other and was surprised that it could still hold him move him after all the watches he had worked all the sea miles logged a ship at her best he looked up and through the rigging at the batlike shadows of the topsails barely moving in a soft steady breeze no moon but the stars stretched from horizon to horizon he smiled to himself and he was not yet used to it he glanced at the helmsmen one at the wheel the other standing by joshua cristie the master took no chances he had only just gone below himself it was as if it was his ship like the gun captains he had watched at the drills possessive resentful of unnecessary interference he had spoken about the new midshipmen one in particular the youngest cristie had been instructing them taking the noon sights and it would be some time before they satisfied him of midshipman hawkins he had remarked should be at home playing with his toy soldiers did you see the sextant his parents gave him a beauty not something for a twelveyearold child to cut his teeth on galbraith had said you were about that age yourself when you were packed off to sea or have you forgotten cristic had been unmoved that was different very different for us he felt the deck tremble and saw the wheel move slightly the helmsman was watching the little dogvane a tiny pointer made of cork and feathers perched on the weather side of the quarterdeck rail on a dark night and with such light airs the dogvane was a trained helmsmans only guide to the winds direction trained that summed it up he thought like the drills sails and rigging guns and hoatwork it took time for raw recruits it was different for the old hands like that brute campbell and the gun captain he had seen glaring at sandell behind his hack they might not see the point of it any more now that there was no real enemy to face and fight no cause to recognise no matter how uncertain it could change tomorrow they had already seen it for themselves when napoleon had broken out of his cage on elba he glanced at the dimly lit skylight the captain was still awake probably thinking about it too his uncle had been killed then a cross on a chart nothing more no better and no worse he had said of unrivalleds company galbraith thought of varlos comment about a captains responsibility why should that have touched me as it did varlo never seemed to make casual remarks everything had to matter to reflect he lifted a telescope from its rack and levelled it across the empty nettings over his shoulder he said quietly well warn the middle watch mr deighton those lights are fishermen if im not mistaken he heard the midshipman murmur something tiny lights on the water miles away like fireflies almost lost among the stars it would be a safe bet to say that every one of them would already know about unrivalleds steady approach he added remind me to make a note in the log aye sir he liked deighton what he knew of him he had more than proved his worth in battle and the captain had remarked on it galbraith put it from his thoughts as my captain wrote of me when i was recommended for command he heard the midshipman speaking to the boatswains mate of the watch and he thought of what he had seen during the dog watches when deighton had gone aloft with the young landman who had been terrified nobody else took much notice but galbraith had watched and remembered his own first time going aloft in a channel gale he smiled a million years ago and he had seen them return to the deck they had climbed only to the foretop and had avoided the puttock shrouds which left a man hanging out over the sea or the deck below with only fingers and toes to keep him from falling a voice murmured capns coming up sir some would never tell an officer warn him when it came down to it it was all you had to prove your worth he was surprised to see the captain coatless his shirt blowing open in the soft wind the helmsman reported sousoueast sir galbraith waited sensing the energy the restlessness of the man as if it was beyond his control driving him driving him adam said a fine night the wind holds steady enough he turned to look abeam and galbraith saw the locket glint in the compass light he could see it in his mind the bare shoulders the dark challenging eyes why did he wear it when sir richards flag lieutenant avery had brought it to him before he himself had been killed on this deck the captain would be about his own age and the lovely woman was older beyond his reach if that was the force which was tearing him apart adam said call all hands at first light i expect this ship to look her best if and when we are given the time i want more boat drill the waters we are intended for are not suitable for a manofwar galbraith waited he was thinking ahead going over his orders again sifting all the reasons and the things unsaid for the captains discretion adam said suddenly i was pleased about young deightons work today a good example god knows some of these poor devils have little enough to sustain them he turned and galbraith could almost feel his eyes in the darkness ill not stand for petty tyranny leigh attend to it as you see fit galbraith heard his shoes crossing to the companionway he missed nothing but what was driving him when most captains would have been asleep at this hour he was pacing the deck when the middle watch came aft he noticed that the cabin skylight was still glowing and his question remained unanswered obsession frank rist unrivalleds senior masters mate pressed one hand on the sill of an open port and stared at the colour and reflected movement of funchal harbour he had visited madeira several times a place always ready with a bargain to tempt the sailorman even if the price doubled at the first sign of a kings ship he felt the heat of the timber through his palm something he never tired of and smiled as a boat loaded with brightly painted pottery hovered abeam apparently deaf to the bellowed warnings to stand clear from one of captain luxmores bullocks he withdrew his head into the chartroom and waited for his eyes to accept the gloom of the low deckhead after the glare off the water he rubbed them with his knuckles and tried to shrug it off it was when he looked at a chart in uncertain light or by the glow of a small lamp on the quarterdeck during the night watches that he noticed it most like most sailors rist was used to staring into great distances taking the bearing of some headland or hill or gauging the final approach to an anchorage like this morning he heard the first lieutenants footsteps overhead and the shrill of a call as another hoist of stores was hauled inboard the purser doubtless counting every item and checking it against a list as if it was all coming out of his own pocket unrivalled suited him despite the gaps in her complement and the new hands who were either old jacks who had volunteered for a further commission or those totally untrained in the ways of the sea like the youth ede who was quietly clearing up the chart space as if the ship was still out of sight of land or he was afraid of making contact with those people and boats out there in the harbour ede was so young and it troubled rist when he considered it lie was a good masters mate and the senior of the ships three he tried to push it aside he was also one of the oldest men in the company rist was fortytwo years old twentyeight of which had been spent at sea in one sort of ship or another he had done well better than most but he had to face it unless old cristie was offered another appointment or dropped dead any hope of promotion was remote and now his sight it was common enough in sailors he clenched his fist but not now he glanced at the youth still so pale despite the sun which had greeted their course south of biscay neat almost delicate hands more like a girls than a youngster going to sea for the first time he could read and write and had been an apprentice at some instrument makers shop in plymouth or nearby in the navy it was usually better not to know too much of a mans past it was what he did now how he stood for or against the things which really mattered in a manofwar when it came down to it the loyalty and courage of your mates counted more than anything rist looked around the chartroom old cristies second home you could still smell the paint and pitch from the repairs after that last savage battle he stared through the port again there was a spanish frigate at anchor nearby she had dipped her ensign when unrivalled had glided past her hard to accept to get used to ile shook his head such a short while ago and their young firebrand of a captain would have beaten to quarters and had the guns run out before the poor spaniards had finished their siesta it was strange but it was what he did best ile thought about the rumours and the endless gossip in the mess to most of them slavery was just a word others saw it as a possibility for prize money even slave bounty or so the lower deck lawyers insisted rist had already considered something else if unrivalled was to be involved which seemed unlikely at close quarters there might be prizes any such capture would require a prizemaster it was hard not to consider it captain bolitho could not spare a lieutenant for the task and the midshipmen were either too young or incompetent it would be the one chance he needed he could see no other he turned and exclaimed if the master sees you handling that hell hang your guts out to dry my lad ede looked at him across the sextant which he had been about to place in its wellworn case he said almost shyly i used to work with these sir a parsons model one of the earliest i ever saw in the sudden silence rist saw the pain in his eyes and wondered how it had all gone wrong attempted murder they said youth and something else had saved him from the gibbet rist pushed it aside it happened ede was paying the price for whatever it was after all you didnt ask forgiveness when you were trying to hack out an enemys guts with dirk or cutlass he asked what about magnifying glasses for chart work and that sort of thing he turned away far enough you idiot but ede said i can repair them sir i made some once for my his employer he had nearly said the man he had stabbed almost to death rist nodded ill speak to the first lieutenant cant promise anything but we could find work for you here he added scathingly anything to keep some snotty blowhard out from under my feet he did not mention sandell he did not need to rist was thinking of galbraith how they had been together in that raid off the african coast the exploding charges the chebecks like fireballs while they had floundered to safety he liked the first lieutenant they got on well galbraith would be thinking much the same about his own dwindling chances of promotion others seemed to get it as if it were their right or because they knew somebody he heard the bell chime from the forecastle and thought of the rum which would soon be served in the warrant officers mess after that he had been ordered to take a boat ashore and stay in company with the captains new clerk a strange old bird if ever there was one but afterwards if he could find the house if it was still there he might seek a little pleasure with one of the girls he was fortytwo but told himself that he did not look it adam glanced through the open port again at another vessel which was swinging to her anchor to make a perfect twin with her reflection a portuguese flag it was a joke when you thought about it all the big powers beating the drum about banning slavery portugal most of all he gave a wry smile and yet they shipped more black ivory than any one he looked at his hands in the dusty sunlight slavers then he turned away and i was one of them captain adam bolitho climbed through unrivalleds entry port and paused to raise his hat to the quarterdeck and the flag which hung so limply that it was scarcely moving as he walked past the sideparty he felt the sweat run down his spine and gather above his belt and yet despite the busy afternoon ashore the rituals of meeting the governor and clearing the ship to take on supplies and fresh water he felt strangely alert perhaps it was just being back on board something he knew and trusted like the faces around him some so familiar they could have been aboard since the ship had first run up her colours when the world had been so very different for all of us yet he knew that several of them had only joined at penzance mere days ago were they regretting it an impulse seeking something they had believed lost galbraith greeted him and said fresh water will be brought out by lighters in the forenoon tomorrow sir his strong features were full of questions but he added only two hands for punishment sir it sounded like an apology working on the jetty drunk there was a fight adam glanced past him feeling the heat striking down through the taut rigging the neatly furled sails who was in charge mr midshipman fielding sir he is usually very good in such matters he is young all the more reason why he should be respected not abused because of it fielding the midshipman who had once awakened him from a dream that same dream another memory he said deal with it when we are at sea he shaded his eyes to study the other anchored ships nearby mostly small local craft they would have no difficulty clearing the harbour even with a light breeze he thought of the people he had seen on the waterfront the watching faces interested indifferent it was impossible to tell like some spanish officers from the visiting frigate there had been a group of them waiting for their boat by the stairs they had doffed their hats a couple of them had smiled politely was it really so simple so easy to forget to wipe out the madness the ferocity of battle which they had all suffered could i he saw partridge the barrelchested boatswain giving instructions to one of his mates a flogging then partridge would never even question it when it came down to it the articles of war and a thin line of marines was the final extent of a captains authority he turned his head missing something galbraith was saving it was partridge big fists on his hips an amused grin on his sunreddened face she may ave a fancy portuguese name my son but i knows er of old he seemed to realise that adam was listening and explained the brigantine over yonder sir the old rebecca as she was in them days first tasted salt water in brixham adam stared over his massive shoulder like the flaw in the pattern the face in the crowd which is so easily missed youre certain parker one of the boatswains mates grinned never forgets sir partridge seemed to realise it was not merely idle comment he said my father worked at the yard in brixham sir there was money trouble and someone else paid for rebecca to he completed his eyes sharpened the rig i remembers most the extra trysl rare unless youve got spare ands to manage em she were in all kinds o trouble even had a runin with the revenue boys then she vanished out o brixham disappeared he looked around at their faces till now galbraith said shes taken on no stores since we anchored sir and shes unloaded none either time in harbour costs money unless adam touched his sleeve come aft with me he looked across the water again perhaps it was meant to he or maybe he needed to delude himself there was no mail or message for unrivalled nothing so why had he noticed the blackhulled brigantine even the name albatroz across her counter when the gig had pulled him hack to the ship youve a good memory mr partridge it may be a great help partridge rubbed his chin and said well shes not in ballast sir my guess is shell be up an away before dawn i could take a party o picked men an go over he looked down surprised as his captain gripped his arm a portuguese ship in a portuguese harbour mr partridge it goes beyond our powers some might even say it is what certain people are expecting hoping we might do he smiled suddenly but we shall see eh galbraith followed him aft beneath the poop saw him glance at the nearest ladder as if he had remembered something adam said call all hands early leigh mr partridge may be right i want to work clear of the anchorage as soon as possible we shall use boats to warp her out if need be he gave that rare smile again my orders state quite clearly with all despatch so be it then he entered his cabin and hesitated there was no mail for the ship leigh new or old it will doubtless catch up with us one day the smile would not return now if youll excuse me i have a letter to write he walked to the stern windows and stared at the nearest ships and the waterfront beyond them on his way to pay his respects to the governor he had seen a little stall it could hardly be called a shop but it had reminded him of the one in malta where on a reckless impulse he had purchased the small silver sword with the single word destiny engraved on the reverse like some mindless lovesick midshipman but she had taken it and had worn it with him and for him and she had been here in this ship in this cabin he sat down and pulled open his shirt to cool his body destiny perhaps that too was another dream daniel yovell laid down his pen by its little well and tugged out a handkerchief to mop his brow it looked soiled and crumpled but he was an old enough hand to appreciate the value of fresh water no matter what size the ship ile had heard the familiar slap of feet overhead the bark of orders the response of squealing blocks and suntaut cordage he had always allowed it to remain a mystery something outside his own daily life even here in the great cabin it was stiflingly hot the deck barely moving the shadows angled across the beams and frames unchanged he looked over his spectacles and saw the captain leaning against his table his hands pressed on a chart some brass dividers where he had just dropped them it was over a week since they had quit funchal with a better wind than anyone who was interested had expected yovell picked up the pen once more and was thankful for his freedom to come and go in this part of the ship and more so for the privilege of sharing it without being compromised he watched adam bolitho now one hand moving on the chart as if it was feeling the way testing something preparing for some unknown obstacle only here in his own quarters did he ever seem to show uncertainty doubt like the day they had left funchal after discovering that the portuguese brigantine which had caught his attention had weighed and slipped out of harbour without anyone seeing her leave the water lighters had come out to the ship and once again yovell had sensed the captains mood why waste time taking on water when they might be at sea chasing and running down the mysterious alhatroz but it had been the right decision water was like gold dust and along this invisible coastline it might be weeks before they could obtain fresh supplies and the brigantine like most of unrivalleds company he was beginning to think that she was a need rather than a threat it was like being totally abandoned he thought every day the horizon was empty with not even a cry from the masthead he watched adams hand move again the dividers marking off some new calculation yovell had seen the other side to the captain despite whatever doubts he might have about the purpose of his mission he had told the first lieutenant to reduce the time spent aloft by all lookouts they are my eyes i want them always to be fresh and alert and he recalled when galbraith had come aft to ask about the new hand ede and the possibility of his working with the masters mates for which he seemed more suited than general seamanship some captains might have told their senior lieutenant to deal with it and not to distract them from more important duties instead captain bolitho had said i read his report i think it is a sensible idea keep me informed as watch followed watch the daily routine took precedence over everything sail and gun drill boathandling when unrivalled had been becalmed under a cloudless sky before a light northwesterly had taken pity on them out of necessity or discipline they were becoming used to one another making the best of it despite his inner caution yovell often found himself making comparisons he had seen sir richard bolitho trying to distance himself from the hard reality of punishment as an admiral he had been spared the tradition and spectacle of a flogging something which he had seemed unable to accept even after his years of service from midshipman to flag officer myadmiral ofengland as he had heard lady somervell call him several times a secret between them and something very dear to her adam bolitho could not do that as captain he had to order the relevant punishment according to the articles of war which held the power of life and death over every man aboard the old jacks made light of it getting a checkered shirt at the gangway was their casual dismissal of a flogging no matter what they thought of the rights and wrongs of the punishment the hard men like campbell bared their own scars from the cat with something like pride or jago the captains coxswain who had once been unjustly flogged in defiance even against the authority he served and upheld adam bolitho would have been at the quarterdeck rail with his officers while the punishment had been carried out the beat of a drum the masteratarms counting each stroke aloud the boatswains mate wielding the lash probably with little thought for the victim but very aware of his own performance without fear or favour as partridge would put it neither of the two men under punishment were new to the naw after two dozen lashes each they were cut down and hauled below to the sickbay without uttering a sound curiously yovell thought the midshipman who had been involved in the drunken affray had almost fainted a shadow dipped over the desk the captain was looking down at him a few more days my friend adam glanced at the skylight no wonder the west african station is so unpopular for us it is had enough imagine how it must be for the antislavery patrols small vessels for the most part brigs schooners even cutters he thought suddenly of james tyacke who had served on such patrols the devil with half a fine the slavers had called him tyacke who had become his uncles flag captain in frobisher who had been with hirer he swung away from the desk angry for allowing it to pierce his defences and tyacke was back there again in a frigate but not as a frigate adam had heard one longserving lieutenant describe the work as fit only for the haunted and the damned he heard napier padding about beyond the screen shoeless because he was feeling the heat or because he does not want to ojjend me he looked at yovells round shoulders have i been so intolerant so obsessed he strode to the stern windows feeling the deck tilt more steeply the wind but when he thrust open one of the windows he felt the air on his face and chest like the door of an open furnace he stared at the blue water the small ridge of crests breaking towards the ship little slivers of silver too flying fish so there would be sharks as well something else for the new men to get used to not many could swim if they fell overboard it was like sailing into nowhere his orders were vague to be interpreted by the senior officer at freetown or by the crown agent as the new appointment was grandly called probably a civilian and conferred as a reward or an escape he walked away from the glare and then paused abruptly by the desk again what was that yovell peered up at him i heard nothing sir adam listened to the sounds of rigging and the occasional thud of the great rudder he clenched his fists sailing into nowhere feet outside then the marine sentrys call first lieutenant sir galbraith entered his forehead reddened where his hat had been jammed down to shade his eyes what is it galbraith glanced at yovell as if to share it masthead sir sail on the larboard bow standing away adam wanted to swallow to moisten his mouth he could do neither he said call the hands leigh get the tgallants on her my compliments to mr cristie id like him in the chartroom without delay he looked at him calmly it could be any vessel it was infectious even yovell was nodding and beaming galbraith grinned i think not sir adam snatched up his notes and strode to the screen door but stopped and looked aft again where yovell remained hunched at the desk in silhouette against the dazzling blue backdrop he said simply when next you have the will to pray my friend id be grateful if youd speak for me then he was gone and for the first time since he could remember daniel yovell was guilty of pride lieutenant george varlo jumped down from the mizzen shrouds his shirt blackened with tar everyone on watch was busy about his duties like badly rehearsed players he thought angrily careful to avoid his eyes and no doubt amused by his stained and dishevelled appearance he looked up at the topgallant sails free and bulging now to the steady northwesterly such as it was the seamen already sliding down backstays to the deck while the landmen and novices took a slower but safer route by the ratlines urged on by threats and yells as one mast vied with the other the masthead pendant was licking out towards the southern horizon and varlo could feel the ship coming to life again dipping her lee bulwark towards the water the masthead lookout had reported a sail somewhere out there beyond the larboard how miles away even by climbing up into the weather shrouds varlo had been unable to see it a desert of glaring water and even if the lookout was not mistaken he turned and saw galbraith climbing through the companion hatchway strong dependable and as popular as any first lieutenant could safely be he thought and yet they were rivals and would remain strangers through this or any other commission galbraith strode to the compass and consulted it after checking the new display of canvas unrivalleds skyscrapers as the old hands termed them the first thing you ever saw of a friend or an enemy cutting above the horizons edge varlo was twentysix years old he glanced at midshipman hawkins the newest and youngest member of the gunroom a baby the one with the beautiful sextant which the master had admired impossible to believe he had ever been so shallow so ignorant even of the basic terms of seamanship and naval discipline he moved to the side again and felt his shoes sticking to the deck seams his stained shirt clinging like another skin he thought suddenly of his father it was common enough over all the years of war for families to be separated held together only by memory and the occasional letter his father had been a postcaptain and one of considerable merit varlo accepted that he had learned more about him from others who had known or served with him when he considered it he realised that he had probably only seen his father half a dozen times in his life if that grave overwhelming in some ways warmly human at other times each like a separate portrait different his father had died in a shiptoship action in the west indies nearly ten years ago it was still hard to believe he had not lived long enough to be proud of his only son when he had eventually been commissioned he heard someone say captains coming up sir he felt it again like an unquenchable anger would they have warned me he waited while captain bolitho checked the wind direction and studied the set of every sail old cristie had come up with the captain his expression giving nothing away he was the same in the wardroom like an oracle while some of the others chatted emptily about the possibilities of prizemoney or moving to a better station he remained aloof unless he was with his charts or like now gauging the captains mood like those of the wind and tide varlo had found nobody he could talk to or meet at what he considered a like level not obeirne the surgeon the listener who hoarded information and indiscreet revelations perhaps for some future yarn or one of his endless irish jokes nor lieutenant bellairs who was keen and very conscious of his new rank still a midshipman at heart like cristie the other senior warrant officers who shared the wardroom and its privileges because of their circumstances were kept apart and there was galbraith brave and obviously respected but yearning for a command of his own a rival then he heard the captain say suddenly masthead lookout and galbraiths immediate reply expecting it sullivan sir bolitho said i wonder he looked at cristie bring her up two points if the wind holds again he left it unsaid man the braces stir yourselves bolitho took a telescope from the rack and glanced briefly at varlo if he runs we can head him off varlo watched him as he trained the glass to windward sidestepping as some seamen hustled past him gasping with exertion as they hauled at the mizzen braces the marines clumping along with them varlo had heard most of the stories surrounding the captain about his famous uncle killed aboard his flagship at the moment of napoleons escape from elba and of his father captain hugh bolitho a traitor to his country who had fought with the revolutionary navy of america not married but it was said that he was popular with women gossip but where was the man as calm and unruffled as he now appeared turning to smile as a young seaman cannoned into a corporal of marines and paused to apologise the marine who was built like a cliff and had probably felt nothing answered with equal formality one and for the king matey spray spattered over the quarterdeck ninepounders to dry instantly in the unwavering sun deck there shes makin more sail then so shall we set the forecourse mr galbraith more hands on the main brace he looked round briefly as the helmsman called east by south sir full an bye unrivalled was taking it well her weather rail rising to the horizon and remaining there the great shadow of the forecourse spreading and darkening the scurrying figures at sheets and braces a good wind across the larboard quarter more spray and varlo saw some seamen twist their halfnaked bodies grinning as it soaked them like rain he noticed that one of them had been flogged but he was sharing the moment with his mates men he knew and trusted perhaps the only ones varlo swung away angry with himself there was no comparison mr varlo adam bolitho did not move nearer nor did he appear to lower his glass i suggest you go below and seek out a clean shirt varlo saw galbraith turn suddenly stiffbacked surprised shocked then bolitho did look at him frowning it may be nothing but we have to know what this vessel is about whatever we do we shall be unpopular both with those who are making money out of slavery and those who are losing it because of us he smiled you are the kings man today mr varlo dress accordingly he levelled the glass again my cabin servant will give you one of mine if you are in need believe me i have not forgotten the failings of the wardroom messmen varlo swallowed hard he did not know what to say even galbraith seemed taken aback varlo tried again im to board her sir bolithos jaw tightened then he said almost lightly take the jollyboat i suggest you have mr rist with you he is an old dog when it comes to a search he handed almost tossed the telescope to midshipman hawkins and said i saw her he glanced around the quarterdeck embracing them albatroz as i thought it might be varlo had one foot on the companion ladder when the voice stopped him take care be on your guard when you board her varlo ducked his head below the coaming and did not hear galbraith say i could go over to her sir nor did he hear the quiet but incisive answer perhaps you are too experienced eh leigh nly responsibility remember he saw jago at the weather ladder one foot on the top step his head turning as if searching for danger adam said a different war my friends but just as deadly to those who must fight it afterwards galbraith thought he had been speaking to himself and the ship the haunted and the damned adam bolitho could not recall how many times he had climbed into the weather shrouds to obtain a better view of the brigantine or how long it had been since the other vessel had been sighted he had played with the idea of going aloft where sullivan the eagleeyed lookout was watching the performance of both vessels in comparative comfort but there was no time it had to be soon the wind had freshened still more and he could feel the ease with which unrivalleds hull was ploughing over and through the new array of shallow rollers the wind was an ally it was also a possible threat even without his small telescope his spyglass as he had heard young napier describe it he had seen the brigantine standing away on the larboard bow not running but standing close to the wind reaching into it it seemed with every stitch of canvas spread thrusting over as steeply as any vessel could lie under such pressure he glanced now along the full length of his command men not employed at braces and halliards were watching probably betting on the outcome of this unlikely contest the new hands were openly excited it was their first experience of shiphandling the reasons were unimportant he had to admit that albatroz was being handled superbly her master knew exactly what he was doing by clawing closer and closer to the wind he held on to a chance of coming about and cutting across unrivalleds stern if he succeeded he could wait for darkness and with luck make a full escape he had the whole ocean on the other hand if he ran southeast with a soldiers wind he could not outpace the frigate but if the wind grew any stronger it would be impossible to put down a boat with any hope of boarding her he cannot fight us so why must he run unless he has something to hide a portuguese vessel sailing from a portuguese harbour should have nothing to fear by the latest agreement it had been reluctantly accepted that portugal could even continue loading and shipping slaves from her own territories provided they were south of the equator adam strode to the rail where cristie and two of his masters mates were in close discussion but they had to raise their voices to be heard above the boom of canvas and the noisy sluice of water which surged almost to the lee gun ports one woodthorpe was saying bastards got everything but the cooks bloody apron spread hell give us the slip yet damn his eyes cristie saw the captain and said harshly two miles sir another hour and hell see some sense but if he lulls an comes hard about he shook his head you know what its like some of the others were listening and his own words came back to him like a fist my responsibility he shaded his eyes to look up at the yards the quivering thrust of the topgallant sails holding the sun now to mark the change of direction cristie had made his point he said ask the gunner to come aft rist the other masters mate showed his strong teeth in a grin mr stranace is here now sir old stranace as he was called behind his hack shuffled out of the drivers great shadow and touched his forehead his face was a mass of wrinkles and his years at sea much of the time bent and groping in one magazine or another surrounded by enough powder to blast him and the ship to fragments had given him a permanent stoop but his eye was as sharp as sullivans and his judgment relating to his precious artillery had not been faulted he asked two mile did e say sir he bared his uneven teeth a grin or disdain it was hard to tell less n that in my view he nodded you want im dismasted adam stared across the water to give himself time what would people say in england he wondered with their fixed ideas of the heart of oak or the sure shield as william pitt had once called the navy if they could witness this the frigate captain with his grubby shirt a rent in one shoulder hatless with no sword or gold lace to mark him out from those around him and old stranace bent with shaggy grey hair and the shapeless felt slippers he wore to guard against striking sparks in or around the magazines he said if i alter course a few degrees to the southrd the wind will lay us over still further he saw the gunners eyes move quickly to the larboard battery of eighteenpounders the sea barely visible as the hull tilted across her own shadow then he grunted ill lay it meself sir number one larboard adam added i want her stopped thats all he was never sure if old stranace could hear him so many broadsides and countless other occasions from saluting to putting down a careering chebeck had left him partially deaf it was common enough among deepwater sailormen but there was nothing wrong with his ears today ill part is bloody air sir stand by on the quarterdeck braces there helm alee steady hold her steer soueast cristie rubbed his chin and watched the gunner clawing his way down the lee ladder calling out names as he went his cracked voice carrying effortlessly over the chorus of wind and rigging cristie said dourly albatrozs master will think were giving up he sounded mistrustful of the new arrangements by the time unrivalled had settled on her new course the first gun on the windward side was almost ready its crew kneeling and bowing around their charge like worshippers at some pagan ritual old stranace had been a gun captain himself it must have been a long long time ago but he had forgotten nothing he selected one ball from the garland fondling it in both hands then changing it for another with the same performance until he was satisfied he even supervised the loading of the charge and the tamping down of the wad and then the ball itself but allowing one of the gun crew to tap it home cristie said dryly hell not use a flintlock either the crafty old bugger adam found time to recognise the affection as well as the amusement unlike the hammer of a musket which was brought violently into play by a strong spring the deck gun was worked by jerking a lanyard if it failed to strike a spark instantly the gun misfired so great and regular was the risk in close action that slowmatches were always kept ready burning in protected tubs of sand adam raised his spyglass again and waited for the brigantine to lift above the blue water like some great avenging bird ready sir that was galbraith his voice unusually hushed adam looked forward at the small pattern of figures around the eighteenpounder closest to the forecastle the port was open the gun had already been run out extra hands were throwing their weight on the tackles to haul the weapon up to and through it he saw old stranace put his hand over the forearm of one of the crew guiding the handspike while the muzzle was raised to its full elevation and to his satisfaction if the shot scored a direct hit the repercussions would be severe if it went widely astray it would be no less harmful he wondered only briefly if the men on the brigantines deck had noticed that gun frigate of the worlds greatest navy was standing away giving up the chase and would it really matter he closed his mind to it fire as you bear he saw stranace glance aft for just a few seconds the responsibility was not his to carry adam saw his arm move with the speed of light the puff of smoke like steam from a heated pipe he felt the grip of ice around his stomach mi fire there was a sharp bang and the eighteenpounder seemed to come to life hurling itself inboard down the sloping planking until the tackles slowed and then brought the truck to a jolting halt nobody made a move to sponge out the gun as if the single shot had somehow paralysed them there was something like a great sigh changing and rising to a wild cheer as a tall waterspout white and solid against the dark water burst skywards off the brigantines quarter at this range it was impossible to determine the exact fall of shot but everett the sergeant of marines exclaimed much closer an them buggersd be swimmin with th sharks adam said bring her back on course if you please rist called theyre shortenin sail sir call away the boats crew and inform the bosun adam plucked at his shirt it did not sound like his own voice what had he expected and what would he have done he looked again the brigantine was broaching to her canvas in disorder while they prepared to await instructions varlo was close by ready sir adam barely heard him so lets be about it eh lieutenant varlo made another attempt to get to his feet in the swaying jollyboat but had to find support in the coxswains shoulder it was a hard pull the small boat veering and dipping in a succession of troughs and broken crests spray bursting over the oarsmen like rain he shouted dont feather man lay back on it rist sat wedged in the sternsheets with two armed seamen his eyes slitted against the spray gauging the flapping sails of the drifting brigantine waiting for the unexpected a part of him was still able to sense the bitterness and resentment in the boat it was a handpicked crew he had chosen each man himself good experienced seamen every one of them not one would crack and run if shooting started or worse a burst of grape was fired it could only take one shot to finish the jollyboat at this range no matter what unrivalled did after that it would not help any of them he caught the stroke oarsmans eye then saw him look away astern while he lay back on his loom probably watching their ship it was better not to look back once you had started rist thought the ship always seemed so far away he peered hard at the brigantine again pierced for several guns six maybe but none run out or manned yet varlo called well go under her lee rist swallowed hard he did not know varlo never would in all likelihood one thing was clear he was out of his depth in this sort of trick he had been some admirals flag lieutenant the gossip said more used to picking out the right people for his lord and master to meet and entertain than doing his stuff as a sea officer he said shes still swingin sir but the chains are the best chance varlo turned and stared at him as if searching for criticism or defiance so i can see he gripped the coxswains shoulder again as the hull bounced over then he said suppose they dont speak english rist almost grinned no matter sir he touched the hilt of the short fighting sword under his coat thisll do the talkin the brigantine was right over them now or so it appeared they could even hear the clamour of loose rigging and flapping canvas above the din of oars and sea rist watched closely trying to stay unruffled like all those other times just one stupid mistake a man loosing off a pistol by mischance it was all it took but seamanship came first bows he held his breath as the bowman boated his oar and changed it for a boathook just in time with this sea running they could have driven straight into the other vessel splintering oars disaster he saw the helmsman glance at him hardly a blink it was enough the tiller bar swung over and the boat reeled around toward the brigantines rounded hull oars varlo had recovered himself boat your oars they were alongside the trapped water leaping between the vessels while men groped for their weapons some staring up at the nearest gun port varlo snapped with me mr rist rist stumbled after him gripping a shoulder here a steadying hand there it was all wrong for both of them to board together was madness they could be killed as they climbed aboard now it was then that it hit him varlo would never admit it in two centuries but he needed him the next moment they were pulling themselves up and over the bulwark figures and peering faces seemed to loom on every side and rist felt the menace like something physical through it all a voice boomed by what right do you board my ship varlo had drawn his sword and set against the brigantines seamen looked completely out of place in his spraydappled blue coat he had somehow managed to retain his hat through the crossing his voice was quite unemotional and steady as if on parade or rist thought facing a firing squad he would be the same in either situation in the kings name the remainder of the boarding party had climbed aboard peering around weapons ready something they knew and understood from hard experience a false move now and there would be blood rist strode forward but not our blood he stared through the shrouds and saw unrivalled for the first time since they had shoved off he had never thought of a ship as being beautiful before as a trained seaman you saw her in so many different guises and she was there waiting fie turned as varlo finished his little speech about the right to stop and search and the fact that albatrozs master should be well aware of the said agreement rist examined the master broad and heavy without being overweight all muscle a man who could and would know how to use it about his own age he thought but it was hard to tell the face was so weathered and tanned by sun and sea that he could have been anything but rist was certain of one thing this man was as english as he was he had a hard but vaguely familiar accent like loveday unrivalleds cooper loveday was a londoner and had been a thames waterman in the limehouse district for several years before he had volunteered or been pressed by some overeager lieutenant as a waterman he would have had the precious protection varlo said sharply post guards ile pointed to one of several swivel guns put a man there the master said this is a portuguese vessel lieutenant we have no part in smuggling or unlawful trading he shrugged you can see my papers rist watched carefully very sure of himself but he must have known unrivalled was the ship which had been in funchal and been ready for this so why had he tried to run in the end they would have caught him blown this vessel out of the water had he fired a single shot with slaves you had a chance given time but to fire on a kings ship was another matter piracy a hanging matter and briskly done his own thought came back at him given time varlo was calling to a boatswains mate gesturing at him as if he were a new recruit the vessel would be searched rist glanced at the brigantines powerful master he was speaking with another man probably his mate like one of those prizefighters you saw in more doubtful harbours around the mediterranean squat bald and neckless with bare arms as thick as a youngsters legs turkish maybe the man looked over at him now you could almost feel his eyes like metal merciless varlo strode over to him now we shall see eh he snatched out his handkerchief and dabbed his mouth he sounded out of breath rist jerked his head towards the two figures by the wheel what about the master sir varlo had to drag his mind back him names cousens english this is all he can do i suppose it will be up to the captain he broke off as two seamen emerged from a hatchway and one called nothin down there sir varlo dabbed his mouth again must be something he was running away he stared around at the silent staring figures i cant simply take his word for it rist waited that same uncertainty but never an admission he was suddenly angry of course this vessel was a slaver the fresh paint and tarreddown rigging meant nothing she was empty probably on passage to one of the countless islets which stretched along the atlantic shoreline where larger ships waited to bargain and to complete their business for the most valuable cargo in the world he had seen it and been a part of it shut his eyes and ears to the inhuman treatment as men women and sometimes children had been dragged aboard and packed into darkened holds where the conditions had been too foul to believe and i did it ile tried to contain his anger leave it to lieutenant varlo youll get no praise or recognition for doing his work for him nor would he recognise it ifyou did someone else reported empty sir lawson the jollyboats coxswain touched his arm reckon the capnll be spittin fire by now he was enjoying it then he murmured watch out for squalls it was alhatrozs master very confident even pushing a levelled musket aside as he walked over to join the small group by the main hatch i have work to do money to earn so that my men can be paid he did not attempt to conceal his contempt we stopped for you because you fired on my ship but my employers will take this to a higher authority than your quarterdeck varlo snapped how dare you speak to me in this fashion he looked down as rist plucked his sleeve as if he had been struck rist said calmly you had a lively passage capn we were hard put to catch you ile was still gripping varlos coat and was more conscious of that than his own selfcontrol so you can speak too eh beyond the bald neckless mate gave a grimace probably intended as a grin rist smiled ive been at sea all my life ile felt varlo staring at him doubtless unable to accept that his subordinate was daring to interfere one thing i was taught on pain o death never light fires in a had seaway theres nothin that cant wait til youre snug at anchor right he turned aside and added evenly pitch sir i could smell it when we came on board my mind didnt grapple it thats all varlo said tell me rist beckoned to the boatswains mate selby take two hands down the main hold he raised one hand an yes i know youve already searched it selby glared at his companion and said saw the pitch boiler sir coolin so i thought best to leave it be rist touched the hilt of his hanger and allowed the coat to fall open so that it shone dully in the late sunlight tip it out the rest of you stand fast where you are to lawson he added be ready with the signal at any second he expected varlo to shout him down even put him under arrest for insubordination although he doubted if the others would obey any such order it was no longer mere routine the sailors lot with nothing at the end of it rist looked at the brigantines master and said almost softly if you try any tricks captain cousens i promise youll get it first it took another ten minutes it felt like an hour or more across the glittering strip of water unrivalled had changed tack again almost bowson to the smaller vessel as if poised to draw even closer in case of a delay or some trick which might still give albatroz time to prolong what adam bolitho probably now believed was a calculated error on his part rist saw varlo take a pace away as selby came on deck with what appeared to be a wad of tarred rags grasped in a pair of tongs varlo said nothing and nobody moved so that the sea and shipboard noises intruded like some wild fanfare rist said on the deck the metal was so clogged with partly set pitch that it could have been anything rists hanger was quite steady in his hand although he barely recalled drawing it easy mister cousens id not want to spit you here an now but in gods sight i will if needs be selby shook out some more pieces of metal iron manacles rist stared at them for that first horrific voyage it was varlo who broke the silence very well lawson make the signal to unrivalled rist took a long hard breath a close run thing freetown the largest natural harbour on the african continent was always teeming with vessels of every kind and a nightmare even for any experienced master making his first approach some of the larger merchantmen loading or discharging cargo were surrounded by lighters and local traders while stately arab dhows and smaller coastal craft wended amongst the busy moorings with apparent disregard or any respect for the right of way slightly apart from the merchant shipping the frigate lay at her cable her black and huff reflection almost perfect on the barely moving water awnings were in position white and bartaut in the relentless glare windsails too to bring even slight relief to the close confines of the lower decks she mounted a fine figurehead a fiercelooking kestrel with widely spread wings head slightly turned as if about to take to the air she was in fact his britannic majestys frigate kestrel of guns although any trained eye would quickly notice several of her ports were empty without even the customary wooden quakers to give the impression that she was fully armed there were some men working aloft on the braced yards and neatly furled sails their bodies deeply tanned while others did what they could to find patches of shade beneath awnings or the tight pattern of rigging a white ensign at the taffrail was barely moving a masthead pendant occasionally lifted and licked out like a whip to make a lie of the oppressive heat all her boats were in the water alongside to ensure that the seams remained tightly sealed and a royal marine sentry paced along each gangway undaunted it seemed by his full scarlet uniform his sole occupation to watch out for thieves it was not unknown for swimmers to pick upon a moored longboat cut its painter and remove it without anyone seeing or raising the alarm a replacement was hard to get and the marine would not hesitate to use his musket if it was attempted during his tour of duty apart from lion mountain there was little to distinguish the shore from any of the other anchorages on the windward coast huddled white dwellings and some native huts by the water with the unending backdrop of green scrub and forest which seemed to be waiting to reclaim its territory from the intruders and the whole panorama appeared to be moving in a heat haze dust too you could feel it between your teeth everywhere even out here in a kings ship to some of the newer hands it was still something of an adventure strange tongues and the noise and bustle of harbour life something completely alien to men from villages and farms in england for others the endless patrols were hated above all else the monotony of handling salthardened canvas in blazing heat again and again throughout each watch to contain the light tropical airs and the periods of windless calm when men would turn on each other at the slightest provocation with the inevitable aftermath of punishment and always the fear of fever something never far from a sailors thoughts along this unending coastline a few could see beyond the discomfort and monotony one was kestrels captain standing now in his stern cabin his body partially in shadow he watched the haphazard pattern of harbour traffic with professional interest captain james tyacke was used to it even though his return to the antislavery patrols had been a fresh beginning he touched the hot timbers and in a new ship although classed as a fifthrate kestrel had been prepared for her new role a third of her heavier armament had been removed to allow for more stores space and the extended sea passages she would be required to take she carried a full complement however enough for excursions ashore when needed and for prizecrews should they run down a slaver when the chance offered itself tvacke was an old hand at it ile had gained his first command a little brig when he had been pitting his wits against the slavers ile touched the mutilated side of his face burned away like wax with only the eve undamaged a miracle they had said at haslar that had been after the great battle at aboukir bay nelsons resounding victory over the french fleet which had destroyed napoleons planned conquest of egypt and beyond the battle of the nile it was called now although most people had probably forgotten it he thought ile could even do that without bitterness now something he had once believed impossible he touched his skin again the legacy it had earned him the nickname the devil with half a face among the slavers it had been very different then england had been at war and the antislavery patrols had taken second place to everything else slavers had been active then war or not and justice had been swift when you could catch them now with the coming of peace there were pious demands from the old enemies for stricter controls not only of slavery but also the administering of justice irrefutable proof of every mime the word of a captain and his officers was no longer enough so it took longer and it cost more money they never learned he stiffened as he saw a vessel moving seemingly at a snails pace towards the roadstead a pyramid of pale canvas each sail expertly braced to catch the air in this windless harbour going to england ile could think about that without regret without questioning his motives more to the point she was carrying the recently appointed government agent who had been sent to freetown to investigate and assess the navys antislavery activities the climate had got to him almost immediately and drink had done the rest he would not live very long after the ship landed him in england he glanced around his cabin spartan some would call it with little to hint at the character and the courage of kestrels captain the government agent had come aboard soon after his arrival tyacke could see him now concerned sincere probably genuinely interested in what he had been sent to discover to pass back to some desk in london at least their lordships of admiralty no matter what you thought of them were usually content to leave it to the flag officer or captain in charge of the station in question not so with the civilian authority the foreign office even trying to describe the area which was required to be under constant surveillance had been like talking to a block of wood just a handful of menofwar like kestrel but relying for the most part on smaller vessels brigs and schooners the area extended from twelve degrees north of the equator to some fifteen degrees south even using a chart he had been unable to make the agent understand so he had described the navys patrol as being akin to sailing from the northern tip of scotland down and through the dover strait and back up and around to the clyde he had made some impression but he doubted if it would make much sense when it reached that desk in london a needle in a haystack perhaps that was what appealed to him he heard footsteps firm and assured john raven his secondincommand old for his rank he had come up the hard way from the lower deck if they were good there were none better and john raven was good they had grown to respect one another more as individuals men rather than through the necessary division of ranks if it was personal it went no further than this cabin unlike some ships where a captains habits and weaknesses would become common gossip in the wardroom and throughout the command raven had been married but was no longer he had served in brigs also and was at ease in the cramped familiarity of smaller craft and doubtless he knew his captain how his face had been burned away at the nile how he had lost his girl because of it and had found her again he turned towards the door as the sentry called first lieutenant sir iii then i left her for this he smiled news john raven was strongly built with a still young face at odds with hair which was completely grey the guardboat has just come alongside sir seven sisters is returning from patrol they report the frigate unrivalled making her final approach he hesitated watching his captains blue eyes it had been impossible at first not to stare at the terrible disfigurement but he had noticed almost from the beginning of the commission that tyacke seemed able to accept it carry it the eyes were considering now seven sisters was one of their brigs but it was not that unrivalled sir fortysix guns he paused but saw tyackes expression soften yes i know her shes commanded by captain adam bolitho he turned away to watch the guardboat pulling strongly around the larboard quarter they all said the navy was a family love it hate it damn it or die for it it was still a family like that last time in england when kestrel had called at falmouth he had intended to call upon catherine somervell he did not notice that he was touching his face again nor that raven was observing him perhaps discovering something he was thinking of the day when she had boarded his ship and had kissed him on this burned skin in front of the whole company and they had loved her for it as did he was still not sure if he had been relieved that she had been away in london they had said that neither of them would have been able to surmount it the one thing which drew them together now forced them apart the happy few now another memory but john aliday sir richards coxswain his oak had come aboard in falmouth had sat in that very chair where john raven was standing bolitho had died in his arms on that day tyacke could never forget he spoke again calmer now sir richards nephew a fine officer they both looked up at the open skylight as a call trilled and hands were piped to some new task on the forecastle i knew another frigate would be joining us he smiled perhaps its time to stop running eh half an hour before sunset unrivalled dropped anchor the witness despite the heat unrivalleds chartroom seemed almost cool compared with the quarterdeck above adam bolitho waited by the table while the sailing master wrote a few more notes in his log they had been on deck for the noon sights but with the sun blazing down from almost directly above the mainmast truck it had been hard to concentrate the same undulating green coastline on and on without any apparent change even the midshipmen with their sextants had been unusually subdued like sailing into nowhere he watched cristies strong brown hands clumsy most people would think and yet his notes like his carefully pencilled hearings and calculations were fine almost delicate adam sighed it was as he had expected they had logged some eight hundred miles since leaving freetown southeast and then east again into the gulf of guinea and it had taken them nearly nine days unrivalled had been designed to sail and fight in another sea against the americans with their powerful frigates larger and better armed than most british ships unrivalled was fast under the right circumstances and had more than proved her agility in close combat but this he clenched both fists and felt his shirt tug against his back like a wet rag this snails pace was a test of endurance he thought of his meeting with james tyacke before receiving his orders to put to sea again iie stared at the chart and wiped the sweat from his eyes to calm himself lie had expected to meet tyacke but he knew unrivalleds arrival had come as a surprise to the other captain and he had recalled their reunion many times since they had quit freetown warm but wary some sentiment present which was stronger than perhaps he had realised tyacke had done his best to explain the immediate problems of the antislavery patrols and had even provided some notes on the subject and about some of the other vessels and commanders adam might encounter along the way tyacke made no secret of his displeasure at being kept in harbour the stations commodore arthur turnbull was at sea in one of the patrol schooners it was his way tyacke said ile could not apparently accept the need to remain in freetown tied to a shore administration for which he was probably unsuited in any case adam had known several captains like that promoted suddenly to commodore or flag rank something totally unexpected in most cases they had still yearned for the separate and personal authority of command a ship so until turnbull returned to freetown tyacke was in charge he obviously hated the prospect there had been reports of several suspicious vessels in the area a big ocean but as tyacke had remarked the landing points where slaves could be bargained for and then shipped out were known even though some were almost inaccessible for anything bigger than a cutter it had been brewing for months slaving captains were becoming more daring and prepared to bargain against their own kind for one more rich cargo their ships were built for the purpose designed for service in the light airs of these latitudes against them the british fleet had older ships which had been constructed for the endless blockade of ushant and all the french ports where ships of war might lie and for riding out those heavy seas a few ships like unrivalled might tip the balance and allow smaller craft to penetrate the rivers and lagoons and confront the slavers before they could reach open water and run to the markets of brazil and cuba tyacke had said diplomacy has many pitfalls adam good intentions and greed go hand in hand and with turnbull at sea the acting governor seems unwilling to lift a finger and a new crown agent was expected at any time an improvement tyacke obviously doubted it let me get kestrel back to sea adam the diplomats can stew adam realised that cristie had said something cristie gave his twisted grin a few more days sir five maybe an we shall sight the island of st thomas he tapped the chart and waited for adam to lean over it the furthest leg of the patrol area after that adam nodded we shall return to freetown he felt a drop of sweat splash on his hand even then they might fail to make contact with the commodore and then what more orders he tried to recall what tyacke had written in his notes about st thomas a small portuguese island right on the equator barely twenty miles long insignificant he straightened his hack and frowned but it had shipped many thousands of slaves protected by the clause in the agreement which allowed portugal to use her own ports to trade in human lives south of the equator without interference it was madness and it was cruelly unfair he shrugged and said i wonder what will happen to our prize the alhatroz cristie did not blink he was becoming used to the captains occasional disclosures and his doubts strangely it seemed to add to the man rather than the reverse he had heard lieutenant varlo bragging about the brigantine they had taken into freetown the impression it would make his mate rist had said hotly a few manacles itll take more than that to pin a charge on that hugger cousens cristie had hoarded that too rist knew more than he realised but he was probably right with bounty being offered for every slave freed and recovered a captain and his ships company could be expected to share among them a purse which ranged from sixty pounds for a male slave to ten pounds for a child but the prize court would require more than a few irons or manacles as proof it was all most of the sailors could think about it was strange about rist he thought he wanted to be a prizemaster the only way up the ladder for a man of his service and rank but had returned from the albatroz angry troubled about something it was unlike him he was a good masters mate and a good friend when you needed one in a manofwar that was most of the time adam did not notice the masters amusement he was looking at the open log the notes and the observations ships position and course a man for punishment an issue of grog unrivalleds life story but it was the date almost a year since his uncle had fallen tyacke must have been thinking of it too but had said nothing he felt the locket sticking to his skin and catherine he crossed to an open port and stared at the unchanging pattern of land abeam misty in some places hard and sharp in others were there eyes over there watching this ship he wondered like the playful dolphins he had seen around unrivalleds slowmoving stem this morning or the gulls which seemed too tired to leave the water as the ship had passed them by the hot unmoving air quivered very slightly more a sensation than a sound he straightened a storm d you think cristie turned bare feet thudded overhead as the watch on deck came alive he studied the captains profile and thought unexpectedly of his home on the tyne it was probably snowing there bitter too but all he said was gunfire sir lieutenant galbraith strode to the larboard nettings and levelled the telescope he had just snatched from its rack by the compass box he winced as the sun burned across his shoulders when he stepped out of the drivers shadow he had sent midshipman deighton clattering down the companion ladder but knew in his heart that the captain would have heard the distant echoes he ignored the buzz of voices nearby speculation a welcome break from the airless torpor of watchkeeping he swore under his breath the lens had misted over the masthead lookout might see something but it had been gunfire not heavy but rapid now there was utter silence he heard the captains voice now he smiled to himself no longer a stranger bring her up a point if shell take it mr deighton aloft with you and speak with the masthead he turned away and must have glanced at the seriousfaced midshipman an extra pair of eyes wont do any harm galbraith cupped his hands pipe the hands to the braces mr partridge cristie was here too tgallants sir a question or a gentle reminder you could never be sure with the master adam nodded yes hands aloft eastnoreast galbraith waited for the confusion to settle into a pattern topmen swarming up the shrouds like monkeys marines at the mizzen braces a masters mate using his hat to deflect the glare from the compass so that the helmsmen could see it helm alee the big double wheel creaked over like everything else bone dry galbraith licked his lips and tried not to think of a tankard of ale in some impossible situation he started as another sound sighed against the hull just one an explosion a ship in trouble on fire adam joined him by the nettings too much haze coming offshore and in any case lie did not finish as deighton called down deck there sail on the larboard bow sir he paused perhaps the lookout had told him something then very fine on the how sir moving inshore cristie said not too smartly charted hereabouts well be close enough presently someone else murmured ill bet the bastard knows it too galbraith accepted it a few sounds a vague sighting of a sail probably quite small to be standing so close inshore not much to go on and yet these men around him had already given it a form and personality somebody to hate adam took a glass and climbed into the shrouds again the coastline was unchanged moving slightly in the haze no wonder men went mad in the desert he forced himself to ignore the tarred cordage which was burning through his breeches like a furnace bar it was a sail maybe two masts but not very large he was already losing it in the clinging heat haze he bit his lip they were getting a better share of the wind than unrivalled that was certain a waste of time but there had to be a reason get the tgallants on her now he stared up surprised as the maintopsail writhed and then banged away from its yard wind like an omen he heard the creak of steering gear and saw one of the helmsmen turn to grin at his companion thats woke er up ted adam walked to the opposite side his mind busy with the frugal intelligence at his disposal an explosion only the one and yet a vessel was standing away from whatever had caused it fear or guilt there was nothing to choose he knew that cristie was watching him thinking of that last time when his captain had taken this ship through a channel which was scarcely known adam often thought about it holding his breath while unrivalleds great shadow had risen inexorably from the sea bed for a final embrace a terrible risk and galbraith would remember it better than anyone it had saved his life that day he glanced at the ensign as it curled away from the peak it would not last but while it did deighton yelled down again deck there he seemed to falter something in the water sir same bearing what the hell does he think hes doing varlo had arrived adam cupped his hands and waited as the sudden flurry of wind through canvas and shrouds eased into a sigh tell me take your time somehow he knew it was sullivan up there it was his watch but he would have been there anyway would have known the seaman who had fought at trafalgar under our nel and who was still working on a fine model of his old ship the spartiate strange how one thought linked to the other spartiate was a french prize taken by nelson at the nile seven years before trafalgar his uncles last flagship frobisher had been a prize too did ships feel it deck there adam stared up at the mainmast seeing the midshipmans struggle his efforts to remain calm some wreckage sir very small and adam said quietly tell me between us he did not realise he had spoken aloud nor did he see galbraiths look of compassion blood sir cristie said how could it be even with a glass he could never see he broke off as his senior mate rist retorted harshly he would you know if theres enough of it adam folded his arms mr cousens go aloft and bring him down he held the signals midshipmans eyes with care do you understand he did not turn take in the tgallants mr galbraith and have the jollyboat made ready for lowering he counted the seconds and said go yourself leigh then he crossed to the quarterdeck rail and stood beside the sailing master i shall take every care mr cristie he tried to smile but put a good leadsman in the chains if it will help to ease your mind all the unemployed hands turned to watch as midshipman deighton jumped down from the shrouds and walked across to his captain adam said you did well deighton now tell me the rest in your own time he saw jago by the hatch he would know what to do the midshipman said ii thought it was the sea sir changing colour but it was spreading and spreading he looked at the water unable to believe it it was all alive sir he dropped his head and said in a small voice sullivan said they were sharks sir hundreds jago was here guiding the youth to a fire bucket roughly and without sympathy here spew into this deighton would have cracked if he had offered gentleness it seemed to take an eternity the ship gliding through the offshore current with scarcely a ripple beneath her stem and all the while the sea seemed to open up across the bows stained in drifting patterns of pink with tendrils of darker red reaching up like weed to wander amongst the surface litter of flotsam broken spars an upturned boat planks and scraps of canvas most of which were charred and in the centre as if there by accident was a drifting hatch cover and on it a human figure stretched out staring at the sun as if crucified varlo said thickly must be dead too and then partridge the boatswain abrupt angry dont say that sir th poor devil wears your coat adam said heaveto if you please mr varlo take over the watch stand by to lower the jollyboat lawson pick your crew dont waste time asking for volunteers its running out he glanced over the nettings and saw the sea come alive again as two sharks or more broke surface somehow lithe and graceful obscene in their frenzy he knew midshipman deighton was watching nodding as if to reassure jago or himself their eyes met and adam smiled he was sickened by it but it was important perhaps vital for this youth who would one day be a kings officer and would remember unrivalled came unsteadily into the wind her sails scarcely flapping in protest as if she was glad to be standing away from the invisible murders adam barely heard the boat pulling away from the quarter but saw galbraith standing in the sternsheets one arm outthrust leaning over to speak with lawson the coxswain then he took a glass and levelled it with care the jollyboat galbraiths head and shoulders leaping into focus one of the oarsmen squinting in the glare as he lay back on his loom then past and beyond the small pieces of flotsam and the hatch cover even as he watched he saw a shark thrusting against it lifting it slightly in an effort to pitch the inert figure into the water partridge was right the man was wearing a lieutenants coat like seeing yourself someone gave a gasp as the figure let his arm slip to the edge of the hatch cover another exclaimed es alive the shark surged against the cover again the cruel crescentshaped mouth starkly visible in the telescope lens a last hope or some lingering instinct who could tell after what he must have seen and endured but he moved his arm again so that the shark scraped past lashing at the misty water turning instantly for another attack adam lowered the glass and wiped his forehead it was as if he had just climbed from the sea himself the jollyboat was there the sole survivor already manhandled across the stroke oarsman to the sternsheets adam heard the surgeons deep tones as he gave instructions to his assistants he moved to the compass box his feet dragging on the melting pitch perhaps they would discover what had happened and why he shook himself impatiently when we recover the boat you may bring her back to her original course he glanced at the curling masthead pendant and saw sullivan framed against the empty sky looking down at him adam raised his hand in a slow salute then turned towards cristie again the rest would have to wait the ship came first cristie watched and was satisfied for a short while he had been troubled now it was past the captain was himself again and the ship came first denis obeirne unrivalleds surgeon had already rolled up his sleeves and was gesturing unhurriedly as if to impress the need for care rather than haste adam stood in one corner of the sickbay as the loblolly boys carried the survivor to the table their faces intent but devoid of expression they were hardened to it they would not survive otherwise he hated the sounds and smells of this place it was something he had never grown used to in any ship he had known men pray and plead to be left on deck to die after being wounded in battle anything rather than face the saw and knife on the orlop he halflistened to the sounds from overhead muffled and somehow remote galbraith was in charge now bringing the ship round to catch the feeble offshore airs he had said quickly names finlay sir lieutenant in the paradox he was in charge of a prize crew aboard a slaver he kept losing track of it delirious i dont think he knew what was happening when we pulled him on board adam watched obeirnes hands deft busy like extensions to his mind a big man awkward in many ways but his hands were small and very strong the figure on the table could already he dead one arm hanging over the side as on the hatch cover which had saved him skin badly burned a livid bruise on his forehead where he had been struck down adam forced his brain to examine the few hare facts at his command paradox was one of the antislavery schooners for a few seconds he wondered why the name seemed familiar then it came to him she had been mentioned in tyackes notes as the vessel commodore turnbull had been using to visit the limits of the patrol area she was small so this lieutenant was likely her senior officer a rich prize then but where was paradox now and why had the captured slaver been left unescorted he heard a gasp and saw the man named finlay trying to prevent obeirnes assistants from removing his coat perhaps in his tortured thoughts it represented a last link his only identity obeirne was saying half to himself a had wound left hip knife deep and infected lie laid one hand on finlays shoulder and said quietly easy now youre among friends he nodded sharply to his men and the uniform coat was removed then finlay spoke his voice quite strong must tell the captain obeirne was watching his senior assistant the instruments gleaming in the swaying lantern light like something evil he said the captain is here now as you speak he looked at adam a few words sir adam approached the table and saw the man trying to focus his eyes fighting to retain his senses my name is bolitho i command here he put one hand on the arm the skin was cold clammy he was naked now and adam did not have to look around to know that the others had taken up their positions ready to pin him down to hold him still no matter what only their shadows moved leaping across the whitepainted timbers like ghouls the other man murmured vaguely new out here he tried again pausing while a hand came out to dab his mouth with a wet cloth we ran down a slaver he groaned and moved his head from side to side three days back ii cant remember the commodore was with us we had struck it lucky what happened after that i took command boarding party ten good hands and young mr coles his first attempt he closed his eyes tightly paradox had to leave us cant remember why we were to make for freetown as ordered obeirne remarked not much longer sir adam glanced at him a minute finlay said suddenly then we saw this other vessel closing with us a brig spanish colours nothing unusual about that he was remembering seeing it then she ran up a black flag and ran out her guns i had the slavers crew locked up and under guard but poor coles must have got careless they broke out and attacked my people it was over in minutes adam felt the men tense around him and saw obeirne reaching into his bag he persisted the slaves what happened to them finlay let his head fall back on the table his eyes suddenly dull defeated there were over two hundred of them most were in manacles we couldnt spare the time to free them but they knew they were saved some of them used to sing about it adam realised that the eyes were now looking directly into his they must have sighted your topsls captain bolitho i was helpless he attempted to touch his side and perhaps knew for the first time that he was being held motionless they slaughtered my lads there and then young coles took longer even out there on that raft i thought i could hear him screaming like a girl being tortured i thought they must have thought me dead then there was an explosion theyd planted charges before abandoning her then i was in the water i think somebody pulled me on to the raft ii cant remember and there were sharks as the slaver went down i heard them screaming its shallow there the sharks would get them before they drowned poor bastards he did not speak again or resist as a leather strap was forced between his teeth and the knife showed itself for the first time adam walked from the sickbay and thought of the unknown midshipman who had been tortured to death and the seamen who had been killed like pigs in a slaughterhouse and he thought of midshipman deighton who had seen it the great spreading stain to mark where over two hundred helpless captives had been torn apart they would never know who finlays unseen rescuer had been he had probably been taken by the sharks too he heard finlays strangled cry and wanted to go back to him to tell him that he and his men would be avenged instead he went on deck his mouth raw as if he had vomited like deighton everything was as before a glance aloft told him that the yards were braced to hold the breeze but the ensign was scarcely lifting galbraith stood by the larboard ladder but made ready to move when his captain appeared nobody looked at him but adam knew they saw his every emotion napier the cabin servant was waiting with jago the boy hesitated and then moved towards him a tray held carefully in one hand a clean cloth covering it that was thoughtful david ile did not notice napier start at the use of his first name it was a glass of white wine kept almost cool somewhere in the bilges until now he looked at galbraith and shrugged they were all killed then he tilted the glass his eyes blinded by the sun or something stronger which he could no longer control he saw obeirnes heavy figure climbing the quarterdeck ladder peering around as he always did when he visited this place of command different from the man in the sickbay with the strong and steady hand his world apart obeirne said almost casually lost him im afraid sir i dont know how he stayed alive as long as he did he spat out the word poisoned deliberately if im any judge he turned only briefly as the sailmaker and one of his loblolly boys crossed the maindeck together a burial then the corpse well weighted for a swift passage down into eternal darkness he added softly just before the end he looked up at me he smiled and it made him appear intensely sad right at me and he asked where were you he shook his head then he died who had he meant his own captain this ship adam turned abruptly and stared astern the sea was smooth again the stain was gone perhaps he was speaking for them at dusk the masthead sighted a sail to the east it was paradox at daylight tomorrow they would speak but before that with the purple shadows of sunset suddenly upon them they buried lieutenant finlay in the same ocean which had decided that he should remain the only witness as he closed the prayer book adam heard instead those other words and knew he would never forget them where were you commodore arthur turnbull walked easily across the black and white checkered deck covering pausing only to touch one of the beams above his head i relish the space bolitho room to stand upright instead of ducking to save your skull they become used to it in small vessels im told it seemed to amuse him the drawbacks outweigh the advantages id say he turned with his hack towards the stern windows the movement light and without effort like his walk you did well bolitho wed have been totally ignorant but for your prompt action framed against the dancing reflection and the glare from astern it was impossible to see his face gauge his attitude turnbull was younger than adam had expected or so he seemed but he was a senior postcaptain and tyacke had told him that prior to being appointed to freetown he had been in command of a big threedecker he had done well but even in the short time since he had arrived on board adam had sensed a restlessness an impatience which was at odds with his air of selfassurance finlay who had been buried the evening before had been paradoxs first lieutenant the same age and rank as the commanding officer turnbull had listened carefully to the account of his rescue and subsequent death but had said only paradoxs captain will miss the fellow they were quite close i believe but there it is adam had thought it strange that he had not been summoned to go aboard the topsail schooner which was even now tacking slowly across unrivalleds quarter a smart wellhandled vessel and he could well imagine how two officers could become close and dependent on one another perhaps turnbull preferred that this interview should be here away from the eyes and ears of the men among whom he had lived on this last patrol certainly the last for finlay and his boarding party the other ship sir a known slaver perhaps turnbull shrugged could be one of three which i have in mind he did not elaborate recaptured the prize and intended to take her inshore where the cargo would be transferred to a larger vessel as it is nobody has gained anything and we have lost a prize he sat down in a chair and crossed his legs his eyes moving around the cabin again as if seeking something your arrival on the station will carry some weight bolitho endless patrols are not enough we must hit the slavers on their home ground destroy them before they make our efforts look like a useless campaign to save face in london he glanced at napier as he walked carefully into the cabin with a tray and some glasses the boy waited beside the desk his eyes averted from the visitor turnbull said suddenly of course you have known captain tyacke for some time in fact he was your uncles flag captain he hurried on but he learned his skills out here too id see him commodore when i leave if their lordships would agree again something appeared to amuse him tyacke is the only one ive met on this godforsaken station who seems at ease here adam relaxed muscle by muscle turnbull was letting him know how well informed he was about all those under his command and from his last remark it was obvious that he was already thinking of his own next appointment he poured two glasses of wine while napier dared to look at the commodore for the first time turnbull said this is a fine ship bolitho your record matches it i believe a frigate will bring you fame but beyond that im not so sure he sipped the wine and smiled gently you put into funchal i see fair id say but a mite too sweet for my taste he changed tack again when we return to freetown we shall be busy the new crown agent should have arrived and i intend to impress on him the need to carry out some sharp attacks on the various collecting areas the trade is thriving the prices are going higher by the day and some of the traders are making it worse by bribing local chiefs to get the slaves for them he looked up his eyes sharp bribing them with muskets and you know where that will lead there was a tap at the door and the sentry shouted midshipman of the watch sir napier hurried to the screen bare feet soundless on the painted canvas turnbull took out his timepiece it seemed to glow in the cabin and adam guessed it was set with diamonds he would be amused to know that the cabin servant always carried a broken watch engraved with a little mermaid quite useless and yet it seemed to mean everything to the boy the realisation angered him suddenly he was being unfair and as intolerant as his visitor in the same breath he knew how different it was not once had turnbull shown the slightest pity for the murdered slaves and paradoxs boarding party the loss of the prize and its potential bounty seemed to matter more to him midshipman deighton entered the cabin his hat under his arm mr galbraiths respects sir and the wind is freshening ile glanced up as feet thudded overhead perhaps remembering what he had seen from the lofty masthead was that only yesterday turnbull said i shall require my boat bolitho we dont want to lose the wind lie became serious again as soon as we clear the land and gain sea room we can pick up the southeast trades that will knock a few days off the passage adam said carry on mr deighton i shall come up directly have the commodores boat called alongside he wondered why turnbull had not chosen to shift his broadpendant to unrivalled for the return passage it was all a cloak of mystery some image of dash and daring which he seemed to consider appropriate for his present role the door closed and turnbull asked casually deighton his father was killed wasnt he a commodore too he chuckled again i shall have to watch myselfl at the door he said abruptly i would appreciate it if your clerk could complete two copies of your report before we sight freetown it will be useful to me and i expect the new crown agent will be concerned to read it when he hears about the boarding party an act of piracy no less which no turtleback at the foreign office will dare to ignore not this time adam led the way to the companion ladder glad he was leaving turnbull glanced back towards the deserted wardroom and once more his eyes missed nothing perhaps he was recalling a face or some moment in his past he said the crown agent is or was a sea officer himselfthats something in our favour i hope he turned again one perfectly polished shoe poised on the ladder names herrick rearadmiral thomas herrickmean anything to you adam gripped the handrail to steady himself turnbull had not waited for or expected an answer he already knew on deck again it was still with him and those who waited by the entry ports or stood smartly aside as he passed wore the faces of others he had known we happy few very few now and thomas herrick had been one of the first so many questions unanswered and unexplained like some of cristies calculations the neat lines on a chart which somehow seemed to convene and join again and again the vessel which had perished and screaming trapped men and women left to drown or be savaged by sharks tyacke who had been unable to speak of the memory which still ruled his life and george avery who had died because of it and now thomas herrick down over the years my uncles best friend he raised his hat to the commodore and the calls shrilled in salute as the marines presented arms on the face of it turnbull should be more than satisfied an unblemished record and the seniority to prepare him for the next step to flag rank when so many others had been cast aside with the running down of the fleet he had a bright future within his grasp he watched the boat pulling clear the commodore did not once look astern at unrivalled adam replaced his hat and recalled the two barely touched glasses of madeira in his cabin looking back it was hard to discern the real man beyond the authority all he could recognise was envy secrets unrivalleds gig came smartly alongside a sagging sunblistered pier and hooked on luke jago tilted his hat and stared at the buildings on the waterfront one of which displayed the union flag with two scarletcoated marines finding what shade they could inside the arched entrance then he glanced at midshipman deighton who was in charge of the gig he had said nothing more about the bloodstained water the pathetic fragments all that remained to mark the scene of the slaughter he was doing well and even jago had to admit to something like admiration it was as far as he would go he waited while captain bolitho climbed on to the pier in his best frock coat cocked hat and fresh breeches he could have been someone else entirely he thought the open shirt and scuffed hessian boots belonged elsewhere jago hid a grin like me adam said not too far to walk ile turned to look back at the ship clean and sharp against the sprawl of merchantmen and busy coastal craft awnings and windsails already rigged some boats lurking nearby to offer their wares always hopeful jago watched him remembering his expression his change of mood after they had dropped anchor this morning it had happened after captain tyackes first lieutenant had come aboard to see him as if he had judged their arrival to the minute then jago had seen it for himself their prize the portugueseowned albatroz had gone from freetown released they said on some small legal detail point of law as he had heard cristie call it he knew most of unrivalleds company had been so certain of their share of the prizemoney that they had spent it already in their dreams but it was not that it was something deeper more personal perhaps he knew the captain better than he realised and could sense his moods in a way he would never have believed likely nor wanted to like young deighton and his father the commodore who had been killed by one of their own men they shared it but it remained private all the same he looked at the people milling along the waterfront black brown as many colours as the flags in the harbour ill lead the way sir he glanced into the boat as deighton asked uncertainly what shall i do jago frowned keep the boat in the shadow if you can an if any bugger tries to steal somethin he could not keep it up with deighton he grinned youve got a pretty dirk on yer belt mr deighton use it adam climbed the last of the steps and looked at the town the dust and the haze rising beyond it like woodsmoke as he had brought unrivalled up to her anchorage he had seen another vessel already at her moorings she had probably entered freetown an hour or so earlier a brig sturdy and typical of those which served as maids of all work in the fleet tyacke would have seen her too and been reminded of his first command as i was of mine but it was something else she was a courier brig most likely from england her scarred hull and weathered appearance speaking more than words of the seas he knew so well grey stormy the enemy and there were men working aloft on the yards spreading new canvas or sending down the remnants from their recent passage to be repaired courier brig so there would be mail for somebody men unable to read or write would have the letters recited to them on the messdeck while others who perhaps never received news from home would sit and listen share it he stopped by a tall dangerouslooking cargo hoist and tried again to come to terms with the thought uppermost in his mind tyacke had considered it important enough to send his lieutenant raven across to prepare him or to warn me rearadmiral thomas herrick to everybody else the name would signify just another flag officer perhaps not even that but adam had known herrick for as long as he could remember the navys way on and off like a family they all said that he could not accept that valentine keen now flag officer plymouth had not known had not forewarned him he had served both with richard bolitho and thomas herrick more times than he could count and yet just weeks ago when he had visited keen and his wife while unrivalled was completing repairs at plymouth keen had said nothing ile must have heard about herricks appointment as crown agent so why not mention it adam had sensed for a long time that there had been a coolness between the two herrick had once put keen in front of a court of enquiry which he had bitterly resented and now their roles were reversed keen outranked herrick and still had several avenues of advancement before him there was surely no need for continued animosity he had been and still was hurt by the realisation that valentine keen had kept it from him did rank really reach so far above friendship he was reminded suddenly of his brief visit to falmouth when ferguson had dissuaded him from going over to fallowfield to see john allday at the old hyperion in a quiet moment ferguson had told him something allday had said about that day when richard bolitho had been marked down by a sharpshooter he had spoken of alldays pain when he had been trying to explain his own feelings how despite the aftermath of battle and the people all around them he and his admiral his friend had been quite alone he was going fast bryan then suddenly he looks up at me an asks where was herrick somehow he expected him to be there ysee his oldest friend adam shook himself free of the memory and said lets get it over with shall we jago shrugged another mood he had seen captain bolitho like a young lion in the heat of a fight yet still able to take the hand of a dying man he had heard him exclaim in a moment of despair cant they be allowed to die with dignity is that so wrong and another time he had heard the catch in his voice when reading over the sea burial of a man he hardly knew he heard the sentries stamp their boots together plymouth gibraltar or on the deck of a flagship the bullocks never changed he smiled even in the heat no sense no feeling captain bolitho sir a lieutenant had come to greet them his face set in a practised smile adam said ill not be long luke that was the other thing he would use your name natural like a friend not like an officer at all let alone a postcaptain as if he really knew you and that you would never take advantage of it not like some like most jago watched him vanish into the shadows of the entrance and glanced around for a suitable place to wait people would look at the captain and see only the trimmings he thought the frigate captain who had everything who would turn any womans head he thought of the one they called lady bazeley so proud and beautiful knew it too and when he had seen them together her halfnaked her robe plastered to her body he had known there would be more to it he looked around as two native women walked past each with a huge basket balanced easily on her head saw the way they rolled their eyes at the two sweating sentries just what the captain needed he grinned and patted his jacket he was not the only one adam followed the lieutenant along a passageway their heels strangely loud on a tiled floor an old building he thought one accustomed to temporary occupation and function it was not hard to imagine this place when there had been only the sea and jungle for company who had come first traders and merchants missionaries perhaps eventually the military would arrive to protect them it had happened many times the traders and missionaries might leave the military and the flag always remained here sir the lieutenant opened a door and announced captain bolitho sir in a quieter almost confidential tone he added about ten minutes sir as the door closed behind him adam found himself in semidarkness or so it seemed after the walk from the landing stage a long narrow room with a window filling most of one wall it was heavily shuttered the slats tilted to allow a minimum of sunlight so that he had to stand motionless for several seconds to find his bearings then he saw rearadmiral thomas herrick by the far end of the window his head halfturned as if he were listening for any sounds from the harbour do sit down he gestured to a table i can offer some ginger beer and i owe that small luxury to the army hereabouts the same voice but as his eyes grew accustomed to the shadows adam could scarcely believe it was the same man he had been prepared for some of it he knew how herrick had suffered after his arm had been amputated how the death of his beloved wife dulcie had broken his heart but in his mind he had always held on to the man he had known for most of his service and what he had heard from others mainly his uncle brave loyal and stubborn to a point of maddening obstinacy but always a man you could trust with your life herrick must be approaching sixty this man who had never expected to be posted because of his humble beginnings let alone reach the rank of flag officer adam said are you well sir herrick dragged at a cord beside him and opened the blinds a little further adam could see the effort the way he bent his shoulder as if the stump of his right arm still troubled him greatly his hair was completely grey but as he turned away from the glare he glimpsed the same bright blue eyes he had always remembered herrick said unrivalled will make a fine addition to the force here a temporary arrangement more like a show of force than anything which might suggest a breach in the agreement i understand commodore turnbull has a plan of action i shall see him again presently adam tensed so turnbull had already been here to see herrick before anyone could dispute his appraisal of the brutal murders of slaves and british seamen alike herrick continued in the same unemotional tone they will need a lot of smaller faster vessels to compete with the trade i am informed that at least one new barque is operating along this coastline fast well armed and able to carry three hundred or more slaves for a quick and profitable voyage and there are others one of which you apprehended with unrivalled adam waited it was not a question herrick had been busy since his arrival in freetown herrick walked to the table and poured a glass of ginger beer albatroz is a slaver make no mistake on it but she is owned by portugal and she is not hampered by the equipment clause which our government is trying to make universal manacles are an indication but no longer it would appear a proof this time he did not attempt to contain his contempt piracy is a very different matter but i dont have to tell you that people in england do not begin to understand the misery and depravity of this foul traffic like the highwayman who may appear a hero to some but not to those who suffer at his hands i used to warn he stopped abruptly and walked back to the window leaving the ginger beer untouched adam felt pity for the first time he had almost said her name herrick said id never shed a tear when they dance the tyburn jig adam recalled the bitterness his uncle had shown on one occasion when herrick had displayed his disapproval of his liaison as he had called it with catherine and yet when i lerricks wife dulcie had lain dying of typhus which she had caught when trying to help spanish prisoners of war from some nearby hulks she would have been alone but for catherine yovell who was even now out there in the harbour had been with her when shed called at the house to see herricks wife she had refused to allow him to stay and risk his own life but had sent him to fetch help and medical assistance and catherine had remained to the end caring for her every need washing and changing her soiled clothing knowing as she did so that every hour was putting her in greater peril his uncle had spoken of it with both anxiety and pride now in this dim airless room with a fan swaying hack and forth overhead to the pull of some unseen hand it seemed like yesterday adam said we have taken on a tremendous task sir herrick looked at him directly perhaps suspiciously i accepted it because i could stand the inactivity no longer his voice was stronger as he relived something still too close to put aside their lordships suggested my name for the position an officer who could be trusted to perform the task without fear or favour as i have always tried to do in my duty he swung away his pinnedup sleeve all the more apparent against the filtered sunshine and a suitable scapegoat of course should the need arise there were voices in the passageway and adam could imagine the lieutenant listening outside the door herrick said you will receive your orders from the commodore within two days at no time will you discuss the proposed exercise except with your officers and then only the bones of your instruction they are all experienced sir he felt unreasonably irritated with himself for sounding so defensive herrick said i know your record the algiers affair and your fight with the renegade frigate did you credit but you chose to ignore your admirals signals to interpret them as you thought fit as a result you carried out the rescue of a valuable merchant ship and more to the point some very important passengers as hostages at best they could have brought disaster to any future bargaining with the dey of algiers i did what i thought was right sir herrick glanced at the door you were lucky you would not find me quite so understanding the door opened an inch but herrick said sharply wait it closed then he walked across the room one shoulder hunched unconsciously like so many veterans adam had seen in the seaports of england he said quietly i did not intend our meeting to be like this he held up his hand no hear me perhaps i am alone too much i did not mean to speak of itnot here not now but you will know more than anyone what your uncle meant to me he never forgot and neither shall i like all great men and he was a great man although hed be the last to admit it he made enemies far more cunning and treacherous than those who use powder and shot for one cause or another so be warned hatred like love never dies then suddenly he thrust out his remaining hand id ask for no better captain he smiled adam it was the saddest thing adam had seen for a long time he left the darkened room without even noticing the vague figures who were waiting their turn for an audience like a stranger it would have been far better if he was he paused by another window and touched the old sword at his hip herrick had once told him how he had returned to falmouth with bolitho and had been present when captain james bolitho had given this sword to his son a captain and his first lieutenant what had happened to that tough stubborn young man commodore arthur turnbull came out of another doorway and stood gazing at him adam guessed he had been waiting for this moment rough was it adam regarded him calmly he was frank with me sir turnbull might have smiled that says a lot bolitho he glanced towards the other door where the lieutenant was already poised with another list then i shall he equally frank rearadmiral herrick is here to advise us but never forget i command adam listened to his shoes tapping unhurriedly back along the passageway selfassured and confident he picked up his hat from the table and jammed it on to his unruly hair and ruthless he saw jago by the entrance and the same two sentries as before only the shadows had moved what would john allday have said had he heard herrick just now then he saw unrivalled swinging at her cable a shipbuilders dream people changed ships did not and for that he was suddenly grateful adam lay back in the deep chair and listened to that other world beyond the whitepainted screen with its everpresent sentry it was evening another of the changes of colour and texture which seemed common in freetown an intense ochre sky crossed with long ragged banners of dark cloud moving even as he watched cristie had said there was a better chance of a favourable wind coming soon tomorrow perhaps when unrivalled weighed and left harbour through the thick glass of the stern windows he could see the riding lights of other moored vessels growing brighter in the shadows tomorrow then perhaps cristie was right in his prediction he thought of tyackes kestrel it had taken her hours just to work clear of the anchorage and at one time boats had been lowered to offer a tow and give her steerageway outside the approaches she had remained motionless or so it seemed as if becalmed it must have been a test for every man aboard especially james tyacke commodore turnbull had sailed earlier without his broadpendant flying above the graceful topsail schooner paradox adam had wondered how her company felt about the deaths of their fellow seamen galbraith had told him he had heard that another officer had already been appointed to replace the dead finlay it would be even harder for him on his first passage amongst strangers adam glanced at the folder on his lap facts and figures and three possible locations where slavers might be expected to rendezvous much of the intelligence had been gleaned from trading vessels as well as the hardworked brigs and schooners of the patrol flotilla and he knew from frustrating experience that most of it was pure speculation he thought of herrick again he had often spoken of his faith in lady luck it was hard to believe now ile picked up the letter and turned it over in his hands well travelled it must have left cornwall about the same time as unrivalled had quit penzance he had already read it twice iie had been able to picture his aunt nancy writing it pouting every so often as he had seen her do when composing a letter nancy he could never think of her as lady roxby as the crest on the notepaper proclaimed she never allowed him to forget that she was always there in surroundings he knew so well thinking of him much in the same way as she had written to her brother richard she was alone now in that other house on the estate adjoining the bolitho land her husband known affectionately or otherwise as the king of cornwall had died suddenly a man who had lived a full and boisterous life and enjoyed it to excess he had been a local magistrate and more than a few had paid with their lives after appearing before him he had helped to raise the local militia at a time when england daily expected and feared a french invasion and he had had an eye for women but adam had never forgotten that he had been the first to go to catherines aid when she had cradled zenorias broken body in her arms and the other nancy who had greeted him like her own son when he had walked all the way from penzance after his mother had died he knew roxby had had doubts about his identity nancy had changed that too she had written about the child elizabeth your cousin he had never thought of her as that he smiled and hardly a child she must be all of fourteen years old or would be in june the same month as his own birthday elizabeth was nancy s ward and there could be none better she would give her the love and care she needed but nancy was sharp too and missed nothing the girl would be in good hands she had written of her last visit to the bolitho house it must have been shortly after his own brief stop in falmouth she had taken elizabeth with her and had shown her the family portraits adam wondered how she had explained the painting of catherine it is a tradition in the family that each shall have a portrait it would be right and proper for you to have yours beside the others as if sensing his reluctance she had added for my sake iffor no other reason she had enclosed a small piece of notepaper with elizabeth s writing beneath a drawing of a beach and a sail far out at sea there was also the figure of a girl back turned obviously watching the distant ship the handwriting was wellformed and strangely mature my dear cousin i would so like to meet you this is a picture of your ship coming home it was signed elizabeth adam folded it and was oddly moved by it she was well cared for nancy and her lawyers would see to that otherwise she had lost everything he thought of the little drawing again it was uncanny so many women had waited for the first sight of a homewardbound ship or prayed whenever one had departed nancy would understand she came of a family of sailors and as a young girl she had been in love with a midshipman who had been richards best friend in his first years as a young gentleman she had come to love roxby but he knew she had never forgotten the young man who had visited falmouth and had been taken from her he looked at her letter again catherine called upon me she was visiting viceadmiral keen and his we at boscawen house i h ope and pray she may discover some fixture happiness my heart went with her he looked up napier was watching him from the pantry door yes then he waved the letter softening it you did not warrant that sharp welcome napier rubbed one foot over the other are you not eating sir adam stood up and watched a boat pulling beneath unrivalleds counter the guardboat their own galbraith had not questioned the need for secrecy nor would he he folded the letter so keen had known about catherines visit too fie confronted it with sillitoe it had to be she needed someone he stared at the closed skylight the cabin was like an oven but the lanterns would draw insects like bees to honey and they stung he sighed a far cry from nancy s falmouth lie realized that napier was still staring at him some sliced pork david you know the way i the boy nodded gravely finesliced fried pale brown with biscuit crumbs he gave a rare grin with black treacle he hurried away adam opened the skylight a few inches and heard the hum of voices men passing the offwatch hours on deck seeing the sights enjoying the breeze no matter how feeble a violin too not the shantyman this time but well played one of those sad melodies beloved by sailors something stung his wrist and he closed the skylight abruptly he heard napier leaving for the galley no doubt mystified that his captain should eat such spartan food when he could enjoy better fare ashore he had begun a letter to his aunt and would finish it tonight before he turned in and tomorrow they would stand out to sea again like those converging lines on cristies charts meeting where and for what he crossed to the inner screen to study the old sword hanging in its place catching the lantern light napier took care of that also he had often thought about the sword long before it had come to him in so many of those portraits he smiled sadly and it would have been given to my father he recalled herricks words his bitterness hatred like love never dies he saw the goblet on his desk the cognac where napier always placed it it was a warning frank rist masters mate closed the chartroom door and made his way to the companion ladder he had examined the charts that cristie would require a day or so out of freetown it was never necessary but cristie always expected it nothing left to chance rist had taken the opportunity to test the new magnifying glass the boy ede had made for him it was amazing he thought from a few oddments he had explained oddments it looked as if it had been made in a topquality instrument shop and somehow he knew that ede had wanted to do it for him need would be a better word for it as if it was his way of holding on to something and not to beg favours as some might expect a quiet almost gentle youth who certainly did not belong in these rough brutal surroundings which only a seasoned jack would recognise as offering comradeship it was hard to think of ede as dangerous although rist had heard that he had been seized and charged for wounding his employer with a pair of scissors attempted murder they said somebody had spoken up for him and a lesser charge suggested and it had not been opposed by the victim which was strange but young or not he would have hanged otherwise lie was good with his hands rist had even seen joseph sullivan allow him to fix some tiny fitting on his model of spartiate and rist knew that sullivan an otherwise calm and easygoing man would have beaten anyone senseless who dared to touch his work ile rested on a gun and stared across the harbour all in deep shadow now a few boats still on the move but most of them had given up trying to get alongside unrivalled it was not unknown for women to be smuggled on hoard through gun ports even up the anchor cable itself to remain undiscovered but well used until the morning watch but not unrivalled marines at entry port and beakhead on the gangways and out in a guardboat just to be sure they were going to sea for a purpose anything was better than rotting in harbour lie had thought a lot about the boarding party which had been slaughtered men like those here on deck yarning and passing the time after a meal of salt beef from the cask hard biscuit all washed down with some of the pursers coarse red wine black strap the sailors called it they were in the mood for gossip and outrage over the coldblooded murders and now they did not even have the prize albatroz to pass bets on rist watched the lights ashore and found himself wondering again if there were people there who knew about the proposed mission which would begin tomorrow he tried to laugh it off if so its more than we do but it would not come he had never forgotten the risks in the trade when they had boarded albatroz with the highandmighty lieutenant varlo he had been tensed up hard and ready and once aboard he had made sure that two of the swivel guns were loaded and primed and trained inboard at the first hint of danger a daisycutter could have swept the decks as clean as a parsons plate somebody must have got slack overconfident the appearance of the second vessel had tipped the balance he had heard some of the hands exclaim there was no need to kill our lads they couldve let em run for it rist knew differently there would be every need to kill them it was when they had arrived in freetown and the boarding party had been relieved by a military guard from the barracks that it had happened the big hardfaced master cousens had called out youll never hold on to us then as varlo was climbing into the jollyboat he had added sharply i knows you from somewhere dont i and he had smiled sneered dont worry matey itll come to me then well see it was unlikely but it was not impossible all those years some he could scarcely remember others he still tried to forget it was just possible you have the watch i believe rist knew it was varlo you couldnt help knowing sir time for rounds send for a bosuns mate and ships corporal never a please or offer of thanks he could smell the drink on his breath too maybe he would fall down a ladder and break his poxy neck alhatroz had sailed they would probably never lay eyes on her again he turned as two more figures appeared by the companionway one was the first lieutenant the other was hawkins the ships newest and youngest midshipman varlo said im about to carry out rounds mr galbraith rist relaxed muscle by muscle glad of the interruption the evening ritual of rounds when the lieutenant on duty would inspect all aspects of cleanliness security and safety messdeck to magazines defaulters if any to be inspected also or given extra work galbraith said hands will be called two hours early both watches will be fed before the boats are hoisted weigh anchor at eight bells rist could almost feel their exchange of glances no love lost there galbraith continued in a more informal fashion and mr hawkinsfirst time doing rounds i hear the boy stammered something and galbraith said just remember when you are on the messdeck it is a part of ship but it is also their home so show respect as im sure you would elsewhere rist kept his face straight for varlos benefit he thought the boy was too young to know anything galbraith watched the little group move away and soon he could hear the shrill twitter of the call and imagined men in their messes at their scrubbed tables loose gear stowed away illegal bottles of hoarded rum well hidden from the officers prying eye men who would fight and if necessary kill when ordered die too if the cards played a false hand tough and hardened men like isaac dias the gun captain who could measure the fall of each shot with accuracy although he could neither read nor write and sullivan who had been at trafalgar and campbell who seemed to cherish the scars on his hack like battle honours and youngsters like napier the captains servant somehow untainted by the violence and crude language around him he wondered if adam bolitho realized what he had done for the boy it went far beyond hero worship or the youth he had seen talking to rist who now had work he understood and could usefully do in the chart room in some ways an escape from the past which must still haunt him he frowned and rist himself he had probably worked more closely with him than anyone except the captain but rist was still a stranger despite their mutual respect he leaned back on his heels and peered up at the masthead the pendant barely visible against the banks of stars and patches of cloud but he could feel it the ship beneath his feet the shrouds and running rigging the blocks clicking and rattling quietly in the offshore breeze and breeze was all it amounted to tomorrow might change everything he thought of varlo a man he would never know and he realised it was mostly his own fault he was the first lieutenant messdeck or wardroom hero or villain he was supposed to be able to assess each mans value as well as his weakness varlo had been a flag officers aide he should have had his life and career at his feet something had gone badly wrong it was said that another officer had died because of it a fight a duel an accident perhaps even the captain did not know varlos admiral had obviously thought enough of him to arrange his appointment to unrivalled at a time when such chances were almost impossible to come by or perhaps and he knew he was being unfair again perhaps the admiral had done it to rid himself of any possible embarrassment he recalled the captains return on board after his visit to the headquarters building just over there across the black water rearadmiral herrick galbraith had scarcely heard of him except that he had known sir richard bolitho and had once faced a court martial for misconduct and neglect of duty it was little enough to go on perhaps captain bolitho had summed it up when he had told him about the new orders ill not be sorry to see the back of freetown leigh lets get to sea again in his way he had spoken for the whole ship direct action captain adam bolitho shaded his eyes to peer up at the flapping driver and the masthead pendant he could feel the deck shudder as the rudder responded slowly to the thrust of wind the helm creaking while the barebacked seamen put their weight on the spokes hold her steady that was cristie his eyes flitting from compass to flapping topsails noreast by north adam let his arms drop to his sides his mind blurred by the heat the slow response from the tall pyramid of canvas and always always aware of the monotonous coastline the gulf of guinea again and it had taken them nearly two weeks to work into position a cross on the chart south of the niger delta and some two hundred miles north of the notorious st thomas island where slaves could be loaded and shipped with impunity once they had been brought from the mainland a handful of vessels stretched across the approaches and the escape routes like the noose of a trap on a chart it was easier to see turnbulls strategy tyackes kestrel was in position to the east unrivalled on the western side while in between and trying to maintain contact with one another were the brigs and schooners which made up the flotilla take the slack off the lee forebrace mr fielding your people are like old women today galbraiths voice unusually sharp adam walked to the nettings and stared at the empty sea it was even affecting his first lieutenant the endless strain of wearing ship altering course a degree or so throughout every watch just to gain a cupful of wind the seamen were responding well enough but boredom the barely edible food salt pork or beef from the cask and the need to conserve water were taking their toll the usual water casks where a man could snatch a mug or wipe his mouth to give an illusion of refreshment were gone and marine sentries were posted below decks to ensure that the daily ration was strictly observed adam turned slightly to allow the warm breeze to fan his body through the open shirt he wondered how the commodore was managing aboard the topsail schooner paradox the flagship he had heard some of the older hands scornfully call it no matter what shortages they had aboard paradox he imagined turnbull always clean and smartly turned out he thought about paradoxs captain also galbraith had discovered from someone or somewhere that his name was hastilow a lieutenant and like many of his contemporaries on this station senior for his rank he and finlay his secondincommand had been together for two years on this station that must be an eternity like brothers galbraith had heard so like the navy adam thought there was always someone who knew or who had been told a piece of the whole story hastilow was also dedicated as if the antislavery campaign had become something personal it was not difficult to imagine how he would be feeling now he saw lieutenant varlo walking along the starboard battery of eighteenpounders gun by gun with williams a gunners mate at his side he thought he saw williams glance up at galbraith as they passed williams was good and with rist had been on the island raid when the chebecks had been destroyed they were closer than some of the others because of that unconsciously he clenched a fist when i risked this ship the helmsmen were being relieved the last topmen sliding down backstays to the deck their work aloft done until the next pipe adam looked at the unending panorama of glittering water again no wonder men driven to desperation had been persuaded by the everlurking devil to slake their thirst from the sea he had seen two men die mad and unrecognisable after doing just that and there was always the other temptation at night when the ship offered a hint of cooler air and the sounds were muffled by the cabin timbers there was no law to prevent a captain from drinking too much in a different way but one no less dangerous in the end and night brought other forms of torment lying naked in his cot his limbs bathed in sweat and unable to sleep listening and interpreting every sound no matter how small and unimportant as if the ship were driving herself indifferent to all the souls she carried and in sleep there were dreams one in particular the girl beckoning and arousing him sometimes speaking his name reaching out mocking him only the faces remained blurred uncertain zenoria or catherine neither of whom had ever been his to love or even the desirable lady bazeley rozanne who had taken and responded with a fierceness of passion which had surprised perhaps shocked them both he thought of the little tablet in the church at penzance or perhaps my own mother at such times he had been thankful that napier had taken to locking the cabinet where the cognac was stowed he paced slowly aft his feet avoiding flaked lines and ringbolts without conscious effort he pictured his aunt dear nancy reading the letter he had put ashore in freetown trying to imagine what we are doing here sharing it as she had done with others in her family while we shall be tacking up and down week in week out going slightly mad and wondering why we do it or we might all be dead by the time she reads it deck there sail on the starboard bow men about to creep into the shadow of gangway or bulwark or those who had just been relieved from trimming the great yards and now making for the messdecks brief refuge paused and stared up at the masthead friend enemy prize or victim it did not matter they were no longer alone on this blistering ocean adam returned to the quarterdeck rail must be looking for us leigh shed have run by now otherwise he was thinking aloud only partly aware of the listening watching faces tanned or burned raw by the sun we shall alter course two points to starboard it will make it easier for our friend to converge on us hell be finding less wind than we have under our coattails at present he grinned and felt his lips crack as if the effort had drawn blood but it was infectious some wag called moight be nother prize capn fair shares this toime others laughed and punched their friends arms something which only seconds ago would have been answered with a genuine blow pipe the hands to the braces we will steer noreast by east lines and halliards came alive snaking through blocks as more men ran to their stations their fatigue momentarily gone put up your helm now steady lads handsomely does it be ready to make our number that was midshipman cousens very conscious of his position in charge of the signals party and just as quickly belay that mr cousens everyone will know this ship lieutenant bellairs who such a short time ago had been a midshipman doing cousenss work adam saw the swift exchange and felt it for himself pride it never left you like galbraith and young napier or the scarred and mutilated seaman who had come to see him at penzance pride for anemone the ship which had done that to him but had left him no less a man noreast by east sir steady as she goes adam saw cristie making some notes in his personal log the lines meeting on a chart somewhere it would probably amount to nothing a few words on a page soon forgotten a captains responsibility was total he saw cristie pause to look at him the date perhaps had he remembered adam resumed his pacing all he could do was wait then decide on this day his beloved uncle had died lie nodded to a seaman who was expertly coiling a halliard although he did not notice his surprise he could still reach out the hand was still there luke jago watched the jollyboat being warped alongside then turned to stare at the topsail schooner which lay hoveto downwind of the frigate the signal captain repair on board had been hauled down in time with unrivalleds acknowledgment and jago was still fuming about it the commodores broadpendant shone like silk from paradoxs masthead and as cristie remarked they could shout a message from there damn them jago heard galbraith calling to a boatswains mate and knew the captain was coming up bloody turnbull who the hell does he think he is lie had been surprised that the captain had shown neither surprise nor resentment at the signal jago looked at him now and was partly satisfied he was wearing his old seagoing coat and had tied a neckcloth loosely into place jago smiled to himself the commodore could think what he liked he said i could have the gig swayed out sir adam smiled take too long ceremonial can go too far he touched his hat to the side party and looked directly at galbraith maybe the waiting is over the jollyboat seemed to plunge into a deep trough as they cast off from the chains and the oars dipped for the first pull adam twisted round to look at his ship how large she appeared from the boat the yards and flapping canvas blotting out the land completely she never seemed so big when you shared her hull with some seamen and marines he shifted on the thwart to study the other vessel smart lowlying rakish a fine command for a young officer with one foot on the ladder for one more senior like hastilow it might appear very different bows then jago said under his breath ill be ready sir their eyes met never doubted it hastilow was waiting to receive him as he clambered up and across the bulwark welcome aboard captain bolitho hastilows eyes said the opposite tall and lean even thin with his lank brown hair tied back in the style still followed by some older sailors but the eyes were very different dark almost black in the glaring sunshine deepset and wary as if on guard for something he added the commodore is below the slightest hesitation sir each commanding one of his majestys ships and yet miles apart the lieutenant and the postcaptain schooner and fifth rate usually it did not matter when men met like this here it obviously did adam followed the other officer aft but glanced at the sailors working on deck or waiting to trim the sails for getting under way again all were so burned by the sun and wind that they could have been africans a large company for so small a vessel for prize crews and he could sense hostility as if he was from another world which they had all rejected they were probably remembering the men who had been butchered he could almost hear finlays words where were you below deck it was very dark and adam was reminded of the meeting with herrick the thick shutters the narrow strips of sunlight the remaining hand drumming on the table beside the tray of ginger beer the cabin was small the deckhead low enough to make him stoop there was one skylight so that commodore turnbull appeared to be on display in the shaft of dusty sunlight he was adam saw as immaculately dressed as if he were in a ship of the line a fortunate rendezvous bolitho he gestured to a bench seat he even did that elegantly you came with all haste the eyes moved only slightly but seemed to take in adams threadbare coat and soiled shirt captain tyacke is in position by now without seeming to move he dragged a chart from another seat and laid it flat on the table here and here as planned unrivalled will remain on station at the southwest approaches he tapped the chart to emphasise each point the slavers are there in the delta as reported three vessels maybe more its a maze of channels and sandbars safe for them dangerous for a ship of any size he smiled gently but then youre aware of that he hurried on i intend to catch them before they can reach open water they might try to withdraw upriver of course in which case it will take longer le looked around the dark cabin as if seeing it for the first time hastilows fellows know their work well they can outsail most slavers and can use carronades to settle the majority of arguments adam bent across the chart and studied the location where unrivalled would mount guard almost precisely as cristie had described a perilous place on a lee shore worse if you ran on to one of the sandbars turnbull said you will anchor adam studied the chart again wondering why hastilow had not been asked to join them in his own command turnbull might have taken his silence for doubt he said slavers know these inlets and beaches far better than we do but once at sea it is a different story my latest information is that these vessels are to transport slaves to st thomas as i anticipated there they will be transferred to a larger ship but we will take them before that none will escape no matter which way they run adam leaned back and felt the schooner moving around him eager to go he said they may sail at night why had he stated the obvious giving himself time turnbulls plan made sense if the worst happened and they only seized one of the slavers it would show others that the navy could and would take action on the doorstep as jago had put it turnbull reached down and opened a cupboard i hope they do but i doubt it hastilow thinks it will be at first light he lifted a bottle and two goblets from somewhere and looked questioningly across the table not madeira i promise you adam watched him pour two large measures cognac so what was wrong confident pleasant enough he saw the beautiful cuffs the glittering lace on the coat the new navy emerging he was younger even than hastilow provided nothing changes before we can act i intend to make an attack as close to dawn as possible he sipped his cognac at least well not have to depend on this damnable wind for a second or two adam thought he had misheard landing parties sir turnbull poured himself another drink you surprise me in some ways bolitho a fellow with your recordid have thought you would he fully aware of such tactics ile shook his head direct action thats my belief ile pushed the chart aside hastilow understands i ics cut out for the work and he wants revenge a boat action sir it was like hearing someone elses voice turnbull regarded him curiously you were hoping for something different a seafight or a chase a true frigate captain to the end iie gave the soft chuckle again i shall need unrivalled right enough but the first blow will be dealt in amongst them the brig seven sisters will be there and kittiwake in reserve he looked up his eyes very steady i shall lead the attack in paradox adam heard voices somewhere on deck and pictured jago in the jollyboat and the others in unrivalled waiting and wondering at the outcome ile thought of the shoreline closer now somehow threatening or was that only his imagination because of a boat action which even in the most favourable circumstances could end in disaster lie looked at the commodore again it was already decided you could almost feel it in the man turnbull took out a large envelope for you bolitho he smiled broadly in case anything unpleasant should happen to me he was serious again ill not come on deck just now ive some last details to arrange i am sure that our new crown agent will want to be fully informed it was a dismissal hastilow was waiting to see him over the side he could barely conceal his impatience but he could not prevent his deepset eyes from settling on the bulky envelope under adams arm then he said bluntly the commodores told you then sir most of it hastilow said well teach them a lesson theyll never forget he seemed to contain his anger with a physical effort and stood aside to allow adam to climb on to the bulwark adam saw some of the schooners company watching him leave defiant contemptuous glad he was going back to his own ship perhaps turnbull was right it was their kind of action but all he could think about was the one glaring flaw revenge he thought of the renegade captain who had died of his wound in unrivalleds great cabin perhaps he had been right after all he had called it vanity after the shuttered lanterns in the chartroom the quarterdeck seemed pitch black but not for long adam walked to the rail and stared along the full length of the ship his eyes eventually picking out shapes and small groups of seamen at their stations bodies pale against the guns and the familiar rigging for another long day they had remained clear of the land using the light airs to tack this way and that but never losing their mean course for a final rendezvous apart from the occasional slap of canvas or the creak of the wheel you could believe the ship to be motionless there were no lights anywhere on deck so that the tiny glow of the compass lamp seemed like a beacon it was always the same he told himself you could feel the solid landmass creeping out on either bow like some giant trap but he held the image of the chart firmly in his mind most of the anonymous figures relied on trust they would do what they were told when the time came that hardly ever changed but cristie would know and would be measuring his own doubts against his captains skill or lack of it adam moved aft again and saw the white crossbelts of the marines stark against the dark water alongside and beyond armed and ready with others the best marksmen stationed in the fightingtops somewhere overhead he turned quickly as a large fish broke surface and then splashed down into a trail of phosphorescence like submerged fireflies his lips felt parched he could smell rum it was all they had found time for after the galley fire had been doused he tried to think clearly two hours ago he heard cristie murmuring to one of his mates then he called ready to begin sounding sir carry on he imagined the leadsman up forward in the chains swinging the great lead beyond and behind his perch then up and over the lead and line snaking well ahead of the ships slow progress he walked to the rail again and rested his palms on it cool and wet in another couple of hours it would be like a furnace bar he tensed as the splash came from ahead like another leaping fish the leadsmans voice was clear and unhurried no bottom sir he sounded almost bored even galbraith had seemed surprised by the precautions doubtless he thought his captain was overdoing it had lost confidence in himself adam gazed up at the topsails which with the jib were the only canvas spread for this final approach some overnight fisherman might otherwise see the frigate lie gritted his teeth and do what turnbull was no fool and would take no unnecessary risks the horizon already seemed paler in an hour paradox and the others would begin their plan of attack he thought of hastilow experienced and eager to avenge his men and his friend how much might he be influenced by a senior officer like turnbull whose last command at sea had been a ship of the line by th mark thirteen adam imagined the leadsman up there in the gloom hauling in his line and feeling for the telltale marks bunting pieces of leather or simple knots strong tarred fingers an expert in his work thirteen fathoms cristie would be making calculations unrivalled drew three a safe margin but with so many sandbars and unmarked spits you could never be confident he heard something fall heavily on deck and an instant mouthful of curses from whoever was in charge the anchor party was in position poised and ready to let go as soon as they were anchored galbraith would supervise the running out of a stern rope right round the ship and then fastened to the mooring cable an anchored manofwar even one as powerful and welldrilled as unrivalled was almost helpless to defend herself against oared vessels which could work around a ships stern and fire directly into it the chebecks had reinforced that lesson and it was not one he would forget no matter what galbraith thought about it he saw the chart in his mind again so many channels which led from the main river and into the first open water by th mark ten galbraith had joined him soon now sir it sounded like a question adam did not reply directly if they anchored too far out there might be a dozen passages of escape for any slaver which slipped past turnbull not yet he walked to the compass box and peered up at the maintopsail he could see the entire span of it now the sun would appear over those hills which cristie had noted so carefully after that an deep eight not so bored now it was not difficult to imagine the seabed rising relentlessly to greet unrivalleds keel he peered at the little dogvane and knew the helmsmen were watching him intently cristie said meaningly winds freshened a bit sir adam considered it cristie never wasted time with idle comment and he could feel the strengthening offshore breeze hear it in the sails it would be hard work for turnbulls boats pulling directly into it the slavers if any were still there would use it to advantage perhaps turnbull had already decided to wait and allow their quarry to make the first move at the same time he knew he would not he recalled something he had heard his uncle say as if he had spoken the words aloud the only thing a captain can take jr granted is the unexpected fie was surprised that he could sound so calm bring her about mr galbraith we will anchor orders were passed with no more than necessary noise and men who had tripped and fumbled with every move only months weeks ago scampered to sheets and braces as if they had been doing it all their lives lee braces there hands wear ship adam reached for the locket beneath his shirt and was surprised that it was missing he had left it in his strongbox where it would remain until this episode was just another entry in cristies log but it felt strange different the ship cleared as if for action but none of the main armament loaded over cautious or losing it as the old jacks termed it he listened to the rebellious canvas as the seamen kicked and fisted it into submission he saw the two royal marine officers by the boat tier every feature so much clearer now the leadsman coming aft along the starboard gangway his line neatly coiled over one shoulder midshipman deighton standing beside galbraith thinking what let go he saw the spray burst up beneath the larboard cathead heard varlo calling out somebodys name then he saw the land swinging slowly past the bows the beautiful figureheads naked shoulders suddenly etched against the hills which were still in deep purple shadow all fast sir adam saw napier speaking with the other youth ede gesturing as if to explain something which was happening by the capstan one with a mother who no longer wrote to inquire after her sons wellbeing the other so deft and gentle with his hands who had tried to murder his employer so he was being over cautious this time it was his decision he smiled briefly and they were ready daniel yovell stood below one of the quarterdeck ladders his hat pulled down to shade his eyes from the first fierce glare of sunlight he disliked the heat but made no allowance for it in his dress his father had been much the same as far as he could remember what keeps out the cold keeps out the heat had been a rule with him he knew it was a source of amusement to unrivalleds ships company but he was used to that too he took a deep breath as he watched the golden glow spreading across the choppy water giving life to the shoreline with its hills and the darker green of forest further inland it was a time of day he tried never to miss he had no responsibilities no duties he could merely observe and enjoy it he had grown used to avoiding the normal rush and urgency of a man of war without being a part of it like now he thought one of the boats had been pulling a long rope from aft and had hauled it beyond the bows to lash it to the anchor cable he had heard that it was to swing the ship if need be to train the guns when there was no other way he heard partridge the boatswain bawling at some men on the capstan bars ard work did you say robbins if the wind gets any livelier itll he a bloody sight arder without turning or looking up yovell could hear captain bolitho speaking with one of his officers calm unruffled but in the great cabin yovell had seen the other side of him not the captain but the man who cared and was often hurt because of it like the time he had returned on board after his visit to the headquarters at freetown after hed met rearadmiral herrick yovell knew a good deal about herrick and had served with him when he was sir richard bolithos secretary stubborn pigheaded with a fine edge between right and wrong he had known of herricks refusal to accept lady somervell catherine to see her true strength and value as more than merely bolithos lover he felt privileged to have shared it he had seen catherines courage in the open boat after the loss of golden plover unable to conceal her discomfort her borrowed sailors garb barely hiding her body from a boat full of men she had still managed to inspire and encourage them all most of them had given up any hope of survival yovell had taken comfort from his bible but even he had had moments of doubt he had heard adam bolitho refer to the navy as a family richard bolitho had done so as well it was no mere coincidence that the other frigate anchored at freetown when they had arrived had been under james tyackes command tyacke in his brig larne had found that open boat and saved them from certain death and now there was thomas herrick to yovell it seemed only yesterday since he had accompanied catherine to herricks house in kent where they had found his wife in the grip of typhus sir richards wife belinda had been there but had left immediately when she had realized the nature of the illness he had heard that herrick had asked for forgiveness for his behaviour after that yovell was ashamed that he found it hard to believe galbraith strode aft and paused to say nothing to see im afraid he glanced at the partlymanned capstan but theres still time i suppose he halfturned you going up sullivan the seaman nodded capn asked me sir he sounded troubled i hate this place i was here before once long time ago his clear eyes were distant reminiscent we was ashore on a waterin party and them devils took one of our lads the capn sent th marines ashore but they was too late theyd cut off his eyelids so that he couldnt close them against the sun then they pegged him out on an anthill an watched him die it must have taken a long time sir they watched him leap into the shrouds like a young boy before he began to climb up towards the maintop yovell removed his spectacles and mopped his face with a large handkerchief i often marvel that such men return to sea again and again even after what they have seen galbraith grinned hes no different from the rest of us fle touched yovells plump arm or you for that matter deck there sail to the norcast galbraith almost ran up the ladder and saw bolitho already opening a telescope sullivan might resent the other lookout calling a sighting before him galbraith nodded to midshipman cousens as he offered his own glass ile heard bolitho say shes paradox makes a fine sight galbraith adjusted the telescope with care it was strange at first with unrivalled lying at anchor the other vessel appeared to be much further out it was an illusion paradox was standing towards the larger of the two inlets tacking well enough although the offshore wind had her almost aback at one point she had all her boats in the water towing or alongside galbraith hit his lip that would do nothing to help steerageway the dawn haze was clearing slowly ile moved the glass again and saw another fan of sails the hull still hidden in mist or smoke as if she had fired a silent broadside that would be seven sisters he looked at paradox again clearer and sharper now the broadpendant seemed far too large for so sleek a vessel he thought she had shortened sail and he could see one of the boats then another being hauled alongside the occasional glint of weapons as men clambered down into them adam bolitho said too soon the oarsmen will he exhausted before they can work into position galbraith handed the big signals telescope to cousens watch the commodore ile looked forward all work had ceased and most of the hands were either standing on the guns or clinging to the shrouds spectators as if they had no part in it deck there this time it was sullivan sail in sight sir adam raised his glass again even as he heard cristie exclaim theres another of em fine across the inlet paradox was on the move again her sails changing shape as she shifted to the opposite tack cousens called huskilyfrom commodore sir enemy in sight adam flinched as a gun banged out over the cruising wavelets small and dull without menace paradox would close with the other vessels and fire a few shots into them there would be no point in their trying to resist especially with seven sisters already making more sail adam walked quickly to the rail barely seeing the marines standing by or against the packed hammock nettings he felt helpless anchored and unable to offer support he turned abruptly and asked how long shall we hold this lie to the cable cristie answered instantly bout an hour sir then we shall begin to swing adam stared at the green mass of land between unrivalled and the first sandbars there was a channel it was badly charted but doubtless well enough known to the slavers and those who hunted for them hastilow must know this coastline better than most creeks and beaches inlets and places where even the biggest craft could lie undisturbed paradox fired again aiming for the sails if the vessel was packed with slaves it would be sheer murder to fire into the hull deck there third sail leavin the inlet sir adam heard galbraith say theyve left it too late they can never come about in time adam turned as cristie said i may be speaking out of turn sir but afterwards adam recalled the sailing masters surprise when he had gripped his arm as if to shake him tell me man whats wrong paradox is on the wrong bearing then more firmly no im damn sure of it adam said mr galbraith heat to quarters if you please and have the starboard battery loaded he held up one hand like a rider quieting his mount but not run out he swung round and saw jago watching him as if he was waiting for it you were offering to sway out the gig remember then do it now larboard side he sensed his servant napier by his side and reached out to grasp his shoulder all the while he was watching the converging pattern of sails like the fins of sharks closing for the kill fetch my coat and sword david sir napier stared at him not understanding he squeezed the shoulder a boy his mother should be proud to have they might think twice before firing on one of the kings captains galbraith must have heard him the urgent rattle of drums beating to quarters had ceased the spectators had formed into tried and tested patterns the ship seemed suddenly still the occasional bark of gunfire remote and unreal i ie exclaimed you will not do it sir he was shaking with emotion there was a great chorus of shouts and groans and adam heard someone cry shes struck paradox has driven aground he looked past galbraith and saw it for himself paradox was slewing round her foretopmast falling as he watched soundless in distance but no less terrible you know leigh i dont think theres any choice then half to himself there never was when he looked again paradox was mastless a wreck seven sisters would not be in time and the other vessels in turnbulls flotilla would he hard put to cut off the remaining slavers there was only unrivalled and she was anchored and impo tent unable to move even into the other channel without sharing the same fate as paradox all guns loaded sir he held out his arms for napier to assist him with his coat then he took the old sword and thought again of the renegades words bravado courage or vanity cousens called theyre firing on paradoxs boats sir he sounded sickened outraged the flat dull bangs of carronades packed with canister and at pointblank range turnbulls proud gesture was in bloody rags he said man your capstans leigh let us see what we can do today and looked directly at him together pike in the reeds adam bolitho forced himself to remain motionless his coat brushing the quarterdeck rail while he stared along unrivalleds deck and beyond to the main channel the other vessels were still making good use of the offshore breeze sails barely slackening as they altered course slightly their outlines overlapping and distorted in the harsh light he could hear more shots small and individual now marksmen he thought shooting at anyone in the water who had survived the carronades paradox had swung with the wind and tide but was still fast on the sandbar the nearest slaver a brig fired two guns as she drew abeam but there was no response the third vessel changed tack again showing herself for the first time since she had left the inlet a brigantine if he had harboured any doubts cristie quenched them its that bloody alhatroz and his mates quick response and not empty this time by god adam said keep your men down and out of sight mr varlo he wanted to move to climb the shrouds for a better view but he did neither he did not need a telescope to see that the brig seven sisters had come about and was attempting to alter course on to a converging tack with the leading slaver how they must he hugging themselves the first shock of seeing paradox and then an anchored frigate giving way to something like jubilation people would yarn about it for years and more and more slavers would be prepared to take the risk because of it ready on the capstan mr galbraith take in the slack from aft he did not raise his voice impress on the gun captains to aim high rigging and nothing below it heave lads ifemvei adam saw lieutenant bellairs urging more men from aft to add their weight to the capstan bars feet and toes slipping as they matched their strength against the ship and the anchor cable adam watched the land it was moving but so slowly he stared at the three other vessels spreading out now with all the room they needed to avoid unrivalleds challenge except for the unmarked channels each of the three masters would know all about them and be ready to choose his escape route to the sea if they took no chances they could do it full human cargoes would increase their risk of sharing paradoxs fate and they had fired on a kings ship had killed turnbulls men in the water yes every man aboard would know the penalty of failure now unrivalled was swinging but not fast enough it had to be soon adam gripped his sword and pressed it against his thigh until the pain steadied him it was now open the ports run out he watched the leading and nearest slaver it would surprise them if nothing else but they would know that unrivalled could not move if she weighed now it would take an eternity to clear the treacherous anchorage and give chase he had already told varlo what to do the gun captains would lay and fire without even the movement of the deck to disturb them he realized that yovell was still on deck instead of having gone to the orlop his station when the ship was cleared for action the gun captains were peering aft fists raised eyes on the bluecoated figure by the rail surrounded by many but totally alone a prayer today mr yovell might not come amiss he raised his arm and gauged the glittering arrowhead of water which separated them there was no sound on the quarterdeck each man was waiting wondering perhaps it was not merely prizemoney this time he thought of hastilow or revenge as you bear his arm sliced down fire the deck jerked violently the sundried wood flinching to every shock as gun by gun along the ships side each eighteenpounder hurled itself inboard to be restrained by its tackles and crew many of the shots went far too high one even splashed down alongside the mastless paradox adam found a moment to wonder if turnbull had survived at least long enough to see what he had caused he heard rist say got that bugger then he seemed to realise he was beside his captain and added nice one sir a lucky shot or a skilled aim the result was the same the vessels topmast had cracked like a carrot and the rising wind did the rest the spars and heavy canvas splashed hard down alongside like one huge seaanchor dragged her round broadsideon and adam could see tiny antlike figures running about the brigs deck probably expecting the next broadside to smash directly into them her sails flapped in sudden confusion as if her master was going to attempt to wear ship and claw back into the narrows cristie said flatly aground hard an bloody fast rot him the second vessel was already changing tack unrivalled could not fire again without raking the first one adam said number one gun larboard battery he saw galbraith turn and stare at him we might lose the other brig but not albatroz not this time then he took a telescope from its rack and walked to the larboard side the brigantine even fully laden would still draw less water than the others that one channel which had always been avoided by larger craft was albatrozs obvious choice he thought of his uncles words again the unexpected and there she was exactly as he had remembered well handled her rig which partridge had first described bracing now to carry the vessel closer inshore where she would tack again and cross unrivalleds bows unharmed galbraith had gone forward and was standing with the gun crew gesturing and the gun captain was nodding red neckerchief already tied firmly around his ears it might take a few more minutes but one gun firing and reloading without support from the rest of the battery might avoid confusion and over eagerness gun crews were used to competing with each other it was all a part of training and familiarity not only among gun captains but every member of the teams a pull here a turn there handspikes ready to edge the long barrel around perhaps a mere inch to get that perfect shot someone growled the buggers run up the portuguese flag another retorted ell need it to wipe is backside with adam glanced at the main channel the first brig was still aground she had boats in the water to escape to attempt to kedge her off one was pointless the latter would take too much time seven sisters would be there before long and the other vessel was making good her escape he pressed his knuckles against his thighs and stared at the brigantine slack off aft mr partridge handsomely now he lifted his hand again and saw rist turn to watch him easy lads he knew varlo was signalling from the forecastle unrivalled was taking up to her cable again the shoreline was as before as if they had never moved but all he could see were the tancoloured sails moving slowly from bow to bow the masthead appearing to brush beneath unrivalleds jibboom run out after the squeal of trucks and the rumble of heavy guns being run up to their ports it was almost gentle and vet nobody moved and speech was in whispers fllbatrozs master was standing into the narrow channel there was no turning back soon any second now and he would see the solitary gun and he would know he might run ashore he could even attempt to kill every slave aboard but he could not escape the portuguese flag was the only thing between him and the rope he heard the gun captains voice saw him lean over to tap one of his mens shoulders the seaman even looked up and nodded his tanned face split into a grin adam felt some of the tension drain away he had spoken to that same seaman a few days ago but at this moment he could not recall his name cristie remarked shes got a couple of guns run out he looked at his captain they might if theyre desperate enough no one answered him adam straightened his back and felt the trapped sweat run down his spine and between his buttocks the brigantine was on course now all sails drawing and filling well as if unrivalled were invisible and if they did open fire unrivalleds guns would offer no quarter i le thought suddenly of avery and lleightons father and his hand moved as if to touch the locket it only took one shot now as you bear he folded his arms and stared at the brigantines flag a splash of colour against the hazy backdrop fire for an instant longer adam thought it was another overshoot then the maintopmast began to dip very slowly almost wearily towards the deck and as shrouds and running rigging snapped under the strain the complete mast with driver and trysails fell with sudden urgency the sound mingling with the echo of the last shot adam wanted to wipe his face his mouth but could not move strike you bastard strike his own voice or someones beside him he did not know another few minutes and they would have to fire again ile knew from instinct as much as experience that the gun had already been reloaded and run out after that alhatroz crippled or not would be beyond their reach ready sir it was not his concern the seizure of any slaver was his duty above and beyond all else the words of his orders seemed to mock him but all he could see was the effect of one ipounder hall smashing into a hull packed with helpless terrified humanity he lifted his arm but held it there as bellairs veiled theyre anchoring sir the huggers are going to strike adam breathed out slowly it sounded like the exhalation of an old man galbraith stood at the foot of the starboard ladder staring up permission to hoard sir adam looked across at the anchored brigantine it was not over yet and there was always the flag the thought made him want to laugh but as in the past he would not be able to stop no belay that mr galbraith is my gig ready he ran lightly down the ladder for a moment shutting out all the others take charge here leigh fire if need be for by that time it will be your decision galbraith walked beside him then take mr rist i pray you sir he knows these people you and i do not there was no sane interlude he was in the boat the oars already hacking at the water without it seemed moving a limb like some of the nightmares it was not next week or tomorrow it was now stand by to board now suddenly the other vessel was right here small compared with unrivalled and yet she seemed to tower above the gig as if to overwhelm them oars jago swung the tiller bar glancing only briefly at the last few yards conscious even in this moment of danger of how it must be done be it for the last time adam was on his feet feeling the bottom boards creaking under him intent on keeping his balance when at any second he expected a shot to smash him down figures lined the brigantines bulwarks and some of them shook their weapons apparently ready and eager to use them stand away stand of i warn you now and but once the voice was loud and clear and adam guessed he was using a speakingtrumpet rist murmured its cousens sir hes the one adam did not even look at him but recalled galbraiths last words he knows these people you and i do not and there was another sound which tension had forced into the back of his mind a strange groaning many voices blended into one despairing protest as if alhatroz herself was in pain as the gig moved into the vessels shadow he was aware of the stillness the finality so unlike the wildness and sometimes the exhilaration of a true sea fight the triumph and the suffering as an enemys flag fell into the smoke he looked up at the faces even they were motionless now it only needed one hothead that brief incentive to kill but all he could think was that his own voice seemed detached disembodied like someone else an onlooker in the kings name stand down and lower your weapons i am going to hoard you and who speaks with such confidence laughter an unnatural sound and adam noticed that the voices from the vessels hull had fallen silent as if they all knew and thought they understood they would be expecting more treachery no different from that which had beaten them into captivity rist muttered hes bluffing sir jago reached out to prevent it he had heard rists remark like the leadsmans chant deeper and deeper into madness but adam looked at him if i fall get the boat away he smiled faintly luke then he seized the handropes and felt the heat on his face as his head rose above the bulwark this was the moment he thought of the broken watch and the boy who treasured it of galbraiths concern of the church in penzance he jumped down on to the deck a press of figures seemed to fill it seamen they looked more like pirates and each man would know that they could hack him down and dispose of the boats crew with neither risk nor effort the burly man in a rough blue coat he assumed was cousens confronted him his eyes flitting across the epaulettes and sheathed sword then coming straight to his face he said again and who are you sir captain adam bolitho my ship you can see for yourself he heard an undercurrent run through the listening watching seamen you and your vessel are under arrest and will be taken to face charges as laid down cousens did not let him finish i had nothing to do with that shooting those vessels are barely known to me he folded his thick arms i am under charter to do this work i have nothing to hide he leaned slightly towards him and nothing to fear from you adam heard rist move very slightly by his shoulder and imagined jago waiting in the boat alongside your decision he said abruptly tell your men to put down their weapons now someone shouted in french spanish to adam it could have been anything but cousens turned away eyes glazed with fury or disbelief as unrivalleds larboard battery ran out into the sunlight as if controlled by a single hand like a line of blackened teeth he gasped ill see you in hell first and then stared at his men as singly or in groups the cutlasses and boardingpikes clattered to the deck rist stepped forward ill take the pistol and dragged it from his hand it was cocked and ready cousens stared at the frigate again they wouldnt dare rist wanted to kill him it had been too close this time insanity he answered and would any captain dare to board a slaver alone jago and the gigs crew climbed aboard and adam knew other boats were pulling across to join them he was unsure if he should or could move dazed sick afraid it was all and none of them cousens was staring around baffled unable to believe what was happening perhaps wondering if the frigate would have fired when her captain would have been one of the first to die adam took two paces away from the side and looked up at the portuguese flag but he saw only galbraith and would he have fired had it been his choice alone and suddenly there were familiar uniforms and faces taking up positions on deck and aft in the brigantines quarters varlo had come across with a fully armed party of seamen and some marines and they were in no mood for threat or argument now that the tension was broken rist saw the lieutenant placing some of his men at the swivel guns he had at least remembered that lesson rist licked his lips and nodded to williams the gunners mate who was one of the boarders near thing frank his welsh accent seemed even more alien here adam said search the vessel mr rist papers evidencevou know what to do ile looked at the hatch covers the silence now was almost unnerving is it safe to open those dyou think it can be done with care sir slowly cousens a royal marine on either side of him with a fixed bayonet at the ready shouted i am within my rights captain adam looked at him and found himself thinking of his aunt dear nancy she had so wanted a portrait for the old house she had nearly lost her chance but once again the laughter remained trapped in his throat he said i would dispute that but others better qualified will decide in good time for my own part i would happily run you up to unrivalleds mainyard he thought he saw the man flinch and seemed to hear rists voice hes bluffing and enjoy it he swung round at the sound of shouted orders and a disturbance of some kind from the companionway by the wheel williams and another seaman slowly emerged carrying what looked like a corpse wrapped around with a filthy blanket williams got down on his knees and laid the bundle carefully on the deck in the cabin sir tied up she was she was a child naked wrists and ankles scarred by ropes or shackles her feet were badly torn as if she had been forcemarched for some time before she had been dragged aboard albatroz to this she was alive but unable to see or think on the verge of hysteria or madness williams was murmuring softly to her holding the blanket to shade her face from the glare but adam was looking at her thighs and legs caked with dried blood there were teeth marks on her skin where she had been bitten she must have been raped repeatedly a child he thought of the letter and the sketch maybe the same age as elizabeth a girl he did not know any more than this one varlo said one hold is full of women sir all ages adam looked at cousens is this your work too you are the master of this unspeakable vessel what say you now he did not wait for an answer open that hatch mr varlo but be well prepared so calm still the tone he might use when asking a midshipman about the weather on deck when he already knew then he walked to the hatch as two marines prised it open the stench he had expected he had sailed downwind of slavers before when the world had turned its back but you never accepted it or became accustomed to it jago was beside him he could hear his breathing anger disgust or just glad he was out of it alive to rist he said tell them if you can that we are here to free them he averted his eyes as screams and wild cries burst from the hold what must it be like flung aboard chained not knowing where they were or where hound days or weeks scarcely able to breathe or move in their own filth until daylight found them as slaves williams called she wants to go down to them sir he sounded both anxious and protective the same man who had helped to blow up a chebeck with his bare hands with galbraith and rist easy with her he almost touched the girl as they carried her past but saw her stare at him with eyes full of terror his fury helped in some way or perhaps it was some lingering madness after toying with death vanity you say you are the master i lis voice must have been low for cousens leaned forward to catch his words and two bayonets rose level with his throat as if to some whispered command but he managed to nod you will know the name of the ship with which you intended to rendezvous to relieve yourself of this cargo this is too small a vessel to remain at sea for long with so many captives rist called three hundred an fifty men an women sir he consulted a list in his hand and glanced at williams an children cousens smiled relief surprise his confidence was returning my orders were to deliver them elsewhere i will tell any government official but not here or now i know my rights damn you adam saw one of the marines watching from the hatchway it was corporal bloxham the crack shot a good man in every way and with luck listed for sergeant at the next opportunity adam knew he would kill cousens here and now at the drop of a hat he repeated the name of that ship tell me cousens did not even shake his head adam walked to the lip of the hatch again staring faces eyes white in the shafted sunshine skins like ebony shining with sweat they had seen him they would know understand or most of them would without looking over his shoulder he said as master you are expected to care for all persons carried in your vessel at all times then he did look at cousens we have much to do before we can get under way again repairs a juryrig and a prize crew to be quartered aboard when we leave this place he watched the smirk on cousenss face fade i think it fair and proper that as master you should remain below with those women to reassure them if you will he strode to the side see to it mr rist directly jago muttered theyll tear him apart sir he was staring at him searching for something like that day in the church i dont doubt it call the gig alongside mr varlo can remain in charge he is discovering a great deal today i believe the marines were dragging cousens along the deck others ran to assist he was a powerful man but his voice strong as it was broke in a scream as they reached the open hatch the scream was almost drowned by the combined din from the hold like one great beast baying for vengeance rist stared at jago and then at his captain he wants to talk sir to tell you he glanced at the hatchway anything but that adam looked across to unrivalled so bright so clean in the sunlight he said it soils all of us not only the guilty the masters mate strode away and jago said would you have done it sir adam swung around sharply and felt the claws slackening releasing him i hope i never know and punched his arm luke galbraith ducked beneath a deckhead beam and stood by the small desk on the opposite side of the great cabin yovell was seated at his table absorbed in the notes he was copying unhurriedly in his round hand no wonder they called them quillpushers in the navy he thought yovell was utterly engrossed as if completely alone as if this had been an ordinary day and the captain hard to believe he was the same man galbraith had watched through a telescope climbing aboard the anchored alhatroz unaccompanied and vulnerable he was still scarcely able to accept what had happened as if to mock him he heard eight bells ring out from the forecastle noon six hours if that since they had seen paradox strike bottom and her masts and sails fold over her on the water like a dying seabird work had not stopped since boats plying back and forth slaves being released on albatrozs deck carefully guarded and separated from the vessels crew some of whom were in irons varlo was obeying orders take no chances with anyone the brig seven sisters had been busy too securing the other slaver intrepido and kedging her into deeper water other boats had been ferrying guns and stores from paradox anything which might be used against her original owners paradox could not be moved and in these currents and this climate it was doubtful if she would last much longer commodore turnbull had survived completely unhurt before he had come below galbraith had seen one last boat lying alongside the dejected topsail schooner by then a mastless wreck they would set her ablaze a suitable pyre for all those who had died for one mans folly hastilow had been killed among others the wounded were shared between unrivalled and seven sisters some would not last until freetown he looked at the captain now shirtless his dark hair clinging to his neck and forehead galbraith had heard that he had stripped naked and had ordered some seamen to use a washdeck pump to drench him from head to foot salt water maybe but it seemed to help to cleanse away something foul and not only from his body adam raised his eyes from the log book on his deck they were clear the aftermath of what he had done fallen into place recognised if not accepted they had clasped hands when he had returned aboard even his voice had sounded different hard as if he were expecting a confrontation fast as you can leigh tell the carpenter and have mr partridge send a crew across i want us out of here today shortly afterwards another brig kittiwake had arrived she had not managed to catch the third slaver she had not even been a spectator she had sailed past them heading for open water many of her company clinging to the shrouds to cheer and wave they were going to freetown it had been then that they had seen the commodores broadpendant streaming from the brigs masthead and through the glass galbraith had glimpsed turnbull himself aft with one of the lieutenants he had raised his hat to unrivalled and he had been smiling galbraith had turned to comment but had heard adam bolitho say ill see you damned for this they had not been alone together again until now adam said how goes it leigh i can see from here that the juryrig is raised and working and the surgeon tells me that the wounded are settled in are we ready one hour sir the wind is holding and steady ive told rist to remain with the prize hes doing well adam leaned back in the chair and tasted the coffee which napier had made for him that had been almost the worst part of his return on board he had been only just holding on facing them the captain again and then here in the cabin his sanctuary napier had taken his hand in both of his and had stammered i thought i thought it was all he had been able to say even yovell who rarely revealed emotion as if it was something too private to share had said what you did was pure courage lie had paused perhaps to measure how much more adam could take but if another had done as much you would have been the first to call him foolhardy and reckless adam said you all are leigh ile put the cup aside the coffee had been laced with rum we will remain in company with seven sisters and the two prizes we cant he certain of anything yet the other slaver had six hundred on hoard in a brig how can they expect them to stay alive galbraith said i have put cousens in irons sir i would not trust him an inch adam opened a drawer and took out the bundle of notes tyacke had given him he said the ship everyone knows about but no one has seen is named osiris fie shut the pitiful gibbering from his mind maybe he should have had cousens thrown into that hold he looked at the paper with the vessels name scrawled on it cousens had hardly been able to grasp the pen galbraith repeated it osiris strange name sir yovells pen paused in midair and he murmured judge of the dead adam smiled like a severe schoolmaster with a slightly backward pupil ile said rist discovered a few pieces of the puzzle i did not ask how osiris is or was an american vessel built around for use as a privateer galbraith nodded against us he saw the captains hand move unconsciously to his side to the ugly livid scar he had seen only once yes shes big and fast and well armed as the war against the trade becomes fiercer and more dangerous so the prices will rise and the rewards will be all the greater for those successful or aggressive enough to fight it he realized that his hand had moved to the wound the mere reminder of it anemones last fight against the american frigate unity when he had been cut down by a metal splinter as big as your thumb someone had told him at the time it had never left him the colours cut down in surrender when he had been unable to prevent it afterwards as a prisoner of war he had escaped only to face a court martial for the loss of anemone he saw the crippled sailor again in his mind the finest in the fleet he glanced around the cabin until you my lass he looked towards the stern windows but unrivalled had swung again to her cable there was only the land albatroz and the wrecked schooner were temporarily hidden from view feed the hands by sections two parties to each watch a double tot of rum too no matter what wringing of hands you get from mr tregellis he touched the wound again without thinking well man the capstans this afternoon make it seven bellsthe light will be good for hours god and mr cristie permitting they both laughed yovell did not raise his head but gave a quiet sigh of approval like sand running from a glass the strain was going this time then he heard adam say but ill find this osiris somehow some day cousens and his breed are dangerous but without the power behind them they are little fish he banged his hand on the scrap of paper the pike in the reeds hes the one we want his mood changed just as swiftly but the crown agent must decide and our commodore will see him before any of us the explosion was like something thudding against unrivalleds lower bilges only a sensation but a ship was dying adam walked to the quarter window and shaded his eyes to watch the column of black smoke rising above the middle channel torn by the hot wind like some ragged garment or shroud no ship should die like that he thought of hastilow and the action which had cost him so dearly what price revenge now foolhardy and reckless like a court martial the sword could point in either direction at the end code of conduct captains comin sir denis obeirne straightened his hack and wiped his hands on a piece of rag a seaman lay on the sickbay table his naked limbs like wax in the spiralling lantern light he could have been dead but a faint heartbeat and the flickering eyelids said otherwise move him presently obeirne looked at the bandaged stump and sighed inwardly another onearmed survivor to end up on a waterfront somewhere but at least he was alive he seemed to realise what his assistant had said and turned to see captain bolitho in the doorway his body at a steep angle as unrivalled leaned her shoulder into the sea the wind strong and steady across her quarter you wanted me i ic glanced around the sickbay with its bottles and swabs its smell of suffering and death above all the stronger aroma of rum the navys cure to kill pain to offer hope even when there was none he hated this place and all like it it was stupid but he had long since given up fighting it obeirne took it in with practised eyes strain anger perhaps there is someone asking to speak with you sir one of paradoxs men her boatswain he paused briefly to examine his hands he has not long i fear some last spark of resistance or disbelief a dying declaration was not unknown among sailors what would i say very well he regarded the surgeon more closely outwardly he showed no sign of exhaustion although he had been working here or aboard the prize intrepido since the brief action had ceased seven sisters also carried a surgeon obeirnes comment of a sort said it all adam followed his large figure into the darker interior of the orlop which seemed to be full of wounded or injured men some lay still recovering or quietly dying it was impossible to tell others were propped up against the ships timbers their eyes moving following the swaying lanterns or just staring into the shadows stunned by the realisation that they had survived and as yet only halfaware of the injuries obeirnes small strong fingers had explored and dealt with and here too was the stench of rum three had died and had been buried after dark their second night at sea after leaving the anchorage with the wrecked and burnedout paradox a lingering reminder each corpse was doubleshotted to carry it swiftly into the depths there were always sharks following patiently but sailors believed the dead were safer at night obeirne murmured his name is polglaze it was grapeshot there was nothing more i could do adam gripped his arm sensing his sadness so rare in a manofwar where a surgeon often had to face sights far worse than in the height of battle he knelt beside the dying man who like the others was propped against one of the frigates massive frames he could hear his breathing the rattle in his throat he was bleeding to death adam felt the steeper roll of the hull the wind had found them too late for this man and others like him you came zur the eyes settled on his face reflecting the light from the nearby lantern and fixed on the tarnished gold lace and gilt buttons something he understood not a young man but powerfully built or had been when he reached out to take adams hand it was unable to grasp him adam said polglaze a fine cornish name am i right the man struggled to sit up and perhaps lean forward but the pain halted him like another piece of grape his grip strengthened almost imperceptibly st keverne capn you cant get much further south than that a wild coast when it wants to be eh i ic wanted to leave he was not helping this man who had been born not so far from penzance was beyond aid now but the boatswain named polglaze might even have smiled as he muttered fes a wild shore right enough the manacles claimed moren a few vessels when i were a lad there obeirne said softly i think thats time enough adam halfturned wondering which one of them he meant he felt the mans hard hand tighten around his as if all his remaining strength was there and the need which was keeping him alive he said quietly ill be here be certain of it he listened to the uneven breathing wanting it to stop to end his suffering he had done enough this hard rough hand said it all the countless leagues sailed ropes fought and handled sea wind and now this he could hear tyackes words bitter scathing and for what polglaze said suddenly i wanted to tell you about paradox capn how it was what they did a fine little craft she was adam tried not to swallow or move did he know what had happened in the end the rising pall of smoke it was all planned see the boats was put down and some of our best men sent aboard his voice seemed stronger reliving it our mr hastilow was ready too hed done it often enough see he broke into a fit of coughing a hand came from the shadows with a cloth to dab his mouth there was blood on it when it withdrew polglaze groaned and then said we was too far off an the wind too hard on em i thought mebbee we should have waited til the others came an then the lieutenant orders a change of tack i dunno why exactly adam recalled cristies surprise the wrong bearing and the schooners ragged sailors their obvious hostility but as a company they were as one polglaze could not even remember the lieutenants name he had replaced the luckless finlay but he was not one of them now he never would polglaze gave a great sigh an then we struck nobodys fault we was just obeyin orders he sighed again but the grip was just as strong we never carried a senior officer afore see adam bowed his head to hear other unformed words turnbull must have ordered the change of tack and the new lieutenant would obey he did not know that coast like the others polglaze was looking at him intently the winterll be lettin go in cornwall now i reckon his head fell forward and he was dead obeirne stooped to prise the fingers from adams hand yes it will adam stood his hair brushing a deckhead beam the cool timber quietening him sustaining him although his mind was still blurred with anger and with sorrow he said thank you for fetching me it was something he needed to tell me to share in his own fashion he knew obeirnes men were lurking in the shadows ready to carry the dead boatswain to the sailmaker for his last voyage as one captain had described it and one day perhaps in the tiny village of st keverne where the land looked out over those treacherous rocks the manacles if there was still anyone who cared the man named polglaze would be remembered he hoped for his courage and his loyalty he turned to leave to face galbraiths unspoken questions but he paused and looked down again you were murdered obeirne watched him go i ic had not caught what the captain had just murmured but he had seen the dark eyes in the lanterns glow and believed he knew him well enough to guess he recalled the sights which had confronted him upon his visit to the slaver intrepido spanish but she could have been under any flag only a brig yet she had carried over six hundred slaves crammed into her holds packed so tightly that they could barely breathe in a hold filled with women like albatroz one had already died and others were in a terrible state corpse and dying chained together amongst the ordure he signalled to his men sailors like the dead boatswain endured much on this godforsaken coast they obeyed orders he thought of adam bolithos face sometimes it was not enough at nightfall that same captain read the familiar lines from his prayer hook and they buried his fellow cornishman with full honours the last voyage leigh galbraith walked to the entry port wincing as he left the shadow of one of the awnings freetown was unchanged except that it seemed even hotter as if all the air had been sucked out of that wide harbour up as far as the majestic lion mountain even the excitement of their return had dimmed he shaded his eyes and looked across at the two anchored prizes intrepido and albatroz abandoned now but for a few red uniforms under guard to await developments galbraith recalled the wild cheering from some of the ships when they had come to their anchorage the slaves being ferried ashore laughing sobbing and confused they were free but how they would manage to return to their villages or settlements was difficult to understand and far worse some would doubtless be trapped and returned to one of the barracoons along that same hostile coast to await the next ship and another buyer unrivalled had been at anchor for two days and only the pursers crew and two working parties had been allowed ashore to await orders he heard the bell chime from forward and that was today the brig kittiwake had taken on stores and had departed almost immediately commodore turnbull was with the crown agent galbraith had sensed the disappointment and resentment amongst unrivalleds people two slavers as prizes there would have been none but for their action anchored or not a courier brig had arrived but no mail had been delivered to them galbraith was not expecting any but hope was always contagious adam bolithos friend and his uncles last flag captain james tyacke was still at sea in case the missing slaver attempted to return to the inlet which seemed unlikely or to continue with another endless patrol i hate this place he wiped his face and tried to dismiss it better here than on halfpay in some place full of others rejected by the one life they knew needed slavery was evil weighed against that their presence here was necessary if colonies were to survive against peacetime conditions it still did not make sense he had heard some of the older hands talking about it a few had boasted of their liaisons with women like those they had freed only days ago campbell it would he him insisted there was nothing to touch them nice bit o black velvet to get you goin midshipman cousens called boat shoving off from the jetty now sir always alert perhaps thinking of his hopedfor promotion my respects to the captain would you tell him he beckoned to a boatswains mate pipe for the guard creagh then man the side he relented his voice had been sharper than he intended it was affecting him more than he had believed maybe it was only the heat and all for just another official visit this time the crown agent he thought of the captains expression the last time they had been here rearadmiral herrick had been his uncles oldest friend he had heard that several times but when bolitho had returned on hoard it was as if they had met as strangers the royal marines were already falling in by the entry port sergeant everett checking the dressing watching for any flaw in the pattern there was none guard of honour or shooting down an enemy it seemed to be one and the same to this elite corps the seamen often joked about it it made no difference captain luxmore was also present his face almost matching his tunic galbraith turned to watch for the boat an ornate affair almost a barge it belonged to the governor and was manned by seamen borrowed for his excellencys convenience he refrained from using a telescope the rearadmiral would know he halfsmiled they always seemed to know such things he heard the captains step on the companion ladder and said clear all idlers off the upper deck mr cousens he turned and touched his hat right on time sir adam glanced along the main deck galbraith had done well everything was in its place ready for sea herrick would miss nothing he had once been richard bolithos first lieutenant a lifetime ago he wondered if he still remembered galbraith said i spoke with the purser sir there is ginger beer in the cabin he did not think it was the time to mention tregilliss list of complaints after he had returned with his crew from the stores drinking water they call it id not wash a horse in it and the salt beef three years in the caskthat fellow sullivan could carve a fleet of models from it its like iron but a purser was rarely content adam watched the approaching boat another senior officer think of it like that he had noticed that cousenss signals party had already bent on a flag for herrick and were ready to run it to the mizzen truck as he came aboard herrick would decline it he was coming as an agent of the government not in the capacity his rank implied a matter of courtesy then he saw the bowman toss his oar and replace it with his boathook the barge was still turning and the man almost lost his balance jago was looking on it was not hard to guess what he was thinking he could see herricks cocked hat now he was wearing his best uniform then he thought of unrivalled how she must appear to herrick not just another frigate surely but as a singular ship perhaps i misjudged him thought of my own pain rather than his the boatswains mates moistened their silver calls on their tongues and captain luxmore brought his sword to the carry pipe as the calls shrilled in salute and the marine guard brought their muskets to the present herricks head and shoulders appeared in the entry port adam removed his hat and stepped forward he heard a gasp of alarm and saw herrick lose his grip on the guiderope he knew herrick never made any allowance for having only one hand but this time he had misjudged it the guard of honour the hard glare from the harbour an error of timing or was it emotion could it be that jago was there in a second before even the boatswains mates could move seizing herrick by the wrist yet still managing to remove his own hat while even the disciplined marines gaped with astonishment herrick stepped on to the planking and doffed his hat then he looked for jago and said that was nearly a very short visit i thank you for your alertness then he glanced up in the sudden confusion cousenss assistant midshipman fielding had misunderstood his instructions lazily defiantly even the rearadmirals flag had broken from the mizzen ilerrick nodded as if he had heard someone speak and looked directly at unrivalleds captain the full uniform gave him a stature which had been lacking at their last meeting there were lines about his mouth but his eyes were as blue and clear as that young lieutenant of years past adam said you are welcome here sir he saw herrick wince as he shook his hand the empty sleeve was a constant reminder they walked aft beneath the poop and adam was aware for the first time that the same eager and anxious aide had come aboard with him the marine sentry snapped to attention the screen doors were open wide and young napier was waiting wearing his best jacket and shoes herrick hesitated and looked closely at the royal marine i know you lucas isnt it the mans eyes barely blinked beneath his leather hat yessir th old benbow sir you were younger then we all were it would be all over the marines messdeck the barracks as they called it within the hour no herrick had not forgotten they walked into the great cabin adam sensing that herrick was moving almost uncertainly as if unprepared for this moment so many ships so many situations he must have seen it all on his way up the ladder of promotion from his humble beginnings napier said anxiously this is the best chair sir the blue clear eyes turned to him and you look after the captain do you napier considered it frowning slightly we take care of each other sir that is well said but he went to the wide bench seat beneath the stern windows and gazed out at the anchored shipping and tangle of masts and rigging his eyes were far away he was somewhere else adam said we have some ginger beer sir from the army mess herrick grimaced it would be he looked past him towards the sleeping cabin i would relish a drink however adam nodded to napier and saw him frown once more as his shoes clicked noisily across the deck herrick said i have read your reports with great care the seizure of the two slavers was commendable and a useful example of what can be achieved with the will behind it this ship performed well although i cannot judge if her exact position at the time was the most suitable he looked up calmly for i was not there then he smiled that was an observation not necessarily a criticism and repeated i was not there adam heard the shoes returning and said i was obeying orders herrick glanced at the silver tray and the two goblets from the very beginning we are told orders will be carried out at all times without question obey do your duty he took the proferred goblet of cognac and studied it gravely but as we move up the ladder we discover that there is more to it than obeying orders there is the responsibility the conscience if you like you will know that better than many i suspect he swallowed some of the spirit and closed his eyes this takes me back he changed tack again as if he had momentarily lost control of his thoughts my aide will give you all the relevant details or as much as you and i are intended to know but i want this to remain between us you have my word on it sir you see i have always done my duty or tried to i never allowed myself to question the minds of those who dictated the orders you make friends and you make enemies a friend is everything but he can break your heart he did not explain he did not need to i never wanted to quit the sea the navy even after this he looked down at the empty sleeve with more than a suggestion of hatred in the end i was offered an appointment with the revenue service at plymouth someone blocked the wayill not mention his name but his word was accepted and i was given this role of crown agent at best a dead end at worst a scapegoat he shrugged i accept that i have no choice not anymore adam looked quickly at his own goblet surprised that it was empty he remembered nothing of it herrick was speaking of valentine keen it explained so much a missing link herrick continued so personal matters can intrude even with the wary and the righteous ile waited until napier had refilled the goblets and the pantry door was closed he said quietly commodore turnbull made full use of his time after paradox was disableder wrecked he is a lucky man adam waited but there was no hint of suspicion whatever he might voice in his private report to the admiralty and the foreign office herrick shifted his position and reached for his drink i am all but finished here i have seen and made enough reports to carpet portsmouth point some will be acted upon others will be considered the fleet was cut down to a dangerous level when the last french flag was lowered as our nel and he hesitated sir richard proclaimed many times to deaf ears the main need will always be for frigates there have never been enough nothing has changed adam watched his hand smoothing the goblet as if to seek a reason for breaking his own severe code of loyalty then herrick did look at him his eyes very direct calm as if he had come to a decision any previous doubts dispelled there is to be another offensive in the mediterranean very shortly frigates are few enough experienced captains hard to find you will know what i am saying where the last offensive failed he almost smiled you were there lord rhodes herrick shook his head you may discount that he leaned forward on the bench the sun across his shoulders and epaulettes unrivalled will be leaving for england in a day or so after captain tyacke returns here he gazed at him impassively you were asked for by name more i cannot say adam stared around the cabin scarcely able to believe what he had heard england the mediterranean again and there could be no doubt in his mind that algiers was the destination it was like turning back the calendar to last year when men in this ship had paid dearly for rhodes arrogance and stupidity herrick said quietly slavery does not begin or end here i fear you will be ordered back to freetown when you are available for duty small fast vessels and their lordships will have to provide them he smiled again eventually i shall be leaving too in the courier for spithead we shall say our farewells today tic doubled his hand into a fist and added take heed lord rhodes is still powerful and he makes a had enemy he dragged out his watch and opened the guard with some difficulty his wrist seemed to be troubling him after his near accident at the entry port adam waited and imagined the aide loitering and bobbing beyond the screen door he was leaving freetown and returning to something familiar which he had trained himself to accept but he had known thomas herrick long enough to be sure he had not come out to the ship merely to wish him well perhaps unrivalled was the only venue where he felt safe at liberty to speak herrick said youre like him in many ways you know headstrong reckless he was often like that he stood up and looked for his hat then he turned and stood beneath the scaled skylight his face suddenly determined in your report you wrote of the barque osiris we lost her this time but in the end we shall meet up with her again and therell be others like her while the pickings get richer he looked slowly around the cabin like someone who did not expect to see it again i wronged lady somervell i have tried to make good my ignorance but i wronged her nonetheless she was very dear to your uncle and now i can understand why he added with sudden bitterness now that its too late adam faced him by the desk tell me osiris is a slaver and she wears spanish colours he glanced at the screen door where a marine he had once known stood at yet another post but she plies her trade for a company in the city of london baron sillitoe is the force behind it he clenched his fist again his father built his empire on slaves did you know that there were shouts from on deck another boat was coming alongside adam could hardly believe what he had heard sillitoe feared respected influential a confidante of the prince regent and his inspectorgeneral until recently and catherine had nobody else to protect her when she most needed it he said thank you for telling me sir i will never forget herrick examined his hat as if he was glad he had unburdened himself i wanted to tell you when we first met in this damnable hole he smiled and it made him look incredibly sad duty remember they left the cabin together napier wearing an expression of surprise herricks lieutenant of relief as they passed the wardroom herrick stopped and saw yovell stepping aside to lose himself in shadows he did not offer his hand but said so you could not leave it either eh i wish you well yovell watched them walk forward towards the sunshine beyond the poop the greyhaired rearadmiral with one shoulder stooped against the constant pain and unrivalleds captain like a young colt richard bolitho had often said so unlike one another but the bond was there god mind you he said quietly but keep up your bright swords he shook his head the coxswain was right he was getting past it herrick stood by the entry port as the governors gilded barge was manoeuvred alongside he saw partridge with some of his seamen trying to conceal a boatswains chair in case he was unable to make the descent unaided he shook his head but thank you he turned and looked up once more at the listless flag at the mizzen then at the waiting officers and midshipmen the scarletcoated marines no detail escaped him he held out his hand and said short and sweet how every flag officers visit should be take good care adam i shall think of you and heed what i said there are many enemies in our work not least is envy he doffed his hat abruptly to the quarterdeck and walked to the entry port where jago was standing vigilant but apparently unconcerned galbraith watched the barge pulling away from unrivalleds shadow and into the relentless glare adam said fall out guard and side party mr galbraith their eyes met and he smiled leigh galbraith glanced again at the slowmoving barge herrick did not look back perhaps he dared not adam said come aft presently we are to receive orders today when commodore turnbull has discovered their content he followed galbraiths gaze and added there goes a part of the old navy leigh he touched his arm and walked aft again none better captain james tyacke pushed his servant to one side and finished tying his neckcloth himself dont fuss roberts i have to see the commodore not the almighty he looked into his hanging mirror and then at adam who was sitting in one of the cabin chairs with a glass in his hand good of you to come aboard at such short notice adam he seemed to hesitate over the name as if he were not yet used to such informality i met up with seven sisters on passage here and spoke to her captain he looked at him in the mirror again about this and that adam smiled he had watched kestrel enter harbour working her way slowly and expertly under minimum sail to where the guardboat loitered to mark her point to anchor he said ive received orders to return to plymouth he heard the words drop into the silence he had not yet accepted it nor did he know his true feelings tyacke nodded buttoning his waistcoat so i heard you know the navyi expect the whole west coast knows about it by now he turned and regarded him thoughtfully i expect youll be ordered to return here one step at a time adam noticed that tyacke no longer betrayed any discomfort or selfconsciousness the devil with half a face the slavers had called him when he had come to this station and had welcomed its solitude he had said more than once of sir richard bolitho he gave me back my selfrespect and whatever dignity i still possess people still stared at the melted skin his legacy from the nile young midshipmen dropped their eyes others showed pity the one thing tyacke despised adam had told him about osiris and what he had learned about her tyacke was like steel and would never indulge in gossip especially if it concerned no matter how remotely the reputation of catherine lady somervell while adam sipped some wine tyacke had shaved himself waving his harassed servant aside with the razor if i cant shave my own face im ready to go over the side a difficult captain to serve but he had the feeling that they thrived on it all a long time ago adam when it was fair and respectable to grow rich on slavery now as controls grow even stronger the price goes up but its still the same market the eyes held his steadily i heard about sillitoes fatherhe made his fortune out of it hes long dead but the profits live on he walked to the stern windows and back his burned face in shadow so that it was possible to glimpse the man who had been cut down that day and had lost the girl he loved because of it now she wanted him back and tyacke had seen her in the house she had shared with her late husband and the two children of her marriage all tyacke had said was never go back ships places people theyre never the same as you chose to remember adam said what about you james im content on this station probably the only one who is it seemed to amuse him but the work wants doing and it needs men who care enough to do it without thinking all the while of prizemoney and slave bounty then he took adams hand and said youre still finding your way and the navy is going to he hard put to find good captains at the rate things are moving i wish you luck adam we both share the memory of the finest man who ever lived i iis eyes hardened and ill not stand by and allow others to defame his lady he held out his arms and allowed the servant to help him into his coat take care adam and watch your hack he shouted enter the screen door opened instantly it was fairhrother the captains coxswain unrivalleds gig is alongside sir very well eli we shall he up in a moment adam grinned the story had gone around the squadron when tyacke had chosen his new coxswain fairhrother what sort of a name would that be in half a gale man so it was left at eli adam wondered how john allday had got along with him in the flagship together raven the first lieutenant was waiting with the side party he shook hands too as if they were old friends as it should he in frigates adam looked over to his own ship and another prize which kestrel had brought in with her a small schooner or as tvacke had described the capture just a rabbit sneaking out when it believed all the foxes had gone elsewhere the rabbit had carried a hundred slaves nevertheless as the gig pulled slowly amongst the anchored shipping adam sat with one hand on the sunheated thwart and tried to assemble the events and his reactions into some sensible pattern the orders were precise but suitably vague four months since they had left penzance with a long commission the only likely outcome they would be home in the spring like the words of paradoxs dying boatswain but he recalled tyackes flat statement never go back they re never the same as you chose to remember jago saw his sunbrowned hand grip the edge of the thwart and wondered what was going through his mind the captain who had everything he watched a boat pulling across the channel and scowled back to some other squadron with another admiral who probably didnt recognise his backside from his elbow officers adam was aware of the scrutiny but was glad of it something honest even if you were never quite sure what he might come out with what might be waiting this time he allowed his mind to explore it falmouth perhaps the empty house more memories perhaps there would be a letter waiting for him he touched the locket beneath his damp shirt he said what dyou think about our returning to plymouth as tyacke had remarked the news was all over the station jago kept his eyes on the water ahead of the gigs raked stem so long as ive got baccy in my pouch an a wet when i needs one he gave the smallest hint of a grin an a few coins to jangle in the right direction then im not too bothered sir adam saw the stroke oarsman contain a smile we are all deluding ourselves bows he glanced up at the ships curved tumblehome the faces at the entry port lieutenant varlo met him with the side party and he recalled that galbraith was ashore to offer support to the purser he looked at the masthead a fair breeze but the air was like an opened oven would it last varlo said some mail came aboard sir his face was full of questions official for the most part adam walked aft seeing their expressions hope expectation anxiety the sailors lot he strode into his cabin and tossed his hat on to the chair napier had offered to herrick the chair he smiled a little sparse for the captain who had everything he heard a quiet cough and saw yovell waiting by the pantry door well i expect you know all about it but he stopped his troubled mind suddenly alert what is it galbraith would leave everything in order and varlo had said nothing he asked again something troubles you tell me it was unusual to find yovell so hesitant unsure of himself there was a letter sir some people might say it was not important that it was not our concern adam sat down slowly to give yovell time to compose himself he said if it concerns you or anyone in my ship then it matters to me yovell removed his spectacles and polished them on his coat the letter was for your servant the boy napier sir from his mother he asked me to read it adam said but he reads well he was too distressed to read anything after that sir shes getting married again yovell cleared his throat is married again sir they are going to america her husband has work offered there it was not uncommon boys signed on for the fleet or some particular ship but always with a link to sustain them then a new marriage and the new husband or friend would consider the youth in question to be so much inconvenience a burden adam was on his feet without knowing it it had been right here when herrick had asked him the question and napier in his own serious fashion had replied without hesitation we take care of each other sir and the same boy with a jagged teak splinter spearing his leg concerned only with helping his captain yovell went to the door and brought napier right aft to the stern windows he saw napiers chin go up with defiance or a determination not to give in he might even regard yovells behaviour as some sort of betrayal it only made him appear younger defenceless adam said well not talk on this david but i know we weigh anchor during the morning watch so i shall want to be up and about early he saw the boy nod not understanding unrivalled will be in plymouth in june earlier with fair winds think of that napier stared at the deck he had even forgotten to remove the offending shoes i know sir adam did not look at yovell he dared not but put his hands on napiers slight shoulders and said after that my lad you are coming home with me he swung away and added abruptly some cognac for myself and mr yovell i have some letters to dictate the boy paused by the pantry and looked back it was enough yovell said gently we have no letters sir it was a day he would never forget home from the sea adam bolitho winced as his elbow slipped from the window rest and he was tossed against the carriage side lie was astonished that he could have fallen asleep when every bone in his body ached from the lurching motion the roads were dry the ruts left by the last rainfall ironhard a match for even an expert driver like young matthew he looked out at the passing countryside the contrasting greens the rugged stone walls which were so familiar and so alien it was hard to recall unrizvalleds return to plymouth or even set each event in its true order plymouth in contrast to their last departure was no longer full of ships laid up in ordinary or stripped and forlorn awaiting the ignominy of being hulked or broken up it was alive with menofwar from towering liners to seventyfours and support craft of every shape and size but not many frigates he noticed not a full fleet but it soon would he from what he had been told he glanced at yovell sitting opposite him filling both scats and fast asleep despite the sickening motion gold spectacles still on the top of his head yovell had the gift of acceptance ile had been neither surprised nor excited by the prospect of their return as if it was ordained he heard the boy napiers voice above the clatter of wheels and harness and the steady thud of hooves on the narrow road i le had wondered about the impulse if that was what it had been which had compelled him to tell napier he was coming with him to falmouth not any longer he could hear young matthew the bolitho coachman answering his many questions laughing at some of them but enjoying his new companion young matthew even that was part of the story which went with the old grey house his grandfather had been old matthew the head coachman for many years the boys father had been lost at sea in one of the famous falmouth packet ships so it had seemed only natural that the name should remain even though he must be over forty by now strange that they should have sighted a homewardbound packet while they had been beating up the channel to plymouth long enough to close with the other vessel and pass a message to her master ferguson would have seen to the rest young matthew had been in plymouth waiting for him when he had left unrivalled for ten days he had never been absent from his ship for any such length of time he had wanted it more than he had realised needed it but his other self had forcibly opposed it he thought now of viceadmiral keen when you were at sea only the ship mattered it had to be so for any captain you tended to believe that everything else would remain the same in your absence like a familiar landfall or the face of a friend he had realised what was happening as soon as he had gone ashore to make his report to the flag officer plymouth at the magnificent boscawen house with its sweeping views of sea and coastline furniture all anyhow as jago would put it packing cases and bustling servants keens flag lieutenant with what appeared an armful of lists he seemed barely able to remember that unrivalled had anchored that morning he had had more important matters to deal with and a new flag officer was arriving the following day keen accepted it he was appointed to the nore the medway and a whole new dockyard with facilities for the next generation of ships and men it was important and he had the knowledge that his immediate future was secure he might even rise to the rank of admiral it did not seem possible physically he had changed hardly at all and only once did an inner disappointment reveal itself each command their lordships pass my way takes me further and further from the sea in many ways i envy you adam youll never know how much his wife gilia had been there too and had added her insistence to keens on the subject of taking leave from duty while there was still time keen had said youve been at sea almost continuously for years the longest time you had ashore was when you were a prisoner of the yankees and even they couldnt hold you and there was the child only a month old squawking in the arms of a nurse and barely larger than a woollen glove he had thought they had named her geraldine after keens mother when keen had been called away to deal with something which one of his staff found beyond his abilities gilia had spoken with the same candour and sincerity as when adam had confessed his love for zenoria he loves the child of course adam she had rested one hand on his sleeve like that other time but its the navy he wants a boy to carry on the tradition he began adam knew keens father had done everything within his power to persuade his son to quit the service and take up more important work in the city like himself or even in the honourable east india company then she had said i shall miss this place so many memories but as val is constantly pointing out ive travelled with my father almost as much as any sailor yovell said were slowing down he put his head on one side like a wise owl adam thought stopping in fact he was suddenly alert the dreams and uncertainties scattered it had been a long long drive with halts from time to time for the horses to rest and water all of fifty miles or so from the tamar to this place on a road somewhere in cornwall for much of it they had been out of sight of the channel hills fields pastures and men working in the sunshine hardly glancing at the smart carriage with the bolitho crest on each door well coated with the dust of travel they had stopped for a meal at an inn at st austell and more notice had been taken of them there they were an oddly assorted group he supposed a sea officer and a large benevolent figure who might have been almost anything and the boy proud and showing it of his new singlebreasted blue jacket with its gilt buttons which adam had obtained from the tailor he occasionally used in plymouth so many memories he thought of gilia again and smiled like galbraiths repeated assurances that he would keep good charge of the ship while his captain was away and the surprise which even he had been unable to conceal when adam had responded it is my behaviour i care about not yours leigh the carriage quivered to a halt the leathers creaking in time with the horses stamping on the hard ground they knew better than anyone they would be in their stables within the hour he heard someone jump down and knew it was napier perhaps his confidence was running out like mine so young and yet so adult in many ways at the inn at st austell when some old man probably a farmer had scoffed bit young for a kings man baint ee lucky th wars over i say adam had turned from speaking with the landlord ready to intervene but had said nothing napier had bent over and unhurriedly pulled up the leg of his new white trousers in the filtered sunshine the jagged wound left by the splinter had been stark and horrific he had answered simply not too young for this sir the door opened and napier resumed his seat beside yovell who had made room for him he looked at adam and asked naively almost there sir adam pointed at a slate wall which was turning to follow the narrow track downward now all the way to the sea he said hanger lane they call this david in the old days you were mad to walk here alone without one on your belt he recalled the ragged corpses hanging in irons by the roadside when they had skirted the moor it was not very different today yovell readjusted his spectacles after six hours in this seat i feel as if ive been round the horn it was a casual comment to break some indefinable atmosphere lie was not certain if this youthful man who seemed to have been born to his captains uniform was suffering some lastminute misgivings napier said quietly you said wed be back in england by june sir lie glanced up at yovell we were faster than that yovell saw adarn clench a fist against the worn leather it was the first of june it would he his birthday next week he had heard sir richard speak of it on several occasions adam was thinking of unrivalled lying at anchor she was in good hands he had heard galbraith mention the risk of men deserting and cristies gruff response well not lose a soul sir which is a pity in a few cases i can think of but til their lordships see fit to pay them their share of prizean bountymoney you can sleep safe on it and he thought of luke jago what would he do who did he care about if anyone and his characteristic answer when adam had suggested he spend some time at the house in falmouth not for me sir a few wets ashore an mebbee a lass when i feels like it thatll do me fairly ile had laughed at the idea and yet adam shook himself and leaned out of the window the smell of the land but above it the sea was there waiting drive on young matthew before i change my mind young matthew peered down at him his face like a polished red apple beneath his hat then usd be real sorry zur he flicked the reins and clicked his tongue the carriage rolled forward adam leaned back in his seat and looked at napier was that it was he trying to emulate his uncles little crew jago another john allday and this graveeyed youngster perhaps as he had once been himself the sound of the wheels changed and he looked out as the carriage rattled past a pair of cottages two women were talking by a gate and he saw them point then wave smiling as if they knew him he raised his hand in greeting and felt yovell watching him the crest on the carriage door would tell them a bolitho was back coming home bryan ferguson shaded his eyes and looked across the stable yard where a few of the estate workers had gathered to watch young matthew giving another riding lesson to his new friend the boy napier sat upright on the back of the pony jupiter face determined and still unable to believe he was here barefooted and stripped to the waist he already wore some bandages to mark his progress and his falls in the stable yard young matthew had remembered his grandfathers golden rule that to ride a horse you must first know how to sit properly no stirrups or saddle not even reins at this stage young matthew guided the pony with a halter giving an occasional hint or instruction letting the boy learn for himself ferguson thought of his wife grace there was no friendlier person alive but as the bolitho housekeeper she regarded all newcomers with suspicion until proved otherwise it had taken only one day with napier after his first fall when he had cut his knee on the cobbles she had come down to ferguson in his estate office unable to contain her tears you should see that poor lads leg bryan hes lucky he didnt lose it how could they let boys take such risks war or no war she had relented immediately and had touched his pinnedup sleeve his own reminder of action at sea forgive me gods been so good to us he turned away now from the sunlight and looked at his oldest friend john allday captain adam had been back from sea for three days and the time seemed to be running out like sand from an hourglass this was alldays first visit and ferguson knew he was troubled by it perhaps even relieved that adam bolitho had been away from home for most of the day the mug he always kept for his friend was grasped in his big hands like a thimble his wet which they always shared on these occasions had barely been touched a had sign allday was saying couldnt get away earlier bryanlot going on at the old hyperion two new rooms being builtyou know how it is yes ferguson knew with the new road and a carriage toll business at the inn would be improving he thought of alldays pretty little wife unis and was glad for him she had done well for both of them and for her brother the other john as she called him who had done more than anyone else to help her when allday had been at sea her brother had only one leg a legacy of his service in the thirtyfirst foot when he had been wounded on the bloody field of battle i thought danl yovell might be here too allday looked around as if he expected to see him gone to see somebody john keeping away was the truer reason ten days captain adam had said and even that might be cut if some damned messenger came galloping up to the house with an instant recall to duty he heard a great chorus of laughter then cheering and looked at the yard again napier had nearly lost his seat but was even now releasing the ponys shaggy mane upright again his face all smiles something he sensed was rare especially for one so young they were all busy making each day count in its own way lady roxby had apparently persuaded captain adam to sit for a portrait to hang eventually with all the others in the old house ferguson closed it from his mind one he might never see something all sailors must consider he turned to his friend once more allday had none of it the old dog who had lost his master he did not belong unis their little daughter kate the inn and a life now unshadowed by the prospect of separation and danger they were a part of something else even his trips into falmouth to watch the ships anchoring and departing were fewer nor could he bear to mingle with all the loudmouthed veterans you found in every tavern and ale house at least the village of fallowfield where the old hyperion remained the only inn was usually free of sailors and with the pressgangs only an evil memory no kings men ever reached that far gracell fetch some food presently he sat down opposite the big heavy hands were unchanged they could wield a cutlass or create the most delicate of ship models like the one of the old seventyfour hyperion which occupied a place of honour in the inn parlour a strong man yet although ferguson knew better than most how allday still suffered from the terrible wound in his chest a spanish blade and the story had it that sir richard had thrown down his own sword in surrender in order to bargain for alldays life allday said i aint sure bryan ill be wanted over at fallowfield ferguson picked up his own mug and studied the contents the wrong word or some false sentiment and his old friend would get up and leave he knew him that well he thought about it often how unlikely it would sound in the telling i low he and this big shambling sailorman had been seized by the pressgang here in falmouth or very close to it and their captain had been richard bolitho and the ship his frigate phalarope after the battle of the saintes when he had lost his arm ferguson had been nursed back to health by grace and had risen to become steward of the estate allday had gone one better he had become bolithos coxswain and his friend his oak ferguson made up his mind stay here until the captain gets hack he wanted to see you before but the roads were awash and he had to leave for his ship you should know that better than anyone allday swirled the rum around in his mug whats he like then full of himself now that hes captain of a new frigate his deeds argued about when the ale flows is that it you know him better than those lampswingers john people will always compare him with his uncle but thats stupid and unfair hes still learning and would be the first to say so id not wonder but hes his own man now he broke off as there were more cheers from the yard the lesson was over and young matthew was grinning hugely one arm around the boys shoulders allday said when sir richard was his age wed just taken over the tempest thirtysix guns an smart as paint she was his blue eyes were far away that was when he took fever nearly died he did he jerked his shaggy head towards the window used to make me take him up the cliff walk every single day then wed sit on that old bench up there watch the ships yarn about the ones we knew ferguson almost held his breath like you do now old friend we had some good times in tempest bad uns too mr herrick was the first lieutenant i remember went by the book even in them days he stood up and paused as if to get his bearings and ferguson knew it was to prepare himself for the pain should it be lurking to bring him down he had been lifting a cask of ale over at fallowfield once and he had heard him cry out and fall had it been anyone else he might have been able to accept it allday said that boy down there napier the captains servant an he brought him here with him he has nowhere else you see so i heard allday frowned his mother cut the strings ferguson stared at the stable roof with its father tyme weather vane how many bolithos had that seen and time it gave him to think and consider what allday had said he must have asked about captain adams servant and probably yovell as well although he could well take care of himself bible or not allday was feeling his way afraid of being outgunned as he would put it he said quietly captain adam has nobody now john allday turned and walked heavily to the table i seed the roses when i got here a fine show of em this year he looked at his friend searching for something i used to talk with lady catherine about them he nodded slowly i would like to stay bryan was it roast duck you said did i and smiled ill tell grace itll be the making of her old friend allday put down his mug it was empty needed that bryan the grin was returning an thats no error horse and rider paused silhouetted at the top of the hill where the narrow road divided into separate lanes adam released the reins and patted the horses flank easy lukey easy now the horse stamped on the hardpacked ground shaking its head as if to show disapproval impatience perhaps at being held to such a slow meandering pace adam eased his body in the saddle surprised that such a short ride along the winding track from falmouth could make itself felt every muscle seemed to throb the close confines of a frigate had taken their toll fie stared at the sprawling house at the far end of the second lane framed by trees with the glint of water proving that carrick roads and the sea were ever close the old glebe house they called it once owned and occupied by high churchmen from truro it had fallen into disrepair after a fire had broken out in the small chapel adjoining it derelict for years a birthplace for rumours and tales of ghosts and evil spirits which found a ready audience in these parts it was said to have been used by smugglers the brotherhood when it suited them the church authorities had agreed to sell the place although most local people had considered any prospective buyer either mad or eager for ruin the eventual owner proved to be neither sir gregory montagu one of the countrys most distinguished painters had bought it repaired and refurbished it but had left the gutted chapel untouched montagu rarely mixed socially and was said to spend much of his time in london where his work was always in demand eccentric and reputedly a recluse he was certainly different adam thought he had heard the story of montagu as a young halfstarved artist who had scraped a living from selling small paintings in the form of silhouette or profile which could be used as miniatures gifts from departing sea officers to their loved ones there were many such artists working around the various naval ports but montagu who had rented a tiny attic on portsmouth point had attracted the eye of an admiral a man of taste as well as charity for reasons buried in time the admiral had sponsored montagu and allowed him to accompany his squadron to the mediterranean where he had paid for professional tuition by a notable painter in rome nancys influence or the great montagus curiosity had brought adam here an honour to take his place with all those other proud portraits or just to please his aunt who had done so much for him he hated the prospect and had even toyed with the idea of turning back at the first crossroads to the village of penryn years of inbuilt discipline had prevented it adam disliked being late just as he had little sympathy with those who kept him waiting in the navy you soon learned that presently meant immediately he nudged the horse forward again come along lukey they may have made other arrangements they had not even as the horse clattered across loose cobbles and the houses tall shadow closed around him like a cool breeze a stable boy and a dourfaced servant who might easily have been a priest himself appeared at the main entrance he climbed down and patted the horse take care of him will you i may not be long the servant eyed him sadly sir gregory is expecting you it is captain bolitho the implication was that sir gregory alone would decide how long he would be inside it seemed very still and the high arched windows would not have been out of place in a church wellpolished furniture dark and probably very old and plain flagged floors added to the atmosphere of spartan tranquillity the servant cast his eyes over adams appearance in the filtered sunlight the dust on the blue coat and gold lace must be very evident i will inform sir gregory the slightest hesitation sir alone again he recalled nancys enthusiasm as she had told him about the appointment with the great man she had taken his elbow and guided him to the wall where the portrait of captain james bolitho caught the reflected sunlight from one of the upper windows and had turned him so he could catch the precise angle of the light across the painting captain james her father had lost an arm in india and when he had returned from sea it had been montagu who had been called in to paint the empty sleeve over the original work he had also painted the portrait of richard bolitho in the whitelapelled coat of a postcaptain which adam heard had been cheneys favourite it still hung with hers in the main bedroom catherines selfcommissioned portrait was with them they were at peace there ah captain bolitho at last a great pleasure he did not walk in nor did he suddenly appear he was there adam was not sure what he had been expecting montagu was not tall or imposing yet he dominated the place with his presence very erect squareshouldered like a military man but wrapped up in a paintsmeared smock which looked as if it had not been washed for years there was dried paint in his hard handshake and his thick white hair was tied back with a piece of rag like any common seaman but his eyes revealed the real montagu alert restless one second and then fastening on to some feature with the intensity of a hawk he said abruptly ill make a few sketches you can sit and talk while im thinking on it or you can hold your peace and enjoy some reasonable hock which might slake your thirst after a hard ride adam brushed some dust from his sleeve to give himself time a hard ride to put him at ease or was it sarcasm montagu would know very well that it was only three miles from pendennis they walked together along a highceilinged corridor there were adam observed no pictures of any sort on display and all the while he could feel the other man studying him although he was looking directly ahead he said i understand that you recently painted the prince regent sir gregory nancy had told him it had not helped yes thats true he gave a quiet laugh but another man wearing his garments for most of the time he was too busy they said then he did turn to look at him i know you do not wish to be here neither as it happens do i but we are both good at our work and for that reason if nothing else it will qualify there were voices unreal and echoing like an empty vault montagu said sharply my proteges we shall take another route a barn of a place but it suits the gaunt servant had reappeared by magic it seemed he had a finger to his lips sir gregory your nephew montagu said curtly well slip past them he must get used to interruptions if he hopes to line his purse he opened another tall door and entered what appeared to be one huge room it was hung with sheets and there were trestles a bench of clean brushes beyond which another figure in a paintdaubed smock stood stockstill one arm outthrust as if he was painting some invisible canvas the room had a glass roof with rolling shades to contain or deflect the bright sunlight montagu said this way adam did not move ile could not sitting on the floor directly opposite him with one leg bent under her was a girl she was so still that for a second longer he imagined it was a work of beautiful statuary then her eyes moved seeing him accepting dismissing him her gaze returned to the motionless outthrust arm of the painter she was naked but for some sort of robe which had fallen across her thighs while her arms were pulled above her head fastened by a chain around her wrists montagu paused do not overwork her joseph he lifted part of a sheet to shield the girls shoulders with the casual disinterest of a housekeeper covering an unwanted chair they walked past another screen and into an adjoining room over his shoulder montagu said imagination as well as skillsomething you will doubtless appreciate captain bolitho adam looked back at the closed door as if it had never happened but he could still see her her body poised motionless in the unwavering light what were they doing montagu gestured to a solitary chair doing he smiled soon it will be the beautiful andromeda chained to a rock to be sacrificed to the sea monster before she is rescued by her lover perseus imagination you see adam was seated in the hard chair one arm resting across it although he had scarcely felt montagu move him he attempted to adjust his neckcloth and coat but montagu held up his pad no captain as you are the man others see not necessarily the one you would have him be uncanny that he could ignore the restless sometimes piercing stare the accompanying squeak of crayon someones wife or mistress who could she be he could laugh out loud at himself but he wanted to keep that image fixed in his mind she was lovely and she would know it and yet in that single moment he had seen only indifference or was it contempt montagu walked back and forth muttering to himself darting occasional glances at his subject adam tried not to move and wondered if the chair had been chosen especially to remind each victim of its importance montagu said lady roxby tells me that you are in falmouth for only a few days he made stabbing adjustments to his sketch that is a pity i understand that you have seen a great deal of time and action at sea of late he did not wait for or expect a reply i shall require you here again of course surprised again adam found himself nodding i will do what i can a fine woman lady roxby i never truly understood how she came to enjoy her life with sir lewis the quiet chuckle again the king of cornwall but they succeeded when many do not he gazed at him for several seconds and said your sword the sword i am surprised that you came without it i need it you see part of the legend the charisma there was no scorn or sarcasm he heard himself say i still find it difficult to wear without misgivings sir gregory the crayon hesitated in midair that does you credit captain he inclined his head graciously as if to confirm it i knew your late uncle of course very like you in some ways especially when it came to sitting for a mere painter restless always searching for excuses to leave he turned his pad to the light it is coming he stared at adam again its there right enough the same look and yet he swung round as the servant peered around the door what is it you know i will not be interrupted just as quickly the mood changed and he winked at adam not exactly what i told my nephew is it adam realised for the first time that montagu had a short pointed heard which had been concealed by the untidy smock it was not hard to imagine him one of the kings cavaliers what age was he seventy or more he was ageless montagu swung away from the door my nephew is about to leave i must just speak with him i ic will not like what i am about to tell him but he will listen and he will learn lie tossed back his smock the cavalier and his cloak in his absence adam looked around the littered room empty canvases a halffinished painting of sea birds circling a ruined belfry the chapel he had seen when he had approached the house how long ago was that even the filtered sunlight should have told him he had been here for over an hour how had it happened was it montagus restless energy his ability to switch moods and subjects with the ease of creating different images in his mind he had not thought of unrivalled once during this time not of turnbull nor of herrick nor even of the array of shipping at plymouth the smell of action this was another world he thought of the girl again her arms pinioned above her head her breasts full and taut montagu saw beyond the sheets and the untidy trestles it was or soon would be a great rock where the beautiful andromeda waited chained and helpless a sacrifice to the monster it was clear without doubt or question imagination he had said it was far more than that montagu was hack wiping his stained fingers on a rag i think that will suffice captain i shall work on it tonight i find it suits the subject the keen eyes settled on him again you have been badly hurt i think that will come into it adam smiled surprised that the tension within himself had dissipated in the navy it is a risk we have to accept montagu smiled politely the hurt i see goes deeper than any wound of battle he shook his head but no matter captain it will come to me he gestured to the tall harp adam had seen by an open fireplace he had assumed it to be mere setdressing for another painting music of the gods yes then he said tomorrow then again he did not wait for an answer i would not wish to interrupt your birthday celebrations when you have so little freedom from the sea the adjoining room was deserted the sheets folded untidily the trestles waiting to be transformed into a rock for a lovely captive the chains lay where she had been sitting only the sunlight had moved adam heard the horse stamping outside the entrance in seconds he would make a fool of himself perhaps destroy the only moment of peace he had found in this old house and its strange ageless owner but he heard himself say please the girl who was here sir gregory montagu faced him again almost like a duellist now measuring the distance the threat she sits for me and those i choose for their potential she is very skilled it is not merely the act of disrobing posing before men with neither expertise nor scruples he smiled but it did not reach his eyes and she plays the harp to perfection the main doors were open the sky was still clear in a moment he would be out on the road again montagu held out his hand does that answer your question the one you did not ask me adam saw the stable boy waiting expectantly and felt for a coin they would doubtless laugh at him once the door had closed behind him she is very beautiful he expected the other man to interrupt but montagu said only quietly she was badly hurt also do not harm her he hesitated do i have your word it was hard to believe they had only just met that he could respond without any hesitation you have it sir gregory he tried to smile to reassure him or perhaps for his own sake he would never see her again and she would remain as much a mystery as the poses of those myths of which he knew so little he climbed into the saddle and heard the boy call something and grin up at him he could have put a guinea into his hand for all the notice he had taken he reined the horse round towards the gates and halted hearing the harp from one of the tall windows and imagining her as he had seen her then he urged the horse out on to the road he did not once look back he dared not he was afraid of destroying something he felt the horse pounding beneath him as if his mood was infectious it made no sense it defied all reason he had always been made welcome in falmouth nancy bryan ferguson and his wife and faces he knew only by sight on the estate or at the harbour but he had always felt like a stranger an intruder this was the first time he had ever felt he belonged trust luke jago slitted his eyes against the reflected glare and gauged the gigs passage through the mass of anchored shipping it must have been a long time since plymouth had seen such an array of naval strength he thought not a day had passed since unrivalleds return from west africa without more vessels arriving gathering around the flagship queen charlotte it was strange if you considered it the flagship was only ten years old and carried a full armament of one hundred guns a new vessel by naval standards some other wellknown ships of the line had been over forty years old when they had been abandoned to the breakers or had become melancholy hulks like those he had seen elsewhere and yet queen charlotte was unlikely ever to stand shiptoship in any line of battle they had seen the last of it he glanced at lieutenant galbraith upright in the sternsheets his strong features composed on his way to the flagship and jago could guess what he was thinking the captain was still away and galbraith had the weight he smiled inwardly why i called away the gig make it look right midshipman martyns was in charge but jago had to nudge his arm as a bargelike craft pulled slowly abeam obviously looking for trade like the rest of the boats which were never far from this impressive fleet there was a colourful canopy rigged aft and he could see several women sitting beneath it their gowns and painted faces leaving no doubt as to what they were preparing to barter midshipman martyns gulped and actually blushed there was some hope for him after all jago decided his thoughts returned to the captain i ic had never seen anyone so torn between taking leave of absence from his ship and remaining for everyone to see in command others would never have hesitated especially with a flag officers blessing he had considered the captains suggestion that he join him in falmouth he had laughed at the idea but it had not gone away he had even mentioned it to old blane the carpenter who had responded scornfully i always thought you was a fool luke but never that much of one i wish t god someoned make me the offer and now they were on the move again there had been no official orders or speeches from the officers you just knew it the collection of ships had become a fleet the flagship was like the hub of a great wheel and when the word came it would be sudden the navys way he glanced at the young midshipmans hand on the tiller bar the watchful eyes of the stroke oarsman as if the flagships presence had touched each one of them if not the big threedecker then certainly the admiral whose flag curled only occasionally at the masthead lord exmouth now but better known and remembered as sir edward pellew who during the wars with france and spain had become famed and respected as the navys most successful frigate captain the new title had been bestowed on him at the end of hostilities like most of jagos contemporaries pellew had grown up in the navy and wanted nothing else he might have been expecting enforced retirement it had happened to many officers of similar stature jago looked up at the towering masts and crossed yards not for me he himself had served in a ship of the line an old twodecker and by no means as grand as queen charlotte he had been with her for over a year before being transferred to a frigate and in all that time he had never ceased to meet people he had never laid eyes on before a floating town names you never remembered officers who did not care to find out about any man outside his own immediate authority boat ahoy jago grinned and cupped his hands wye aye just to let them know there was an officer coming aboard but dear me not a ships captain whorl need all the proper ceremony and respect only a lieutenant this time he touched the midshipmans arm and murmured take er in now he remembered the rearadmiral named herrick he would have fallen outboard but for his quick action strange he thought there were plenty of senior officers he would have happily aided over the side if he had believed he would get away with it oars tossed bowman hooked on to the chains and the flagships gleaming tumblehome rising above them like a cliff galbraith said stand off coxn ill not be long delayed on this occasion jago touched his hat and watched him seize one of the handropes and jump on to the lower stair as he had observed before galbraith was very light on his feet for so powerful a man he was not soft or easygoing nor did he try to be popular like some first lieutenants jago had known being close to the captain he had got to know him better than most or so jago told himself enough for instance to catch the bitterness in galbraiths tone he knew the story or most of it galbraith had had his own command he watched the blue and white figure moving steadily up and around the curved hull his sword slapping against his thigh not a big ship just a little brig vixen she was named and his own a lot of junior officers started that way captain bolithos first command had also been a brig and so he heard had been the cruelly disfigured captain tyackes but galbraiths promotion had stopped right there the full story would be worth knowing he saw galbraith reach the entry port and barked cast off shove off forrard be ready to out oars the last order was for the midshipmans benefit martyns was daydreaming again staring at the flagship ilis eyes saying ifonly jago snorted he could have it lieutenant leigh galbraith paused to doff his hat to the quarterdeck and the flag pleased if surprised that he was not out of breath after the steep climb the deck seemed vast after unrivalled you could lay two hulls here and still have room enough to drill the marines a lieutenant took his name and sent a midshipman scurrying away with a message ile recalled his own brief command it was like no other feeling lowly or not you were received with honours paid as if you were already posted he thought about it a lot too much ah mr galbrice he turned to see a lanky lieutenant with the twist of gold lace on his shoulder that distinguished him from all other mortals the admirals flag lieutenant he corrected calmly galbraith sir quite your captain is not aboard i understand it sounded like an accusation flag officer plymouth insisted he should take some days leave of absence the flag lieutenant shrugged viceadmiral keen has hauled down his flag things are moving more quickly i have a letter for you to take when you leave this ship arrange a fast courier will you now if you will follow me you may sign for your orders he let the words sink in your responsibility you understand he did not need to hear it from the lieutenant captain bolitho was being recalled galbraith could not determine if he was relieved or resentful he followed the other officer beneath the poop everything was larger than life and there was no sense of movement as if the great ship were hard aground he was reminded suddenly of varlo he had been somebodys flag lieutenant before he had joined unrivalled replacing the dead lieutenant massie wounds healed quickly under such circumstances it was only a short time ago and yet he could scarcely recall what massie had looked like how he had sounded the unwritten rule his name was never mentioned either he signed for the sealed orders observed by a small darting man who must be the clerk or secretary to someone higher no one asked him to be seated the flag lieutenant said that seems in order mr er galbraith he looked up startled as a shadow fell across the door the newcomer was tall wellbuilt and dressed in what appeared to be a towelling robe of the kind galbraith had seen worn by wealthy people at a local spa his large feet were bare and he had left wet impressions across the perfect deck covering he could only be the legendary admiral nobody else would dare he held out a big hand and said abruptly exmouth youre from unrivalled i believe he smiled easing out the lines and wrinkles a sailors face glad to have you with me i read the report your captain left with valentine keen i found it inspiring could make all the difference when i am allowed to proceed with matters he looked piercingly at his aide who was openmouthed at this casual display of informality a glass of something would not be unappreciated galbraith said i had better call my boat my lord the admiral nodded gravely it takes some getting used to believe me he waited for the flag lieutenant to scuttle away and added gunnery that will prove and win the day if anything will his eyes were distant all these ships at my command but unrivalled is the only one which was there galbraith felt the tension drain from his muscles so it was algiers he was surprised to discover that he was heartened by the confirmation the land had nothing to offer anymore the admiral regarded him steadily i shall be glad to have captain bolitho in the van ills voice softened i knew his uncle great days he patted galbraiths arm best not to dwell on old times but great they were and he was a fine man his eyes hardened as the lieutenant returned with some wine you will stay and take a glass with me again the unexpected smile it is an order the admiral waited the glass delicate in strong fingers yours mr galbraith galbraith presented his own glass and said quietly absent friends my lord their eyes met well said later when galbraith waited for the gig to be signalled alongside he thought of that encounter with the admiral it would be all over the flagship within the hour about the lieutenant who had joined lord exmouth for a glass of wine like old shipmates and tomorrow captain bolitho would receive his recall glad or sorry which would he he he considered his own feelings the bitterness was gone the old glebe house was exactly as he remembered it he had thought of little else since his visit and yet there seemed so much more to see and hear the hedgerows along the lane were alive with movement birds and other furtive sounds of the countrvside some jackdaws watched his approach as if to time the exact moment when they would all take to the air in noisy unison before returning after he had ridden a few yards and wild roses he reached down and plucked one remembering that other time the only time the same stable boy hurried to greet him and waited as adam swung himself down from the saddle there were flowers here too foxgloves almost wild in the sprawling garden a place of memories he thought where time had come to a halt the boy said th masters with a gentleman zur his eyes were fixed on the old sword at adams hip young though he was he probably knew of the bolitho family the sailors commemorated in the church of king charles the martyr where he had stood beside catherine at the memorial service and galbraith had asked to attend with him it had been their first true moment of intimacy and understanding not merely as captain and first lieutenant but as men the dourfaced servant had arrived and said unhelpfully youre a piece early captain sir gregorys engaged at the moment the stable boy anxious not to offend and with the prospect of another coin or two glimmering in his mind said i told n he pointed to a walled garden you could look at th bees zur adam patted the horses flank he must have ridden harder than he had realised nervous anxious what is the matter with me he had hardly touched his breakfast and he had felt ferguson s eyes on him as he had waited for lukey to be brought from the stables he had even tried to concern himself with unrivalled and what might lie ahead when the final orders were settled he had gone to the room and looked at his uncles portrait again could almost hear his voice trust the professionals in your ship you lead theyll not let you down he had heard him say that several times the professionals the warrant officers and the timeserving men like sullivan the sharpest lookout he had ever known and partridge the bluff heavyhanded boatswain and cristie with a lifetimes experience of currents and tides shoals and stars he knew them and had been with them in calm and storm broadside and the grim aftermath the servant took his silence for annoyance and said almost grudgingly i can tell you the instant sir gregory is ready sir he shuffled away maybe he had been with the old house when montagu had bought it adam walked slowly along a winding path and found himself listening for the sound of a harp he tried again to shrug it off like a bumbling midshipman but it would not release him he thought about this day his birthday nancy would be coming to the house there would be a few friends grace ferguson would supervise the food and wine and would probably cry a little and perhaps john allday would come across from fallowfield on the helford river to celebrate or to mourn there was only one would have made it complete he looked up and saw her coming towards him she was dressed from neck to toe in pale grey a gown so fine that it seemed to float around her body she carried an armful of yellow roses and he noticed that her skin had been browned by the sun that her throat was hare and the gown had almost slipped from one shoulder she had stopped on this same path her gown catching at other flowers adam neither saw nor recognised above all he knew she was about to turn and retrace her steps if need be run to avoid the inevitable contact his hat was in his hand although he had not moved he bowed his head clumsy and awkward words sticking in his throat afraid that when he raised his eyes she would be gone i beg your pardon i did not wish to disturb you he dared to look at her i arrived too early it seems he saw one hand detach itself from the flowers and rise to adjust the gown across her bare shoulder and all the while she was looking at him into him with neither smile nor recognition her eyes were very dark as he remembered them in a single glance but it was the same he had not recalled her hair other than that it was also dark almost black in the dusty sunshine but much longer waistlength perhaps more he said it was good of sir gregory to make the time for me my aunt she continued along the path but then stopped again a few feet away she said he wanted to do it she gave what might have been a shrug otherwise you would not be here her voice was soft but strong cultured not a local girl assured as she would be when composing herself for a painting and yet there was something else he heard montagus voice she was badly burt also what had he been trying to say she said i must leave you captain bolitho she lingered over his name testing it as montagu would assess the quality of a new canvas in a moment he would step aside and she would not look back he said quietly i heard your harp when i left here before i was very moved by it unconsciously he gestured in this setting it seemed so right so perfect now that i have met you i understand why she stared at him defiant or angry it was impossible to tell she was taller than he had realised and the gown did nothing to free his mind from that first time the chained wrists the painters motionless arm her eyes touching his for no more than a second but she said you have a way with words captain with women too i suspect now if you will allow me to pass she looked down startled as two of her yellow roses fell to the ground he stooped to retrieve them and saw her feet barely covered by leather sandals as brown as her throat and arms she stepped hack and almost lost her balance as her heel snared the hem of the gown lie gripped the roses one of the thorny stems drawing blood but without any pain lie felt nothing it had been her quick withdrawal which recalled it a stark ugly picture the young black girl violated beyond anything but terror and revulsion when he had reached out to reassure her of her safety she had responded in the same manner he said ii am so sorry i never meant to offend you there were voices now someone laughing a horse stamping ready to leave it was over it had not even begun adam stepped from the path and felt her pass him so close that the gown touched his hand he looked after her and saw that her hair was as long as he had imagined she was probably going now to adopt a pose for another artist disrobed perhaps her lovely body open to another mans stare what did she think about was it a way of avenging herself for what had happened to her to prove she was inviolable if he could find that stable boy he would leave now before he stared at her unable to accept that she had turned back her face no longer calm she reached out and seized his sleeve your hand its bleeding she prised the two roses from him and laid the entire bouquet on the scorched grass at her feet she had produced a handkerchief from somewhere and was wrapping it around his fingers as montagu followed by his servant appeared in the walled garden now then what have we here adam saw it clearly anxiety suspicion it was far deeper than either she said roses my fault she looked directly at adam and said i have seen many men of war captain but only in portraits i was unprepared she knelt to recover the roses or herself montagu said you see captain your reputation precedes you but he was smiling unwilling or unable to hide his relief so let us begin ive roughed out some ideas he beamed besides we must not detain a man on his birthday he turned and called something to his servant she stood very upright and composed i did not know captain she broke off a rose and attached it to the lapel of his coat to remember me by then very deliberately she broke the other stem and placed the rose in the bosom of her gown his blood made a bright stain on the silk and i shall remember you he watched her walk unhurriedly along the path and out of the garden montagu was waiting for him come along while the light is good adam thrust his hand into his pocket the handkerchief was still there not a dream im delighted that you remembered to bring the sword memories eh the same room the same unwelcoming chair adam saw the canvas for the first time an outline a ghost montagu placed the sword carefully on his bench and made a few swift sketches i would not ask you to leave the sword this sword with me i think captain that you will need it again soon adam waited his eyes on the tall harp montagu was giving himself time weighing the chances like an experienced gun captain watching the first fall of shot he said suddenly i see that you are wearing the rose shall i keep it in the finished work so casually said so important i would be honoured sir gregory i mean it more than ever now montagu nodded slowly and rolled up one sleeve i shall tell lowenna what you said he began to paint very briskly he had made up his mind lowenna adam bolitho entered the church and closed the tall doors behind him after the heat of the morning and his walk into falmouth from the old house it seemed a cool haven a refuge he was still wondering why he had come he felt his shirt clinging to his skin as if he had been in haste or had some pressing reason for being here it was dark after the sunlight of the square and the streets where people looked at him as he passed interest curiosity or like some of the old jacks by the ale house hoping to catch his eye for the price of a drink perhaps he had come to clear his head unused as he was to the awesome meal which grace ferguson had prepared in his honour duck and local lamb fish as well it would have satisfied unrivalleds midshipmen for a year and john allday had made an appearance it must have cost him dearly to come adam thought older heavier shaggier but otherwise the same unchanged the first moments had been the hardest allday had taken his hand in both of his and had stood in silence holding it remembering so that he had shared it seeing it as it must have been the hardest part allday had told him about meeting tyacke when his ship had called here and other names had been mentioned faces appearing as if from the shadows the hardest part he walked deeper into the church seeing the tablets and sculptures soldiers and sailors men who had died in battle at sea or in some faroff land for some cause few would now remember there were all the bolithos their wives too in some cases he looked back through the church at the aisle where he had given his arm to belinda when she had married his uncle there were others in the church resting escaping from the heat praying but all separate alone with their thoughts he thought of the untidy studio and sir gregory montagus sharp assessing gaze while his brushes had moved tirelessly as if controlled by some independent force and the girl hed not seen her again and yet as he had ridden from the house he had felt that she was there watching him he had sensed nancy s immediate interest when he had mentioned her but even she knew very little born in cornwall but had moved away when still a child as far as london where the family had somehow become involved with sir gregory montagu her father had been a scholar a man of refinement but there had been some scandal and nancy had heard little more except that the longhaired girl named lowenna sometimes came to the old glebe house with montagu but was rarely seen anywhere else not even in the adjoining village of penryn she knew more than she was telling before she had left for her own house she had taken his arm and murmured dont break your heart adam not again a warning but she had not been there in the walled garden like stripping away a curtain of secrecy when he had seen the girl lowenna her defences momentarily broken down andromeda the captive waiting to be rescued from sacrifice he had paused opposite a finely crafted bust of captain david bolitho who had died in fighting pirates off the african coast he had been the first bolitho to carry the sword montagu admired so much and now unrivalled would be going back there he touched the scabbard at his thigh will i be the last bolitho to wear it montagu expected him to make another visit lie was afraid of hope afraid of hoping why captain you are not wearing my rose lie swung round his shoe scraping on an iron grill and saw her sitting at the end of a pew her face pale against something dark even black i le gripped the back of the pew hardly trusting himself to speak i would have walked right past you i had no idea he saw her hand gripped around the polished woodwork like some small wary creature i still have it i will never lose it he saw some faces turn towards him disturbed irritated he lowered his voice may i ask why you are here at king charles the martyr i might ask the same of you captain perhaps you came to bask in the past glories of your family or to find peace as i do on occasion he reached out to cover her hand with his own but it had vanished ile said i wanted to walk to think i ic hesitated to remember she looked down her face almost hidden you asked for the rose to remain in the portrait is that so ile nodded sensing her sudden uncertainty like panic ile said it will always be there even when i am not she shook her head and he saw her hair shine briefly in the colours from a stained glass window io not say such things she looked at him directly again her eyes very dark and do not think of me as you first saw me it would be better for you if we never saw one another again he felt her hand close on his slight but surprisingly strong believe me for my sake if not your own the building quivered to the slow deliberate intrusion of the great clock chiming the hour she stood suddenly the contact broken i must leave i am already late forgive me she had opened the pew gate and was very cl use to him her perfume or perhaps it was her bodys scent was amost physical he said i would wish to see you again lowenna he felt her start at the use of her name but she did not pull away instead she said quietly he told you then he trusts you she stepped out of the pew and he was vaguely aware of other faces turning to stare she said it is a long walk you may ride with me and put a hand to her mouth as if surprised even shocked by her own suggestion then she tossed her head the hair spilling across her shoulder they can think what they choose he stepped aside for her unable to believe it was happening he said there will always be thoughts like a voice from the past there were some empty vases waiting to be filled and he took her arm gently to guide her around them he felt the sudden tension so strong that he thought she would turn upon him but she halted and faced him quite deliberately and her voice was heavy even sad dont do that again captain without anger without hope they walked in silence to the big doors and he saw a pony and a smart little trap waiting in the square it was the same stable boy neatly turned out and without his grubby apron he showed neither surprise nor hesitation as he hurried to lower the other seat side by side not touching but adam could think of one thing only this meeting was no accident she must have wanted it dont break your heart adam not again he glanced at her profile as the little trap rattled out of the square her head and shoulders were covered with a fine black shawl only one hand showed itself on the safety rail a temptation and a risk he would never take like the girl on board the slaver afraid of what might happen worse what she might do it seemed to take no time at all the old stone wall the house beyond and always the sea he said you could step into the house i could show you some of the portraits it sounded meaningless ile tried again you would not be alone there are people here she was not listening she said only someone is waiting for you i think the little group stood motionless by the entrance ferguson and surprisingly allday yovell was here too a little apart from the others a spectator but all adam saw was the man in uniform the dust still on his shoulders from his ride the horse was with young matthew and the boy napier who was rubbing his eyes with his wrist she murmured is it had news adam turned on the seat and looked at her lie did not need to be told he had experienced it many times without question sometimes he had welcomed it but not now he answered i am recalled she did not take her eyes from his i think i knew it was why i had to see you to speak she attempted to pull her hand away as he covered it with his own but instead stared at it as if fighting something unable to break free i felt it too lowenna he looked around the house the group of people he cared about they were not here there was only the sea like an old familiar enemy i shall never forget she shook her head you must for both our sakes adam felt a tear splash on to his hand and released hers very carefully then he stepped down and stood beside the little trap and said simply i want to know you and for you to know me to share and confide to trust she watched him one hand to her breast as he lifted his wrist and touched the fallen tears with his lips until we meet again this must suffice he didnt know if shed heard him or even if she had answered the trap was rattling away and was lost almost immediately around the bend of the road she did not look back he walked towards the house and saw the courier unfastening his pouch the rest were dreams adam bolitho stood by the stern windows in a patch of deep shadow and stared out at the great array of ships it never changed except when unrivalled swung to her cable he traced the outline of an anchored brigantine with his finger on the thick glass you could almost feel the impatience of the vessels and their companies eager to leave before the excitement lost its edge it was his first full day on board and yet he still felt as if part of himself had remained with the land he had tried to lose himself in his command something he had always been able to do even if only to give confidence in moments of doubt galbraith had done well during his absence no deserters perhaps because of the unpaid bountyand prizemoney and only a few defaulters petty for the most part he turned his back on the glistening panorama and looked around the cabin two hours ago he had assembled all the officers here senior warrant officers included he smiled faintly trust the professionals two hours yet he could still see them just as joshua cristies rank tobacco lingered as another reminder he had explained the main points of unrivalleds orders in three days time unless otherwise instructed she would proceed to sea to carry despatches of importance to gibraltar then return to plymouth with the latest intelligence for lord exmouth himself unrivalleds captain was commanded to act upon these orders with all despatch and at no time deviate from them exmouth was an admiral but he was still a frigate captain at heart and knew better than most of the temptations which might intervene with loosely worded orders unrivalled was quiet now during the first dogwatch the hands in their messes the young gentlemen and boys under instruction adam had listened to his own voice as he had stressed the need for extra care the final testing of standing and running rigging galbraith and partridge would deal with that powder and shot he had seen old stranace nod his experience of many years priceless in a campaign which might well explode into a fullscale war lie had been aware of some surprise when he had emphasized the importance of provisioning the ship to her full capacity especially with fresh fruit and vegetables tregillis the purser had met his gaze without expression he more than anyone would know how easy it was to barter with traders at a better rate if the goods were overripe before they were even stowed away it would do no harm for him to be aware of his captains interest there had been only a few questions most referring to a particular officers duties or part of ship only lieutenant varlo had broken the pattern if we are indeed to confront the dey of algiers to stamp out his capture and enslavement of innocent christians why do we require a fleet to carry out the necessary measures commodore turnbull has only a handful of wornout brigs to end the trade in africa as we have seen for ourselves cristie had intervened bluntly cause there are too many people making money out of africa mister varlo lieutenant bellairs had raised a question about the prospect of promotion for some of the new hands and varlos comment had remained in the air but it had not gone away he walked to his desk and unlocked a drawer his personal log book was still open but the ink was dry he wondered who would ever read it almost cautiously he turned back the pages and lifted the yellow rose to hold it to the light it would not last even if carefully pressed but in his mind he could see it exactly as she had given it to him the one he had worn for the benefit of sir gregory montagus darting brushes it was past there was only the next horizon and the next he closed the drawer and locked it it would be better if they could leave put to sea right now no matter what the mission entailed three more days he thought he heard young napier tidying things in the small pantry how did he feel about leaving again it had all been so new so different young matthew allowing him to share the box on the carriage and teaching him to ride the new pony jupiter being spoiled by grace ferguson and cheered by the stable lads when he had fallen from his mount and struggled up again adam had been unable to look at yovell as he had dictated the last of his letters and instructions should i be unable to act on this request through death or disablement the youth david napier shall be discharged at the expense of my estate and taken into care by those listed at falmouth yovell had placed the document with the other letters for his signature and had said nothing adam thought of his return to the house riding beside but separated from the darkeyed girl and the recall unexpected and yet in some strange way inevitable the boy napier wiping his eyes with his hand so unwilling to leave the first real home he had ever known yet determined proud even to stay with his captain we all need somebody he glanced at the old sword on its rack remembering the church in falmouth the first bolitho to wear this sword and the last lie returned to the quarter gallery and stared at the hazy outthrust of land lie knew nothing about her might never see her again and even if i did ile swung away seeking anger to offer an escape but all he could see was her face uplifted in that old church asking telling pleading feet thumped overhead and he heard someone laugh galbraith would be here shortly corporal bloxhams welldeserved promotion had been sanctioned a sergeant in the royal marines was a big step up the ladder and in a crowded hull like this it was an event one to be celebrated the man who had saved his life that day when martinez had paid with his own he reached for his coat the captain would share a wet with the new sergeant in his mess fie looked at the locked drawer but saw the rose in her hand there was a tap at the door ile was ready it was not a dream coming to terms the rugged stretch of parkland which ran down to the river thames to mark the winding curve of chiswick reach was deserted there were usually young riders exercising their skills here as it was considered safe at least during the daylight it was july and yet the wind off the river seemed cool and strong enough to ruffle the bushes the sky was almost hidden by cloud the smart landau in its dark blue livery stood alone the matching greys resting now shaking their harness after a lively trot across the park catherine lady somervell tugged the strap and lowered one of the windows tasting the air the nearness of the river even though it was not visible from this place this place she felt a shiver run through her why was it guilt excitement she stared across the park but only saw her own reflection in the glass it was speckled with rain too she shivered again there were two leafless trees standing apart from all the others they had died long ago but something or someone had decreed they should remain it was said that they marked the last rendezvous for many duellists over the years pistol or blade for officers from the nearby garrison falling out over women or cards or in a momentary fit of ill humour it often ended here her fingers tightened around the strap her husband had been killed in a duel someone else she had never regarded him as a husband she heard the carriage creak as the coachman shifted his position on the box ready for anything one of sillitoes men most of whom looked more like prizefighters than servants he had not asked where she was going or why he would know it was his way and she had become used to it like this finely sprung carriage unmarked unlike his others with the arms of baron sillitoe of chiswick the one he sometimes used for private business meetings she shook herself as if to drive it away she had stopped questioning him she looked at her reflection again the beautiful catherine who had won the hearts of the nation and had been their heros lover who had spurned the hostility and envy of society she touched a lock of the dark hair at her brow until that man had fallen in battle and her world had ended she turned her thoughts aside as a swordsman might parry a blade and focused on sillitoe powerful respected and feared the man who had used his influence to keep her from richard and had never denied it and yet he had been the rock which had saved her from what she still did not know she could sometimes even consider the horror of the night when she had returned unescorted to her little chelsea house on the walk she would have been raped but for sillitoe bursting into the room where she had never slept again without remembering now she lived in sillitoes house which lay just around this sweeping bend of the thames and had accompanied him to spain on the excuse that she might help with his business affairs as she spoke good spanish or was the truth more simple like the word whore carved on the door of the chelsea house because she needed him now more than ever she often thought of her last visit to cornwall her talks with richards sister nancy at first she had been tempted to return to falmouth and to live in the old house he had made into a home for her she was after all used to spite and cruel gossip it would have taken time but they would have accepted her she knew even that was a lie nancy had said envy and guilt walk hand in hand she would know better than anyone and adam and his letters which she had left unanswered what else could she have done she suspected that adam knew as well as she what disaster would have resulted intentional or otherwise the house by the river was almost spartan when compared with the mansions of other men of influence and it would soon be empty with only the servants to care for it and memories she could only imagine like the portrait alone on that wide landing of sillitoes father who had founded an empire upon slavery there had been pride in sillitoes voice when he had spoken of him he might be thinking very differently now rarely a day had passed when the issue of slavery did not appear in the newssheets and now algiers again she controlled her breathing richard would have lived but for those ships at algiers napoleon had landed in france after his escape from elba it had been inevitable she thought suddenly of the man who was meeting her today now viceadmiral sir graham bethune a rising star in the admiralty but still young and alive he should have relieved richard in the mediterranean she had heard her lover say it so often time and distance wind and tide a few days sooner and he would have been replaced safe she heard the coachman shift again the click of metal as he loosened the weapon he always carried something like a club but it could change at the twist of a wrist to a footlong stiletto comin m lady she dabbed her eyes and looked again a solitary horseman approaching at a loose canter unhurried watchful she realised that it was the first time she had seen bethune out of uniform it was easy to recall her private visits to his office at the admiralty up the back stairs he had always called it she watched him wheel round towards the carriage another one who had done little to hide his feelings for her the youngest viceadmiral since nelson with a brilliant career ahead and a wife and two children to support his endeavours he was taking a risk simply by meeting her today she had never forgotten the savage cartoons herself naked and shedding tears while looking out at the assembled fleet the caption who will be next had roused sillitoes fury more than anything she had seen he was usually too clever to show emotion william called down this im m lady no chances or he would answer for it bethune swung down from his horse and doffed his hat she said come in and moved along the seat richard had always spoken warmly of him bethune had been a mere midshipman in the sparrow his first command and he had never lost that youthful look bethune was studying her he said we can always meet here when you need to see me it is secure enough she said it was good of you to come it was not so easy after all they were like strangers but it was safer this way i have something for adam she groped in her shawl knowing that he was watching her as she had seen him do in the past he had never forgotten that it had been he who had allowed her to return alone to chelsea when the nightmare had been waiting for her he had blamed himself and his wife for conspiring with belinda on that same night she said it is richards nile medal i think adam should have it she knew bethune was about to protest richard gave it to me at malta that last time she faltered and tried again i think he knew then that he was going to die adam must have it it will help him his hands closed around hers to cradle the little package i will attend to it unrivalled will be at sea but i can make arrangements the grip remained firmly on her hands you are looking wonderful catherine i think about you constantly he attempted to smile the midshipman again i did think that you might have married he hesitated forgive me i had no right she released her hands and smiled at him for the first time i lost my way and what of you graham their lordships are very demanding at times he seemed to come to a decision i have been hearing a great deal of sillitoes involvement with the slave trade i am certain that he is in no way a party to the continuation of such illegal dealings but his other connections may bring criticism the prince regent as you may know has discontinued his seals of office some people are quick to forget past favours she nodded she did not know about the prince regent he had already revoked sillitoes appointment as inspector general because of rumour because of me bethune cocked his head to listen to a church clock somewhere i have heard that lord sillitoe intends to visit the west indies some of his old interests he took her hands again and this time he did not release them i would ask that you do not accompany him i would feel safer if you remained in england he looked at her openly in london where i might see you do not seek trouble for yourself i beg you catherine she felt him touch her face her hair and she was suddenly ashamed is this what i have become the door opened and closed and bethune was looking up at her again he said quietly remember i am always ready always at your call but you know that she watched him swing easily into the saddle my own age younger she wanted to laugh or cry back to the house please william the river came into view a few coloured sails on the grey water but all she saw was the door whore unis allday walked slowly across the inn yard and felt the sunshine hot across her neck and bare arms she enjoyed it even after the heat of the kitchen and the baked bread fresh from the oven it was afternoon in some ways the best time of the day she thought she looked at the front of the inn freshly painted and welcoming a place to he proud of she waved to a passing rider one of the estate keepers and received a greeting in return they all knew her now but nobody took liberties with her if they did it would only he once small though she was even the inn sign had been repainted the old hyperion under full sail to strangers passing through fallowfield on the fringe of the ilelford river it might be just another name for a local inn but not to unis or the man she had married here hyperion was a real ship and had taken one husband from her in battle and given her another john aliday she could smell the paint the two additional rooms for guests were almost finished the new road nearby would bring coaches and more trade they had done well despite or perhaps because of the struggle at the beginning at noon it had been busy with men in from working on the road and they were young men proof that the war was truly over men who could walk free without fear of a pressgang or the misery of returning home crippled and unwanted she thought of her brother the other john who had lost a leg fighting in the line with the old thirtyfirst now at least he would talk about it instead of looking upon his injury as some kind of personal failure without him she would never have managed to build the inn into a successful even prosperous business she heard the clatter of glasses and guessed it was tom ozzard our latest recruit john had called him another link a veteran from that other world she could only imagine sir richard bolithos servant who had been with him until the day he had been killed out of nowhere ozzard had appeared here in fallowfield more like a fugitive than a survivor a man haunted and hunted by something and she knew that but for johns sake she would never have considered offering him a roof and work which he understood despite his dour and sometimes hostile manner he had proved his worth with wine and with some of the more demanding customers auctioneers and traders in particular an educated man he had made the inns bookkeeping and accounts seem simple but he never shared a confidence and she sensed that even her john knew little about him beyond that world they had shared at sea she saw a shadow pass the parlour door it was nessa tall darkhaired and rarely smiling but she would turn the head of any real man her brother john for instance but it was hard to know if there was anything between them turned out by her parents because she had conceived and lost a child by a soldier from the truro garrison nessa had become part of the family here and had rejected the past and she was so good with little kate necessary at a busy inn when you needed six pairs of eyes at once the old hyperion was doing well and would do even better she paused one hand on the wall the bricks almost as hot as new bread so why was she worried she thought of the big shaggy some might say ungainly man who had burst into her life rough but respected as a true seaman and sir richards friend john allday had won her heart he had come ashore now he had done far more than his duty but he was still not over it when he made his trips to falmouth she knew he would be watching the ships coming or going it was always the same trying to hold on to remain a part of it she considered his last visit to falmouth when he had met captain adam bolitho she had been painfully aware of his uncertainty his misgivings as he had tried to decide whether he should go back to the old house he had once called his home when he was not at sea with sir richard she had heard bryan ferguson say that sir richard and her john were like master and loyal dog each afraid of losing the other perhaps that was so she clenched her fists she would allow no harm to come to him now she had asked john how he had found captain adam lie had thought about it his chin in the big awkward hands which could be so loving and so gentle in their private world he had said like his uncle a good and caring captain to all accounts but stands alone shouldnt be like that as if he felt somehow responsible she entered the parlour so familiar now the shining copper and pewter the lines of tankards and the mingled smells of food flowers and people in the place of honour was the beautiful model of the old hyperion exact in every detail and scale and made by those same big scarred hands but it had been moved something forbidden to everybody except she walked into the next room the one with the fine view of a long line of evenly matched trees when the light was right you could see the river like molten silver beyond them john allday was sitting at the table his face deep in thought as he studied the canvas roll of tools blades and strips of bone arranged in front of him like many sailors he could take on most jobs he could make furniture like the beautiful cot he had fashioned for little kate and the chest he had built for the lieutenant named george avery who had become so much a part of uniss life because allday was illiterate avery had written his letters to her and had read her letters to him it would have been a rare and wonderful relationship in any walk of life let alone aboard a manofwar now the quiet almost shy avery was gone one more name on the roll of honour for king and country what is it john she put her arm around his massive shoulders sir richard had called him my oak but she could feel his slow careful breath ing even now the terrible wound in the chest left by a spanish sword at a place no one could remember and it was getting worse but he had always insisted he could manage when sir richard had needed him now i need you dearest john when i gets time on my hands he did not look up at her i gets to thinking another model mebbee she hugged him youre always busy make some of the youngsters sit up an take notice i can tell you he sighed you knows me love im not one for passing time with the old jacks swinging the lamp with every tankard of ale your brothers got the right idea puts em in their place he looked round wheres kate resting nessall keep an eye on her she remembered his dismay when the child had turned away from him when they had met for the first time on his return from sea to her he must have seemed like a stranger an interloper but he had won her over in his own patient fashion he could even pick her up and play with her now without fear of damaging her in some way and unis loved him for it allday said suddenly i meant to ask about young elizabeth sir richards daughtershell be growing up now right enough i wonder what the king of cornwall thinks about having her in his great house she hugged him again and said nothing sir lewis roxby had died back when lady catherine was still living at the bolitho house she said youre going to make a model of the frobisher and bit her lip to steady herself well have to find a real special place for that then allday did look at her his eyes very clear the frown gone i shall give it to capn adam from both of us afterwards alone in their room she wondered who did he really mean nancy lady roxhy saw the rambling old building swing into view as the carriage swayed over the rutted track it was an open vehicle and she could feel the dust gritting between her teeth but she liked it this way always had since she was a small girl the younger daughter of captain james bolitho she often thought about her father the man she sometimes felt that the one she knew existed only in the portrait at the bolitho house while his character and upbringing were like entries in a diary or history book go straight in francis i doubt this will take long the shadow of the old glebe house rose above her as always grim and unwelcoming ideal perhaps for an artist and a recluse but few others she felt a twinge of excitement and rebuked herself roxby would have called her too curious for her own good she smiled sadly but he would have loved her for it the dark windows were blind to the outside world the ruined chapel adding to the air of mystery gossip more likely this place was well known for its tales of witchcraft and evil spirits the coachman said doubtfully i dont think we are expected m lady he had not been with her very long otherwise he would have known about her impulses she heard roxby again damn impudence more like the sky was bright and clear without even a wisp of cloud over the hills or the sea beyond adam would be out there now somewhere doing what he had always wanted and dreamed about she thought of his face so near when she had last spoken to him and then had pressed his cheek against her own doing what be wanted and believed in but this time had been different as if he was leaving something behind she said impatiently get down and knock on the door francis she saw the horse shaking its ears irritated by the buzzing insects she could remember a time when she would have ridden here herself and across country if the mood took her it was wrong to look back too often perhaps because since roxby had died there had been so little joy and nothing to anticipate so many things had changed like young elizabeth who had been so surprised at the way local children lived and played how could it be that she had been so sheltered from an endless war which had threatened every mile of this coastline she thought of the girls mother belinda and tried once again to come to terms with it she heard voices francis tall and ramrodstraight like the soldier he had been until a year ago and the servant she had met on her previous visit when she had called to arrange for the portrait she climbed down and grimaced a little her breathing was fast just to remind me on her next birthday she would be fiftyseven years old people told her to settle down and enjoy these years she was secure and had two fine children and now two grandchildren she should be more than satisfied she grimaced again she was not francis called he says that his master is not here m lady he will gladly take a message it was as if the servant was invisible perhaps they were like that in the cavalry she said it is about my nephews portrait even that made her sound ancient in captain bolithos absence i thought i should enquire may i be of any help my lady nancy turned in the direction of the voice thank you my dear have we met before the girl looked towards the house as if regretting her first impulse but she said i am lowenna i am staying here nancy took a deep breath and stepped into cool shadows in her heart she had hoped for this meeting with one who until now had been little more than a name an occasional visitor to these parts and then only in the company of sir gregory montagu she followed her along the deserted passageway conscious of her poise her apparent confidence she remembered her vaguely as a child it was coming back to her like her fathers history like fragments from the pages of a diary she had been born in bodmin where the family name had been garland a successful arrangement they had said at the time between a promising scholar soon to be appointed to a prestigious college in winchester and the daughter of a bodmin corn chandler nancy saw the girl pause as if to ensure that she was still following she saw the date in her mind around when news had reached her of richards fever in the great south sea he had been in command of the frigate tempest allday had been with him even then we may talk in here if you wish very composed and in the filtered sunlight quietly beautiful a woman then aged about twentysix or twentyseven nancy glanced around the room untidy but she was aware of the order of things in this a painters domain a place wherein he could work leave for a week or a month if he chose and know that it would be exactly how he wanted it when he returned she often spent her spare time painting flowers or scenes on the shore and she had been moved by elizabeth s readiness to copy her it had been their first real point of contact she observed the girl dressed in a pale blue robe without any sort of decoration or even a belt loose and airy she had already noted the long hair and the easy way she walked but now that she was facing her she was more aware of her eyes so dark that they concealed her thoughts like a barrier between them lowenna said the portrait is over here sir gregory is pleased with it i think nancy waited as she uncovered the canvas she even did that with a graceful unhurried movement she knew she sat for montagu perhaps that was it poise she studied the unfinished portrait unbelievable that one man could possess such a great talent it was adam to the life the way he held his head when listening or answering a question the dark eyes like the eyes of the girl she knew was watching her instead of the painting there was an uncompleted yellow rose in adams coat and she almost mentioned it but some deeper sense seemed to warn her that this tenuous contact would be broken instantly and adams small elusive smile montagu had caught it precisely no wonder he could turn any womans head and break his own heart she said it is exactly right how i think of him when hes away which is too often these days she turned and saw the astonishment which for only a second had broken through the girls composure lowenna said quietly i had not realised that we were so close nancy looked at the portrait again the flood of memories pushing aside all reserve he came to me when his mother died he had walked all the way from penzance he was only a boy she nodded slowly without knowing she had done so came to me thank you for telling me so simply said like a very young girl again will you be staying here long lowenna she shook her head the sunlight touching her hair like fine gold i dont know i may be going back to london sir gregory has several paintings to finish she glanced at the portrait again almost shyly as if she were testing something but he will complete this first nancy walked to a window seeing the harp and the stool beside it then she saw the other unfinished painting the naked girl chained to a rock the sea monster about to break surface beside her she looked at her again defensive or defiant the dark eyes gave nothing away she said softly you are very beautiful it is not what it may appear my lady i am far older than you she shrugged unfortunately i have been in love twice in my life i know how it feels she made to hold out her hand but instinct prevented her i also know how it looks i care deeply for my nephew perhaps dare i say it more than a son he is brave loyal and compassionate and he has suffered she saw the words reaching her as i believe you have who said that of me nobody i am still a woman still young at heart she tried not to listen to the sound of carriage wheels montagu was back but it would make no difference who it was she made up her mind you see i believe my nephew has lost his heart to you it is why i came here today she walked towards the door now that i have met you i am glad i came she turned one hand on the door if you feel the need lowenna come to me she did not move but the hostility was gone she said as adam came it was the first time she had used his name then nancy did reach out and take her wrist as a friend if you like she felt that in another moment the girl would have pulled away she said calmly a friend then my lady along the same bleak passageway and the bright square of sunshine through the opened doors it was not montagu but a man she recognised from a wine merchants in falmouth he touched his hat and beamed at her tes a fine day m lady summer at last mebbee nancy looked back at the pale blue figure by the stairway yes mr cuppage it is a fine day she raised one hand to the girl and added now it is she walked out into the dusty air again afraid to stop and consider even to look back francis and a stable boy were by the horse the dourfaced servant had disappeared she might have imagined all of it she thought of adam and his ship under orders again after so brief a respite it was his life and she was a sailors daughter and the sister of englands naval hero she took francis arm and pulled herself up into the carriage before glancing back at the house but now i am adams aunt she saw a brief movement by a window pale blue where she had seen the harp and the other painting she said aloud there is nobody else as the carriage moved away she imagined she heard roxby laugh rearadmiral thomas herrick got up from the chair and walked to a nearby window he could not remember how many times he had done so or how long he had been here he stared down at the familiar scene the unending parade of carriages mostly open to the watery sunshine a few bright parasols and the widebrimmed hats of ladies being driven from one form of amusement to another a troop of dragoons trotting past a young helmeted cornet turning in his saddle as a straightbacked man stepped from the crowd to raise his hat to the colours at the head of the troop he had only one arm herrick turned away angry with himself unable to ignore or forget the raw pain in the stump of his own arm even at the slightest movement and all the more so in his heavy dress coat he sat again and stared at the opposite wall and two paintings of sea fights colours flying swirling gunsmoke the enemys canvas riddled with shotholes but they never showed the blood the dead men and the pieces of men he studied the polished marble the neat array of gilded chairs it must take the equivalent of a watch of seamen to maintain this great vault of a building he grunted and eased the shoulder of his coat beneath the heavy bullion epaulette whose presence could still surprise him this was the admiralty where their lordships and an army of staff officers controlled the strands of the web connecting them to every squadron every ship and every captain on every ocean where their flag flew almost unchallenged and after this ile thought of the lodgings he was using close to vauxhall not fashionable especially for a flag officer but comfortable enough and cheap he had never been careless with his hardearned money ile had come up the hard way and was well aware of the navys habit of reversing a mans fortunes along with his destiny he had been at the admiralty the whole forenoon going over the charts and reports of the antislavery patrols with the admiral concerned and he knew men well enough to understand that the admiral pleasant though he was had not the least idea what freetown and the appalling conditions of slavery entailed perhaps it was better safer that way there would be more discussions tomorrow a member of parliament on the interested committee would also be there herrick had explained in his reports and face to face that they needed ten times the number of agile patrol vessels and a diligent leadership in direct command before any real results would be manifest money was always the objection there was none to spare for an overall increase and yet herrick had been hearing nothing else since he had arrived in london but the rumour of a massive show of force against the algerine pirates and the dey who had persisted in defying all attempts to unseat him this time it would be no less than a fleet and under the command of pellew himself herrick could not be bothered with the frills and fancies of grand titles pellew was good enough for him there did not seem to be much in the way of secrecy even the times had hinted at a determined intervention to free the christian slaves who languished in the deys prisons and now this had happened a messenger had caught him just as he had been about to leave the building he had been requested to present himself to viceadmiral sir graham bethune the newly appointed deputy and no stranger to the lords of admiralty he had no thoughts on bethune as a senior officer i was richards first lieutenant a year after bethune was one of his midshipmen now he outranks me he had grown used to such distinctions he did not have to like them he found that he was at the window again perhaps adam bolitho had told a superior officer maybe keen what he had divulged about sillitoe and his part in the slave trade no adam might be hotheaded even indiscreet but he would not violate something as strong as personal trust he watched a smart carriage passing among some market vehicles saw the woman who sat alone her face shaded by a broadbrimmed hat it could have been richards mistress that woman why had he told adam bolitho concern or was it guilt it had been adam who had brought the news to him that his own very dear dulcie had died just as herrick had once carried the tragic news of bolithos young wifes death he stared with something like hatred at the garishly painted battles the roots and memories were stronger than many believed he heard unhurried footsteps approaching and braced himself perhaps it was a mistake or bethune had taken another appointment sir graham bethune can see you now sir herrick stood up and winced as the heavy dress coat dragged at his stump so damned typical of this place can see you now as if it was a favour he knew he was being unreasonable and blamed his pain for it he hated the way people stared or clucked sympathetically when they met him i ic could recall a surgeon suggesting that he should wear ostrich quills on his coat to steer people away from jostling or reopening the wound he could even hear himself afraid of war are they or of what it does to those who have to fight it if dulcie had been alive ile saw the doors swing inward and bethune waiting to greet him standing his arm outstretched his left arm to match his own good to see you thomas i lis handshake was firm his paten still that of a sailor seat yourself therell be some wine in a moment but we are served by snails in this cathedral herrick sat down taking time to adjust himself in the chair like someone searching for a trap then he looked directly at bethune he had always prided himself in being honest and open with others and grudgingly he recognised those qualities in bethune something which the viceadmirals lace and the grand office could not hide bethune said i saw your reports i was particularly interested in your views on freetown and the windward coasti have said as much to the first lord you should get the credit you deserve i suspect you may he requested to return to that or some other aspect of the slave trade but i dont suppose youll mind about that it was not a question herrick almost smiled requested a term they used when you had attained flag rank it still meant that you had no choice in the matter bethune strode to a window and opened it admitting the ceaseless din of ironshod wheels and the clatter of many horses london on the move never at rest herrick watched him he too was restless full of energy still a young man like the one who had commanded that fine frigate depicted in this rooms only painting bethune went on i especially liked your report on captain tyacke another officer who might well have gone unnoticed passed over but for someone caring enough to act herrick clenched his remaining fist as if tyacke were also in this room listening to the street watching the dragoons like the man in the crowd he said without hesitation sir richard did as much for me sir graham bethune nodded satisfied perhaps you served with him at the nile herrick rubbed the arm of his chair this was not what he had expected yes in lysander i was sir richards flag captain then bethune turned from the window herrick would say no more but it was enough tyacke was at the nile also where he was so cruelly wounded a servant entered and began to place glasses on a tiny square of cloth more like a woman than a grown man herrick thought for a moment he thought he had misheard as bethune dismissed the servant and repeated lady somervell i saw her here in london he glanced over at him this is rhenishi hope it will suit it should be cool although after its journey up those stairs one can only hope and laughed completely relaxed or was he herrick said it is some time since i saw her it was in falmouth when i was intending to take up an appointment with the revenue service bethune critically examined a glass he knew about that and thought he knew why keen had intervened not all grudges faded with the years he said a brave and lovely woman i admire her greatly ile thought of the nile medal she had entrusted to him another link but it had always been there he suspected that she knew how he felt he tried to shut it from his mind and said i think that baron sillitoe may become more involved with his business affairs in the west indies even cuba herrick stiffened cuba still the worlds clearing house for slaves bethune said we must put all past disagreement aside the fleet is committed to the algiers venture as it is elsewhere where the trade flourishes you know this and i know it i would take it as a great favour if you would pass on to me what you may hear about said involvement so that the innocent can be protected he raised his glass very slowly until their eyes met herrick swallowed if the hock was warm or icecold he did not notice it i understand sir graham it was utter madness and if anything went wrong bethune would deny any association he watched bethunes tanned hand refilling the glasses when dulcie had died of typhus lady somervell he hesitated even over her name catherine had stood by her the only one to the end she could so easily have been infected by the fever herself but she had stayed it shall be done their glasses touched committed then and thomas herrick was suddenly alive again restored tomorrow he might regret it he smiled quite openly but that was tomorrow sudden death james bellairs unrivalleds young third lieutenant touched his hat and said i relieve you sir eight bells had just rung out from the forecastle the first watch was about to begin lieutenant varlo saw his own men hurrying away to their various messes and remarked if you are certain you can manage til the hour of midnight bellairs watched him walk to the companionway and tried not to dislike him a competent officer but never without the lastminute jibe the sarcastic quip at someone elses expense one of bellairs watch had been adrift when the hands had mustered aft he had fallen and injured his wrist varlo had remarked shall we rouse out the masteratarms to find him eh he allowed his anger to settle it was not in his nature and anyway he spread his arms and stared along the length of the ship already in deep shadow with an incredible orange glow to starboard as the sun dipped towards the horizon to larboard it was lost in a purple haze you could sense the nearness of land he put varlo from his mind and smiled not so near lisbon lay about sixty miles abeam according to the last calculation he listened to the creak and hum of taut rigging as unrivalled leaned more steeply on the larboard tack every watch brought him fresh confidence like the sounds which had once made him uneasy but usually unwilling to call for advice from a lieutenant now he was a lieutenant himself and those years as a young gentleman seemed a lifetime ago he glanced at the cabin skylight there was a glow there brighter than usual the captain going over his orders again was he ever unsure he wondered with nobody to advise him he walked to the compass the two helmsmen watching him as he passed soon it would be too dark to recognise faces but it no longer mattered he felt that he knew every man in the ship even the had ones he grinned especially the had ones he thought of plymouth now five days astern a smooth if lively passage so far skirting the bay and its foul moods they had been out of sight of cape finisterre except from the masthead when they had changed tack yet again to steer southwest by south and follow the coast of portugal standing well out to sea perhaps to avoid rumour or suspicion lie had heard the older hands joking about it that everybody in the whole world would know more than unrivalleds people he peered at the compass card southsouthwest two more days maybe less and they would he beneath the rocks great shadow his thoughts returned to plymouth his parents and sister had come to see him to present him with the new sword they had purchased to mark his commission he looked again at the skylight before that he had worn a curved hanger which belonged to captain bolitho galbraith had remarked i cant say ive heard of anv other captain doing that he allowed his mind to return to the girl named jane who had also been there a friend of his sisters a ready smile and dancing violet eyes they had got on well together encouraged he realised by his sister she was of a good family so what prospects could he offer as a lowly luff but she lived at dartmouth which was not that far from plymouth when unrivalled returned after completing this mission he might be able to see her again capns comin up sir thank you tucker he had learned well the risk of trying to be popular or showing favouritism to this man or that all the same he could not imagine anyone warning varlo if the captain was on the move he saw one of the helmsmen turn his head to make sure the windvane was in position it got dark very suddenly hereabouts bellairs waited near the wheel while the captain walked to the compass and the log which was protected by a canvas hood he had probably already been in the chartroom to make his own estimate of their progress he made it seem so effortless even when he stared up into the black tangle of rigging and the trimmed angle of each yard it was as if he already knew when they had been in action it had been impossible to register every act or injury only afterwards when your heart and breathing steadied could you realise what you had done and those who had not come through it bellairs could recall the captains part in it his apparent disregard for both danger and the nearness of sudden death or far worse a lingering despair in the agony of the surgeons knife he straightened up as bolitho said holding her course and progress well mr bellairs he tapped the pale planking with his shoe but shes feeling it with all that extra weight of stores and shot he turned away to watch a leaping fish bright gold in the sunset well be needing all of it i daresay he could have been talking to the ship adam could feel bellairs watching him it was strange when he had been a lieutenant he had never considered his captains young in thought and heart except his uncle they had sometimes been mistaken for brothers he would know nothing until he was in gibraltar the prospects of battle might all have blown away by then it happened often enough but until then he thought of his carefully worded orders nothing which any captain could misinterpret if an opportunity offered itself lord exmouth had been a great frigate captain he would know every trick in the hook like the vessel they had sighted two days back after they had weathered cape finisterre he had sent sullivan aloft and had then joined him with a telescope as if something had driven him a large ship a barque as far as they could tell there had been a stiff wind and a lot of spray which made proper recognition almost impossible but they had seen her again and she had immediately changed tack her sails like pink shells in the dawn light to avoid unrivalleds closer scrutiny cristie had suggested that she might be standing closer inshore and heading for vigo it made sense but adam could not shift it from his mind there were hundreds of ships in these waters probably the busiest seaway in the world and some of them would be barques in any case his orders were clear blunt he said i hear you had the good fortune to meet a young lady during our stay in plymouth he was aware of bellairs confusion had it been full daylight he might have been blushing this is a small ship remember bellairs said a friend of my sisters sir he faltered she cannot yet be seventeen i see adam walked to the rail and stared down at the boat tier bellairs was just nineteen whereas i he stopped it there they were at sea it was all that counted he said time will pass quickly you will know if your feelings are strong enough to endure the life we follow he took two paces away angry that he should or could offer advice he said i note from the log that there are two men for punishment tomorrow like cutting a cord safe in their ordered world yes sir one for drunkenness it was now too dark to see his expression but adam knew he was frowning craigie the other one is lucas maintopman he threatened a warrant officer no hesitation this time mr midshipman sandell i shall speak with the first lieutenant directly i am not pleased about this he sighed and it would be another two years before sandell could even be considered for promotion to lieutenant what luke jago would call the rotten apple he had heard his uncle say that it only needed one he said suddenly we shall alter course two points mr bellairs i fear the wind is backing a little he halflistened to the rush of feet the shrill of calls as more men ran to braces and halliards it might give an extra knot at least it would keep his mind from her face her body framed against the soiled canvas the imaginary rock her eyes so dark defiant challenging him so different from the girl in the church her pleasure over the rose which would be in that portrait he touched his empty belt and the sword steer souwest helm alee there the squeal of blocks men hauling on snaking lines and halliards before they could fling a sailor off his feet even the new hands were working like veterans adam crossed to the empty nettings and waited for the deck to sway upright again still faintly he could see the beautiful figureheads naked shoulders showing only for a moment through the gloom while unrivalleds stem ploughed into a deeper trough in a welter of bursting spray like the girl on the rock helpless and in need iie heard bellairs say something and then laugh somehow carefree despite the chorus of sea and thrashing canvas steady she goes sir souwest full an bye adam raised one hand to bellairs and walked to the companionway the first watch could settle down without its lord and master overseeing every move i ic went down the ladder feeling the ship closing around him the marine sentry his figure angled effortlessly against the deck stiffened as he passed and napier had the screen door open as if he had been listening for his step on the ladder everything as it should be and a weighteddown pile of letters and orders in yovells round hand awaiting his signature he stared at the sloping stern windows one side in darkness spray dappling the thick glass like spectres the other tinged with dull copper the last of the sun on the western horizon the whole ocean and yet he was hound by his orders tied to the fleets apron strings napier asked may i bring your meal sir adam stared at him and was touched by his concern ile knew what it must have done to him to be so well received in falmouth as if he was one of the family not too much david ill have some cognac while i sign that little mountain lie saw the boy smile and hurry away to the pantry why was it so easy to help others when you were helpless to rally your own sp irits tomorrow things might seem different the final approach to gibraltar the formalities the new orders if any bellairs would he thinking of the girl he had met in plymouth napier might still be remembering the excitement and laughter over his first ride on the new pony the hands had piped down now and the ship was unusually silent overhead the watchkeepers took note of the course and behaviour of the wind and in the wardroom there might still he a few lively enough for a game of cards or the unfinished letter to a wife or lover somewhere he yawned and sipped at the goblet napier had put by his side before returning just as silently to the pantry feet pale against the checkered deck covering and tomorrow he would speak with galbraith about the punishment book but he looked at the desk and pictured the rose pressed in the small log it was little enough he watched napier arranging the table for him a plate rattling suddenly in time with the rudder as the keel sliced into another long trough he moved to another chair and regarded the neatly laid table being captain kept you apart from the ships routine watchkeeping and everyday work on hull and rigging it also left you without an ordered programme of eating and sleeping the carefully prepared meal consisted of slices of fat pork fried pale brown with bread crumbs that must be the last of the loaves he thought ironhard biscuit from now on until the next time and there was a bottle of red wine he looked at napier and smiled you do a good deal for me david with precious little thanks the boy poured some wine frowning slightly as he usually did he said simply its what i want sir he walked back to the pantry and adam noticed that he was limping again not much but he would mention it to the surgeon later when napier came to clear the table he found the captain in the one deep chair legs outthrust and fast asleep he carried the tray to the pantry again pausing occasionally to allow for the decks erratic movements then he closed the shutter on one of the lanterns and stood beside the chair again uncertain but characteristically determined using two fingers he loosened the captains neckcloth holding his breath waiting for the motion to settle the captain opened his eyes wide and stared at him seizing his wrist holding it but saying nothing napier waited he knew that the captain was still asleep it was important that he should remain so he released his hand and backed away satisfied it was what he wanted when adam did awaken it took a few moments to recover his awareness the instinct of any sailor the feel and movement of his ship no matter what hour of day or night it might be too much cognac or that red wine which rasped on the tongue it was neither he had hardly slept since leaving plymouth and now he stared at the partly shuttered lantern and the empty table it was still dark but the sounds overhead were different he sat upright feeling his way it must be eight bells the morning watch was taking over he had been dreaming he touched his neckcloth in the dream she had been there with him he saw the figure darkly outlined against the white paintwork he pushed his fingers through his unruly hair and said you should have roused me man luke jago stood up and looked at him i wouldve i just thought i ought to come he was instantly wide awake like those other times so many of them like a foxs scent of danger even his voice was clear sharp what is it trouble jago turned his head and glanced at the shuttered skylight as if he could see the disruption in the order and discipline he said flatly mr sandells gone missin sir adam was on his feet are you sure his mind was reaching out like a beam of light a warning galbraith had had the middle watch he would not leave it for somebody else to act jago replied theyve searched the ship sir napier was here now a jug of water held ready adam wiped his face and neck with a wet cloth seeing it for himself sandell was in galbraiths watch the night was reasonably calm but for a steady wind an unemployed person could not come on deck without being seen by one of the watchkeepers an accident somebody would have seen that too he blinked as jago unshuttered the lantern it would be first light very soon the ship coming awake to a new day jago lifted a hand as someone shouted something the voice carried away by the wind he said theyve not found him sir adam looked at him nobody liked sandell some hated him he should never have been selected he could guess what jago thought about it he turned and faced the door hearing galbraiths familiar footsteps the responsibility as always lay here in this cabin he heard the sentry stamp his boots outside the screen door accept it then it was murder lieutenant galbraith strode aft his shoes sticking on the deck seams as the sun bore down on the anchored ship it had been a long and slow approach to the anchorage as if the rocks majestic presence defied the wind to intrude he squinted his eyes against the reflected glare at the other ships anchored nearby and the guardboat which had waited with tossed oars to mark their journeys end rolling evenly above its own image he looked at the fortifications and batteries which seemed like part of the rock itself a flag flapping listlessly above one of them there was a lot to do all boats would be lowered no matter how short their stay here to seal the sunbaked hulls the captain would expect windsails to be rigged to draw what air there was into the cramped quarters between decks galbraith had known captains who would never have contemplated it would have insisted that the ungainly canvas spoiled their ships appearance no matter what discomfort they averted but not this captain the gig was already being hoisted out over the starboard gangway jagos voice urging or threatening as required he saw lieutenant varlo speaking with i lastie the masteratarms arranging another search maybe the captain had told the second lieutenant to carry out a final investigation although it seemed unlikely that anything would he gained by it but galbraith could feel a difference in the ship and amongst the various sections of men he had come to know so well resentment suspicion it went deeper than these to many of them it would seem a betrayal of something personal and intimate that bond in any fighting ship which made each man look out for his friends sailors owned little enough and a thief if caught by his fellows would suffer a far harsher fate than that meted out by the articles of war and a man who would kill another in this ship was like something unclean midshipman sandell would not be missed but the threat would remain he saw the captain by the taffrail a telescope trained towards the main anchorage but unmoving as if he was unwilling to let it go galbraith touched his hat and waited ship secured sir the gig is being lowered now he followed bolithos telescope a little apart from the other vessels and larger than most of them they had seen her on the last two cables before the anchor had plummeted down and the cable had taken the strain a receivingship they called such vessels used mainly as temporary accommodation for officers and personnel on passage to other appointments mastless and with most of her upper deck covered by a protective awning her gun ports empty and opened to attract any offshore breeze she was another hulk the last time they had seen her she had worn an admirals flag at the mainmast truck was that only last year even now her gingerbread the ornate scrollwork about her stern and counter was still brightly gilded in the sunlight and her name frobisher was not to be forgotten least of all by the man at his side adam said is that all they could find for her leigh he closed the glass with a snap and looked directly at him i saw my uncles old coxswain when i went to falmouth he looked at the ship again but galbraith knew he was seeing something else i am only thankful that john allday is not here today to see this he seemed to pull himself out of it with a great effort and said i will be going ashore directly in the meantime perhaps mr tregillis will loosen his purse strings again and attempt to obtain some fresh bread the garrison will be the best chance ill deal with that sir he looked down surprised as bolithos hand gripped his arm what do you think happened to midshipman sandell lucas the maintopman accused of threatening him denies all knowledge sir and in any case he was in the care of the ships corporal in irons during that watch he added bitterly my watch adam released his grip and stared at the towering rock there was mist or low cloud around the summit cristie had said it might promise a wind for the return passage varlo seemed to be enjoying his investigation had even made a sketch showing where every man would or should have been stationed in what he had calculated was the last half hour of sandells life at the second eighteenpounder on the starboard side he had discovered that two halls were missing from the shot garland enough to carry a body swiftly down before the keel had had time to pass over it and up forward so close to the lively bow wave it would hardly make a sound sandell had had the makings of a tyrant given the opportunity but it could have been anybody you never spoke of it but it was always there when you realised that if the worst happened and you were sailing alone only the afterguard and the thin line of marines stood between a captain and mutiny he saw jago at the top of the ladder his dark features expressionless waiting i want both counts of punishment to be stood down one man was drunk and you know from experience that flogging has never yet cured a drunkard as for lucas he is a good hand remember how he saved two raw landmen from falling to the deck when we first commissioned a man of spirit and courage and ill not see him broken without proper evidence sandells people are quite important i believe sir adam was looking at the frobisher again they shall have the truth leigh when i know it he walked to the rail and joined his coxswain man the side attention on the upper deck rist masters mate stood with the others while the calls trilled and the captain went quickly down the side into his gig he said you reckon mr sandells gone to the sharks cristie overheard and said calmly if i was a shark id throw the little bastard right back at us rist forced a smile but turned away as the calls shrilled once more and work recommenced he thought about it again he had done little else since it had happened it would soon be forgotten and as everybody knew but would not say midshipman sandell with his arrogance and secretive cruelty was no loss to anyone think of it man the fleet was growing again you could see that for yourself at plymouth and here beneath the rock there were more craft than on their last visit the real cutting down was over for now anyway rist was not young but young enough for promotion if it was offered or fell his way to sailing master like old cristie or maybe to a command of his own no matter how small just given the time and the chance he watched the first lieutenant speaking to partridge the boatswain he liked and respected galbraith trusted him also he faced it for the hundredth time how long would that last if he revealed that he had witnessed the murder he had to go down to the chart room it was no use just going over it again he felt the fine new spyglass the youth ede had made for him put yourself first but it would not go away luke jago perched his buttocks against a massive stone bollard and picked his teeth with a piece of whalebone the stone was still warm and yet looking across the dark heaving water there were already lights showing on some of the ships like fireflies at his home in dover what he could still remember of it the gigs crew was close by where he could keep a weather eye open for some lastminute chancer although he had to admit they had become a fairly reliable boats crew he heard someone kicking stones into the water midshipman deighton doing his share on this duty a young gentleman and one day he would be a lieutenant and maybe another jumpedup slave driver but he had to admit that he liked him shared something which even his keen mind could not define or accept always ready to listen and learn never threw his weight about even with the most junior hands but it went deeper than that like the one most important thing which had brought them together the fact that jago had been there when deightons father had died shot down by one of his own men although nobody ever spoke of it not even the captain he thought of the missing midshipman sandell he smiled grimly sandell as he had always insisted nobody spoke much about that either deighton was affected by it although he had never liked the other midshipman it was like a presence moving between decks captain bolitho had been ashore for most of the day but had sent word by messenger that the gig would not be needed until now he watched the passing throng of people it was always the same at the rock it was funny when you thought about it a few years back and you could imagine the dons just over the water at algeiras waiting to spy on ships arriving and leaving here ready to send fast horsemen with the news where from or where hound the enemy now there were ships of a dozen flags at anchor here he could recall all too easily when there was only one flag the rest were the foe but they were not making much of a secret of their presence here he had heard the first lieutenant say as much to young bellairs why unrivalled any fast schooner or courier brig could have done it they did it every day somewhere or other he hid a smile in the dying sunlight two sailors from another vessel had looked at the gig and had asked what was their ship when he had told them one had exclaimed thats captain bolithos ship matey jago had been forced to give in to a feeling of pride which before would have been laughable neither of those two jacks had ever laid eyes on the captain but the name was enough deighton stood up and brushed his white trousers the captains coming jago pushed himself away from the bollard and spat the whalebone into the water must be getting old deighton had seen him first he could sense the impatience anger even as the captain stepped down into the nodding boat jago gauged the mood took a chance we sailin again sir he saw the upturned face the dark eyes framed by the hair the familiar cocked hat he had gone too far this time but adam said quietly we are so my friend in falmouth i heard of an errand boy who rose to be a rich and powerful man now you can see a captain who has become an errand boy the boats crew shifted on their thwarts sharing it some without understanding midshipman deighton rested one hand on the tiller to lean forward and listen so very different yet these two men had filled his life when he had believed himself to be alone he remembered the day he had met captain bolitho for the first time he had been sympathetic but not out of mere duty as his father would have reminded him like a friend someone who had understood what he was going through cast off bear off forrard his voice confident and strong as the gig pulled away into the lengthening shadows midshipman richard deighton would have changed roles with no one jago smiled and settled back to watch the regular rise and fall of the blades once he saw the captain turn to look at the big hulk he had seen on their arrival the last time had been when admiral lord rhodes had ordered unrivalled to stand fast to discontinue the chase of the renegade frigate and this captain had ignored the signal and together they had won the day but in his heart jago knew he was seeing the moored hulk and her empty gun ports as she had once been as his uncles flagship he saw him remove his hat and hold it against his breast and was surprised that it touched him so deeply and yet beyond even that he felt something else like a warning it was the scent of danger two days out of gibraltar unrivalled was heading north again after standing well clear of cape st vincent to find more sea room as was expected cristies prophecy about the wind had proved true within an hour of leaving the strait the rock had vanished into thick mist probably rain deeper inland and now closehauled on the starboard tack and leaning steeply into the wind despite her reefed topsails the frigate was constantly swept by a sea which thundered over her weather side making any movement on deck dangerous at first light the masthead had reported a sail directly to the north but with such poor visibility any recognition was pure guesswork while they reeled over fighting into a wind which at times seemed to be from directly abeam most of the hands especially the older ones were glad they were well clear of the land adam climbed to the quarterdeck as the forenoon watch relieved other soaked and exhausted seamen who under these conditions were unlikely to be offered anything to warm their insides before they were called once more to trim or reef the salthardened canvas but rum could work wonders he had even heard two of the relieved topmen sharing a joke as they groped their way below no doubt wondering what all the fuss and urgency had been about adam wondered also he had had a meeting with the captainincharge at gibraltar the acting flag officer was otherwise engaged being entertained aboard one of the visiting dutch ships how long would it take to accept this change of allegiance enemies becoming friends overnight the captain had told him that the information he had given to be carried in unrivalled would be useful and important to lord exmouth he had not said that it was vital nothing it seemed had changed several small vessels had been attacked by algerine pirates their crews taken as prisoners to the deys stronghold there had been other reports of innocent fishermen being slaughtered by turkish soldiers at bona a port adam had good cause to remember the documents and despatches were now locked in the strongbox to be guarded at all times the captainincharge had insisted he braced himself as his head and shoulders emerged from the companion his hair blowing unheeded as he waited for the deck to rear up again bellairs greeted him eyes reddened by the onslaught of wind and spray steady she goes sir nor by west adam gripped the rail feeling the ship plunge and rear again like a thoroughbred fighting a halter despite his weariness his regular visits to this windswept place of command he could still feel the old excitement the challenge man ship and ocean he stared along the upper deck aware of the sharply braced yards the spray pouring from the hardbellied canvas like icy pellets conscious that everything was in its proper place stays and running rigging taking the strain boats on their tier firmly secured with this sea it must have been a fight just to accomplish that he watched the water boil against the guns on the lee side saw crouched figures snatching at handholds until the miniature tidal wave had passed over them before running to the next task another repair to cordage and canvas deck there sail on the starboard how there must have been a momentary lull as the lookout yelled again two sail sir bellairs wiped his streaming face with his sleeve our two companions of yesterday sir perhaps adam peered up at the swaying topmasts trying to picture unrivalled as another lookout might see her whatever they were they were not running away or trying to avoid an encounter common enough when ships masters knew there was a manofwar about on their lawful occasions or not they had not forgotten the pressgangs either he thought of the dutch ships he had seen at gibraltar part of exmouths plan or was it mere coincidence he saw a man clambering up the main shrouds fingers and toes expertly hooked around the ratlines as the hull reeled over again so that he appeared to be hanging bodily above the leaping wave crests he saw the seaman turn and stare down at him it was lucas whom sandell had accused of threatening behaviour it was still hard to believe that an officer had gone missing they might never discover what had happened he tried to shut it out somebody knew lie glanced at the masthead again mr cousens take your glass and go aloft will you id value a second pair of eyes up there cousens grinned signals midshipman as bellairs had been such a short while ago and with luck the next one for the board for lieutenant he should do well he worked at his studies but had a reputation for practical jokes also he had a good head for heights woodthorpe the masters mate of the watch asked carefully d you think them ships want to speak with us sir adam watched the midshipman climbing steadily up the shrouds the signals telescope hanging across his shoulders like a small cannon we shall likely lose them soon he looked at the compass imagining the spread of sharkblue ocean which separated the vessels the bearing was the same as far as he could estimate in this unruly sea a converging tack then with the benefit of a wind under their coattails they should pass well ahead heading west deep into the atlantic deck there leading ship is a frigate sir some of the seamen on deck had stopped work to listen anything to break the aching monotony of hauling on ropes and hammering wedges into position adam moved a little apart from the others without looking he knew cristie had come on deck in a moment galbraith would appear they never had to be told he swallowed and tasted the treacle he had spread on a biscuit with some of napiers strong coffee he had questioned him about his leg and napier had said that he had picked up a splinter in his foot otherwise he was quite well in some ways the boy reminded him of himself at that age he was not a very good liar either he would speak to the surgeon deck there shes a yankee someone gave an ironic cheer and a boatswains mate remarked dont them buggers ave somethin useful to do another man laughed adam looked at the masthead again the spray running over his face like rain come on come on with that big telescope cousens would be able to see the ship well enough to identify it but what about the other what was an american ship doing out here perhaps after all the united states government was taking the slave trade seriously although until now they had strongly resisted any attempt by patrols to stop and search their vessels in the known vicinity adam took a telescope from the rack and climbed up into the weather shrouds he was soaked through in any case he hated wearing a heavy tarpaulin coat if you slipped it could carry you down as quickly as any round shot he waited the tarred shrouds biting into his skin while the hull went over once again unrivalled must have lifted suddenly on a freak crest he saw the other ship quite strongly her buff sails and most of her shining side before she dipped into the sea again but not before he had seen the bright patch of colour standing out from her peak like polished metal the stars and stripes he clambered down again and saw galbraith waiting for him he said yankee frigate he looked at hire his eyes steady despite the biting spray the other ones a barque the barque could be in which case deck there the next vessels a prizeshes flyin the same flag adam hit his lip in which case the americans have beaten us to it this time galbraith said theyre still closing with us sir adam turned away and walked down to the leeward side perhaps rearadmiral herrick had made a report to their lordships about osiris the mystery slaver it would further involve sillitoe he frowned and therefore catherine he pictured herrick again aboard this ship intense stubborn but sincere finding it impossible to break a code he had almost been born to uphold sir richards oldest friend he climbed into the shrouds again hearing two bells chime from the forecastle as he settled himself in a suitable position an hour had passed it felt like mere minutes since he had come on deck he tried again it was clearer this time the other frigate much closer two miles at the most he shifted the glass with great care gritting his teeth against the raw pain in his arm and thigh with each steep plunge the stars and stripes were very bright and clear now and men too lining the gangway and clinging to the rigging to stare at this ship he moved the glass again to gloat probably then he found the barque graceful for her size closer but angled away from the frigates quarter and he saw the flag it was flying above another which had been crudely tied into a knot the mark of submission the prize he saw some of the sailors waving from the other frigate well aware that telescopes were watching them cristie said proud as peacocks now aint they bellairs said the winds easing sir it was a question rather than a report adam nodded impatient to end it call all hands shake out those reefs and we shall take her closer to the wind he glanced at cristie show them how its done eh high on his perch in the crosstrees midshipman cousens heard the faint squeal of calls and guessed what was happening far beneath his dangling legs clinging to a stay the lookout watched him patiently eager to be alone again cousens trained his glass it felt like a bar of ballast in his wet hands he studied the frigate and then wiped his eye thinking he had missed something somehow the picture had changed which was impossible the waving cheering sailors soundless and tiny in the lens were gone and he could scarcely believe it the stars and stripes had vanished also even as he watched the line of ports opened as one or so it seemed and he stared with disbelief at the guns which shone in the hard light like black teeth he groped for the lookout and punched his arm alarm alarm all else was blotted out by the growling roar of a broadside and one last scream as he fell the oldest trick beat to quarters and clear for action for an instant longer there was chaos as the men pouring on deck to obey the last order broke into groups the constant drills taking charge even as a few stared with disbelief at the other ships adam cupped his hands alter course two points steer norwest by north men were running past to take station at the braces while gun crews ducked around them looking for familiar faces driven to a faster pace by the staccato rattle from the drums of two marines by the mainmast truck adam gripped the rail with both hands watching the other frigates the open gun ports the sudden menace of their black muzzles it was too late already too late i should have known guessed steady she goes norwest by north sir all else was drowned by the rolling thunder of a broadside perhaps the other captain had sensed that unrivalled had been about to spread more sail and maybe thought it was his only chance it was like a wild wind shots screaming through the rigging and punching holes in topsails and jibs and the telltale quiver of iron smashing into the hull he looked again one ipounder had been flung inboard from its port and a man was pinned under it his arms reaching out as if he were drowning his lower limbs did not move nor would they two other seamen lay by the foremast one cut almost in half by a ball the other trying to drag himself away to hide galbraith shouted if hed waited hed have dismasted us adam saw the shattered telescope broken across one of the guns and cousenss body dislodged from the mainyard as the hands hauled at the braces to fall like a rag doll to the deck he felt the grief changing to fury whitehot and beyond reason they died because of me not because of the stupid overcautious orders but because of me the guns were running out again along the other frigates side and he tried to clear his mind not quick but fast enough there were trained men working those guns renegades rebels whatever he chose to call them was irrelevant still on a converging tack the second vessel still wearing the frigate mounted guns so perhaps the barque carried armament of her own her master had also expected unrivalled to change tack come fully aback perhaps and leave her stern exposed for just long enough ready sir he ignored the faces around him and sought out varlo at the first division of guns he was standing motionless his hanger drawn and across one shoulder as if this were a formal inspection and one of his boots had left a bloody footprint from the man pinned under the eighteenpounder as you bear fire the broadside was well timed crashing aft along the side the orange tongues spurting through the dense pall of smoke funnelling inboard through the ports and over the gangway the other frigate had the windgage but held over by the same wind her muzzles highangled unrivalled had the range adam knew the enemy had fired again cordage severed blocks and charred strips of canvas fell and scattered across the gun crews who working like demons with handspikes and rammers were already responding to the hoarse shouts of command unrivalled was alone and ordered to be so until her mission was completed if anything vital carried away now the other vessels would lie off and take their time until there was no one left alive to prevent a boarding a slaughter he seized midshipman deightons arm and pushed him against the rail and trained a telescope across his shoulder the youth was staring at him he could even feel his breath his body shaken to another ragged salvo but his eyes were steady trying to tell him that he was not afraid adam acknowledged him without speaking and concentrated his gaze on the other frigate there was a black flag at her peak now and he recalled with insane clarity the words of the dying renegade captain in that same cabin beneath his feet in war were all mercenaries he saw the shotholes in the sails raw timbers protruding from a bulwark a few empty gun ports he lowered the glass but it was not enough not enough he flinched as he felt hands fumbling around his waist the sudden drag of a sword against his hip it was jago face half shaved caught by the sudden call to arms more shots slammed into the lower hull each one a body blow jago reached out and gripped his arm unsmiling and said harshly no matter sir ill finish shavin when were done with this scum adam stared at him and realised perhaps for the first time how close he had been to breaking failing the ship and the men like jago who never questioned why they were here or who would die next well hold this course he saw galbraith cup his hand over his ear to listen as the roar of cannonfire drowned out all else the gun captains blinded by smoke were barely able to see their enemy and yet with practised fingers they gripped their triggerlines even as each carriage lurched up against the side fire sponge out load run out fire if the pattern was broken they were finished a boatswains mate dropped to the deck without a sound unmarked his face shocked as if he couldnt accept the haste of death the range was down to less than a mile with both ships firing the churning fog of gunsmoke hiding everything but the upper yards and punctured sails of the adversaries galbraith yelled hes badly mauled sir one shot to our two if that he was actually grinning and waving his hat to the quarterdeck gun crews adam walked to the centre of the deck his legs suddenly able to carry him again then hell try to board us leigh he found he had the sword in his hand not his own jago must have snatched it from somewhere there must be no more mistakes could not all guns doubleshotted and with grape warn the smashers up forrard to be ready over his shoulder he called bring her up a point mr cristiewe dont want to keep him waiting he watched the topmasts of the other ship rising through the smoke saw small bright flashes from the tops or yards where marksmen had taken up their most effective positions distant without apparent danger until you felt the heavy balls thudding into the deck or gouging up splinters as if raised by some invisible chisel and that other sound lead smashing into flesh and bone a mans pitiful cries as he was dragged away to the orlop and the surgeon a ball ploughed into the boat tier and severed the bow of the big cutter like an axe more men fell as the splinters cut amongst them like arrows adam thought suddenly of napier that last time when he swung round he saw the youth on one knee tying a bandage around a marines forearm his fingers red with blood and with the same serious expression he wore even when preparing a meal for his captain keep down david their eyes met and he thought he heard him reply it sounded insanely like a pony ride ready sir every gun captain who was able was peering aft fist raised galbraith had drawn his hanger and the marines at the packed hammock nettings had already fixed bayonets the carronades too would he ready if they failed now he shouted stand fast and take them as they come lads lie saw faces eyes staring wild fearful desperate and they were his men he waved the unfamiliar sword remember lads second to none with a shuddering lurch the enemys jibboom and bowsprit drove over the forecastle like a giant tusk he could hear the crack of muskets and voices merged above the din of grinding hulls and snapping cordage like a hymn of hate a severed halliard snaked through the crouching seamen and marines and had somehow become entangled with midshipman cousenss body so that it swayed upright again as if to answer the call he had followed without question for most of his young life the sword sliced down fire towards the bows the gun muzzles must have been overlapping those of the enemy now looming high alongside at pointblank range doubleshotted and with added grape for good measure the explosion sounded like a ship being blasted apart where seamen had been standing and shaking their weapons waiting for the moment of impact there was now a smoking strip of water men and pieces of men the dead and the dying ground together as the hulls were brought to another embrace by the wind but a few had taken the risk and had somehow gained a foothold some by the smoking carronades which had transformed the enemys foredeck into a bloody shambles forward marines that was captain luxmore adam could not see him beyond the smoke but imagined he would be immaculately turned out as always he could hear a new sound like a horn rather than a trumpet or bugle galbraith was shouting at him theyre casting off sir his voice was harsh with disbelief on the run adam swung round grapple her galbraith was staring at him as if he could not understand grapple her but it was too late the hulls were lurching apart like two prizefighters who had given and taken too much adam gazed up at the sky clear again now above the smoke in that other impossible world where was the barque why could galbraith not understand he felt the solitary explosion and was only partly aware of the deck splintering behind him half the double wheel had been shot away one of the helmsmen still clung to the spokes but his legs and entrails painted a grisly pattern on the planking and above it all he heard the lookouts cry far far away beyond all this pain deck there sail on th larboard quarter he felt jago holding his shoulders and realised that he had dropped on his knees and then came the pain he heard himself cry out it was like a branding iron he tried to grope at his side but someone was preventing it for some reason he thought of john allday when they had last met had spoken and had held hands as it must have been galbraith was here now eyes anxious moving to others around them as if to seek assurance or grim acceptance he heard himself speaking anguished incoherent theybrokeofftheactionbecauseofthisnewcomer he almost bit through his lip as the agony lanced him otherwise he could not go on there was no need the smoke was clearing he heard the guns run out yet again someone was calling pitifully another was insisting im ere ted ang on now he turned his head and saw napier bending down to wipe his forehead with a cloth cristies voice surgeons comin he tried to rise but felt the blood running across his side and down his thigh mr galbraith he waited for his face to move into focus get the ship to plymouth those despatches must reach lord exmouth galbraith said god damn the despatches how many did we lose he gripped his sleeve tell me eight at a count sir too many lie shook his head the oldest trick and i did not see it a shadow shut out the misty glare small strong hands for so burly a figure the irish voice calm taking no nonsense even from the captain ah be still sir a pause and some sharp pain insistent pitiless a close thing ill deal with it now the shadow moved away and he heard obeirne murmur marine fisher was killed dropped his musket as he fell and it fired on impact it found the wrong target he felt hands lifting him others reaching out as if to reassure him or themselves galbraith waited until the little procession had disappeared below then he looked at the scars and the pitted sails the drying blood and the deck where men had died and more would follow them before they saw plymouth hoe again he shaded his eyes to look at the other ships but they had become unreal in the mist and the drifting smoke already he could hear hammers and saws men calling to one another as they worked high above the embattled deck how was it that the captain had seemed to know what was happening at the moment of truth and later when the other frigate had tried to free herself from their deadly embrace and what if the barques captain had realised that unrivalleds steering had been disabled by that single shot he took a mug of something from one of the wardroom messmen and almost choked on it it was neat rum and when he had seen the captain stagger and then fall to his knees he had heard himself speaking aloud anyone but him please god not him it was like a voice because you could not have done it nor will you he stared at the flag locker overturned in that brief but savage encounter attend to it mr cousens then he turned away sickened remembering and murmured forgive me there was nobody to hear him daniel yovell critically regarded the nib of a new pen before testing it against his thumbnail beyond the whitepainted screen he could hear the constant sounds and movements of men working to repair damage reeving new cordage or replacing sails which had been shot through in the engagement it seemed that the work had never stopped and it was sometimes difficult to believe that the brief action had been more than four days ago it was as if the labour was a need the only way sailors could put their anger and sadness behind them yovell had watched men die and had been there when they had made their last journey down into permanent darkness he looked across the littered table at the sheaf of notes the captain had used to compile his report in spite of the wound he seemed unable to rest or make any allowances for his pain and loss of blood even obeirne seemed baffled by the will and determination which was driving him he was with the captain now in the sleeping quarters they made a good pair yovell thought neither willing to give in to the other he saw napier by the stern windows watching some gulls swooping across unrivalleds lively wake their strident screams lost in this cabin it was like a haven separate from the rest of the ship yet closely linked by the comings and goings of officers and messengers from the working parties no matter how lowly the captain had to be informed yovell thought of his own part in it assisting the surgeon seeing men he had come to know suffer and sometimes die stretched out on that bloodied table he had held the hand of one seaman and had recited a prayer for him inserting his own words when he had forgotten some of it and all the while the dying sailor had been very still watching him finally obeirne had pulled the mans hand away and signalled for his assistants gone im afraid almost callous how else could he do his work he thought too of the burials the uncanny silence falling over the ship as if even the dead were listening anonymous canvas bundles weighted with round shot but as each name was read out the face would come to mind with maybe a word or a deed remembered captain bolitho had insisted on doing that as well the familiar muchthumbed prayer book in one hand this boy napier holding his hat and jago standing at his elbow ready to support him if the pain became too much obeirne came into the cabin and dragged on his coat yovell had already seen the dark stains of blood on his shirt he did not seem to need sleep either obeirne saw napier pouring a glass of brandy well trained boy but the usual humour evaded him he looked at yovell and waved one hand despairingly cant you do anything about it the man will kill himself if he keeps to this pace he swallowed the brandy gratefully and held out the goblet to be refilled when we reach plymouth i shall submit my papers for a transfer see if i dont then he did grin very wearily they both knew he had no intention of quitting unrivalled yovell asked quietly how is he obeirne tilted the goblet in a shaft of sunlight lucky i would say without hesitation the musket ball cut across the old wound he received when he lost his other command anemone well not know the total damage for a while ive stitched him up as well as i may under these circumstances another inch he shook his head and hed have gone outboard with those other poor fellows he closed his worn leather bag with a snap im away now before he makes me forget my sacred oath he paused by the screen door napier come and see me later i want to have a look at that leg of yours the door closed behind him yovell sighed the captain had even found time to tell obeirne about the boys injury adam bolitho heard the door and obeirnes unmistakable voice as he spoke with the sentry with care he sat on a chest and leaned forward to study himself in the hanging mirror calmly and intently as he might examine some failing subordinate he was naked to the waist his sunburned skin dark against the most recent layer of bandages like a tight waistcoat and a constant reminder throbbing now after obeirnes examination the bowl was beside the hanging cot some bloodstained water shivering in time with the dull boom of the rudderhead he listened seeing the ship as she must appear to any other vessel responding to a freshening wind it had veered overnight southeasterly he found that he was holding his side reliving it the closeness of disaster death had seemed almost secondary tomorrow would see them off ushant the western approaches and the english channel but he could find no satisfaction in it he could only think about the unknown barque there was no certainty that she was osiris but she had made the signal causing the frigate to cast off when they had been about to grapple and board unrivalled so that the barques master could bring his own armament to bear but for the unexpected sighting of another sail it could have ended there the unknown vessel had made off almost immediately as had their two attackers the barque had made the signal so she must have the authority and the intelligence to plan and undertake so dangerous a venture his mind repeated it it could have ended there he glanced around the sleeping quarters quieter now a standeasy must have been piped to allow his men to rest from their countless tasks he thought of jago by his side dark features grim and challenging as they had buried the dead during the action and in the days which had followed they had lost a total of fourteen men some others lingered on the verge but obeirne was hopeful fourteen then too many in his minds eye he could still see them midshipman cousens racing up the shrouds the big telescope swaying over his shoulder so full of life a boatswains mate named selby adam had not known much about him perhaps in some way he had avoided it selby had been the alias used by his own father when he had been escaping justice when he saved my life and i did not know him the royal marine fisher an old sweat who had never gained promotion in the corps but a popular man who had always been proud to boast of his service in the old thirdrate agamemnon horatio nelsons last command as a captain it had marked him out lent him a certain celebrity he had died without knowing that he had nearly killed his own captain he found he was holding his side again fourteen men he stood up slowly and grimaced as the pain seared across his ribs and midshipman sandell the hammers had started up once more standeasy was over he saw napier by the door and that he had a clean shirt over his arm adam smiled he could not remember the last time he had done so well go on deck david are you ready napier shook out the clean shirt and nodded gravely it was what he had been waiting to hear aye ready sir yovell looked up as they entered the great cabin mr midshipman deighton was here sir i told him it was not convenient he saw the clean breeches and shirt and napiers face adam said i sent for him i am appointing him signals midshipman he is more experienced than the others keen too he raised his hand never fear my friend i shall see him directly on deck yovell pushed the spectacles on to his forehead and gazed at his hands they felt as if they were shaking with gods help he could usually conceal emotion it was not like him at all he heard the door close and the stamp of the sentrys boots it was what they all needed the captain was back the admirals servant moved the chair a few inches as if to indicate that it had already been selected for the visitor adam had noticed that there was little conversation between lord exmouth and his personal servant perhaps they had been together for so long that spoken instruction had become unnecessary he lowered himself into the chair afraid that the pain would return at this moment when he needed to be fully alert galbraith had warned him about it had almost pleaded with him and jago had been unable to conceal his indignation what do they expect sir you have been woundedyou shouldnt he here at all by rights adam thought of herrick overcoming his disablement visiting unrivalled at freetown and the stubborn determination which had made him refuse the offer of a bosuns chair to hoist him aboard he had had misgivings of his own as the gig had approached the flagships side like a cliff he was still not sure how he had reached the entry port without losing his hold and falling headlong as herrick would have done but for jagos swift action jago had touched his hat standing in the gig while adam had reached out to pull himself on to the stairway and he had heard him murmur softly nice an easy does it sir and now he was here in the admirals great cabin the din of his reception had been the worst part not the calls or the slap and click of muskets but the faces on the fringe of the side party and the waiting officers curiosity or excitement he was not certain like the silence which had fallen over plymouths busy harbour and jetties as unrivalled was moved slowly to her allotted anchorage her company had worked without complaint for him for the ship and for one another but they could not conceal the scars of battle and only the most pressing tasks could be accomplished while the ship was still under way it was the first anyone had known of the action and he had sensed the shocked stillness of those same vessels which had seen them depart less than three weeks ago some store ships had stopped work when the frigates shadow had glided slowly abeam the hoists and derricks motionless as if it were a mark of respect the request for his appearance on board the flagship queen charlotte had been brought by the guardboat and not by any signal and the officer of the guard had signed for and carried the secret despatches to this very cabin lord exmouth sat back in his chair outwardly relaxed but his keen eyes missed nothing i read your report bolitho very thorough especially under the circumstances his hand moved very slightly and a tray with two fine glasses appeared on his table another small movement and the servant began to pour wine you might like this i keep it for myself usually he continued i also read other things which you did not put in your report and i appreciate how you felt feel about the sly and unprovoked attack made under false colours he shook his head an old trick but you were under orders my orders which is why i selected you in the first place any other vessel brig or fast schooner would have stood no chance at all there was a discreet tap on the door and a lieutenant moved soundlessly to the table and placed a note by the admirals glass he left the cabin just as quietly giving adam only a brief glance in passing lord exmouth read the note and screwed it into a tight ball it is as i surmised bolitho the dey has gathered more ships to his flag like the frigate which attacked unrivalled french dutch who can say but i dont have to explain that to you do i he made another small gesture and the glasses were refilled adam tried to stretch his body in the chair testing it feeling the immediate drag of the bandages he did not remember even drinking the wine it was almost cool in the great cabin but he felt as if his body was burning the admiral was observing him calmly you did not mention that you were wounded i am not a mindreader bolitho nor should i have to remind you ile did not wait for any reply time is running out i intend to sail from here at the end of the month to gibraltar where we shall be joined by a dutch squadron under baron van de capellan an officer who is known to me and whom i greatly respect his eyes crinkled in a smile in your report you mention that you did in fact see some dutch ships at the rock very astute of youperhaps you had already guessed what their purpose might he i had good cause to remember one dutch frigate my lord indeed indeed but as our nel was given to say war makes strange bedfellows and peace creates even more he glanced at the skylight as the trill of calls drifted down into this remote cabin the admiral was a great man but perhaps still a frigate captain at heart the sound of running rigging in the middle of the night watches someone calling a command or a warning like young cousens who had seen the danger before anyone and had paid for it i have a good squadron already bolitho to say that i need a certain captain is too frivolous a term for my taste you have the experience and the skill for this venture i want you in the van when i begin the attack on the deys defenses and his ships if your ship is not in fit repair by the time i make that move then i will find you another adam caught his breath astonished and dismayed she will be ready my lord with some local help i can the admiral held up one hand i will arrange that shall you be fit enough to follow the flag his whole world was suddenly compressed into this moment with this famous man and the threat of losing unrivalled i will be ready my lord you have my word the admiral frowned and pressed his fingertips together your word may not be enough i knew your uncle and i can see something of him in you youd not rest and leave the routine to others adam stared around the cabin the truth stark and very real he would lose unrivalled the admiral stood up and walked aft to the tall windows the big threedecker had plenty of headroom even for him perhaps he was still with his own frigate somewhere he turned swiftly your first lieutenant galbraith i met him he seemed competent enough it sounded like a question i read somewhere that you recommended him for promotion even though you were short of trained people at the time so you must have confidence in the fellows ability yes sir why was it so strange that he had hesitated he is a fine officer that settles it bolitho you will take a week or so and spend the time ashore cornwall is my home too y know he smiled but his eyes never wavered from adams face i am not giving you an order bolitho i want you in the van if you do not think you can do it then tell me now i would not hold it against you not after what youve done i can my lord so will unrivalled discreet voices it was time adam stood up and gasped involuntarily with pain lord exmouth held out his hand and took adams between both of his own as allday had done i will make certain that your ship has all the aid she needs i may even be able to hurry up the bounty money owed to your people it will not raise the dead but it will lift a few spirits i daresay the flag lieutenant had returned the door was open and ready then the admiral released his grip and said almost curtly you will go to your boat by bosuns chair this time pride is one thing bolitho but conceit is an enemy the servant was already leaving with the tray and the two glasses the next visitor was to receive other than the admirals own wine lord exmouth smiled almost sadly he is a good fellow lost his hearing back in after we captured the cleopatre when i commanded nymphe he glanced around the spacious cabin and his eyes were momentarily wistful now she was a fine little ship adam went on deck past two other captains waiting to see the admiral unbelievably the great man would have been the same age as himself when he had commissioned unrivalled ile turned and raised his hat to the flag and to the assembled side party then hardly trusting himself to hesitate he walked directly to the group of seamen waiting with the bosuns chair one a boatswains mate made a quick adjustment and raised his fist to those handling the tackle only for an instant their eyes met then he whispered you showed em capn now usll do it together he cupped his hands and yelled andsomely lads gist away there the marines presented their muskets but he barely noticed the flagships people were cheering him as he rose above the gangway and then swung easily above the waiting gig jago steadied the tackle until he had freed himself and reached the sternsheets midshipman martyns was at the tiller and looked as if he was about to say something his face full of excitement and pleasure as the cheers echoed over and around them as if the whole ship was joining in but jago silenced him with a scowl adam felt the gig move away from shadow into sunlight and thought of the unknown seaman who had spoken to him together he looked at jago and shrugged like hearing someone else so be it then he said the girl sat facing the tall mirror her hand moving steadily up and down the brush running through the full length of her dark hair brush brush brush unhurriedly in time with her breathing she wore a long loose gown this was a private moment and there would be no visitors around and beneath her the old glebe house was very still empty montagu had ridden into falmouth to speak with a carpenter there some work he wanted carried out while they were away away london again that endless journey in their own coach it was sir gregorys wish she studied herself in the glass meeting her own gaze like a stranger outside the house it would be hot very hot the shrubs and flowers drooping in the suns glare she would have to arrange for the roses at least to be cared for the brush stopped and she thought of the deserted studio directly beneath her feet the portrait was finished but sir gregory would still not be satisfied until he had given it more time to settle in she had looked at it on several occasions interest or guilt she could not describe her feelings would not the brush began to move again this time the other side her long hair draped over her shoulder and down to her thigh beneath the gown she was naked something she shared with no one she thought of the portrait again anybody who knew captain bolitho captain adam as she had heard people call him would recognise it as fine work lady roxby would be pleased with it but something was missing she tossed her hair impatiently how could she know the rose was there in the portrait sir gregory had seemed satisfied with that if a little surprised she tried to think of london and the house which even the prince regent had visited several times she plucked at the gown even the thick walls of the glebe house could not hold the heat at hay i ter feet were bare and she rubbed one on the tiled floor as she recalled the stone house where she had last seen adam bolitho and that tense little group and the courier with the recall to duty she had heard the cook talking about a manofwar which had entered plymouth a day or so ago damaged as if in battle although there had been no news of any such event she put down the brush and shook her hair out this place was so isolated she rubbed her thigh with her hand for my sake she looked at the window the creeper tapping against the dusty glass although there was no breeze she stood up and stepped back from the mirror her eyes never leaving her reflection she might be asked to sit for sir gregory in london or for one of his students why did she do it he had never insisted she stared at herself and touched her body the hand in the mirror like that of a stranger because it saved me she let the hand fall to her side and turned away from the stranger in the glass she had heard a horse sir gregory was back earlier than expected the house would be alive again she wondered why he insisted on riding when he could afford any carriage he wanted the old cavalier ile would never change what will hecome of she swung round startled someone was banging on the door she hurried to the window and looked down no one was supposed to be coming today she saw the horse tapping one hoof and idly chewing some overgrown grass then she saw the stable boy looking straight up at her his eyes wide with alarm what is it joseph youd better come miss lowenna theres bin an accident she almost fell back from the window the horse the one he had ridden here but that was impossible she dragged a shawl around her shoulders only half aware of some bottles being knocked from the table it was suddenly clear like one of montagus quick rough sketches there was nobody else only the cook and she was probably asleep at the back of the kitchen she flung open the doors and exclaimed where is he the boy gestured towards the gates e be bleedin bad miss she ran from the house heedless of the loose stones cutting her bare feet he was sitting on a large piece of slate part of the original wall when the church had ruled here one leg was bent under him and he was leaning forward bowing his head eyes tightly closed his hair plastered across his forehead she saw his hat lying in the lane it was as if she had been there seen it happen then she saw the blood so bright in the cruel sunshine on the leg of his breeches it was spreading even as she watched go now leave it you do not belong here go now it was like some insane chorus as if all the spirits people had spoken of had come to taunt her to remind her but she said help me joseph she was walking towards him saw her shadow reaching beyond her as if the girl from the mirror had taken her place then she knelt and put her arms around his shoulders feeling the sudden uncontrollable shivering knowing it was her own joseph was a good reliable boy but he was only thirteen she heard herself say run to the inn joseph and fetch some men we must get him into the house her mind was reeling suppose there were no men at the inn they might be back in the fields by now she could not even remember what time it was somehow she steadied herself and waited for the understanding to show itself on the boys freckled face rouse cook i want hot water and some clean sheets she tried to smile if only to restore his confidence go on now ill stay here until help comes she watched him scamper along the pathway she was alone she tried to open his coat but it was fastened too tightly there was blood on his shirt also and it was fresh she felt the tremor run through her again it must have been his ship which had been damaged the rumour which had eventually reached here all the way from plymouth it did not seem possible she realised that he was staring at her moving his head slightly as if to discover where he was what was happening he said suddenly bloodits on your clothing he struggled briefly but she held him she wanted to speak but her mouth seemed drv and stiff she made another attempt youre safe here she held him more tightly as she felt his body clench against the pain what happened she looked along the lane but there was no one only his hat lying where it had fallen like a spectator he said hoarsely there was a fight his head rolled against her shoulder and he groaned we drove them off it seemed to trigger something in his mind too late i should have known lie was still staring at her with wide eyes perhaps only just understanding what had happened she could feel it he was momentarily without pain lie said lowenna it is you i was coming lie pressed his face into her shoulder again and gasped oh dear god she took his hand gripping it tightly help is coining soon now she twisted round to stare down the lane again and felt his hand on her breast she looked at it seeing the blood on his fingers and on her gown where he had touched her the fear the scream was rising in her throat but she did nothing and watched the hand on her breast feeling the heat of his skin through the thin material like fever and then all at once everyone was here even the landlord from the inn well take capn adam miss and young joseph was saying there was blood on the road miss lowenna on the horse too mustve thrown him she stood up as two of the men eased adam into a chair we kin carry un to the inn missy she looked down at her gown the bloodstains and the smudges of blood around her breast there was blood on her feet also she felt nothing like taking a pose for a painting empty the mind wipe away the memory she scarcely recognised her voice perhaps it was the girl in the mirror carry him carefullyi will show you the room i must stop the bleeding send someone for a doctor the garrison will send one if you tell them who its for she held the door open wide and the men lurched against her she saw his hand reaching for her although he could not know what was happening she seized it holding it against her ignoring the people all around her not even aware of them you are safe now adam and she thought she felt his hand respond she had called him by name walk with me adam boiitii lay quite still for how long he could not tell counting seconds waiting finding himself he moved slightly waiting for the pain to bite into him it was late sunset ile tried again and realised that there was a curtain drawn across a window the sun was still shining he could see it bringing colour to the bed he closed his eyes tightly again and attempted to fit the pieces together ile was in a bed covered up to his chin by a sheet his hand explored his body his side and the bandages different ones and there was no blood as if through a haze he saw his coat hanging from a chair the buttons glinting dully in the filtered glow his hand moved again touching his skin damp but without the terrible pain and he was naked he groped above the sheet to push the hair from his eyes but someone had already done that for him it was like seeing a picture at the end of a dark corridor remembering the horse trotting steadily into the lane the vague outline of the old house through a rank of trees ile had pulled one foot from its stirrup to lessen the strain the raw reminder of the wound in his side a shadow it might have been a fox or even a stoat but it had taken the horse by surprise at any other time but it was not any other time and he had pitched headlong from the saddle how long how long ile moved his legs afraid of losing the fragments of memory faces and voices more pain while he was carried somewhere he felt the bed beneath him then other voices firm deliberate fingers ile must have fainted again but he had not been alone tie was certain of that perhaps obeirne had been right about his stubbornness the admiral too pride is one thing conceit is an enemy he let his head fall back again he could remember he listened to the sounds some birds rooks most likely voices not in the yard but somewhere in the house perhaps they had already sent word to the ship he tried to move on to one elbow the returning memory like a threat only then did he see her figure beside the window in shadow but she was watching him he could sense it just as he could recall her being here with him in that lost space of time before someone else a professional had come to attend him lowenna his voice seemed like an echo in this strange room he did not see her move but felt her sit carefully on the bed and take his hand in hers as he thought he could remember before she said easy now captain your wound is dressed i am sorry you were caused such pain he felt the fingers moving in his as if she were suddenly aware of something i have sent word to your aunt she must have sensed his surprise she told me i could call upon her as a friend more voices louder now one was montagus not yet adam said you were with me i can just recall it you stayed with me he tightened his grip as her hand attempted to pull away no lowenna dont go you took care of me he made another effort and raised his body but she laid the hand on his bare shoulder and pressed him down please dont adam stared at the ceiling the voices reminded him of the men who had carried him here when she had stroked his face with the cloth when he had protested at the blood on her gown he gazed at her seeing it like a word or a sound bringing back a dream she had stood beside the bed and had dropped the stained gown to the floor then she had laid down beside him dabbing his face with a damp cloth stiffening when he had reached out for her and had touched her she was looking down at him now her hair hiding part of her face lying against his shoulder like warm silk she said you kept saying that you wanted to save me i worried so muchevery effort seemed too much for you she looked away the hair now concealing her eyes you wanted to save me perhaps you saw me as the captive in the painting andromeda her hand touched his mouth dont say anything i will think of it like that he said quietly i was coming to see you lowenna because i wanted to needed to but for my horse throwing me i might have been unable to tell you things riding here was madness anyway i have been at sea too long i fear lie held her hand to his lips and i must go back to it soon she said your steward is here bryan ferguson remembering what he had told lieutenant bellairs but then falmouth is a small place she did not take her hand away but watched as he kissed it she could recall the eyes of the men who had come from the inn and her gown in disarray it would make a good yarn over a glass or two of ale she had seen and heard it all before like the creeping terror which she had fought year after year she removed her hand i never forgot your kiss my tears when you left and today here in this room she had lain beside him nude like one of the poses she performed for sir gregory which had taught her to fight and defy the shame and disgust and the faces that turned to stare and condemn her he had been lost in pain but aware of her his hand had found her and she had done nothing to prevent it she still could not believe it she had wanted to end it then and there but her mind had cried out for it to continue she must face it not merely give in like some innocent child she said i must go to london she felt his eyes on her tomorrow adam said i behaved badly abused you when pain and sickness are no excuse he kissed her hand again but i must see you it was intended fate if you like but i have to be with you she saw the smile the edge of sadness which was lacking in the portrait she hesitated this was their last moment alone perhaps the door opened and montagu with ferguson peering anxiously over his shoulder strode into the room adam released her hand perhaps it was enough john allday seized his friends arm and all but pushed him through the doorway into the parlour ill fetch you a wet meself bryan you sit herean ill want to hear everything about the battle he paused in his stride an you says young capn adam is all right bryan ferguson glanced around the room at the model of the hyperion on the table and alldays kit of tools beside a rough plan of another fine piece of work unis hurried through to the long room but paused to greet him good to see you again were busy todaythe new road y know allday shouted from the cellar only just heard about unrivalled an the battlewouldnt have known anything but for one of the revenue men passin through my god bryan what are we here six miles from falmouth youd think we was on the other side o the real world unis touched his shoulder and carried on with her work but not before ferguson had seen the hurt on her pretty features he took the mug from allday and waited for him to settle in another chair i see youve started on frobisher then allday waved a hand tell me about the battle did unrivalled dish the buggers up who were they anyway why in our day ferguson sipped the rum recalling all the excitement but not the sort his old friend wanted to hear the urgent message from the glebe house and going over with young matthew to collect captain adam everybody wanted to know about it even lady roxby had driven over to see her nephew a surgeon from the garrison had examined and treated him and had offered a few blunt warnings of his own if you were one of my dragoons sir id have you flogged in front of the troop for your behaviour what the hell did you expect to happen and he had met the girl the one who had brought captain adam from the town that day when he had got his orders to report back to plymouth he had recognised the change in her even on so slight an acquaintance there were rumours about her how she posed for an artist no matter that he was one of englands greatest painters to all accounts his wife grace had relatives still living in bodmin where the girl lowenna had been horn lowennas family had not approved of the match hardworking farming people and the biggest corn chandlers in that part of the county they had considered their daughter to be out of her depth marrying a scholar a man who had never known the demands of bending his back and working with his hands they had moved away after the birth vanished foreigners again there had been some scandal although grace had said little about it he had not pressed her he knew what he owed her for nursing and restoring him after the saintes he glanced at the model again before hyperions time that was on this occasion the girl had been warmer but outwardly correct despite all the upheaval withdrawn many would have said but ferguson had recognised something which was still as clear as yesterday when sir richard had brought lady catherine to falmouth for the first time if only allday leaned forward he was wounded y say is he taking it well the ships repairing at plymouth he saw the old light in his friends eyes living it the fleets standing to if you ask me we should have finished the job last time matey them buggers dont understand a soft hand thats it an all about it ferguson looked at the tools on the table captain adam had told him about frobisher and that he had seen her at gibraltar maybe for something to say as they had driven back together in the new dogcart as it was called more comfortable on that rutted track it had bigger wheels than his little trap but poppy had pulled it like a champion he thought adam must have felt every stone and hole on that journey but his mind had seemed elsewhere he had been wounded but in some way ferguson thought he looked better than when he had been here before only weeks ago afterwards young matthew had said with unusual vehemence so that was the girl i heard about her from a loudmouth i used to know ferguson had waited young matthew was not by nature a gossip in winchester i was told beaten an raped an left for dead the story had it tried to end her own life poor lass he had said no more nor would he perhaps grace also knew he felt alldays big hand tap his knee there was no avoiding it well they sighted these two vessels and right away captain adam guessed what they were up to unis paused at the door and after a few seconds smiled at what she heard and saw i ler john was hack at sea again he had never really left it the wine cooler stood in one corner of the cellar its polished woodwork and silver mounts gleaming in the flickering light of the lanterns adam bolitho ran his hand over the inscription and crest identical to that carved on the fireplace in the room above for my countrys freedom he thought again of the forlorn hulk at gibraltar it was hard to imagine this wine cooler on hoard with men working and following their daily routines like the world he had left in unrivalled catherine had given this fine piece of furniture to his uncle its predecessor lay on the seabed in the old hyperion it was a marvel that it had reached here unscathed changing ships being signed for again and again until eventually it had arrived in falmouth and the chair she had given him he heard fergusons breathing behind him he had scarcely left his side since the accident i think we should move it upstairs bryan he looked at the chair covered with a sheet i might have that taken to the ship ferguson nodded unwilling to speak and strangely moved and the wine cooler captain it were best kept in the house to come home to he turned away suddenly lost within himself still the interloper always feeling that the house waited for someone else i shall attend to that ferguson followed him tip the stone steps it should have been so different he thought this was another homecoming which would soon be interrupted by some urgent message he had heard more about the sea fight in which unrivalled had been damaged and men had died lie closed the ironstudded door it could have been adam and next time he shook some dust from a heavy curtain and looked at the flowers in the walled garden to come home to he had said but this was no home not anymore he thought again of what young matthew had told him maybe someone should consider the girls feelings and this spectre which still obviously haunted her he sighed anyway she had gone to london so that was the end of it but her eyes had said something else he smiled awkwardly how grace would laugh if she knew but he had not forgotten how it felt or how it looked he glanced down at his empty sleeve the past was the past adam was only partly aware of fergusons concern as he walked through to the study where john allday had seen captain james bolitho hand the old sword to his younger son he felt the leather case in his pocket the nile medal which catherine had sent to him by special messenger somebody must have arranged it there was only a brief note echoing the one she had left for him in this house with the sword he would have wanted you to have it he looked up at the portrait of captain james with the arm painted out by right the sword should have been hugh bolithos the traitor my father his eyes went involuntarily to the empty fireplace it was even the same rug where he had loved and been loved by zenoria and now catherine had broken the link which had brought them together ferguson knew the signs the ship was his world and soon he would be away again this house will be empty a meal perhaps captain adam had opened the little case and was gazing at the gold medal the nile so many memories so many faces gone forever i think not bryan ferguson said nothing he would seek graces advice she might know he was unable to believe what he saw she was standing just outside the opened french windows by the roses one finger to her lips smiling but unsure as if at any second she might turn and vanish she was dressed in pale grey and wore a widebrimmed straw hat fastened beneath her chin with a blue ribbon her hair was tied back and ferguson saw that she carried a yellow rose like the one rumoured to be in the portrait adam said i think i shall take a walk bryan he closed the little case and turned towards the sunlight she said then walk with me adam crossed the room and paused as she held out the rose this is for you her poise seemed suddenly a lie please i should not be here he took the rose from her hand her breathing was unsteady as if she were fighting something needing to speak unable to find the words adam slipped his hand gently beneath her arm i will show you the house lowenna he pressed her arm to reassure her feeling its tension and then you came it is all i care about you are here beside me and i shall not awake and find only a dream i could not go to london or anywhere else without coming to discover how you are she averted her face slightly no do not look at me so i am not sure if i can she was trembling afraid of him or herself he repeated and you came joseph brought me i told him to wait she looked at him directly her eyes suddenly determined pleading i had no right you of all people have every right she smiled for the first time just walk with me adam show me your home the way you offered that day they moved from room to room scarcely speaking each intensely aware of the other and not knowing how to proceed she said abruptly i saw the portrait i told sir gregory it is not right she seemed shocked by her own outspoken comment who what am i to say such things he smiled tell me ill not bite it was like a cloud passing away she said like that adam exactly that the smile as i remembered and will remember it he put his hand on her shoulder touching her skin feeling her bodys resistance like a reminder as if it had happened before he said i would never hurt you lowenna i would kill any man who harmed you she touched his face a man of war gently she took his arm walk me to that garden the roses what are you thinking adam he walked with her to the steps feeling the sun on his face on her arm the girl who had visited him in a dream had returned he said i think that you belong here lowenna she did not answer and he said that was badly put given time i would learn to express myself as i feel and how i feel you do belong here they walked on pausing while he stooped to pat young matthews dog bosun old and almost blind now the dog allowed nobody to pass unchallenged adam winced as he straightened again that will teach me a lesson ferguson was standing by the door of his office and lifted a hand as they passed from another doorway grace ferguson also watched and felt a tear in one corner of her eye they made a perfect picture like something from the past and yet something so new and radiant that it was beautiful to see after all the sorrow this house had known and all the happiness too she thought she heard the girl laugh at something he had said perhaps a closeness a new discovery she went back into the house and closed the door in spite of the heat would she tell him could she share something which had all but destroyed her without destroying this hope of a fresh beginning she hurried into the cool shadows annoyed at herself that she was weeping aware only of the girl holding his arm adam strolled through the stable yard and towards the gates several people working in the yard turned to look at them a few who had served here longer waved she said i want you to tell me about your life your ship the men you lead she said it so seriously that he wanted to throw caution aside and embrace her like the girl in the dream then you can tell me all about you lowenna she turned away pretending to watch some ducks flying across the surface of the pond she could not answer and she was afraid bryan ferguson stood just outside the library door his hand moving up and down the buttons of his coat a habit he no longer noticed it was rare for him to be so agitated i heard a horse captain i thought it was mebbee a courier sir gregory montagu removed his hat and gave a curt how it is not uncommon for people to call upon me without prior arrangement the times we live in perhaps adam stood up from the table the letter unfinished barely begun my dear catherine it was hard to compare this straight elegant figure with the paintdaubed one in the grubby smock he had ridden here along that same dusty track but looked as if he could have been arriving at court very well bryan thank you he glanced at the open door the windows beyond for a moment more he had imagined that she had come too was it only yesterday their walk in that same garden while he had told her about unrivalled and some of the people who had made her the ship she had become for those precious moments so close and yet quite apart montagu gestured towards one of the paintings that must be some of ladbrokes work ships all out of proportion wouldnt know a block from a beakhead adam was suddenly alert on the defensive montagu had not come here to pass the time of day about a painter who had died years ago i thought you might be in london sir gregory did you indeed he plucked at the short cavaliers beard his eyes everywhere it was the first time adam had seen him uncertain perhaps unsure how to continue you saw lowenna here in this house adam tensed it would be easy to lose his temper maybe montagu wanted just that she was concerned about my injury she would not stay for long he could see that his words were having no effect i made certain that she was properly escorted montagu nodded abruptly so i heard as it should be one can never be too careful these days he walked to a bookcase his riding boots squeaking on the waxed floorboards lowenna is very dear to me otherwise i should not be here she is my ward but that cannot last forever nothing does she is a lovely woman but in some ways adam said quietly then you must know sir gregory that i care for her greatly he raised his hand hear me i was unprepared for it but now i can think of little else only her future happiness montagu sat down heavily and gave him the same unwavering stare as some subject for his canvas he said i knew her father for some years i had occasion to work with him at winchester a scholar and a fair man but not of our world yours or mine he cared and trusted too much his wife died in winchestera fever of some sorts it was a foul winter that yearmany went the same way lowenna tried to take her mothers place and i did my best to help when i could i felt i owed it to her father as i said a fair man but weak unable to find his way after her death i felt there was something montagu seemed not to have heard him they had a house outside winchester near the woods pleasant enough i suppose but remote he leaned forward his eyes very steady sharing something which he must carry like a sacred trust some men came asking for food shelter maybe anyone else would have sent them packing but as i said he was not of our world adam felt himself gripping his leg chilled held in suspension as if watching the gun ports of an enemy opening they wanted money afterwards we heard they were deserters from the army common enough in those times he had none in any case but they would not believe him he was on his feet again i am only telling you this because i trust you if i thought or discovered to the contrary i would use everything at my disposal to destroy you he had not raised his voice and yet it was as if he had shouted it aloud it was some time before it was discovered a visitor from the college where he was employed i believe for four days that girl was held captive at their mercy i can see from your face that you can form your own assessment and i shall leave it there it broke her in mind and body and she would have died i know that now she is a brave intelligent person and i have seen what she has given to force that horror behind her adam said with your help yours alone perhaps i need her as much as i think she needed me thank you for telling me sir gregory montagu regarded him impassively has it changed things how could it she may never be able to tell you herself who can be that certain of anyone adam said after a silence did they catch them eventually they were hanged as felons not as soldiers even at the scaffold they tried to soil her name some of it found a receptive ear no smoke without fire isnt that what the bard said he moved one foot sharply i would have burned those scum alive for what they did adam heard someone leading a horse from the yard montagu had timed his visit to the minute the subject of this conversation is safe with me sir gregory something in his tone made montagu cross the room and take his hand their first contact since his arrival no secret is ever safe captain bolitho be ready i think maybe you are the one who can save her from those four days and from herself adam followed him into the sunshine there was cloud coming in now bluegrey from the sea a change in the weather he watched his visitor climb up into the saddle or an omen for a moment longer montagu sat motionless then he said your portrait will he ready very soon i was told of a few alterations i should make it seemed to thrust some of the earlier anxiety aside and i would not wish to annoy your aunt that rascal roxhy knew a thing or two when he married her eh adam watched the horse until it was through the gates he knew ferguson was loitering nearby it was something they shared without truly understanding how or why he turned and looked at him surprised by his own calmness i shall need young matthew early tomorrow bryan ferguson nodded no questions were needed here he had seen it all too often and yet this was different in some way i have some letters to write he was looking now towards the walled garden at the roses to come home to he was ready the only key al the close of july lord exmouths fleet weighed and put to sea it was an impressive armada even to the eyes of those who had grown up in war and plymouth drew crowds from miles around to watch its departure because of indifferent winds it took a whole day for the ships to clear the sound and take formation upon queen charlotte the flagship they left behind a powerful sense of anticlimax for weeks anyone who could scull a dory or lay back on a pair of oars had pulled spectators around the anchored ships entertainers and even a performing bear had joined with pickpockets and tricksters to make the most of the unusual crowds now apart from local tradesmen and the usual idlers plymouth appeared strangely deserted in the main anchorage only lifeless and laidup vessels in ordinary and the hulks closer inshore remained except for one anchored frigate lying apart from all the others yards crossed upperworks and rigging alive with seamen as they had been since her return with a hull scarred and blackened from that brief but pitiless encounter true to his word the port admiral had sent every spare shipwright and rigger to assist with unrivalleds hasty overhaul and now she seemed reborn only the experienced eyes of watermen and the old jacks on the hoe could see beyond the fresh tar and paint and the neat patches on much of her canvas the carriage stood at the roadside below the wall of a local battery the paired horses resting after the journey the hills and the hot sunshine the coachman leaned outwards slightly and said close enough i think miss lowenna the girl nodded but said nothing like all those who worked for sir gregory the coachman was polite but firm he had his orders for this expedition as he would if he had been transporting a valuable painting from one address to another he was concerned about the loitering crowds she thought some were looking over now a smart carriage a liveried coachman they were all men she plucked at her gown it was hot and the leather was damp against her body one of the men raised his hand in a mock salute and she heard the coachman mutter something under his breath you saw them in every seaport men who had once served and fought in ships like the frigate now shimmering above her own reflection they had suffered lost an arm or a leg two had patches covering empty eye sockets and yet they always came to watch to cling to something which had so injured or disabled them it was something no painter could recreate she thought of the portrait again the smile about which sir gregory had at first been so adamant or was he merely testing her sounding out her strength two more men had joined the group by the wall but stood slightly apart their clothing marking them out as shipyard workers one said shes up an ready to go ben tomorrow first thing if this wind olds the other one seemed less certain under orders then i thought she was too badly knocked about when she first came in his companion grinned my fathers out there now with the freshwater lightershes sailin right enough i was talkin with one of the ropemakers men tells me er captains a real driver a firebrand to all accounts some of the others had moved closer to listen as if they were jealous she thought an older man walking heavily on a wooden leg said er capn is adam bolitho matey you were afore is time eh he ignored the laughter i served under is uncle sir richard in th old tempest when e took fever in the great south sea there was none better the girl gripped the lowered window nancy roxby had mentioned that ship when she had come to see the portrait she looked towards the old sailor the sudden determination making her head swim she had seen the oldfashioned telescope under his arm im getting down she held up her hand no i shall be all right she could not even remember his name i have to see the coachman fastened the reins and glanced around uneasily he liked his work in spite of montagus changes of mood and his demands for a carriage at any time he chose there were few enough jobs and too many men being discharged from the fleet and the army to be careless he saw the girl extending her hand to the burly onelegged figure may i have it they were staring at her close enough to touch to smell the strong tobacco the tar please the hand was steady but felt as if it were shaking uncontrollably she was even calm the way sir gregory had taught her insisted for her own sanity the man suddenly smiled but certainly young lady tis a bit old an dented he shook his head as if to exclude the others especially the one who called like you eh ned she raised the glass carefully heard the coachmans boots slam down on the cobbles as the onelegged man put his arm around her taking the weight of the telescope as a marine will test the measure of his musket there miss the hard hand tightened over her fingers there she shook some hair from her eyes feeling a trickle of sweat run down her spine like an intruder a memory then she saw unrivalled and almost stopped breathing as the ship slightly angled on the current now swam into the lens the raked masts and black rigging shining like glass in the sunlight the loosely brailedup sails a long tapering pendant occasionally whipping out from one masthead tiny figures moving apparently aimlessly about the decks but each having a purpose others motionless officers perhaps she felt the tension returning adam he would be there the stable boy had told him when the carriage had left when she had asked sir gregory if she could be driven to plymouth it was important although even she did not know how important it was like opening a sealed room with the only key not without me you wont but his sharpness had been to cover something else something only they had shared until now she steadied the glass on the proud figurehead the hands thrust behind her streaming hair the uplifted breasts like herself in the studio that day when he had walked in she lowered the telescope and saw the ship fall away become only a fine model again someone you know aboard unrivalled miss they were all looking at her but there was no malice no lust no hands reaching out to hold and force her down down she said quietly yes how can i say that he will leave here tomorrow someone said and in any case i would like to get a message to him is it possible she looked towards the coachman i can pay the coachman relaxed muscle by muscle a patrol of soldiers was coming along the road he was no longer alone he said ill drive us down to the waterfront miss lowenna i can barter with the wherrymen there the onelegged man said firmly i can do it ive got me own boat there was a kind of defiance in his voice pride too then he looked at her eyes taking in everything reliving memories perhaps itll be the capn then yes she said i can take you too if you wishes it she shook her head i will write a note here and now she opened the little case she had brought with her as if she had known it was impossible it was madness and all at once it was done the man took it with great care and said my capn bolitho in tempest e had a fine lady like you lovely she was she laid her hand on his ragged sleeve was we buried er at sea same fever he gripped her hand and folded her fingers firmly over the coins she held ready for him not this time missy es a lucky man ill give im that none luckier eh lads she climbed into the carriage eyes blind to everything even the anchored frigate if they knew they would pity her she bit her lip until the pain steadied her everyone did who knew she recalled crying out in the night not caring its love i want not pity cant you see that like the sealed room the only key viceadmiral sir graham bethune waited for his servant to close the doors and said it was good of you to come thomas i am aware that you are very busy at this time he watched his visitor sit carefully holding his shoulder and frowning as if in anticipation of pain he looked tired more so than on the previous visit rearadmiral thomas herrick looked around the room with its glittering chandeliers and a splendid portrait of earl st vincent as first lord of the admiralty bethune knew herrick disliked any contact with this seat of admiralty hated it was a better description he felt out of place here i received your last report bethune paused like a wildfowler testing his ground i found it very informative helpful especially to me herrick looked up at him his blue eyes very steady commodore turnbull needs more ships sir graham and he needs them now i doubt if we shall ever stop the slave trade completely but without proper patrols we will be outmanoeuvred at every stage a waste of time and money too if that is their lordships only yardstick bethune walked to a window and looked down at the carriages and the riders heading towards the park seeing that other stretch of parkland the leafless trees that marked the old duelling site he had spoken to catherine just a few days ago there had been more people about and she had seemed surprised that he had come to meet her wearing his uniform he touched the gold lace on his sleeve it had been a reckless thing to do but he had already read herricks report and had acted swiftly he had not even stopped to consider what it must have cost herrick to break his silence he tried to put it from his mind herrick was not doing it for him but for catherine and catherines lover richard bolitho he said i hope you will take a glass with me thomas we shall not be disturbed herrick shrugged it could have meant anything but bethune was ready he knew herrick well enough by now i think i do stubborn singleminded loyal the navy was his whole life and like an hourglass it was running out he opened a cupboard and poured two glasses of cognac from the dusty shop in st jamess where catherine had bought wine for richard he saw her face again her eyes flashing when he had mentioned baron sillitoe of chiswick we are not lovers but i owe him so much he stood by me when others did not i would have died but for him herrick took the glass and studied it gravely early for me sir graham always the title like a last harrier just as he never used lord in connection with sillitoe either in his report or in this room it seems certain that lord sillitoe is deeply involved with business affairs in the west indies bethune hesitated and in africa herrick said no doubt about it the offices in the city of london have confirmed it sillitoe may have been unaware of the extent to which it was tied to the slave trade but ignorance is no excuse in the eyes of the law he added with sudden bitterness anyone who has faced a court martial will say as much bethune turned back to the window he must have been mad catherine had been right so near the thames where anyone might have seen them a promising flag officer well placed for further promotion with a wife and children and still young enough to rise to the new demands of the navy in peacetime he thought of the fleet which had sailed from plymouth to an inevitable confrontation with the dey of algiers hardly peace and there was growing friction between the new allies over the slave trade he had even touched her held her hand prevented her from pulling it away i dont want you to go catherine you could remain here in london i can make certain of your privacy he had seen her eyes as your mistress graham another scandal i have too much respect for you to ruin your whole life herrick asked abruptly is there news of catherine bethune faced him i spoke with her a few times he saw the disbelief then the caution she intends to go with lord sillitoe to the west indies he thought suddenly of the nile medal her relief when he had told her that it had been delivered safely to the bolitho house in falmouth he heard the clock chime more of a tremble than a sound and refilled the glasses while he considered what he had done he would be blamed for warning her his future would he in ruins perhaps a sea appointment might have saved him he put down the bottle he saw her walk towards her carriage she had paused once and had asked quite calmly are you in love with me graham he could not recall his answer only her final dismissal then you are a fool herrick said can nothing he done their lordships are too concerned with algiers at the moment afterwards ile shrugged perhaps lord sillitoe will absolve himself herrick stood up carefully i must take my leave sir graham i am told that i will be required to return to freetown shortly that damnable place and afterwards shall he put on the beach as if he could see it face it like a man with one foot on the scaffold bethune said will you go hack to kent herrick studied him i am a stranger there now he watched the door knowing that a servant was waiting ready to spirit him out i ask you sir graham igo what you can for catherine sir richard gave me my life she gave me back my trust something seemed to hold him by the door adam bolitho is he at sea yet i am informed that unrivalled left plymouth yesterday herrick said how i envy him the door closed and bethune picked up the bottle again which was unlike him he raised the glass and said aloud yes catherine i am a fool he thought of her hand in his her resistance and something more the servant was hack i thought to remind you sir graham we have an appointment with the first lord at noon i see he glanced at the empty glasses then we had better not keep him waiting he was reminded sharply of the room he had seen in malta the last place she had joined richard bolitho he had used the same words then how i envy him it was not over lieutenant leigh galbraith followed his captain into the stern cabin and waited by the door halfexpecting him to remember something and hurry to another part of the ship it had been like that since his return a boundless energy which was infectious something you shared without knowing why even obeirne had been at a loss for words which was most unusual he had redressed the wound and had snorted riding a horsei ask you man does he have a death wish this captain we follow yovell was here coat draped on a chair his table and some of the surrounding deck covered with folders and lists and still more letters galbraith noticed he realised that the captain had halted by the stern windows hands spread out on the lower sill as if embracing the anchorage its good to be without an admirals flag to rule our days eh the fleet will be well on its way now galbraith saw one hand pat the freshly painted wood never fear well soon catch them up he turned and you recommended lawson for promotion to bosuns mate to replace selby sir lawson was coxn of the jollyboat and a good allround seaman but if you think adam smiled i had thought that sanders might be the right choice but no i agree with you lawson it is i shall speak with him directly and the new midshipman sir shall i deal with him no i shall see him its important i think galbraith watched him touch the wound again napier came from the sleeping cabin some clean shirts folded over one arm he wore no shoes and adam knew the reason for it obeirne had told him there was a splinter in the boys thigh teak like the other but deeper and dangerous all sailors hated teak triton had been a dutch ship and most of them were built of timber brought from faroff dutch possessions napier had said it will be all right sir i wont have a limp if if was always the threat adam said im pleased with the ship leigh and with what youve achieved while unrivalled has been here he shook his head and i know what youre going to say about all the help steered our way by the admiral i was a first lieutenant myself and i have not forgotten who truly gets things done he smiled at him it will look well when i write your report report sir adam had turned to look at a passing yawl and did not see the sudden apprehension when the time comes for promotion he swung round halfblinded by the glare from the anchorage be ready man it will come or ill know the reason why and now let us go over that list again gun crews and their captains topmen and boat crews he remembered the shattered wheel the mangled corpses clinging to the splintered spokes and touched the fresh paintwork once more as if the rest were only a memory never again tell me about the new midshipman is there anything that might put him at his ease when we meet he thought of the surprise even the pleasure he had seen in faces he thought he already knew he was back in command and it mattered a close thing obeirne had said would they be watching him when next they were called to quarters never question it do it was it ever that simple galbraith said his name is john bremner late of the frigate juno he is fifteen i remember juno a french prize fifthrate when i last heard she was about to be broken up he should be experienced anyway what we need now he watched the wind ruffle the water of the anchorage cristie said it would hold even he had been pleased he thought we owe that bugger one sir he had almost smiled he felt the strain running out of him even the wound was not painful at the moment and they were leaving again tomorrow he saw a small boat pulling away from the side the oarsman pausing to shade his eyes and peer up at the gilded gingerbread around the quarter they would make full use of the time on passage to join the fleet gun drill would be paramount he could almost hear the admirals words unrivalled had been there the others had not i want you in the van there was a tap at the door the new midshipman his most important time so it must be mine too but it was lieutenant bellairs his face scored by the sun even now im sorry to trouble you sir but i thought it might be important adam looked at him and knew he had galbraiths full attention as well bellairs only recently a midshipman himself had changed since young cousens had been killed they had been close and bellairs had helped to train the other midshipman in flags and signals before his own promotion to lieutenant as if he had hardened matured almost overnight not the bellairs who had blushed when telling him about the girl named jane who lived in dartmouth he opened the small hastilyfolded cover for a moment the cabin was gone the faces the individual concerns and responsibilities were at anothers door a clear unfamiliar hand but he knew it instantly i was here i saw you god he with you he stared at the windruffled waterjust in time to see the boat vanishing around two hulks it was not possible like the dream when he had almost lost his mind in pain and despair when she had always been with him lie faced them again thank you for that mr bellairs he sat down in the chair which he had brought from falmouth send in mr bremner will you he was leaving someone and that too mattered steady she goes sir souwest by south adam braced his legs on the wet planking as unrivalled ploughed her stem into the curling breakers of the channel levelling the glass with care measuring the distance the bearing of the last jutting spar of land penlec point the sea lively there too spray drifting like pink shadows in the morning light tie lowered the glass cristie was right they would weather the headland with half a mile to spare you could take no chances with a lee shore ile walked up the tilting deck feeling the ship quiver as she lifted and then hit into deeper water what she did best and wide across the bows lay open water all hands had been piped before dawn the last mail and despatches were lowered to the guardboat and after a hasty meal the capstan was manned the shantyman doing his best above the rising southeasterly wind during the ships stay at plymouth galbraith had managed to find seven recruits to fill the dead mens shoes surprisingly they were all prime seamen so that would make up the difference far more than mere numbers perhaps it was because unrivalled was the last ship to leave port with only the listing hulks to remind men of hard times ahead with all boats stowed and the anchor hove short she had left as the day was just dawning giving colour to the land he strode aft men dodging out of his way rigging groaning and taking the strain experienced eyes watching new and old cordage for weakness or a job too hastily completed in harbour he thought of the new midshipman only fifteen but already well trained in his previous ship a dark seriouslooking youngster a little too serious perhaps probably comparing adam with his previous captain there were no passengers in a frigate and the real personality would soon be forced to emerge it would help to take the minds of the other midshipmen from cousens and the missing sandell he came out of himself and called mr galbraith get the courses on her once we are clear of the point he stared up at the sloping masts the angled yards where topmen were already spread out like monkeys indifferent to the height or the sea boiling along the weather side one hand for the king it was the first lesson for any true seaman the other one you kept for yourself he turned away as galbraith yelled his orders to the boatswains party waiting by the foremast leaving port would he never get used to it the excitement the small pictures you never left behind fishermen standing in their frail craft to wave their cheers soundless in the din of canvas and feet running to halliards and braces a small packet ship under french colours dipping her flag as they had passed her the old enemy the sea perhaps was the only true thing they held in common he had levelled his glass on the land the sound already swallowed up astern and imagined her as she must have been writing the note some sudden whim or determination making her give it to some waterman for delivery maybe she was already regretting it fearing it might he misinterpreted or worse he had put his own letter to her in the guardboat it would be delivered to bryan ferguson if she had not already gone away he would find her he heard one of the helmsmen curse quietly saw him gesture at something on the big double wheel the replacement for one shot to pieces he touched his side again there might have been no letter he thought too of the marine who had died dropping his musket a man well liked and remembered because he had once served under the young captain nelson in the agamemnon old aggie as she was affectionately known was there someone left perhaps in plymouth who would grieve for him or would it he yet another lost name like the paradoxs boatswain who had come from st keverne overlooking the manacles which they had discussed while he lay dying so many too many he had contained a sudden and he knew unreasonable anger when he had read the letter from a retired rearadmiral who had served with sandells father and had sponsored the boy for his appointment as midshipman no sadness no pity if anything only a resentful disapproval that a wouldbe officer had been lost at sea without proper investigation a fault surely of his captain would he have cared so much for procedure if a lowly landman had been missing overboard he saw midshipman deighton standing by the flag locker with his chosen hands frowning slightly as he studied his signals card then he smiled at something said by a masters mate and he saw lieutenant bellairs turn from his station with the afterguard to watch with he thought a certain sadness as if seeing someone else then he was with his men again he would get over it there was no other way he seized the hammock nettings as the ship crashed into a long unbroken roller and what would be the outcome of this venture it was the admirals total responsibility his was the decision whether to call the deys bluff or commit all his ships and men to the onslaught of battle no ship could match gun for gun with a carefully sited shore battery and there might be heated shot and fire every sailors only real fear according to the written orders the dey had mounted a thousand cannon or more perhaps in those same old crumbling batteries he had seen for himself when he had cut out an enemy ship from the anchorage and afterwards when admiral lord rhodes had made his attack with bomb vessels and his own heavier ships in support but too far out to find and destroy those hidden guns exmouth was a frigate man had been how would he perceive and accept a challenge which might end in disaster he saw galbraith studying him trying not to show it he too was changed in some way troubled by his captain unsure of him after what had happened adam faced into the wind coming harder now across the quarter tasting it like the tears that day fallen on his hand whatever happened they must be ready for treachery and for traps a voice seemed to insist you must be ready you he called get the courses on her mr galbraith another hand on the helm too he saw him lift his speakingtrumpet men poised and ready to respond to his orders their bodies stripped and shining with spray like those warriors to whom she had alluded in the myths and traditions of ancient times of which he knew so little she had described him as a man of war perhaps she had not truly understood how apt that had been there had never been opportunity or leisure to become anything else for the boy who had walked from penzance to falmouth the frigate captain lie heard the thunder of released canvas as it filled and hardened to the wind unrivalled was standing hard over every eighteenpounder on the weather side throwing its weight on the breechings they might walk together again and she would share it with him lie stared into the wind until the spray almost blinded him she must know it came like a fist from nowhere why she had written that brief note which now seemed to hold such urgency god he with you it was like hearing her voice more hands on the weather forebrace mr fielding move yourselves adam stared at the land again almost lost now in the wind and spray a green haze without real form or substance it would soon he gone once they changed tack he waited for the ship to steady the sails shining like metal breastplates then he strode to the quarterdeck rail and gripped it with both hands fear was an enemy but it could he held at hay when others looked to you there was never any choice the faces sometimes came back to remind him he had seen it in bellairs just now galbraith also seeking something other than trust it was a long time ago another voice i dont want to die please god not now but the voice was his own prepare for battle luke jago stood with his legs braced against the ships easy motion his hat tilted to shield his eyes from the unwavering glare to some he might appear composed even indifferent those who did not know him it was always the same he thought from the moment the order was piped through the ship all hands all hands lay aft to witness punishment it was a part of life in the navy good or bad you accepted it often you never really knew how it had begun or if it could have been prevented order discipline routine he should be used to it by now perhaps it was boredom it was almost a month since unrivalled had left plymouth they had caught up with the fleet at gibraltar anchored while many of the lame ducks were still making their final approach but after that the ship had spent almost all of her time at sea keeping contact with other frigates the admirals scouts only half aware of the planning and the scheming which must have been taking place he glanced over the heads of the assembled company at the horizon like molten metal from a furnace and beyond it what looked like a faroff unmoving cloud africa he heard hastie the masteratarms call prisoner seized up sir jago moved forward a few feet behind the captains left shoulder his body angled only slightly against the quarterdeck rail he looked briefly at the prisoner stripped to the waist and seized up to a rigged grating head twisted round to stare up at the figures on the quarterdeck a small group of midshipmen on one side the officer of the watch bellairs on the other a mass of offwatch and unemployed sailors filling the usually busy deck the marketplace they termed it the watchkeepers were going about their normal affairs on the gangways splicing and attending to the running rigging some working far above the deck while topsails and jibs flapped or filled to a wind which was little more than a hot breeze jago had heard the master cursing it maybe some fast sailing when every man was required to work the ship was what they needed the prisoner for instance an ordinary seaman named bellamy not one of the usual troublemakers or hard men probably just his bad luck he halflistened to the captains voice reading the relevant section of the articles of war jago knew it by heart he felt his shoulders stiffen remembering the moment the sickening blow of the lash across his naked hack he had been unfairly flogged an officer had stood up for him and had proved his complete innocence but he would carry the scars of the cat to his deathbed other crimes not capital committed by any person or persons i n the fleet jago looked again two boatswains mates were waiting by the grating one creagh carried the red baize hag and he saw that the other was lawson who had until his promotion been coxswain of the jollyboat and a good allround seaman his first flogging and a prisoner he had probably known as a messmate the captain said two dozen boatswains mate do your duty no heat no contempt but jago knew differently as the arm swung back over and down and the cat o nine tails cracked across the bare skin he saw the captains hand tighten around his scabbard the masteratarms called one jago saw the first droplets of blood heard the victim gasp the air punched out of him he had once witnessed a flogging around the fleet on a charge of mutiny the boat carrying the prisoner spreadeagled on a capstan bar had called at every ship and each captain was ordered to award his allotted share of the punishment three hundred lashes the man had died shortly afterwards two the ship leaned into a slight swell and jago swayed forward to look at the officers had it been one of the old hands a seasoned warrant officer like partridge it might have ended there and then a quick punch or rap with a rope starter all that was needed he watched lieutenant varlos expression impassive and yet with each crack of the lash he saw him purse his lips he was enjoying it eighteen jago saw obeirne the surgeon bending to study the prisoners back he made himself do the same he must not forget the mans back was like something inhuman torn flayed flesh blackened as if burned by fire obeirne stood aside the punishment continued lawson was using the lash now probably holding back even though the prisoner was beyond pain jago could recall a captain who had suspected leniency in one boatswains mate and had threatened him before the entire ships company lay it on harder man or by god youll change places with him he glanced at the captains sunburned hand the knuckles were almost white around the sword at his side twentyfour cut him down the captain turned aft and saw jagos expression he said give me an enemy i can fight not this jago stood aside he doubted if the captain had even seen him or knew he had spoken aloud galbraith asked dismiss the hands sir adam looked at him he had recalled lawsons pleasure and pride when he had told him of his promotion now he would understand the other side of the bargain the line he had crossed which set him apart from the rest and martyns their youngest midshipman who had come through the fighting like a brave if inexperienced lion but just now as the flogging had been carried out that same resilient boy had been in tears lie realised that galbraith was still waiting yes and i would like you to have a word with mr varlo at your earliest convenience galbraith turned his hack to exclude the others i hardly think that it should come from me sir adam removed his hat and touched his damp forehead why should it matter because you are experienced and you understand the importance of standing together if i see him myself it may well end in a court martial his or mine i am still undecided he saw obeirne waiting by the companionway do it it was like a shutter falling perhaps it had never really lifted he seemed to hear her voice again want you to tell me about your life had it really happened your ship the men you lead what would she think if she could see him now obeirne bided his time recognising his distress which he guessed no one else would even imagine bellamy will he up and about soon sir ive seen far worse adam looked at him almost time to change tack again an unending rectangle of sea an invisible fleet and a handful of small vessels holding the strings the eyes of the fleet nelson had called them he said what about the lad napier can you do something for him obeirne assessed him gravely for you you mean yes sir while this weather holds theres a risk of course no risks please he walked to the nettings as seamen and marines broke ranks and drifted away some hands were already scrubbing the grating and the deck while down on the orlop the seaman called bellamy would be drowning his agony and degradation in more rum than he could handle a fateful equation too much to drink a loose tongue and the wrong officer varlo would claim rightly that he was only doing his duty an admission not a defence he looked up past the mainyard where cousenss body had broken its fall to this deck and saw the lookout a tiny shape against the empty sky sail on th weather bow sir the link in the chain it had to be everybody else would stay clear for a moment more he stared at the cloudlike outline of the distant coast maybe it was already over he blinked to clear his vision and looked down at the main deck the last traces of blood being washed into the scuppers it was not over fate destiny how could anyone know he thrust it aside our best lookouts aloft mr galbraith we will alter course directly and let her run down on us ill be ready sir bellairs had been watching them and tried to relax as the ship slowly returned to routine normality he liked to think that had he been dealing with the seaman bellamy he could have managed to avoid a flogging just as he knew that in a ships tight world of discipline and purpose an officers word had to be respected obeyed he thought of the girl named jane who lived in dartmouth imagined her face lighting up when he walked up to her one day as a captain with a frigate of his own cristie called wearily when you can spare a moment mr bellairs i would like to have the log witnessed and signed bellairs shook himself out of it at once mr cristie beneath their feet adam walked right aft and slumped in the highbacked chair he had brought from falmouth what thoughts must he have had sitting here like this hopes too before fate had marked him down he touched the wound he must ask obeirne to examine it again he listened to the sudden thud of feet the muffled bark of commands and knew he should go on deck once more and what of trust he recalled galbraiths face the barrier again yovell appeared without letters or documents for once shall we fight sir as one man might ask another about the weather in some country lane i believe so daniel he did not see the surprise at the casual use of his name yovell said uncertainly i attended to the letter sir the legal one his eyes rested briefly on the chair perhaps remembering adam listened to the thud of the tillerhead and imagined the wheel going over cristie watching compass and helm rist or another masters mate waiting to lay the ship on her new course he heard the clickclickclick of napiers shoes preparing to go to the sickbay he said quietly if anything should happen to me for instance that boy should be cared for he reminds me of me he smiled faintly as i believe i once was yovell said the surgeon is a good man sir i am relying on it he stood up his hand running over the back of the chair he could see them all in his mind as he would describe them to her the men you lead the door opened and jago stepped into the cabin the sail is changin tack sir a frigate one of ours he recognised the strain and was angered by it any captain could decide if you lived or died but this one cared sullivan is at the main sir yovell adjusted his spectacles he sensed the unlikely bond between them although he did not fully understand it yet a man who scorned authority and had been quick to say so but one who had earned respect by giving his hand to adam bolitho yovell was not a seafarer but he had noticed that when jago entered the sentry had not even challenged him adam said ill come up presently their eyes met call me he looked around the cabin again trying to find the words to describe it to her in his mind but the other voice intruded i want you in the van it had already been decided midshipman deighton wedged his book beneath one arm and levelled the telescope again shes halcyon twentyeight captain robert christie sir he peered quickly at the others and seemed startled by the authority in his own voice adam folded his arms and watched the other frigate almost bowson now her sails in disarray as she changed tack to converge on unrivalled even now he could feel the shiver of memory of instant recognition as if he had known was it only a year or so since they had last met when admiral lord rhodes had ordered halcyon to chase and attack the big frigate triton the day so many faces had been wiped away outranged and outgunned halcyon had stood no chance and rhodes must have known it but he had been so eager to prevent unrivalled from giving chase that he had ordered her to remain on station adam had ignored the signal and they had won the day when martinez the deys agent and advisor had died shot down by corporal bloxham as he had been about to fire the day young napier had taken the great splinter in his leg and yet despite the pain and the hate the rejoicing and the sadness one picture always stood out in his mind he glanced at galbraiths strong profile he would recall it too they had swept past the mauled halcyon and he had seen her destruction the thin threads of scarlet running from her scuppers as if the ship were bleeding to death young deighton had been there also and he had heard galbraiths voice harsh with emotion theyre cheering cheering us somehow halcyon had survived and her captain with her james tyacke had spoken of him when they had met in freetown he felt his lips crack into a smile that seemed so long ago tyacke had been a lieutenant in the majestic at the battle of the nile and christie had been a young midshipman he thought of the medal now in his strongbox the nile it had affected so many in this naval family the happy few where tyacke had had half his face blasted away just before it had happened he had saved that young midshipman from breaking when christie had become a man a better nzan he had later said to sir richard he wiped his mouth with his hand less than two years ago in this same mediterranean sea heaveto if you please he saw galbraiths eyes he had remembered deighton called ylave despatches on board sir he could almost feel the tension of those around and closest to him dissipate the waiting and uncertainty were in the past jack always knew cristie muttered not wasting any time is he unrivalled came round easily her sails all aback that same corporal bloxham now a sergeant shouting at some marines to form up at the entry port the deck was still rising and falling heavily while the ship hoveto so that they swayed in an untidy dance until they found their feet again some of the seamen were grinning broadly sailor and bullock would never really mix adam watched the frigates gig pulling strongly across the dark blue water a cocked hat in the sternsheets christie was coming in person galbraith was observing halcyon through a telescope for some reason it made him feel like an intruder even without the glass he had seen the scarred and blistered paintwork her figurehead still unrepaired and partly shot away he lowered the glass battered and hardworked with obviously little time spent in harbour but a ship any man would give his right arm to call his own the calls trilled and adam saw christie climbing from his boat tall a keen intelligent face probably posted a year or so after me the sort of man who would catch any womans eye the frigate captain but when he raised his hat to the guard and quarterdeck adam saw the legacy of that terrible day above either ear his hair was not merely greying it was white as if it had been dyed the touch of war the meeting in unrivalled was brief adam sensing both the urgency and the relief of this rendezvous one of the wardroom messmen served refreshments and he was surprised that christie chose rum he said my supplies are all in chaos his lordship has kept us busy indeed i am glad the muddled thinking is over and done with adam waited while yovell unfastened the envelope and looked up sharply at his visitor as christie said lord exmouth sent word to the dey surrender all the christian slaves and disband the fleet of renegadespirates id call themor defeat is inevitable he smiled for the first time and adam could see him as tyackes midshipman at the nile needless to say it was ignored the emissary was damned lucky to leave alive adam glanced at the messman face very intent ears taking full note of everything that was being said he thought of napier the sea was calm enough for the moment obeirne might take the opportunity to extract that one dangerous splinter lord exmouth is joined by a dutch squadron six good ships to all accounts but between ourselves id prefer to act without anyone else becoming involved adam recalled jago making much the same remark let the meneers stay away an smoke their own pipes the war was over the mistrust was not he stood up and walked to the stern windows feeling the jerk and tremble of the big rudder ready to go to obey he heard himself say the day after tomorrow then august twentyseventh exactly a month since bellairs had given him her note here christie had his hat in his hand and his glass stood empty i must leave lord exmouth is all in haste he insisted you were to be found without delay adam followed him to the door the last in the line and the first to lead you have a fine ship captain bolitho but there was no envy adam said after this perhaps you may return to england christie faced him the messman and the rigid marine sentry meant nothing they could have been quite alone england has nothing to offer me they would take my ship from me without her he broke off and said almost abruptly i could ask for no better ship or captain in the van he shook adams hand lingering over it if you meet captain tyacke again he could not continue but when the marine guard and side party stood in swaying ranks to show respect one ship to another they saw only the two captains galbraith waited for the gig to bear off from the side and watched some of his own seamens eyes critical or impressed as their station dictated it was something no landsman would ever understand he thought he looked up at the men aloft and standing loosely by braces and halliards waiting for the next order their captain would tell them but everybody from the cooks slushmonkey to the elegant captain of royal marines would already know and soon sooner rather than later these guns would be in action again in earnest and without mercy he glanced towards lieutenant varlo who was up by the foremast with rist the masters mate the wardroom had been empty which was rare in any ship even the messmen had been elsewhere he had made certain of that there had been just the two of them varlo had been confident almost amused as he had told him what he thought of his behaviour in general and in particular over the flogging galbraith had lost his temper something he had sworn to avoid something he had wanted to do varlo had said offhandedly the captain could have told me himself if he had thought it important in all my experience ive never heard such abuse as first lieutenant you are entitled to dictate matters of duty if or when it is justified this is not ill take no insolence from any lout drunk or soberill see the backbones of anyone who tries it galbraith had listened to his own voice a different sound another person in all your experience i was forgetting forgive me he had seen the slight smile forming strangely it had helped flag lieutenant to a flag officer albeit a junior one but he thought highly of you his aide so much so that anybody might have expected further promotion the smile had gone at that point instead you were appointed to unrivalled to fill a dead mans shoes as it happens i know some who would have killed for the post but to a flag lieutenant surely something more promising should have been offered varlo had snapped hack i dont know what you mean it had gone far enough now he knew for certain soon they would fight he had said the admiral wanted to end it there your liaison varlo had stared at him stunned i le had seen him just now watching him from the foremast trunk shock fury and something far deeper how silent the wardroom had seemed even the sounds of rigging and timbers were stilled then varlo had said softly i lad we been ashore anywhere but in this ship i would have called you out and you would have danced to a different tune galbraith had walked to the door do your duty and remember that you rely on our people just as they poor devils have to depend on you ile had turned half expecting a blow or another threat and had said next time mister varlo ensure that the admiral is safely married eh the pretence was ended and call me out when and where you wish youll find one ready enough he could still hear the door slamming behind him and remembered the shock and the shame of his own words but no regrets get the ship under way if you please the captain was looking at him his hat still grasped in one hand i will speak to the people tomorrow it may be the last chance galbraith understood and turned to call a boatswains mate but something made him hesitate you can rely on me sir the other frigate was already spreading more canvas and going about the gig hoisted and stowed adam thought of her captain robert christie who had served under james tyacke at the nile we are of the same mould the same generation a face you could trust when the signal for close action was flying he felt the chill again the warning they would never meet again joseph sullivan the ships best lookout settled himself comfortably on his perch in the crosstrees and glanced down at the deck far below it was hard to believe that none of them down there could see what he could see not yet they had been roused early but nothing out of the normal run of things almost unhurried he thought but purposeful in earnest a good breakfast too he could still taste the thick slices of pork washed down with a pint or more of rough red wine and of course some rum a proper issue with officers and warrant ranks looking the other way when the older hands pulled out their hoarded supplies after all you never knew if it was the last tot in this world he looked across the bow and studied the array of ships they appeared still and unmoving in the morning sunlight but they were coming right enough a fleet the like of which they might never see again liners keeping perfect formation in the low breeze all sails set and drawing well considering not yet stripped for action frigates too staying up to windward ready to run down like terriers if the admiral so ordered dutchmen in their own squadron he drew his knife and carved himself a wedge of chewing tobacco he had been at sea almost all his life or all that he could remember he knew what was essential like the changing scarlet pattern of marines mere puppets from up here being arranged on the quarterdeck some to be stationed at hatchways and what the old hands called boltholes where a terrified man might run at the height of battle a marine would prevent it there was nowhere to run anyway but only experience taught you that sullivan was at a loss the fine model of his old ship spartiate which had stood in the line at trafalgar was finished it was hard to recall exactly when he had begun it in his last ship they had pulled his leg about it but he and the model were still here the others were not he peered down again more figures about now on edge wanting to get on with it get it over he saw steam rising from the sea alongside and loosened a last piece of pork from his teeth the galley fire had been doused almost time now he twisted round and looked at the shore no longer a shadow an unending barrier of sand and stone he could see the headland a sudden stab of light the sun reflecting from a window or telescope he measured it with his eye three miles it would be noon before they were close enough he thought of the captain yesterday when they had cleared lower deck to hear him speak from the quarterdeck it was strange at such times he thought unrivalled carried some souls of every age and rank and in a crowded hull you would expect to know every manjack of them and yet packed together on deck or clinging to shrouds and ratlines to listen you still found yourself beside someone you had never met before every manofwar no matter how crowded was divided by rank status and station soon the pattern would change again gun crews and powder monkeys sailhandling parties and men to repair damage he watched the land as if it had altered in some way others to drag away the wounded or to pitch the dead overboard the captain had told them about the christian slaves and the murder and persecution of helpless people taken at sea or on land in the deys name he had heard isaac dias the foulmouthed gun captain mutter they can only spare a few poxy schooners to put screws on the slave trade down south eh lads but its a whole bloody fleet for the christians it brought a few grins it did not do to fall out with unrivalleds best gun captain sullivan smiled to himself he was useless for anything else he wondered what the captain thought about it really thought his ship his men and his neck if things went badly wrong he had asked his coxswain about him but jago was as tight as a clam hell do me was his only reply funny for a man who had always loathed officers sullivan looked at the fleet again it was not possible but they were closer now he could see the cross of st george at the masthead of the big threedecker at the head of the line queen charlotte the admirals ship a hundred guns or more they said the enemy had prepared and wellsited artillery in all his years at sea he had heard the arguments about ships set against shoremounted guns he grinned who would be an admiral today he looked down between his bare feet at the great mainyard angled below him overlapping either beam young midshipman cousens had fallen across it when he had been thrown from up here if i had been with him he shut it from his mind he was not here another face had moved on he saw that the marines were climbing into the fightingtops marksmen and a few to handle the deadly swivel guns which could kill or maim more of your own mates than the enemy if badly laid and trained daisycutters invented by somebody who never had to use one he thought he realised that one of the marines was gesturing at him with his musket sullivan waved somebody was coming did he never sleep sullivan had seen the skylight shining throughout the night and had heard of him visiting the magazine where old stranace the gunner ruled the roost and even the sickbay where his servant shared the space with the man who had been flogged his lip curled because of mister bloody varlo like sandell he would not be missed he looked suddenly at his big rough hands scarred and pitted with tar but they could still fashion a perfect ships likeness would i be missed he watched the captain climb the last few feet hatless his brown face shining with sweat he was still able to smile a fine day for it sullivan surprisingly he thought of an earlier captain he had served in a boats crew he had accidentally brushed against the officer as they had come alongside the ship the captain had damned his eyes for it and had threatened to have him charged with assault but at least you knew where you were with a bloodyminded tyrant sullivan was close enough to reach out and touch him a man like himself without the authority and the articles of war he sighed it was no use jago was probably right he saw the captain touch his side and take some deep breaths his eyes first on the shore then up to the masthead pendant as if to take the measure of the wind adam was aware of the lookouts scrutiny one of unrivalleds best seamen but more than that like one of a ships strongest timbers the men you lead he studied the array of ships and wondered how the brooding land mass would appear to the admiral like sailing into a giant trap he checked the wind again almost easterly as cristie had assured him it would he this day off this patch of the coast its more likely easterly than westerly very definite it is hed said it without a trace of a smile perhaps it was something he had had drummed into him many years ago in this same sea he thought suddenly of the studio at the old house with the ruined chapel deserted now empty she would know all about these waters when the pharaohs had ruled and before that another world he looked at sullivan noon sullivan nodded as near as hells kitchen sir they both laughed and some of the marines in the maintop leaned out to try and hear he looked down at the ship again undisturbed unhurried as he had intended it would be hard enough for them to stand to their guns and take the first onslaught without all the usual clamour and call to arms but soon now very soon he pictured midshipman deighton with his telescope trained on the flagship just one signal and unrivalled with halcyon close astern would lead the attack galbraith had said when they had discussed the possibilities simple enough if you dont think too much about it surprisingly relaxed even cheerful he would need all of that today if only he had been able to sleep but it had evaded him except once when he had fallen into an exhausted doze neither one thing nor the other then he had seen her watched her fighting her screams silent but no less terrible the shapeless beastlike forms holding her down exploring her nakedness tormenting and entering her he had awakened fighting off the blanket his body running with sweat calling her name he had almost expected napier to burst in from the pantry but as his mind quietened he had remembered that he was still in the sickbay he had dragged on his shirt and gone through the ship speaking with watchkeepers or men who were merely squatting on deck like himself unable to sleep without knowing what he had said or heard in reply but the dream had remained stark and terrible as it must have been he had found napier asleep the confined space heavy with rum obeirne had been there with one of his assistants checking his instruments which had glittered and shivered on the table as if they were alive he had said he took it well sir it was a deep incisioni found the thing after a struggle he had almost smiled brave lad his only worry seems to be that he wants to be with you when the action begins adam had put his hand on the boys bare shoulder and had seen the frown ease away from his unconscious face as if he had known you shall have your pony ride my lad be sure of that he had left the others staring after him he came out of his thoughts and realised that the foretop had also been occupied by a squad of marines he looked at the land a thousand guns or more again he tested his feelings but there was no fear no uncertainty it was more like a dull acceptance he felt inside his breeches pocket the little note was there all he had he thrust his leg out from the crosstrees and waited for the pain there was none that too was numb he said remember sullivan he grinned the youthful eyes very bright in an old seamans face aye sir for th king then as if surprised at what he was doing he reached out and shook hands adam took his time pausing occasionally to stare through the rigging at the panorama of ships and sails and men hundreds of them into the inevitable i want you in the van he swung out and around the shrouds and dropped the last few feet to the deck cristie gave him a quick crinkled smile captain luxmore the true soldier as galbraith had called him looked as if he were about to mount a parade or a guard of honour the new wheel was fully manned midshipman deighton assisted by young martyns a mere child was with his small party of men by the flag locker bellairs rist and varlo who was up forward again by the first division of eighteenpounders unsmiling even subdued he wondered what galbraith had said to him high above the main deck the chainslings had already been shackled to the yards to prevent heavy spars falling on to men working at sails or guns nets would be spread as well and most of the boats cast adrift before they closed still further with the land always a bad moment for the sailors in any ship but necessary flying splinters cut down more men than any solid shot two small fifers were standing by the weather side moistening their instruments with their tongues their eyes on their captain but only their drums would be used this day jago walked towards him eyes very calm but watchful no doubt taking in the breeches smeared with tar after his descent and the open shirt the neckcloth tied loosely around his bare throat he was hatless and wearing the familiar seagoing coat with its faded and tarnished lace jago nodded in silent approval as if he was putting his seal on it no foolish chances today but still the captain he held up his arms and jago clipped the old sword into place deightons voice shattered the momentary stillness from flag sir prepare for battle acknowledge jago said weve heard that a few times eh sir adam grinned and impetuously seized his arm it had been a close thing jago must have seen just how close he said and a few more yet old friend he swung away without seeing jagos relief come on you drummers beat to quarters and clear for action he felt the waiting figures hesitate and then come alive as if something far stronger controlled them adam looked up at the long masthead pendant streaming out now pointing the way men stampeding to their stations screens being torn down the hull alive with noise and purpose a ship of war it was now captains legacy adam bolitho glanced at the compass and strode to the packed hammock nettings to train his telescope in those few paces he saw the helmsmen watching the peak of the driver flapping now as a warning while unrivalled held as close to the wind as was possible in the gentle pressure off the land so slow so slow he steadied the glass and watched the jagged spur of land reaching out towards the ships it was as he remembered it the rough landscape where it was sometimes hard to distinguish between the country itself and the crumbling fortifications and weathered towers built of sandcoloured stone which looked older than time itself he swung the glass across the quarter halcyon was holding on station a second ensign hoisted now clean and very bright above the tanned sails and scarred hull their other companion the gun brig magpie was further astern tiny against the great array of sails where the fleet was on its final approach adam returned to the quarterdeck rail and saw several of the seamen look up at him from the nearest eighteenpounders so many times and yet you were never certain he ran his eyes along the length of the ship the decks had been sanded to prevent men slipping in the height of battle and to soak up the blood of the first to fall that was always the hardest to accept not that men would die but that they were faces and voices you knew of which you had become a part he saw the slowmatches each in a bucket of sand beside every gun it was still not unknown for the modern flintlock to fail because of a gun captains haste or over eagerness to beat the others to a first broadside the nets were spread overhead and the boat tier was empty so that the deck seemed more spacious than it should the gig and jollyboat were towing astern the rest were well away by now drifting to a canvas sea anchor waiting for the victor to recover them no matter which flag was still flying the land was curving away again like the neck of a poachers bag he trained the glass ahead moving to avoid shrouds and stays or faces intent as they leaped into the lens he could see the main anchorage exactly as it was described in the orders and as his uncles flag lieutenant avery had reported after that first visit adam lowered the glass and stared into the distance there were ships at anchor some no doubt waiting to attack and harry the slowmoving vessels of lord exmouths fleet once his intentions were recognised he had heard four bells chime but precisely when he could not remember it was a wonder that the seaman had kept his head and was able to mark the hour sullivan had been right they had closed the land at noon that was two hours ago he looked at the gun crew directly below him stripped and ready their bodies shining with sweat neckerchiefs tied around their ears cutlasses freshly sharpened at the grindstone and within reach another glance aloft the big yards were braced so tightly that they appeared almost foreandaft she was as closehauled as she would come he heard the wheel creak sharply and one of the helmsmen mutter something as if to silence it he saw galbraith by the starboard ladder speaking with rist masters mate and williams the gunners mate who had been with him on the chebeck raid he dabbed his lips with his sleeve a fetime ago bellairs called flagship is altering course sir adam moved the glass it was impossible to imagine the strength and effort now responding to exmouths signal ponderous slow and some badly out of station but the ships were moving as one their shapes lengthening as they tacked like floating leviathans towards the shore it was still too far but he could imagine the lines of guns running out the muscle and sweat of hundreds of men like these around him preparing to match their skills against the enemy if lord exmouth had been expecting some lastminute submission he would be disappointed the dey was relying on his massive armament adam thought of that brief meeting trick for trick exmouth was still a frigate captain at heart there was a dull bang the sound dragged out by echoes from the land then they saw the ball splash down before ripping across the water like an enraged dolphin cristie had his watch in one hand but his voice was almost indifferent make a note in the log mr bremner at half past two oclock the enemy opened fire adam turned away nothing seemed to unsettle the old sailing master he had even remembered the name of the midshipman who had only recently joined the ship like a rock the man who had been born in the next street to collingwood perhaps the watchers on the shore had expected the fleet to sail directly into the anchorage loose off a few shots at long range and then go about without risking the mauling of close action if so they were wrong a flag dipped above the queen charlotte and the air was split apart by the crash of gunfire unlike any broadside it went on without cease guns firing and reloading with barely a pause the bay and the land already covered by drifting smoke what the gun crews must have trained for all the way from plymouth and from gibraltar to this mark on the chart adam gripped the rail and felt the vibration of the bombardment jerking at the wood as if some of the shots had smashed down alongside he thought of his own service in a ship of the line and knew that halcyons captain would be remembering it also the incredible din which scraped the inner walls of a mans mind so that only drill and discipline saved him from madness down on those gun decks the overhead timbers brushing your hair the confined space thick with smoke and the stench of burning powder and only an open port beyond each crew a hazy outline or shadow which had to be the enemy sponge out load run out ready nothing else existed adam called two points mr cristie steer sou by west it was impossible but he could feel his mouth fixed in a grin thatll give her more freedom he swung round to watch a twisting column of sparks rising far beyond the nearest ships perhaps one had blown up or a random shot had found its mark in one of the citadels magazines nobody could survive that lie beckoned to jago we shall be up to the anchorage directly keep with mr galbraith lie lifted the glass again and held his breath until he had found the vessel in question a schooner moored apart from all the others he moved the glass slightly and saw the frigate anchored foreandaft a floating battery another manofwar lying just beyond her guarding the anchorage the ships which were the jeys lifeblood you know what to do yes lie realised that jago had remained silent iie looked at him his ears cringing to yet another tremendous explosion and saw the expression he had come to recognise since that day when they had settled on a handshake jago said flatly my place is ere with you he saw lieutenant varlo hurry past with a party of seamen let irn go adam contained his sudden anger i did not hear that luke he waved his hand towards the anchored ships that schooner is our weapon the wind is right boat action over quickly trust me jago touched the doublebladed weapon at his belt burn the bastards out before they can cut an run adam nodded or get amongst the fleet some of our ships will be in a had way by now jago frowned his eyes elsewhere recalling another battle perhaps he said shortly gig an jollyboat might leave you shortanded he glanced at somebody below the rail some still wet behind the cars if you gets boarded lie looked at him and shrugged you command sir adam felt his limbs shaking not fear it was worse the madness just being here it made no sense and never would jago was staring around already seeking faces names im ready he swung himself down the ladder his eyes still lifted to the quarterdeck to the helmsmen barely moving as the sails filled again to the wind even that was full of acrid smoke and when you looked astern it seemed the whole fleet had been swallowed up in it broken here and there by flashes of gunfire and the lasting patterns of burning timbers like a scene from hell this deck was quiet by comparison cristie beside his small rigged table his eyes moving restlessly from masthead pendant to compass from individual sails to his masters mates and assistants midshipman deighton at the flag locker bellairs waiting to make more sail and the marines in position behind the hammock nettings their only protection when the time came jago said watch yer back sir then he was gone more flashes darted through the smoke from the anchorage this time adam winced as iron thudded into the lower hull not dangerous he tried not to move or to wipe his face even the slightest change in behaviour might be seen as doubt or loss of confidence the frigate which was anchored foreandaft fired again but the shots were haphazard the gun crews perhaps confused by the spreading barrier of smoke adam crossed to the side and looked for the brig she was holding on station it was only too easy to close on one another if only for a false sense of security he heard cristie say thats the same ship sir no yankee colours this time god rot him adam felt someone beside him it was napier his eyes defiant as if he expected the worst but adam said only stay with me david get down if i tell you he saw the youth nod and then bite his lip as he took the weight on his injured leg the surgeon said adam gripped his shoulder i can imagine what he saidmuch as he did to me i have no doubt some seamen at the quarterdeck ninepounders watched and nudged one another the captain passing the time of day with his servant as if they were still at plymouth it could not be that bad galbraith was here he looked very alert no more time left for mistakes ready sir im taking rist as my secondincommandhes a good hand williams has made up the charges i already know what he can do adam did not look away as a ragged broadside crashed and echoed across the anchorage bellairs exclaimed halcyons hit sir adam shut it from his mind and concentrated on galbraith a good officer who was used to taking risks who was about to lay his life on the line yet again who wanted his own command and was watching halcyons foretopmast stagger and then pitch down into the water alongside as if he was seeing his own ship under fire i shall come about as soon as you slip the boats if everything goes against us then make your own way to the fleet as you see fit leigh i already know what you can do too galbraith touched his hat and ran lightly down the ladder shouting orders as he went he paused only once to stare across at halcyon as she was raked by another full broadside then he too was gone adam saw partridge turn and wave his arm the boats had cast off and they were already pulling like madmen towards the anchorage he measured the distance as if he were studying a giant chart varlo would remain up forward to direct the guns when unrivalled came about that inner voice persisted ifthe wind holds he could also be called to command if the worst happened and the quarterdeck became a bloody shambles he looked around at bellairs with the afterguard captain luxmore with sergeant bloxham and his marines he had already sent his lieutenant cochrane to cover and protect the carronade crews on the forecastle he saw midshipman deighton staring at him over his signal locker and his unexpected smile when adam tossed him a casual wave casual it was like raising the dead stand by on the quarterdeck cristie was waiting slightly hunched as if anticipating a stray shot beside him the boy ede who had been spared the rope for an attempted murder made an unlikely companion on the threshold of battle cristie had proclaimed that none of his navigational equipment had ever been in such good hands it was praise indeed he counted seconds all else but the narrowing triangle of smokehazed water thrust aside another quick glance aloft the masthead pendant was lifting and falling as before but steady the wind held his hand had found the folded note he had crammed into his breeches pocket lowenna in the old cornish tongue it meant joy he swallowed but his mouth was dry so it will be ready ho put the helm down he had to shout above the noise of wind and canvas and the continuous thunder of the distant battle and because of his heart which surely those around him must hear helm alee sir they were beginning to turn to swing the jibboom across the anchored shipping as if they and not unrivalled were moving off tacks and sheets adam stared above the heads of running men while the ship continued to answer the wheel until she was pointing directly into the wind run out the larboard battery i le drew his sword and found time to imagine unrivalled as she exposed her opposite side to the anchored frigate they would have been expecting an immediate challenge and they would have been ready run out he gripped the boys shoulder and knew he must he hurting him badly he saw the guns lurch against the side muzzles lifting to the thrust of wind and wheel as if to sniff out their old enemy the sword was above his head all else was forgotten even the tearing crash of iron slamming into the hull meant nothing not a voice he recognised as you bear lads fire lieutenant leigh galbraith half rose from his place in the gigs sternsheets as another ragged broadside crashed across the water he saw the flashes reflected in the stroke oarsmans eyes but forced himself not to turn it seemed so much deadlier more personal in spite of the unbroken thunder of heavier weapons which as far as he could tell had not stopped since the opening shots he had seen unrivalleds topgallants taut and filling again as she came fully round on to the opposite tack had heard the squeal of blocks and imagined the shouted commands and stamping feet while men threw the full weight of their bodies and souls on braces and halliards then the broadsides unrivalleds and the sharper bark of the brig magpies ninepounders as she sailed deliberately amongst the anchored shipping here in the gig it was all so different like being a spectator or a victim without the usual stealth and cunning of a boat attack he felt the heavy pistol at his side the hanger already loosened in its scabbard puny against the thunder of battle ships of the line matched against the deys batteries the smoke over the town was thicker than ever the fires rising through it the gun crews probably half blinded and too dazed even to be afraid he said ease the stroke coxn well lose the jollyboat if were not careful he thought he heard jago grunt and saw the quick exchange between him and the stroke oar the jollyboat was abeam heavier and slower because of williams explosives and some extra hands to allow for opposition and sudden death he twisted round as another broadside cracked through the smoke the anchored frigate was still firing but the rate was slower unrivalleds sudden attack had worked there were more shots on a different bearing probably halcyon wounded or not she was well able to hit back galbraith peered ahead as two anchored barges loomed through the haze he found he was gripping the hanger as if to steady himself the schooner lay directly beyond them he saw the bowman on his feet with the swivel gun on the stemhead there would only be time for one shot after that jago muttered there she is the schooners counter seemed to loom through the smoke galbraith measured the distance one grapnel would suffice each man was handpicked they all knew what to do how to die without complaint if their officer made a mistake he knew jago was looking at him probably thought him mad anyway if he could actually grin in the face of death someone hissed boat sir larboard bow it should not have been there a major battle was in progress nobody sane or sober would venture out from a safe mooring there were wild shouts and a sudden crack of musket fire galbraith heard and felt the balls smacking into the hull saw the stroke oarsman throw up his hands and fall across his thwart the oar trailing outboard like an extra rudder he shouted fire man rake the bastards so close to the water the bang of the swivel gun was deafening the packed canister smashing into the other boat at almost pointblank range the oars were in total confusion the boat slewing round in a welter of spray the air torn apart by the screams of men scythed down by the blast the bowman stumbled aft to help push the stroke oarsman over the gunwale and take his place it all took time galbraith glanced at the corpse as it floated astern turning slightly on one shoulder as if to watch them press on without him more shots now from overhead galbraith gasped as a blow flung him hard against the tiller bar as if a whitehot bar of iron had been dragged across his back he could even smell the cloth of his coat burning then jagos hard hands as he tore it away and slapped a wad of rags across the wound but no pain just breathlessness as though he had been kicked jago said sharply easy mr galbraith well get you fixed up good as new he turned as the jollyboat passed abeam oars rising and falling without cease as if they had only now cast off from the ships side frank rist can manage he felt galbraith turn to listen to understand and added he always wanted a bloody command of is own anyway then the pain did come and galbraith found himself lying by the first stretcher his head propped on somebodys hat he was alive but all he could think of was that he had failed jago held out a hand oars he gauged the overhanging stern young deighton would have enjoyed this he thought vaguely but his mind was still like ice ready in the bows he heard the hiss of steel being drawn and knew a couple of them were armed with hoardingaxes he trusted that the grapnel had been thrown and lurched to his feet as the gig came under the counter with a violent jerk a swivel gun exploded it seemed only a few feet away and for an instant he imagined that the schooners crew had been ready and waiting for them instead he heard a wild whoop and knew it was williams the mad welshman at em lads then he was clawing his way up and over the stern with all the others he paused only to peer down at the gig where galbraith lay where he had been dragged into a safer position he even grinned bloody officers frank rist masters mate had heard the burst of firing and the swivel guns murderous response as ordered he had brought the jollyboat alongside he knew he would have done it in any case even if a friend is cut down in battle dont offer your hand or its your turn next he rubbed his stinging eyes the smoke was everywhere miles and miles of it he swore silently as his boots skidded on blood and fragments of flesh there had only been one man to challenge them and he had taken the full blast of canister all on his own some other whimpering shapes had been seized without even a struggle the anchor watch were alone on board eight men in all one had tried to escape but a boardingaxe had stopped him in his tracks a splash alongside told the rest he found that he could relax albeit holding his nerves on a leash he heard the battle roaring in the background men being killed and maimed ships disabled or sunk it was all meaningless in the distance and the smoke and unrivalleds guns had stopped firing with her two consorts she would be waiting he stared around the unfamiliar deck scarcely able to believe it because of us he heard williams calling to one of his mates pictured his nimble fingers twisting and fixing fuses like that other time with the chebecks galbraith had been there then he thought williams was humming to himself unconcerned about everything beyond his immediate reach rist felt himself smile the madness of a fight williams would probably lay a bet on the outcome of this raid down to the last minute although he was a powerful man he made his strength seem effortless rist had seen him pick up a handspike and use it to train an eighteenpounder gun to explain something to a green landman at plymouth he had used no more effort than somebody moving a chair up to a table but a gentle man in many ways despite his trade of gunners mate like the time he had carried the young black girl in his arms on board that damned slaver when her master had recognised him or thought he had from the past the girl had been abused so badly that it was unlikely she would recover it was common enough but she had not said a word or protested once when williams had carried her to her own people when by rights she should have seen him as just another white devil williams could have been promoted long ago but for his love of gambling with hirn it was like lust and discipline or not nothing would change him dice or simply laying odds on the most common daily occurrence how many knots sailed in a single watch or how much rum would be consumed in one mess in the course of a week he had a loyal group of fellow gamblers his clutch as he called them and as he was able to read and write he was the one who kept a tally of the wins and more likely the losses rist had heard some of them say they had already laid down their slaveand prizebounty in williams care and they had not even received it yet williams was his own man if he liked you it was enough if you pushed him too far then beware it had all been so quick if mister bloody sandell had not been nosing around between decks when he should have been standing watch it would not have happened maybe the midshipman had heard something and was out to prove himself but he was there that morning when williams had been returning to his mess after yet another secret session with the clutch sandell had probably attempted to seize the list of bets or even some of the money as evidence it was all so fast you would never know for sure one moment there had been the two of them williams towering over the irate gesticulating midshipman then there was only williams sandell had fallen back against one of the carronades his head striking the iron smasher dead or unconscious the sea had received him and bloody good riddance he swung round guiltily as williams shouted done frank cut the cable and well be going rist hurried forward and called cut it lads he stared ahead at the overlapping shapes of anchored vessels they would soon do the same when they saw a fireship drifting down on them a seaman shouted look out it was almost a scream one of the anchor watch must have hidden below undiscovered when the boarding party had swarmed up from the boats he just seemed to rise out of the deck from a small hatch which nobody had cared to investigate fist aimed his pistol he did not even recall having drawn it the two shots sounded as one he ran to help williams who had fallen to his knees the other man had no time even to cry out as a cutlass smashed into his skull where is it owen other hands were helping but rist and williams were completely alone williams said thickly its a bad one frank this time i think his head lolled and he groaned as if to bite back the agony rist could feel the blood on his hand running over his wrist a bad one he had seen enough of them well get you to the boat williams tried to protest but the pain held it back then he said in an almost normal tone you too busy to see the wind man its shifted not much but a bit enough see rist stared around i dont give a damn with sudden strength williams pulled himself up to the schooners wheel gasping with pain he slowly wrapped and fastened the oldstyle crossbelt he always wore around and through the spokes so that it took his weight get to the boats frank time to move see nothing more you can do the shipll need you now somebody asked what d you say mr rist for a moment longer he stared up at the masts and the loosely flapping jib a command of his own what he had always wanted he shrugged as if to the world what galbraith wanted too although he would never admit it he looked down as a hand gripped his rist lowered his head until their faces almost touched feeling the agony the sudden determination what is it owen williams gripped his hand harder you saw me frank that morning i knew you did lie fought a bout of coughing there was blood on his shirt rist heard the distant guns it could not last he had others to think of yes i saw it and you never said he tried to smile but it only made it worse save yourself see time to go cut the cable now he reached out suddenly and rist heard the sharp click of his flintlock the realisation seemed to freeze him but he could see it stark and clear in his mind williams had fired the fuse cut the cable billy into the boats the rest of you the deck was deserted the only sound the regular thud of a heavy axe he heard williams mutter a life for a life see frank so i was taught cut the seaman was already running aft to the waiting boats rist stood motionless seeing the wheel respond to the hands the jib hardening enough to swing the hull very slightly adrift and at any second the fuses would blow then he ran aft his leg over the rail even as the first muffled explosion spurted sparks through the forehatch voices were yelling at him to jump he thought he had heard galbraith too but all he could think of was the figure strapped to the schooners wheel and how strong his welsh accent had sounded in the face of death itself someone thrust a bottle into his hands it was rum like fire in his throat he raised the bottle again and murmured all bets down my friend then the world exploded hold your fire adam had to shout twice to gain varlos attention the guns had fired three broadsides the havoc on the other frigates deck easy to see despite the smoke and confusion perhaps their forecastle party had been cut down in the first doubleshotted onslaught when unrivalled had come about to show her true intention the ship was swinging now moored only by her forward cable the stream anchor aft having been cut to escape the second broadside purpose or panic it mattered little now but the blazing schooner galbraith and his two boats had boarded had been enough for the crowded shipping which had been relying on the warships moored broadsides the fireship had become entangled with another schooner and both were now drifting like one huge torch even as he watched adam saw another smaller vessel catch fire the flames leaping up the sundried rigging and turning the sails into scattered ashes he heard warning shouts from the maintop and saw two oared galleys sweeping past the other ships turning as one towards unrivalled and increasing speed to the urgent beat of a drum such fanatical daring should have achieved a better settlement but the brig magpie was ready and raked the leading galley with canister and grape in an instant changing it to a shattered wreck the second paid no heed and met with more grape from unrivalleds larboard carronades the long sweeps splintered like boxwood as the galley lurched and shuddered alongside in the next instant figures were swarming up and over the gangway only to be confronted by the boarding nets probably something they had never before encountered men snatched up cutlasses and axes while others dragged the deadly boardingpikes from the racks and impaled the screaming crazed attackers before they had even cut through the nets and yet there were a few who managed to hack their way past the defences one a bearded giant marked out from the others by a scarlet robe reached the quarterdeck ladder his eyes fixed on the man he recognised as captain adam had his sword balanced in his hand loosely some of the others might have thought as if he no longer cared he saw the great blade swing down heard someone napier perhaps yell out a warning like being someone else able to measure the weight and force of the blow he felt it lance through his arm heard the scream of steel as the two blades crossed the heavier blade sliding down to lock against the hilt of his sword he could even smell his attacker feel the overwhelming hate which excluded everything else he stepped aside gasping as pain seared his wounded side but keeping his balance as the giant lunged forward it was the madness the moment when risk and caution meant nothing if anything he felt lightheaded and knew only that he wanted to kill this man a shadow sliced across the smoky sunshine and he saw the giant reel aside eyes still blazing as he pitched down the ladder the hard man campbell wielding a cutlass with both hands like a claymore had almost severed his head from his body campbell turned now showing his mutilated back the evidence of a dozen or more floggings with something like a gladiators triumph adam raised the old sword to him thank you campbell streaked with blood his own or that of his victims gave a mock bow your servant capn and then all at once impossible though it was it was over like a sudden deafness left when the last broadsides have exploded adam grasped the quarterdeck rail and stared along his command the dead lay where they had dropped as if they had fallen asleep others reached out as grimfaced seamen and marines hurried around and over them the wretched wounded a captains legacy so that he should not forget midshipman deighton shouted from flag sir discontinue the action adam tried to sheathe his sword but it was sticky with blood the signal made no sense someone had removed the sword and was wiping it clean with a piece of rag he looked at napier and wanted to smile but his lips would not move you did well david your mother he made another attempt i am proud of you small but stark pictures stood out like those first moments the waiting the aftermath was even worse bellairs sitting on a water barricoe his face in his hands the fine sword his parents had given him to mark his commission as lieutenant discarded at his feet its blade also stained with blood and now yovell coming from below for the first time from the orlop where he had been helping the surgeon with the wounded and the dying staring around a length of soiled bandage trailing from one pocket a man wrestling with his beliefs and the boats returning alongside rist hurrying to the quarterdeck peering at the planking pockmarked with musket balls from the enemys sharpshooters and at the dark bloodstains where men had stood together and had died lastly he had looked at cristie the old sailingmaster and remarked almost casually you got through it then and cristie looking and feeling his age who had never quit this deck throughout the attack had smiled perhaps because he knew what rist had expected and replied got through what mr rist adam walked to the hammock nettings his hand feeling the torn canvas where musket balls had cut through the tightlypacked bedding some had been meant for him the bombardment was over through the pall of drifting smoke he could see the freshly set sails lord exmouths fleet on the move again withdrawing the casualties would be terrible but not a ship had been lost on the shore there were fires raging and the guns were silent many must have been buried with their crews when the old fortifications had crumbled under exmouths barrage he recalled his own relief when he had seen galbraith being helped aboard in pain but quietly determined like a man who had discovered something in himself which he had not suspected and the moment when galbraith his wounded shoulders covered by a seamans jacket had paused by varlo at the place where he had controlled every gun and every man of the full broadside galbraith had said you did well varlo had halfsmiled and retorted go to hell and now they were leaving this place many vessels had been destroyed or left abandoned the enemy barque had not been one of them they would meet again he gripped the nettings until the pain in his side reawakened and tomorrow lord exmouth would demand that all his previous terms be met the dey would have no choice he turned away from the smoke and the fires turn the hands to mr bellairs we will prepare to get under way he stared along the ship yet again the first in the last to leave and they had done it he looked at the dead where some had been dragged from the places they had lain to clear the guns recoil one was a marine officer his face covered with a bloodied cloth lieutenant cochrane unrivalled was his first ship move yourselves he walked to the rail again a captain must never show weakness his authority was his armour it was all he had bellairs called shall we put them over sir adam stared down at him so simply asked was that all it took he said no well bury them when we clear the land he saw yovell watching him perhaps you could read a suitable prayer mr yovell afterwards he thought it was like seeing yovells despair clear away another memory had been sparked all he needed for all of us sir and tomorrow galbraith straightened his back in spite of the bandage and said quietly here comes halcyon adam walked to the opposite side feeling their eyes following him the helmsman sergeant bloxham leaning on a musket on which the bayonet was still fixed midshipman deighton his telescope still trained on the distant ships gnawing his lip to make a lie of his composure and jago watching the slowmoving frigate feeling her pain sharing it foremast shot away sails riddled with holes the hull gouged by gunfire at close quarters magpie was following astern she had been in the thick of it but looked unmarked by comparison the second ensign halcyon had hoisted when the flagship had made the signal prepare for battle had been lowered to halfmast for the man who had been tyackes midshipman at the nile and had loved his ship above all else both ship and captain had fought their last fight adam climbed into the shrouds as if something had snapped releasing him from frozen immobility and shouted a cheer lads give them all you have he waved and imagined he saw a telescope being trained from halcyons splintered quarterdeck then he climbed down and felt jagos hand steady his arm it must be the smoke the fight had continued all afternoon it would soon be dusk he stared around at the damage his mind dulled by unrivalleds wild cheering which halcyons people would always remember even when they were sent to other ships he said pipe the hands to the braces if you please if only his eyes would stop smarting he looked at the anchorage again already hidden in smoke and shadow unrivalled was the last to leave as ordered and tomorrow he heard jago remark our gig will need more than a couple of new planks when we gets home sir yes he did not trust himself to say more home had a new meaning now jago watched him and was satisfied like his ship he thought second to none
