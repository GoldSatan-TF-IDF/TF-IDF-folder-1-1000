stephen hunter night of thunder the fifth book in the bob lee swagger series for my daughter amy as the wonderful person she is but also as the symbol for the young american reporter speed is of the essence anonymous part i prelims one brother richard liked it loud he punched the ipod up all the way until the music hammered his brain its force beating away like some banshee howl from the high dark mountains hidden behind the screen of rushing trees he was holding at eightyfive miles per hour even through the turns though that took a surgeons skill a miracle of guts and timing the music roared sinnerman where you gonna run to gonna run to the sea sea wont you hide me run to the sea sea wont you hide me but the sea it was aboilin all on that day it was that oldtime religion fierce and haunted harsh unforgiving it was baptist fire and brimstone his fathers fury and anguish it was negroes in church afeared of the flames of hell it was the roar of a hot primergray v cuda in the night as good old boys in sheets raised their own particular kind of hell driven by white lightning or too much dixie or too much hate it was the south arising under the red snapping of the flag of the confederacy he rode the corner perfectly leftfooting the brake and coming off it at the precise moment so that he came out of the hairpin at full power it was late it was dark it was quiet except of course for the thunder of the engine his right foot involuntarily pressed pedal to metal and the car leapt forward breaching the century mark now now right at deaths edge right near to and within spitting distance of oblivion and he loved it a crack in the window seal sending a torrent of air to beat his hair sinnerman where you gonna run to gonna run to the moon moon wont you hide me run to the moon moon wont you hide me but the moon it was ableedin all on that day a climb and then a sudden turn it was iron mountain and slashed crookedly up its angry hump he hit brake felt the car slide saw the great whiz of dust white in the headlamp beams as he slipped to shoulder felt the grit as the stilled tires fought the gravel and ripped it free but the skid was controlled never close to loss and as the car slowed he downshifted to second lurched ahead and caught the angle of the turn just right pealing back across the asphalt and leaving the dust explosion far behind as he found the new perfect vector and powered onward into the night if you thought you were in the presence of a young prince of the south high on octane and testosterone and the beat of an old and comforting spiritual youd be wrong brother richard was by no means young he was a thin ageless man with a curiously dead facea recent surgery had remolded his physiognomy into something generally bland and genericand he was well enough dressed to pass for a preacher or a salesman or a dentist in a gray suit white shirt and black tie all neat all cheap straight off the rack at mr sams big store near the interstate youd never look at him and see the talent for driving that was so special to his being or the aggression that fueled it or the hatred that explained the aggression or the bleakness of spirt and utter capability or even his profession which was that of assassin nikki swagger girl reporter it was funny it was corny but she liked it and smiled whenever she conjured it to mind nikki swagger girl reporter it was true enough nikki twentyfour was the police reporter for the bristol courierherald of bristol tnva tnva was an odd construction and its oddity expressed an odd reality the newspaper served a single city set in two entities half in the volunteer state half in the old dominion state the border ran smack through the city a burg of one hundred thousand set in the southernmost reaches of the shenandoah valley where one state became another it was horse country it was farm country it was quarry country but most of all and especially this time of year it was nascar country race week was coming and soon one of tennessees smaller cities would become one of its larger as three hundred fifty thousand citizens of nascar nationsome would call it budweiser nationcame to town for the sharpie a week and days away one of the premier sprint cup events on the circuit nikki couldnt wait but for now nikki drove her volvo down tennessees state route from mountain city johnson countys county seat twentyodd miles out of bristol she drove carefully as the road wound down the slope of a mountain called iron switchbacking this way and that to eat up the steep elevation she knew she had to be wary for it was full dark visibility was limitedsometimes interstate rigs came piling up on the verge of chaos and hurt taking a shorter emptier route at night between podunk destinationsand to her life was still one great adventure and she wanted to enjoy every single second of it she checked the speedometer and saw she was under forty which seemed about right and the world beyond her windshield consisted of two cones of light which illuminated the next or so feet a narrow ribbon on asphalt and curves that came and went with breathtaking abruptness she was an excellent driver possibly because shed studied the nature of vehicles in space so assiduously in her western girlhood where besides horses shed spent years in toughasnails gokarting and had the medals and scars to prove it as well as several roomfuls of trophies and ribbons and photos of herself the girl in the pictures was beautiful as always but equally as always slightly disheveled and usually posed in a caged car about quartersize in the pictures always were her mother a handsome fair woman who looked as if she stepped out of a howard hawks movie and should have been named slim and her father whose military heritage seemed inscribed in the leather of a spartan shield that comprised the perpetually tanned hide of his smileless face down the mountain she went at a carefully controlled and agilely sustained forty per her mind alight with possibility shed been in the county seat all day and talked to dozens of people the subject being her specialty as a crime reporter methamphetamine issues methcalled crystal called ice called killer dust called purple death called angel breath called the whispering crazies called whateverhaunted johnson county tennessee as it haunted most of rural america it was cheap it was more or less easily made though it did have a tendency to explode in the kitchen labs of the trailers and shacks where it was manufactured and it hit like a sledgehammer people loved the first few minutes of the high and didnt remember the last few minutes where they put their newbornin the oven or down the well or just on the clothesline they didnt remember beating their spouse to death with a hoe or a brick or wandering down the interstate shotgun in hand shooting at those strange things roaring by that turned out to be cars people got themselves in a whole mess of trouble on meth not after every usage but often enough so that lots of ugliness happened shed seen families sundered hideous crimes law enforcement compromised by the abundant profit dealers shot or slashed to death in alleyways or cornfields the whole spectrum of big city dope woe played out in noname towns the new york times had never heard of and no movies had ever been made about she was the scourges scribe its homer its melville its stephen crane even if no one had ever heard of her either as she drove she puzzled over several eccentricities her daylong trip had uncovered the nominal reason for the trip was to go on a meth raid with sheriff reed wells the exranger officer whod returned home to clean up the county as the saying went and who had talked the justice department into leaning on the department of defense and had somehow acquired a muchbeaten but stillviable blackhawk helicopter to permit scouting and airborne tactical consideration in fact shed spent the morning airborne sitting next to the handsome fellow as he maneuvered his troops down brushy mountain paths and coordinated a neat strike on a rusting trailer which in fact did turn out to house a smallscale meth lab nikki had seen the culprit a downonhisluck mountaineer named cubby holden arrested his apparatus hauled out into the yard and smashed by husky young deputies dressed up like tommy tactical action figures they loved every second of the game leaving behind a sallow woman two wormy kids and a hell of a mess in the yard a typical triumph for sheriff wells yet the problem was that meth prices despite his many strategic successes stayed stable in the tricities area the second and third cities along with bristol were johnson cityoddly not a part of johnson countyand kingsport she knew this from interviews with addicts at a state rehab clinic in mountain city kid told her he paid thirtyfive dollars a hit yesterday and two years ago it was thirtyfive dollars a hit now how could this be maybe there were a lot more labs out there than anybody knew maybe there was some kind of protected superlab maybe some southern crime family was running the stuff in from other places then she heard a strange rumor thought nothing of it picked it up again and had a few hours before dark it held that someone in the mountains was shooting up the night lots of ammo being burned blasting away somewhere down old route before it connected with the bigger newer now what could that be would that be the famous super meth lab hidden in some hollow invisible from the sky its security so professionally run it demanded its own set of tommy tacticals to handle perimeter duties and work out with their submachine guns every night rumor suggested that it lay in the pie of land around the nexus of the routes and night still being a bit off shed poked around there finding nothing except some kind of baptist prayer camp nesting behind a no trespassing sign that she ignored and upon arrival encountered a colonel sanders in a powder blue walmart suit who gave her a free bible and tried to get her to stay for supper she skipped the food but driving back down the dusty road to the highway it was just a piece of cardboard trapped by a snarl of weeds and held at a peculiar angle so the sun happened to light it yielding a color not found in forests in steamy augusts as well as right angles not found in any forest ever her eye caught it so she stopped and plucked it up something in it was familiar it was something official looking military at least governmentalequipment ammo something like that the scrap was torn rent by being crushed by passing vehicles but as her father was a noted shooter and always had boxes of weird stuff around she knew what this sort of thing could mean though only a bit of official print was still legible on the scrap but then she was disappointed as all thoughts of ammunition and explosives vanished she thought it might be biblical something baptist for it also carried religious connotations it had been bisected in its rough passage to its nest in the leaves and only a few symbols remained on the piece who knew what started the inscription but it ended in k though with dirt splashes and spots and crumples she wasnt sure about the colon but it made her think instantly of mark bullet or bible weirdly both she remembered the crazed waco standoff of her youth the gunfight the siege the fireandbrimstone ending that was something that somehow combined both bullets and bibles maybe that dynamic was in play here for the world in many places had not grown beyond killing on what was believed to be gods sayso on the other hand its just a scrap of cardboard by the road thats all it is it could have blown in and ended up here a million different ways maybe its just a function of my imagination the reporters distressing tendency to see more than whats there she tucked it in the bible that the old baptist minister had pressed upon her so it wouldnt get lost or crumpled in her briefcase and drove off in search of answers but a local gun store run by a bitter old man whod turned skank mean after a bit was of no help so she set about her drive home but now she thought my dad will know her dad knew stuff he was a great fighter once a famous marine and more recently had gone away for a while a few times and then come back always sadder sometimes with a new scar or two but he had a talentand in this world it was a valuable talentand the core of it was that he knew a certain thing or two in a certain arcane subject area he wasnt reliable on politics or movieshated em allbut he was superb in nature could read land wind and sky could track and hunt with anyone and in the odd sealed little world of guns and fighting with them he was the rough equivalent of a rock star never talked about it now and then shed catch him just staring off into space his face grave as he remembered a lifetime of near misses or wounds that healed hard and slow but then he shook off his pain and became funny and outrageous again and she knew that other men respected him in almost mythical ways because what so many of them dreamed of hed actually pulled off even if the details remained unspecific after his last absence hed returned with among other things a bad limp from being laid open across the hip and not stitched for several hours and an incurable depression or so she thought and then the depression was miraculously cured in a single afternoon when a japaneseamerican civil servant had delivereda new little sister miko adorable insatiable graceful full of love and adventure the family atmosphere lightened immeasurably and the family condition became extreme happiness even if over two weeks the old mans hair went from a glossy brown to a gunmetal gray and aged him ten or twenty years so her dad would know she pulled off the road not wanting to have the cell in her hand when a truck full of logs or canned goods came barreling up the other lane off a blind turn she got the cellular out of her purse the cars engine idling the silence of a dark mountain forest all around her she picked up the bible and plucked the scrap out holding it in one hand so she could describe it the phone rang and rang and rang until it finally produced her fathers recorded voice this is swagger leave a message but i probably wont call you back his sense of humor not everybody found it funny hey pop its me call me right away i have a question where was he probably sitting around with a crew of marine buddies laughing to hell and gone about master sergeants from another century or possibly out with miko teaching her to ride as he had taught nikki to ride so shed have to wait or would she she put the scrap back in the bible pulled out her laptop along in case she had to file remotely the question would there be a network out here and the answer wasta dayes wireless was everywhere she went to google and pumped in k and waited as the magic inside hunted down k s the world over and sent the information back through blue glow to her hmm nothing in any way connected to her issue so she went to mark and got marks words which made no sense to her context you have to have context arrgh nothing she wanted a cigarette but had been trying to quit but then she thought of her good friends from brazil who were taking over the world she requested amazoncom and instantly that empire responded a few tries at k yielded nothing except some technical gibberish a book on russian submarines another on world war ii ships called corvettes next she tried to work the bullet angle just in case and went to cartridges and got a lot of info maybe too much after scanning its contents courtesy of the amazonians she settled on a book the history of sniping and sharpshooting because it seemed to offer the broadest overview of the subject then hit the onetouch purchase option so that it would arrive soon that was stupid her dad would call well before then and explain all still it made her feel that she had done something positive she put the laptop away and checked this way and that for traffic preparing to edge onto the asphalt shed be home in an hour another day another dollar for nikki swagger girl reporterwhoa some redneck in a low black car came whipping by faster than light or sound man was the guy crazy or what shed never seen a car move like that a blur a low hum a whisper of streamline and chrome there and gone and then vanished forever was it a dream a vision something out of a nightmare it scared her not that these hills were haunted or anything but you could convince yourself of anything looking at fogshrouded hollows hairpin turns the dark carpeting of trees leading up to unseen peaks the networks of roads leading off to no trespassing signs and godknowswhatelse up them there were rumors of militia out here or some gang of outriders or klansmen or white supremacists or some such there was the business about shooters blazing away in the night an army of righteousness getting ready for its conquest this guy in his muscle car bolting along over a hundred miles an hour could have been an emissary from any of them no she told herself some kid too much beer he thinks hes some nascar hero these people love their drivers thats what a kids fancy would turn to she halfbelieved that in the next twenty miles shed come across the low black speed merchant on its side bleeding flame in a pulse of red light as the emergency service vehicles circled it and their crews tried to pull the hero now a crispy critter his soul in heaven from the flames she shivered then she slipped into gear and pulled out he saw her it was in a haze of speed but he made out the volvo and a young womans face caught in the glow of dash light shed pulled aside on the right nestling under trees and had been working at some task some continuation of the curiosity that had doomed her he saw in that flash of light a beautiful young face and he knew how close it was he was running out of mountain road and shed be a much harder kill without an iron wall of trees to drive her into on her right side why had he looked to the right at that moment who knew it was the sinnermans luck and even the sinnerman got lucky once in a while he slowed to eighty then found a wayside pulled over more deeply to await her brother richard punched the ipod and ran through his sinnerman options again beginning with the travelers going to the pure gospel of the reverend seabright kingly and his hebrew chorus that was funky and on to the personalityfree seekers then to les baxters balladeer winding through the highboring purity of shelby flint and finishing up with the arrhythmic antimelodic approach of sixteen horsepower all interesting with the travelers maybe the truest folk esthetic the balladeer the highest showbiz and the reverend the fanciest oldnegro church version almost unrecognizable for all the hooting and shrilling brother richard knew himself proudly to be the sinnerman he would do the wrong i can live with the wrong i exult in the wrong he thought i define the wrong i am the wrong it could have turned out different but it turned out this way he waited as the music roared in his ear and finally she came by him on the lonely road not seeing him pulled off to the side her placid little sensible volvo trimly purring along at less than forty he could see that she was tense behind the wheel for he saw her body hunched forward to the wheel her neck tight and straight her head abnormally still her hands rigid at ten and two on the wheel she was worried about the road about the possibility of a big truck coming up from behind her or barreling widely and wildly around a turn but she wasnt worried about the sinnerman in her version of the world there was no sinnerman she had no concept of the sinnerman and no idea of what was about to befall her almost out of these damned mountains then a short flat run across the floor of shady valley a last splurge of hills and then sullivan county civilization as took her back to bristol to her apartment to a nice glass of wine then nikki saw death it was a blur in her mirror just a shadow as no details presented themselves then it was a blur in her driversside window growing exponentially by the nanosecond full of thrust and empty of mercy it was death in a dark car come to snuff her out no one had ever tried to kill nikki before but she had her fathers blood in her veins and more importantly his dna which meant she had reflexes fast as her killers and she wasnt by nature turned toward fear or panic the car hit her hard the noise filled the universe and knocked her askew toward trees which rushed at her signaling catastrophe as her tires bit against the skittish dust then she did what one person in ten thousand will do in those circumstances and she did it at a speed that has no place in time out of certitude for correct behavior at the extremes she did nothing she let the car correct itself as its wheels reoriented swiftly she had control again most seeing trees or cliff rushing at them will overcorrect and when they do that the laws of physics immutable and merciless mandate a roll the roll is death the neck and its thin stalk of spine cant take the gforce and sunder under the extreme vibration cessation of consciousness and life signs is immediate and whether the wreck is in flames or not further body trauma broken bones sundered bloodbearing organs whatever is immaterial she didnt know that the sinnerman with his experience in automotive assassination had presumed she would yank the wheel for life guaranteeing death and was surprised as she rode the bump out got soft control and then accelerated half on road half on gravel to escape his predation he hit her again in the rearthird of the accelerating volvo knocking her fishtailing off the road in a screech of dust but she didnt panic at the wheel and hardspin it this time either sure death but instead let it spin free and find its own proper vector as she scooted just ahead of him he pulled himself left drew off set up for another thump this one better aimed nikki was not scared fright is imagination combined with anticipation combined with dread and none of those conditions described her instead she accepted instantaneously that she was in a fight to the death with a trained experienced killer and she didnt waste any concentration on the unfairness of it all instead she pushed the pedal so hard to the floor of the car that she felt the beginning of gforce though of course the volvo with its horsepower sixcylinder was no match for the muscledup chrysler barnburner under her antagonists foot but as he struggled to find an angle she put surprising space between the vehicles and yet was astute enough to see in supertime a turn approaching so now she finally braked softly turning into a power slide that would get her around the turn at the best angle and set her up for another deadon acceleration the hell out of there if such a thing were possible and it probably wasnt damn she was good as she controlskidded around the turn in a whine of rubber fighting for purchase of asphalt brother richard saw his opening and instead of veering outside of her he bravely cut inside to begin his surge his professionalquality cornering as opposed to her gifted amateur approach won him the inside where she didnt expect him to be as she tried to float back into the proper lane he revved beyond redline closed that off from her and delivered his blow to the front fender of her righthand side not so much a thud as a nudge to push her out of equilibrium but now damnit she figured this one out too and jammed hard on her brakes pumping the wheel as she skidded left the world spun before nikki racing across her windshield pure abstraction in the cone of the one headlamp that still burned and she nursed the brake pedal with a delicate foot while merely making suggestions to the wheel which kept her in a semblance of control as she stopped alas to find herself oneeightied in the other direction she was now facing the dangerous rising linkage of switchbacks up iron mountain that shed just survived so she punched it hard jammed on the brakes as he came by her a third time how had he gotten around so fast somehow got through a reverse righthand backing turn at a speed at which such a maneuver should never be conceived of much less attempted and again punched hard but he beat her somehow to possession of the road and this time he hit her rode her hard right he turned and she saw his face in the glare of the dash its plainness its evenness of feature its dull symmetry its almost generic quality like the father of dick in a dick and jane it burned into her mind and then she was off the road out of control among the trees and the world was jerking left and right hard as the car slammed against or glanced off the trees she felt her neck screaming her head flopping this way and that and then she hit and everything stopped two it happened so fast two weeks his hair went straight to winter from summer with no autumnal pause it didnt thin it didnt fall out it just veered off to dull gray he looked ancient or so he thought it was a memory that did it he had recently had an actual sword fight to the deathin the twentyfirst century in one of the most modern cities on earthwith a japanese gentleman of infinitely superior skill and talent yet he had won he had killed the other man left him cut through the middle in a mushy field of sherbet snow turned magenta by the mans own blood bob thought often why did i win i had no right to win i wasso lucky i was so goddamned lucky it was like a worm gnawing at his heart you lucky bastard why did i luck out and that guy end up guts out in the snow not that swagger had escaped intact the guy had laid him open to steel bone at the hip and hed gone too long before stitches saved his life it never healed right and he didnt help by denying so fiercely that there was a problem somehow his leg stiffened as if the tide of blood that the stitching dammed was still there coagulating and about to break out in a red ocean spray and bleed him to death killers revenge but the killer had also as another part of his revenge turned him comical with one of those weird bounces in his gait could still ride could still walk couldnt really run much no talent at all for climbing a motorcycle saved his life by giving him the illusion of freedom that had once been his strongest attribute i look a hundred and fifty hed said just that morning you dont look a day aver one hundred fortyfive his wife said honey look at daddy hes turned white daddys a snowman shouted the little girl miko now seven delighted to find a flaw in a hero so awesome as her strange white father snowman snowman snowman its gray its gray bob protested then he added i know someones going to find her ride cut short she dont stop calling daddy a snowman but the tone revealed the fraudulence of the threat for it was his pleasure to spoil his daughters and then take pride in how well they turned out anyway he was a rich man rich in landhe now owned six layup barns in three western states two in arizona two here in idaho and one each in colorado and montana and was looking at property in kansas and oregonand rich in pension from the united states marine corps he was rich in homes as he owned this beautiful recently finished place sixty miles out of boise on land hed cleared himself that looked across green prairie emptiness to blue scars of mountains under piles of cumulus cotton against a blue diamond sky he was rich in wife for julie was handsome a character out of a howard hawks movie one of those tawny feline women who never got excited had a low voice and was still sexy as hell and he was richest of all in daughters he had two nikki was a graduate of the columbia school of journalism and now working her first newspaper job in bristol virginia a place her father liked a lot more than the new york city where shed spent the last year he felt shed be a lot safer in the small city right smack on the virginiatennessee border meanwhile his adopted daughter miko had taken to western life without a hitch and quickly became comfortable around horses the messes that they made the smells that they generated she loved them took to them automatically and it thrilled her father to see such a tiny thing so relaxed atop such a giant thing and controlling it so confidently making it love and obey her the kid was already earning blue ribbons in eventing and might even overtake her big sister whod been a national champion in that sport two years running when she was a teenager now it was morning and since it was august there was no school for miko so they were doing what they loved the girl on her horse sam and her father watching her canter gently about the ring but he was not dominating for while that had been his way as a marine nco it was not his way with his daughter he leaned on the fence and youd have thought theres a cool cowboy type of fellow his jeans were tight framing his lanky legs he wore a horsemans slouch and sucked on a weed he was all cowboyed upthe tony lamas boots muddy but solid a blue denim shirt a red handkerchief around his neck for it gets hot in idaho in august and a straw stetson to keep the sun off his face it really couldnt have been more perfect always a signal that disturbance lurks not far away easy sweetie he called you dont want to force him you have to feel him and when hes ready hell let you know i know daddy she called back she rode eastern on the snooty brit postage stamp of a saddle with erect posture a crop in her hand tall lowheeled boots and of course a helmet she was equally adept with the big western rigs that were like boats upon a horses plunging back but both bob and julie agreed that she would eventually go to school in the east that she should have riding skills set for that part of the country and on top of that they wanted to keep her out of rodeos where too many young gals flocked because they liked the stringbean boys who rode like hell and bounced up with a smile when they went for a sail in the air and a thump in the dirt though with miko maybe it would be something else maybe it would be to actually do some crazy rodeo thing like leave a perfectly good cow pony for a ride on a bulls horns shell probably end up the womens bulldog champion of idaho but still youve got to try he told his wife if she does shell have to put up with a screaming nag of an old lady every damn day julie said so far so goodmiko had a rhythm and a patience that even a generally stoic animal like a horse could feel and love she had magical ways or so bob believed and he would have gladly given up the other hipor anythingfor miko gracefully she took a jump without a twitch to her posture a tightness to her spine a twist to her landing that was a good one sweetie he called i know daddy she responded and he smiled a bit wiped his brow then looked up at a flash of movement too fast for good news and saw julie coming from the house he knew immediately something was wrong julie never got upset shed stitched up enough cutopen indian boys on the reservation where shed run a clinic for ten years and kept her head around blood and pain and emotional upheaval and the occasional death so if she was upset bob knew immediately it could be only one thing his other daughter nikki sweetie he called before julie reached him wanting to bring miko in before the bad news arrived and he lost contact with reality you come on down now just for a second oh daddy i he turned to julie i just got a call from jim gustofson the managing editor of nikkis paper bob felt constriction through his heart and lungs as if his respiratory system had just blown a valve and was leaking fluid his knees went weak hed seen violent death particularly as inflicted upon the young and innocent in both hemispheres and he had a bleak and terrifying image of disaster of his daughter gone of his endless terrible grief and rage what is it she was in some kind of accident she went off the road out in the mountains ended up in some trees oh christ how is she shes alive thank god she was conscious long enough to call and give her location they got to her soon enough and her vital signs were good is she going to be all right mommy whats wrong nikkis been in an accident honey it killed bob to see the pain on his younger daughters face the child reacted as if shed been hit in the chest by a boxer she almost crumpled shes in a coma julie said shes unconscious they found her that way with minor abrasions and contusions no paralysis no indications of serious trauma but the whiplash must have put her out and then she hit her head hard and her eyes are blackened and shes still out oh god said bob we have to get out there right away yet even as julie said that bob knew it was wrong his oldest and darkest fear came out of its cave and began to nuzzle him with a cold nose looking him over with yellow eyes blood on its breath and teeth ill go ill leave soon as i can get a flight you book me on the internet then call me as i head to boise for the flight out no no i will see my daughter i will not stay here well all go miko has to see her too come over here he said and when he drew her away from the child he explained im worried this could be linked to something ive done to someone its a way to get me out bob not everything not everythings about me but you have no idea of some of the fixes and the places ive been you have no idea who might be hunting me you have a scar on your chest and memories of months in the hospital when that fellow put a bullet into you he put it into me because of me not you it was all so long ago but he remembered hearing the shots and finding her almost bled out along the trail nikki screaming another man dead close by i dont say its my business he said but i cant say it aint and i cant operate if im thinking all the while about your safety and mikos i have to recon this alone if its safe ill let you know it was gunmans paranoia he knew it all the boys felt it all the mankillers good bad or indifferent at a certain age faces come to you unbidden and you cant place them quite but its your subconscious reminding you of this or that man you took down and you think did he have brothers parents cousins friends peers colleagues maybe they were as savaged by that unknown mans death as he had been by the deaths of those hed known himself like julies first husband donnie fenn such a good young man the best his chest torn open by the same sniper who put the bullet into julie bob remembered i killed the sniper but maybe the snipers brother was here and couldnt get at bob in idaho where bob had friends and family and knew the land and where all the creeks were so he figured out how to draw him onto unfamiliar land and maybe it was his pleasure to see the pain on bobs face by taking his family first one by one first nikki then julie then mi he cursed himself every time he came home alive and more or less intact he thought about going underground going into his own private witness protection program new identity new start new place new everything but another part said no you can let it drive you crazy its nothing itll take your life if you let it you win not by surviving but by living by having the things you need and love family land home please he said bob this cant be yours alone that is my daughter that is my daughter i cannot stay here i have to be at her side no matter what it costs or what the risk i feel that so powerfully i can hardly face it let me go let me figure it out and as soon as i can at the absolute soonest i will let you know and you can go if its dangerous at all i will have her moved i will hire bodyguards i will set up a secure place for you to come but i have to know first she shook her head she didnt like it i know i can be wrong he said im wrong all the time it aint about me being wrong or me beingwhat was the word nikki used narcissistic someone who loves himself too much even if he cant admit it youre not a narcissist no narcissist would be as shut up cut down beaten bloodied dragged and kicked in the head as much as you i give you that whatever your flaws and god knows there are hundreds of them youre too insane to risk your life for this or that or nothing whatever to be a narcissist so your scars buy you two or three days then were coming thank you now ive got to get packed three as hed just seen miko atop a large muscular horse controlling it and taking such delight in the process that morning he now stood next to his older daughter and remembered her atop the same large muscular animals how she thrilled at them how she loved them how she made them do her bidding how they loved her but nikki was far from horseback she lay in the intensivecare unit of the bristol general hospital monitored by a million dollars worth of gizmos beeps beeped lines dashed across screens to symbolize breathing brain activity blood pressure and so forth she was still her seemingly frail chest moving upward and downward just a fraction of an inch to signify the functioning of her taxed respiratory system those roads can be so dangerous at night mr swagger said jim gustofson the managing editor of the newspaper nikki worked for if she werent such a good reporter she would have come home earlier when it was light but she stayed she got every last thing out of the day that she could have oh this is so awful i just dont know what to say gustofson was a tall man in his early fifties with a full head of hair and a shocked expression he had repeated this statement about ten times it was all he could say bob had received the doctors verdict they were in the waitandsee stage all the monitoring systems recorded strong life signs she was badly bruised and lacerated but there were no broken bones brain activity seemed unaltered ekg strong signifying no permanent damage but she was totally unconscious and had been so now for over twentyfour hours theres no telling in these cases said the young resident she took a bad knock on the head and the whiplash was vicious in the few seconds the car bounced she was rattled around pretty hard we just dont know how long shell be out classically a coma of this nature lasts a few weeks or months or years or forever thats an outside possibility yes sir mr swagger but its rare usually a few weeks and they recover their memory is foggy but in time it returns the brain has had a shock it realizes how close it came to death it wants to rest and relax for a while itll be back when it feels safe shes a strong young woman anyhow dr crane can tell you more tomorrow what do the police say mr gustofson bob asked ive got a copy of the report for you but johnson county sheriffs department says their assessment is that she was driving home down the road and some teenager possibly high on the very thing she was investigating methamphetamine decided to show off you know these rural kids get nascar fever with the big race less than a week away i noticed the traffic and all the activity driving in bob said yes sir well one of the things weve noted is that traffic aggression goes way up this time of year so the cops believe some punk kid was trying to be dale senior to the decidedly unhip volvo just for the thrill of it the kick of it and he got carried away misjudged his speed and instead of scaring the bejesus out of her and getting a laugh out of his buddies he smacked her off the road and down the incline she went she was lucky in one way how is that sir they say he first hit her about three miles back much higher up the mountain if shed have gone over there the incline was several hundred feet rolling the whole way then smashing into trees shed have been dead for sure as it was where she finally went off the distance was only feet or so and she didnt hit any of the trees headon but rather glanced off them the big thing is she didnt roll the roll is the killer somehow she outdrove him for three miles and when he finally hit her solid she kept the car in traction and out of the air id say she saved her own life bob saw his daughter in the car in the dark some big punk fool in a pickup with a brainful of crystal meth and a gutful of budweiser slamming her laughing hard deciding it was fun and slamming her again and again hed like to have a conversation with the young fellow hed leave him a check for the facial reconstruction bill but not a penny for the wheelchair hed need forever do they have any leads they have a detective on the case i spoke to her shes very good shes broken some big cases thelma fielding shed be the one to see bob looked at his watch hed taken a pm from boise to knoxville via st louis rented a car and roared the whole way up i to get here this fast now it was nearly ten im so sorry mr swagger shes an outstanding young woman we all hope for the best for her do you have a place to stay the town is filling up with racing fans it might be hard to find a room we have a spare bedroom the paper has rallied also and theres lots of folks willing to accommodate you if need be no matter how long you stay ill go to her apartment and stay there the nurse gave me her effects when i checked in and i saw the key i hope you have the address and can give me some directions then tomorrow after i see her and talk to the doctors on the day shift ill want to go out and talk to that detective just to warn you this big race screws everything up it brings in millions and millions of bucks you could say the whole region lives off this month the year long but the downside of course is that everybodys all involved in it and the cops especially its a royal pain moving around town or trying to get anything normal done im used to waiting said bob you might say i was once a professional waiter i can wait a long long time without moving a twitch you just watch you always fear entering your own childs private life what if you make discoveries learn things you werent meant to know find out intimacies privacies discretion that a child always hides from her parents just to save them worry or knowledge you can learn too much but that didnt happen if she had a private life or any secrets it hadnt gotten interesting yet nothing indicated a boyfriend a scandal a secret she was dead set on doing well in this job moving on to another job on a bigger paper and who knows what maybe some fancy rag like the times or the post maybe running a smaller more focused thing copies of those papers lay everywhere as did magazines like the new yorker and time and so forth her books were all by journalists and novelists that was her talent bob knew you had to let them be what they could be just as in his way although dying young for it bobs own father earl had let his son be what he wanted and had encouraged his talents and not held his flaws against him after several misturns and dead ends and an involuntary tour of bristol even the line in the city where tennessee magically turns into virginia and vice versa depending on the direction bob had at last found the side road that ran just next to and so close to a walmart that youd have thought it was the parking lot followed it behind the giant store down a hill into a little glade of houses along a creek and then up into an apartment complex hers was on the third floor he saw a sheeted kawasaki in the parking lot and knew it was nikkis and that she loved that bike he wished shed taken it to mountain city because on the bike no redneck high on shit and beer would have outperformed her hed seen her ride the damned thing she could stay with anyone she could stay with himhe was goodand shed have left that cracker crashed and burning in the gully gone home taken a shower had a beer and a good laugh and then a good nights sleep she had swagger blood after all but the squat boxy volvo had saved her life he bet it wouldnt surrender to the forces of gravity or physics as it roared down the incline in a cloud of dust shedding itself of speed it was designed to keep people alive by swedish geniuses and god bless lars or ingmar or whoever because hed done his job that day it never broke it never collapsed and though fenders and engine and trunk had cammed inward the integrity of the passenger box stayed intact his daughter lived on the slenderest of threads that shed been able to forestall her stalker for three miles downhill that shed stayed out of the roll that shed gone over where the incline was much slighter that the car held together that it didnt hit the trees headon but rather glancingly and that shed been conscious enough to call it in outside trees whistled in the southern night was this tennessee or virginia he couldnt be sure you had to live here for years to know automatically whatever it was the south with its dark history of violence its strange streaks of courage its stubbornness its pride its love of hunting fishing twangy music and fast cars he himself had sprung from such a place a state with a long history of clan feuds and grudges violence on the street youth swollen hard on aggression and let to bloom until someone was dead it sent men in the hundreds up the pea ridges of the war of the rebellion and most went willingly and diednobly bob had seen enough gutshot men to know there was no nobility to it but he also knew the strange pride that compelled the young men of the south onward into the grape and musket up that bleak pea ridge swept by leaden blizzards the majority to die slowly of massive intestinal wounds screaming in the night six days after the battle was lost or won that was something the south he thought it made me but am i of it is my legendary father of it is my daughter of it or does this have nothing to do with the south and only grows out of something i did in some forgotten neighborhood or other in the tangled loyalties of my twisted past he tried to settle down he lay on her couch aching for booze to make the hurting go away he called julie gave her whats what told miko he loved her and then after nightmares that werent quite a product of sleep but more of memory managed to fall asleep it had been a hell of a long day a day like no other he hoped hed never have a day like it again it was any strip of forested road sloping down from the mountain above a vast high bulk of stone sheathed in the trees that went everywhere like a carpet or a disease he could make no sense of the cross hatches of the tire tracks fading on the asphalt or the messedup shoulder dirt and gravel where the big vehicles had collided at speed or the patch down the slope laid out by yellow accident tape now a mite ratty three days into keeping folks off the spot where nikkis volvo had landed im not exactly getting a picture he said to the woman detective sir i could trace it out for you explain it better that way the diagrams in the report make it clear too no offense now i never mean offense but i have to ask you sure youre up to this sort of work its not a big department and all this is highly technical it seems i have investigated traffic accidents and fatalities too i admit our state police accident team is better set up for this kind of thing but the trickiness of state laws keeps them from operating off the federal and state highways this is a county highway so theres a jurisdictional problem right at the start well i dont want to upset nobodys apple cart i just have to figure out for myself on what happened im sure you get that i do mr swagger that is why i am here to help i have been at this a long time im a good detective well get him or them yes maam i believe you detective thelma fielding probably forty was a strong woman with exceptionally large eyes manhands what youd call a bigboned woman she wore blue jeans tight to show off a body that was not beyond desire by any meansshe had large breastsand a polo shirt black with a badge over her left breast a baseball cap carried the badge motif but what told the world she was a professional law enforcement agent was the trickedout automatic worn in a kydex speed holster on her hip behind it rode three mags double stack so the gun was probably a paraordnance not that bob let her know he knew a para from a springfield from a kimber from a colt from a nighthawk from a wilson and all the other models that were suddenly all the rage in selfdefense and sporting circles next to the gun and the holster was her actual badge wreathed in a leather badge holder worn on the belt on the other hip she wore her twoway with a curly cord up to the mic pinned to her shirt collar oh and the paraord was carried cocked and locked ready for speed work in less than a seconds notice so i cant make any sense of it detective can you tell me how you read it would you want to sit in the squad car mr swagger its hot here in august and you look a mite peaked wouldnt want you developing any health problems on top of everything else my damned hair bob thought makes me seem maam im fine at least for a little while i just see tracks engraved in the road where im guessing my daughters bad boy skidded after he knocked her from the road at whatever speed he was going sir i should tell you what youve probably guessed by now this time of year such a thing is hardly rare these young boys git all het up on account of the big nascar race week at bristol they want to show off for each other it can get out of hand fast yes maam what i remember of young men reminds me such a thing is frequent but the young men he knew spent their aggression on jungle patrol ready to give it all up for something this batch couldnt fathom called duty the theory is deputy thelma continued some kid decided to put a scare into the lone gal and buzzed her evidently she didnt scare so he wasnt satisfied so the game turned rough he kind of lost his mind and banged her too hard and knocked her into the trees then he panicked saw what he had done and got the hell out of there she was damned lucky she had a cellphone and called before she passed out and that we got her in less than an hour otherwise she may have lain there for a week before help came bob examined the skid marks and could make no sense of them he wanted to believe yes thats all it is it had nothing to do with him it was the random drift of the universe a bad news connection between a hoppedup junior in a pickup and his fewyearsolder daughter all earnest desire and commitment the crosshatched skidmarks were all that remained of the accident because the highway emergency vehicles and tow trucks that pulled her car out of the gully messed up the shoulder bad you see the thicker tires are his you can tell where he skidded then peeled out to catch up to her she veered off the road a bit lost some traction he hit her right to left then came around the other side and hit her left to right thats what we see here she went off right up there down that slope which aint by no means the worst slope of the road and somehow avoided hitting the trees headon its all in the tracks he felt briefly overwhelmed is there any you know scientific clues that might help you figure it all out and lead to a guilty party on the tv theres all this crime scene stuff makes you think its just a matter of shining some magic light on something yes sir well let me say that many folks have a wrong idea how detective work goes detective thelma said its the television we shine the magic light and take something back to the lab and blow it up a thousand times and it tells us who to arrest not true now never was we do have some scientific evidence if you call it that i have sent both the tire tracks imprint and a paint sample i scraped off your daughters door to the state police crime lab in knoxville in a few days ill hear back and ill get a make and model of tire and a make and model of car the latter based on the color amazing how much auto paint can tell you then i can circularize all the auto body shops around the three states see if anybody brought in a vehicle for damage repair in those colors i can then ask local jurisdictions to check on the tires and if we get a match or two we might be in business if the tires are any way unique i can contact tire outlets what are the odds not good lots of folks here dont repair their dents and dings or they do it themselves or if the car was stolen maybe hell just dump it and forget about it thats something these thrill drivers do anyhow thats what the book says now i work a different way im hoping youll tell me im no genius but i have a sound appreciation of human nature i collect snitches what i do is when i bust a kid on meth or grass or assault i pull him aside and i say look i can go forward or you can cooperate with me and this can go away you get a fresh start and maybe you aint as dumb as you look what you mean he says i mean i say what do you know what can you give me what things you heard whered you buy the stuff whos moving the shit this sort of thing he listens sees where his best interests lie and opens up i take notes clear up a lot of cases that way who broke into the piggly wiggly who stole seventysix dollars and fiftythree cents from the pizza hut how junior bridger afforded his new camaro with a under the hood other things i hear about it factor in why homecoming queen sue ellen ramsey dumped quarterback vince tagetti for seeming nocount cleon jackson the answer is that cleons cousin franklin just got into the meth business big time and suddenly the dough is rolling in cleon delivers to folks all over town hes now got a lexus suv and sue ellen has always loved the lexus line that sort of thing thats how crime works in a rural zone of hills and hollows and small towns and big football and bad methamphetamine addictions and very peculiar behaviors and the kids the snitches they take to it finally for some of em they got somebody to listen to them so right now i have my snitches working full time and somebodyll talk too much beer in smokeys one night hell talk hell brag on it how he bopped the volvo and it felt good the storyll get around itll get to one of my kids and hell let me know and ill get a name then ill bring em in and sweat em and theyll roll over and well have a case it may take a little while but that kind of police work is worth all the csi bullshit in the world that makes good sense to me he said i can see you know your profession may i call you now and again for some kind of update why sure mr swagger but i have to ask you one other thing he said i also know that in the real world youre dealing with a workplace i know how workplaces are you got a boss who wants progress soon enough therell be other bigger fancier criminal situations and hell want his number one investigator on them my daughters situation goes on the back burner thats not your choice its not my choice thats just the way it is right now especially with this big race coming up with all the parties all the drinking with your department most likely pitching in on the security arrangements for an event that attracts a quarter of a million people i am not exactly confident that youll have enough time to devote to this not your fault i aint criticizing you im just saying thats what happens i wont let that happen mr swagger i will work this thing out for you and then theres sheriff he could tell since she hadnt mentioned by name the recently famous hero of the meth wars sheriff reed wells of the helicopterborne drug raid and the highest conviction rate in tennessee that she didnt care for his highhanded possibly selfaggrandizing wayhe wants cases that git his name in the paper he wants the big raid the splash he doesnt want slow careful patient development of sources you do know a thing or two about the real world sir just a bit anyhow i may hire a private investigator or a lawyer with investigative skills if thats all right with you or i may do some poking around myself sir there are some fine private investigators in knoxville and some fine expolice attorneys who know the system yes that would be your right and i understand your concern i would strongly recommend against any poking around on your own it can be tough out here and unless youre a seasoned investigator you can make things murkier not clearer and get yourself in a heap of trouble at the same time these young men they can be tough and merciless ive seen killings beating victims all sorts of unpleasantness id hate to find you victim of something like that because you went to the wrong bar and asked the wrong questions well thats sound advice okay ill stay away and try not to get my old bones beaten to pulp and get you another case then you and i are on the same page mr swagger now ive got to get back into town suddenly there was a squawk of electronic noise harsh and indecipherable and detective thelma switched a button on the microphonereceiver pinned near her collar and leaned into it tennine here she said she listened to what bob heard as a gibberish of squawks now and then cut by a recognizable number then she pushed send and said i roger and will proceed on my tenforty she looked over at him well we have some strange boy in these parts who likes to burn trucks dont know why but this is the fifth one in the past two months ive got to get over there fast mr swagger and run the crime scene investigation yes maam he said i will be in touch she smiled jogged off to her car hit the gumball and the siren and fired off bob went back to the hospital and sat around for a couple of hours he met some more of nikkis reporter friends and picked up on how much she was loved and respected and how angry everyone was he told them about thelma and was gratified to learn she had a fine reputation had been to a number of fbi schools had a few big cases and was something of a local character shed been a raving beauty once who knew shed turn up as a cop and become the threetime tennessee state ladies uspsa champion which he now realized was why she carried the fancy automatic in the speed holster he also was invited to dinner and turned down the invites being too tired and depressed for much more comfort about ten he kissed his daughters still cheek and headed back to her apartment there he called julie and reported in on his findings well be there tomorrow no please just give it a few more days i just dont know i like this detective and she wouldnt steer me wrong but i still have a queasy feeling is someone following you no and if they were i sure made it easy on them so no no theres no sign its some old mess of mine i agree then its clear for us to come i got one more trick to play out then ill call you it was stupid he knew but the tracks made no sense to him he went to his laptop turned it on and called up good old google he typed in aerial photography knoxville tennessee four if he blinked he could have sold himself on the illusion he was back in vietnam at some forward operating base where the helicopter was the only way in or out and the helicopter the order of the day taking men to and from battle hauling out the wounded laying on solid suppressive fire where needed he was back in a war zone of engines somehow and although the sandbags were missing the perimeter security wasnt and the whole wide area was separated into bays so that each powerful machine was isolated from the others and its crew and shop worked as one no not vietnam but big powerful machines just the same the noise of them was gigantic a physical presence demanding ear protection so powerfully did the vibrations fill the air and set everything buzzing to the rhythm of their firing everyone running about had something to do with engines all smeared with grease all filthy in that happy way of men who love what theyre doing and dont care what it looks like meanwhile a secondary fact of life was the stench of hightest fuel which lingered everywhere just as palpable in its way as the grinding roar of the engines if you wanted to continue the vietnam game further you could like the aviators of that longago sovanished time and place the drivers were the aristocrats here thin young men in their specialized suits sexy and it seemed that everybody wanted their attention or merely to be in their presence of course it wasnt fob maria north of danang somewhere in indian country rvn circa it was the pits that is the center of the track at the bristol motor speedway bristol tennessee and what towered above wasnt mountains full of victor charlie but the enveloping cup of the speedway itself a near vertical wall of seats for one hundred fifty thousand or so fans the seats were largely empty but a few diehards sat and watched or took notes or worked with stop watches bob was in the pit next to a vehicle that was just as purposebuilt as any huey or cobra gunship it was called usmc a dodge charger in the new blurry digital camouflage just like the boys wore outside baghdad with the globe and anchor emblazoned kingsize on hood roof and doors mechanics and submechanics leaped around each seemingly with a special job to do as they struggled to bring it to some kind of mechanical perfection they worked in puddles of oil and fuel and tracks crisscrossed the concrete as in vietnam the tracks of running men the tracks of rolling smooth wide tires and a myriad of smallerscaled tracks for various wheeled devices that serviced the big machine the usmc carried a specialbuilt v hemi engine so brawny it was bursting to get out rode on four smooth wide tires instantly changeable and devoured some poison brew of chemically adjusted fuel like any tool it sported no softness for comfort but was a hard serious bucket of bolts meant for one thing only and that was to zoom fullbore around a mile track five hundred times spitting clouds of exhaust it had all the gizmos the spoiler on the rear to keep it from going airborne the shocks made of kryptonite or some other wonder steel the fourinch ground clearance all engineered to make usmc go like hell inside it was like a hard devotional place also lacking any softness for comfort with one seat bolted in the doors bolted shut netting everywhere he stood there on the outside of the ruckus feeling like a tourist but this is where he had been told to be and this was the time and the various obstacles to his penetration of the most intimate secret places of nascar had fallen when he gave his name almost as if he were important it was the good old usmc retired nco network in action bob had gotten a batch of pictures taken by deweys aviation inc out of knoxville and what he saw was mainly skidmarks down ten miles of descending road on iron mountain and some skell in some kind of fast mover closing in upon and trying to kill his daughter it was even from the air nonsense and gibberish to bob but he had friends and he called the son of a friend who was a lieutenant colonel in personnel at henderson hall or hq and asked if the colonel could come up with some exmarine whod know a lot about car behavior accidents skidmarks that sort of thing turned out no he didnt but he had something better someone who was fresh off the marine pio at hq where hed been a part of the team that had worked with a big new york ad agency to recruit a nascar driver to run the usmc emblem on his car the upcoming season not for charity because there was no charity anywhere in nascar these days it was all marketing done for the money but still the fellow his people his team they all got it and they loved running under the globe and anchor in fact he was still in the running for the sprint cup and hed be right there at bristol that very weekend calls were made things were agreed to and though the usmcchrysler team was working there was no problem if bob got there at eleven today as qualifying didnt start till tomorrow and they were still tuning so now bob was standing when a scrawny youngster in jeans and a baseball cap came up to him smiled shook his hand and bid him to follow no words were exchanged because the noise was so loud and bob followed the boy through the hustle and bustle dodging a rolling tire someone was wheeling toward the car itself its top halfbob wanted to call it a fuselagevisible over a wall he ducked and bobbed and then found himself inside a trailer home that was way nice like a hotel suite clearly set up as some kind of relaxation area when the door was sealed bob popped out his ear plugs as did the boy and bob introduced himself gunnery sergeant eh you were some kind of cowboy hero in that war all that time ago is that right it was mostly squirming around hoping not to get shot was all bob said well im matt macready bob was stunned to see that this kid was the man hed come to see the actual driver himself fourth in nascar standings a real comer had a shot at winning a few nights down the road and a shot at the big cup so young freckly even with a thatch of red hair but then the chopper aviators were all young and if you put a helmet on them and a bird under them theyd go into hell to get the mission done so he warned himself against holding the boys youth against him pleased to meet you congratulations on your fine racing career sorry i didnt recognize you being recognized is overrated gunny let me tell you and most of the folks who do just want something from you from a signature to an investment they all seem to have fancy haircuts too dont trust a man with a fancy haircut all smoothed up like cake frosting you know hell i just drive cars around in a circle dont even get to go nowhere i end up right where i started whats the goddamn point bob smiled at the joke and the boy tried another one if this dont work out i guess ill head back to the gas station son from the looks of it its working out swell the boy grinned pleased to have impressed a genuine hero so far so good the cars dont crunch up so much no more and i take crunching up seriously because it put my granddaddy in a wheelchair for the last sixty years of his life and they dont burn much no more neither thats the best thing my daddy burned to death in one so i take burning seriously anyhow since you dont want to tell me how damned great i am that tells me you aint no asskiss haircut here who wants free tix or no corporate glad hander wants me at a cocktail party with some of the clients where i stand around all bashfullike and the boys come up and pet me like some kind of cuddly critter hate all that shit but it is a part of the business so we are getting off to a good start now you tell me how i can help you im guessing it dont involve putting on the firesuit and shaking a lot of hands nor putting frosting in your hair nor getting petted much im liking this better n better yes sir well i hope i wont take too much of your time let me get red nichols in here my crew chief hes forgot more than i know he was my daddys crew chief too sure while matt macready got out a cell to call red a beautiful girlsay the kid was doing wellcame out and offered bob a cold drink bob took a bottle of juice and pretty soon the door opened and a man bobs age wrinkled and greasy came in red meet bob lee swagger of the real usmc mr swagger an honor sir i was a motor mechanic late in vietnam and i heard of the famous bob the nailer that old bastard is long gone its just an old man with a bad leg here today matt you realize he run just as hard as you difference is people shooting at him so you mind your manners around him i will said matt i already have mr swagger marked down as a serious southern man not a haircut with a softgal handshake well lets see if we can help him some and so bob laid it out quickly as he could free of nuance what had happened to his daughter what the police made of it his own worries his decision to spend to have deweys photorecon the road the arrival of the pictures over a fax transmission a few hours ago so my hope is you can look at the skid marks and make sense of them for me it looks like chicken scratches to me i figure youve seen skid marks before you know how cars behave at high speed brakes on brakes off how they skid turn wobble go over so you can tell me what happened if the cops are right and this is some hoppedup teenager then i can rest easy theyll get him im sure if not i have to dig deeper and make preparations i will protect my daughter i believe you will is there any reason to expect anyone might try to kill your daughter its not inconceivable she was investigating a criminal enterprise in a county known for its corruption and drug trade that would be one thing another would be my involvement over the years in a number of situations where violence sometimes came into play those episodes may have made me some powerful enemies so it is possible that someone is trying to strike at me through her that one just cant be ruled out ive been around enough not to believe in coincidence we dont believe in it either said red out here on the track where its all happening at close to two hundred per we dont never believe in coincidence so lets see what youve got there mr swagger the boy and the old man examined the faxes not the clearest photos ever taken but mr dewey had gotten pretty damned low and he had a real fine camera bob felt he got every cents worth of the twentysevenhundreddollar dent hed put in his credit card what youll see right away is two tracks one is my daughters volvo though she doesnt come into the picture till late in the sequence hers are much lighter and narrower yep hes sailing on some heavy wide tread no doubt about it you can see where he tries to knock her this way and that you can see how she gets away from him twice and how she got enough down the hill that so when he did finally whack her off the road the incline wasnt so steep and the car never rolled they say that saved her life i think it did said red they didnt talk for a while except in some kind of code great traction all the way through hes left footing seems to find the ideal line a lot say i really like his angle his angles are damned good considering the corners are all unknown i also like how soon he gets to the ideal early in midcorner he rides this one real good and aint fighting it none this boys been in a hundredmileper slide before i think like his traction he aint hardly ever on two i think so too matt mr swagger you got any other pictures what i see is a damned fine driver knocking the little foreign job off the road i will say this girl of yours shes a damned cool hand suppose she gets it from her daddy her mommy more n likely yes i didnt know what to make of these mr dewey told me when he was done he oneeightied and flew back up the road to make sure he didnt miss nothing he stayed on the road a longer time than i asked him to and way way back he came upon some other skids now it may not be the same guy but it sure looks like it to me same width of track same density of color youd have to make a tread comparison to be sure but as i said earlier dont believe much in coincidence he handed the two photos over and the two men looked hard at them then back several times at the actual pocketofengagement sequence well red finally said that ties it up with a ribbon it sure does said matt so tell me what you make of it as i say where hes whacking her its hard to make it out other than hes a good driver sos she the cars are banging together speeds up near a hundred she keeps turning inside him he skids outdont lose it thoughand goes after her yes sir but see these here theyre bad news im afraid bob didnt want to be here he didnt want to find out the worst the world was so much better for everybody if this was just one drunk or hoppedup farmboy who wanted to put a lick on another car just like his hero the late dale senior but that wasnt to be now here we are ten miles before the accident and see this here turn he made and heres another one hes running like hell to catch up to her like he got the news late that she was there but its not like hes chasing her in the sense that he sees her and is closing bob said it means in other words miles before he makes eye contact hes going like hell to catch her well hes sure going like hell said matt hes not just running flat out for the fun of it hes right on the edge of a very dangerous road and take it from me you cant get there unless youre closing on the leader with two laps to go nobody goes that close to dying for the fun of it then here this last curve thats his boldest and damn its a fine piece of driving he read the angle of the curve exactly knew what his attack would be and how long maybe to the tenth of a second and he had to hold it a tenth too long one way hes in the trees to the left of the road a tenth too short hes in the trees to the right he found what we call the ideal angle it may not be the shortest angle but it means hes reading the input at supertime he knows his car like he knows his own face he goes into the curve just fine he keeps traction at maximumtraction is speed and controlhe never slides or drifts hes leftfooting the brake while he rightfoots the pedal not easy and at the ultimate perfect moment hes set up to go to the floor and hit the straightaway speeding up not slowing down and never wastes no time correcting or recovering thats good driving no sir thats great driving most civilians dont know how to corner even cops and good young racers it takes time and some investment of guts and fender metal and a lot of good luck to learn the trick you find that ideal angle that dont feel right but it is right you ride that angle at a certain point you brake but as she starts to skid you got to play leftfootrightfoot making the car dance so that you can be speeding up before youre on the straightaway cause if thats where youre stomping it youre already too late and in all this if your timing aint right youre upside down in flames and hoping the foam truck gets there before your hands and feet burn off never mind the busted neck i see gunny said red whoever drove your daughter off the road wasnt no kid he was a damned good experienced racing driver he had all the tricks hes way up there with the big boys like scrawny little tubofguts matt there hes a professional what he was trying to do he was trying to kill her five the reverend alton grumley pronounced a mighty sermon full of baptist hellfire and damnation in the meeting hall of the piney ridge baptist prayer camp a few miles outside of mountain city on old just before it hit new he called upon god in his majesty to send wisdom to his young prodigal he who had failed send wisdom humility respect for elders all those things a good christian boy should show his religious mentor thou hast failed he said in a powervoice all throb and vibration thou hast failed because thou did not pray for guidance hard enough thou must pray brother richard and give the soul in totality to the man upstairs only then will he listen the reverend was a scrawny old boy with slickedback hair all pouf and vibrant with gray and hair oil big white fake teeth and dressed in a powder blue threepiece suit from mr sams big store his sons and nephews had a joke daddys tailor theyd say is wah ming chow of number industrial facility harbin szechwan province china and get to laughing up a fit you damned boys the devil will take you hed howl in rage and then laugh harder but the boys werent there now in fact only one parishioner listened to the reverend he was a rawboned fella of indeterminate agefellows like him could be thirty to sixty all hardscrabble southern school of hard knocks and rough roads indomitable relaxed tougher than brass hobnails not the sorts to get excited but exactly the sorts to avoid rilingwho now sat in the front row of the meeting hall in tight faded jeans beatup boots a blue workingmans shirt and a richard petty straw cowboy hat both shabby and cool pulled low over his eyes he wasnt the sort who took the hat off indoors church or no church he had on a big pair of mogul sunglasses too as king richard commonly wore and sported a mustache and a goatee though the hair wasnt real old man you do go on he finally said i am getting extremely tired of all this show you was given a job and you failed if i wanted failure id have sent my own damn sons they so dumb they guarantee failure god love em they are dumb said brother richard so called for his resemblance to the real richard petty and what was assumed to be a common nascar heritage but thats okay because theyre lazy too they are good boys said the reverend not really said brother richard anyhows we in a porridgepot o trouble now i agree after all she saw me not even you have seen me if you had to describe me youd come up with he looks like richard so i guess theyd send out richard on the circular but by that time i wouldnt look like richard everyone knows that hair is phony said the reverend it doesnt matter what they know it only matters what theyve seen anyhow you were highly recommended to me by at least three sources it was said by all hes the best nobody like him yet when i need you most you fail there are some things i cant control i cant control the fact that the girl drives like a pro she must have raced gokarts you can learn a lot in the damn little things ask danica who knew ive done that job more times than you can know and nobody ever fought so hard or made so many good decisions at speed if the world were fair id be marrying her not trying to kill her yessir but as i have noted in many a sermon the world aint fair not even a little bit anyhows i am as upset as you she saw my new face and it wasnt cheap not in money not in time not in pain shes the only one thatll identify me you should have had on one of your disguises i didnt have time you called me and i was off i had to kick hell to even catch her like to might have been smeared to ketchup by a logging truck some of the turns i took whynt you finish her you could see the car didnt roll if it dont roll you got problems i am not smashing a girls head in with a rock or cutting her throat among other things if you do that then all the law knows its not a hoppedup kid and is a murder and maybe you got state cop investigators maybe even fbi and lots of trouble it only works if everybody agrees its some kind of hitrun thing by some kind of speedcrazy nascarloving jackrabbit with the brains of a pea thats what im selling but theres an issue of what i do and what i dont do too i dont kill up close where theres blood its my car against theirs and i always win at that game nobody can stay in that game if i kill up close hell im just another grumley car agin car you didnt win this time brother richard now i dont like that one rev this whole shebang youve got set upwell someone has set up as i dont believe you got the native intelligence of a porcupine you are so insolent to your elders you should respect your elders brother maybe next time this whole damn thing turns on me you need the best driver you can get for a certain job and if you dont have him it all goes away you dont want that so why dont you stop cobbing on me alton and pick two sons or nephews if you can tell them apart which i doubtthe two with the most teeth and whose eyes are far enough apart so that in certain lights they appear normalyou send them into that hospital and since theyre such smooth operators and nobody suspects nothing yet they can just inject an air bubble into her vein and when it reaches her heart shes gone then all our problems are solved and we can do our job git our money and our revenge and move on i hope god dont hear the disrespect in your voice the reverend said but if im so dumb how come i already sent the two boys six vern pye had the gift of gab and ernie grumley the talent of conviction one was a nephew one a son though neither was aware of which category they fit into as names were sometimes misleading among the reverends brood after all the man had had seven wives and six boys per wife as per certain biblical instructions and if rumor was believed he had spread his seed amply among the various sisters of the various wives whether those sisters were married to others or not he had a way about him and a hunger and women for some reason were eager to give to him that which they thought he wanted they allwives formal and informal legal and only by custom sisters and husbands the progenylived together far from prying eyes on a chunk of hilltop outside of hot springs arkansas from there they did various jobs for various contacts around the south that the reverend had inherited from generations of grumleys before him the grumleys foot soldiers to the lord and also various interested parties that is why theyd temporarily migrated to the piney ridge baptist prayer camp on route in johnson county tennessee at the insistence of alton the patriarch vern and ernie were somewhat slicker than the usual grumley progeny each was smooth in his way and not too tattooed and the reverend noting talent where it happened to spring up although lord why do you test me so that quality was rare enough always urged them to develop their talent thus vern was the superstar of his generation of grumleys he was an aristocrat a pye out of grumley and so his blood was bluer than any others uniting two lines of violent miscreants from the hinterlands of arkansas outside hot springs he had killed and would kill again without much emotional investment but he didnt consider himself a killer he had vanities and pride he was the compleat criminal he could forge extort swindle steal cold steal hot do banks or grocery stores do hits administer beatings all with the same aplomb he liked getting over on the johns didnt matter who or what the game was it helped that he was unusually handsome with a dark head of hair and large white spades for teeth his eyes radiated warmth and charm he was as smooth with a line of bullshit as he was with a glock and he was pretty smooth with that hed done a few years hard time where hed basically networked and he had three other identities going two wives seven children girlfriends among the stripper and escort population in every southern state and a thing for young girls which he indulged at shopping malls clubs and fast food joints whenever he had a spare moment he could con a twelveyearold into a blowjob in the mens room faster than most people could count to one hundred ernie was less accomplished he was essentially a murphy man a fraudulent pimp who conned college boys out of their dollars and delivered zero in the sex department in some of the razorback states seamier venues basically in todays operation ernies job was to support vern and learn from him which is how they found themselves in medical scrubs under md nametags walking down the hallway of the bristol general hospital headed toward their destination the criticalcare ward it was late the place was nearly empty it was big enough however so that the concept of stranger could apply no nurse for instance could know all the medical personnel by name or face and could therefore be counted upon to yield before slickness sureness of authority and the steady guidance and charisma of an experienced confidence man itll be easy no one suspects a thing the girl is an accident victim not a murder survivor no security no suspicion no fear thus the two men ambled happily making eye contact issuing warm hellos and say there hows the boys as they coursed through the fourth floors spotless hallways they even stopped now and then for a cup of coffee to assure a patient on a walker and to examine bedside charts they took pulses looked into eyes felt throats just like on the television doctor shows when they reached nikki it would be a simple matter vern a little brighter and that much more ambitious was to calmly reach into his pocket and remove a number seven hypodermic filled with air he had practiced on the skin of a grapefruit all afternoon he was to look for a blue artery that led to and not from the heart plump up the flesh just a bit gently inject the needle draw some blood to make certain hed hit the mother lode then cram the plunger forward this would put a bubble the size of a small nuclear missile in her bloodstream and it would jet to her heart and explode it meanwhile ernie would race to the nurses station yelling get an arrest team stat shes lost rhythm then theyd quietly turn and continue their rounds the trick as vern had patiently explained to ernie was to do nothing suddenly if you moved fast if your body had a shred of fear or hesitation it would register with witnesses who were otherwise oblivious it was the first key of the con to sell the mark on your authenticity which was always done with gentle insistence assuming correct subtextual details for example if you were on a job like this you made damned certain your hands were very clean almost pink along with your ears your face any visible patch of skin docs become docs because they hate filth disease laziness clumsiness its how they feel like god so to pass as one you had to play by the rules of the game another issue vern was very big on was shoes what kind of shoes do doctors wear people notice shoes even if they dont realize they do thus theyd parked for a bit outside the hospital in the staff lot and noted men of a certain age whom they took to be docs and not orderlies of some sort your younger fellas and noted a lot of rockport wingtips so they drove to the mallnot to mr sams where all the shoes would have been made by wah ming chow when she wasnt handcutting powder blue suits for the reverendfound a rockport store and paid for a pair each one cordovan wingtips the other less fashionable beige walkers they scuffed the shoes against the asphalt of the mall parking lot because the docs were parsimonious and wore each pair unto death now on those newbutold rockports they slowly approached the girls room it was so close it was two rooms away which theyd discovered after an earlier quick stride down the hallway reading names on the doors while feigning to look for a drink of water here was where your lesser cons would give up the ghost they wouldnt play it out straight theyd see that the room was so damned close and that the nurses were sitting at their stations on the floor without paying any attention at all to them and theyd sort of go into giterdone panic theyd go straight to the girls room do the deed and get out of dodge yeah but thats where it goes wrong an orderly is on the way to the john and he happens to look down the hall and he sees something he doesnt hardly ever see which is a doc moving fast docs dont move fast not unless its the emergency ward and some poor fool is bleeding out or going into advanced vapor lock docs have too much dignity to move fast so he goes to investigate and walks in and sees the needle going into her arm and he says hey what and ernie has to pop him with his nickleplated python inch and the whole thing goes up in flames and vern and ernie end up at the wrong end of another needle somewhere down the line no sir the reverend didnt raise no fools for sons or cousins or whatever so they played it out by good con discipline riding the gag hard they dipped in on mr x and saw that he was fine then had a nice visit with mrs y and noted that her color had improved and got a nice smile out of her for the comment even if she had no idea who in hell they were until at last after a quick check on mr z who was comatose as well they reached the doorway of swagger nikki accident victim and were about to say they looked up puzzled but not riled say there excuse me gentlemen the speaker was a man in a blue suit and a crewcut followed by another gentleman in a black suit but the same crewcut he wasnt a doc as he was moving too fast and looked a little out of place and when he got there he was outofbreath whoa he said more running than im used to plus a terrible drive over from knoxville anyway sorry dont mean to be a bother we just got here youre sorry again ron evers pinkerton detective agency knoxville office were setting up security for this patient here let me show you this he struggled goofily unsure to be busting doctors but better safe than sorry and he pulled out a comicbook badge just like deputy dawgs and some kind of photo id with an official pinkerton imprimatur ill have to see some id before i can allow entrance son im dr torrence im on my rounds said vern smoothly so sorry doctor really i am but ill have to get an administrator here to verify you pain in the ass i know and its your hospital and all that but her father hired our firm and his instructions were very clear no entrance without verification ive already liaisoned with hospital security if youre wondering ill call the hospital admin right now and he lifted a cell something scalding went off inside verns head in his younger days he would have hit the young security guy in the throat then kicked the other in the balls then he would have kicked each in the head until he was sure they were dead then he would have killed the girl with the knife he carried but vern was mellower now even as he felt the frustration build and build like a steam engine about to blow he kept it together well he said no need for that ill go get the duty nurse and shell get this straightened out yes sir thats fine come on jack he said to his cousin or brother or whatever kin ernie was to him well get the nurse i hate it when procedure is violated and the two grumleys walked ever so slowly down the hall in their rockports to the elevator and waited ever so slowly for it to come vern thinking i need to kill something or get laid preferably by a kid fast seven he called her from knoxville the next afternoon where have you been my god what is going on sorry its been busy shes fine or as good as can be expected the brain work is all fine shes just unconscious they say they usually come out of these things in a week or two and recovery is almost always percent so its looking very positive here medically bob i called the hospital shes been moved thats my doing the doctors agreed it was medically sound and so ive got her in a private hospital here in knoxville what is uh there was an incident i dont unclear and maybe im overreacting but the pinkerton agent pinkerton agent i did some checking and im not sure i buy the story about the redneck kid in the pickup anymore at least not wholly so i hired pinkertons to provide plainclothes security three teams of two anyhow as the first team was going on duty they stopped a couple of doctors on their rounds no big deal nobody thought anything about it but the docs went off to get administrative authorization and never returned so i asked and nobody knows who they were nobody got a good look at them only evidence they were doctors was the green scrubs and the nametags but hell anyone can buy a pair of surgical scrubs it didnt sit right so you moved her that was wise i think its okay if you fly in now i dont want to give you the name of the hospital until youre in town but id stay on the north side in a suburb she needs her mother she looks so sad all banged up all those wires and tubes so still breaks my heart shes strong shell come through this i know it okay you have my number when you get in here and get booked in a hotel call me and ill come by meanwhile ive got some nosing around to do what is it he told her at length about the tire treads the interpretation of the nascar fellows the general indifference of the sheriffs department the intensifying traffic and crowding as the big race day approached and the town filling up with campers celebrants drinkers rowdy kids and other assorted pilgrims so i mean to look into it i know you think im paranoid but he was surprised at what came next you listen to me a moment you have gone on many dangerous adventures leaving me to raise the child and now i have another child to raise yes i think you can turn paranoid but this time i am paranoid too because it is my daughter involved so youre not working off some crazy sense of honor or something you think you owe your longdead father or something left over from a war nobody remembers youre working for me if you think someone tried to kill our daughter bob then you find them and you stop them you stop them from harming our daughter or anyones daughter i will do that he said oh and one more thing yes bring some guns eight bob didnt really approve of newspapers and had certainly never been in the office of one before but thats what his daughter had wanted and as he looked at the city room with its ranks of messy desks its knots of insouciant young people its phone obsessives its listless copy editors its harassed junior editors its earnest techies to service the computers in mysterious fashion he wondered why it had meant so much to her ever since she was a child there was nothing in his family to account for such a leaning maybe there was a writer tucked away in some branch of julies but hed never heard of such a thing but he knew this she loved it she lived dreamed breathed and ate it okay sweetie he told himself if this is what you want i will try and get it back for you he sat in a conference roomglasswalled affording a view of the newsroom and the staff right next to the managing editors officeas jim gustofson the managing editor a tough gal named jennifer something and nikkis immediate editor briefed him on what shed been up to the gist of it was that nikki was the cops reporter and her specialty was the crystal meth craze that now gripped rural america as it played across northeastern tennessee and southwestern virginia shed done a prizewinning story on the children of crystal meth distributors who are put in foster homes when their parents are arrested she knew the sheriffs of most of the seven immediate counties she knew a lot of the knockdownthedoor cops she knew the social services people the welfare people the educators for the problem impacted all these areas the stuff was pure shit its only advantage was that it was cheap and the high it granted was intense if short lived once in a while you put your baby in the oven or ran over your grandmother with a lawnmower on the impression she was a troll halfling from the realm of zelazny but generally like dope everywhere of every kind it made its users useless slackers who sat around all day figuring out how to get a few nickels together for the next fix or kitchen chemists in trailer parks who tried to cook it up themselves all too often blowing a crater into the earth and themselves straight to hell a few shrewdies had big labs that made what real money was available in the downhome heroin racket she was preparing another big story on the shape of the problem in the immediate tricities area shed been visiting the local police entities trying to get a sense of what she was doing sir are these people dangerous well as they say they only kill their own kind turf wars the occasional hardhead who goes for the assault rifle when the raid team shows bitterness over price hikes or debts owed you know that easy money stupid people and hard times have a way of creating misery your daughter was the witness to all that shes damned good at her job shell be moving to a bigger city soon im betting it has been a pleasure to work with her and watch her grow yes sir but was there anything specific about johnson county some particular area she was looking at i think i want to go poke around its my nature annoys the hell out of people i know but cant be helped you dont agree with the police report thelma fielding is a good cop she is and i liked her very much it just dontexcuse medoesnt sit right with me thats why i have moved her to another hospital he didnt bother to tell them it was in another city reporters talk people listen that much he knew yes she said she might have to go back said the woman editor jennifer johnson county is so far from everything its a kind of a bad joke around here about the cultural tendencies of the rural working class or these days in this economy nonworking class you mean the trailer trash maam im proud to say i am one of them pure and simple but you dont need to pull punches with me i know they make the best soldiers farmers and family people in the world but that same stubbornness and willingness to risk makes them sickbaduglytempered boils on the butt of humanity if they choose the dark side wed never put that in the paper but yes thats what were talking about so the meth problem is particularly bad in johnson thats where you see your most grotesque crimes and some of the ugliest violence but last year they elected a reformer for sheriff a county man named colonel reed wells i have heard the name handsome guy famous because he was a ranger officer in the war in baghdad and won some kind of medal a star silver star bob asked yes i think thats right were you in the army mr swagger you have something of the military about you not in the army no maam i did a spell in another branch well it shows i wish some more of my reporters had the discipline and the organization that the military teaches so well anyhow reed wells was in the forefront of the fight against the drug hes your dynamo type to the accompaniment of much publicity he has acquired a helicopter from the army on some kind of justice department grant that passes surplus material on to police agencies hes organized a firstrate raid team all very gungho you know guys in black with hoods and machine guns he searches for the labs from the air most days then coordinates with ground then he hits em from above just as the ground team hits em from two sides very commandolike nikki said she felt like she was in vietnam though i dont know how she could know anything about vietnam maybe she saw some old books said bob but heres the thing johnson county leads the region in the number of meth labs raided the number of arrests the number of prosecutions but the odd part is the price of meth in johnson hasnt gone up its stayed the same now why would that be if the supply is drying up the price would rise yet nikki had discovered from someone in an abuse program that the stuff is just as plentiful and just as economical that means that either a outside sources were bringing it in or b there were a lot more meth labs than anybody thought or c there was some kind of superlab capable of taking up the slack that nobody had discovered yet finding the superlab theres your pulitzer prize for investigative reporting and theres your ticket to the washington post i see said bob tell me if i wanted to figure out what she did the last day before the event what would i look for what does a reporter carry a notebook im guessing she had a notebook yes most reporters today have laptops that they carry with them then they can plug their notes straight into our computer system and it saves copying and reduces mistakes so there should be a computer too and of course a cellphone it might have numbers registered that she called that day the police would have recovered all those things from the accident site though of course they may be damaged or whatever or they may be temporarily impounded as a part of thelmas investigation but thelmas a decent person if you want your daughters things back im sure shell cooperate you must have some sort of list of names and numbers out therepeople involved in the meth business i dont mean dealers i mean all the social services people the drug rehab programs that sort of thing she might have talked to them i can get you an official list ill talk to bill carter he did cops before nikki got here and i know he gave her access to his rolodex ill get a list from him that would be very helpful mr swagger said jim gustofson i can certainly appreciate your anger at the inability of the sheriffs department to bring this thing to a close quickly but im wondering if you really want to go up there on your own and start demanding answers and kicking in doors i cant just sit around its not my nature sir with all due respect sir i see where nikkis aggressive nature as a reporter comes from but i would caution all my reporters not to take chances and i have to say the same to you the people up there dont like strangers and they have as has been noted violent proclivities you could find yourself in a lot of trouble fast id hate to see a tragedy become a double tragedy and you end up on the front page of our newspaper good advice sir i wish i could follow it most would but sorry to say i cant bob called the hospital to check on nikki called idaho and saw that julie had already left for the trip to knoxville and then started the drive out to johnson county but soon found himself ensnarled in traffic he pulled over got out a map and investigated various alternative routes but all seemed to take him too far to the west and then back around he decided to bull through straight down volunteer parkway on the premise that once he passed the speedway traffic would lessen considerably and he could make up for lost time and still get out to mountain city by midafternoon where hed begin with detective thelma and maybe even get a chance to meet up with the hero sheriff reed wells silver star winner and reformer the traffic crawled along and the closer he got to the speedway the more festive bristol turned he felt like he was at some gathering of clans or tribes or something there was a feeling of celebration in the air and no shortage of alcohol to fuel the glee pennants hung across the road all the street lamps had been festooned with portraits of blasting chargers or fusions or camrys roaring through clouds of dust blazing bright with primal colors looking for all the world like fighter planes hungry for the kill flags of a hundred colors flapped and danced in the wind against a bright blue sky every lawn bore a sign offering parking and the cost increased hugely the closer he got to the speedway the far hills were carpeted with recvs suvs and tents as a whole new population of occupiers and spenders moved in they were like the lakota sioux just before the little big horn only in vans and sleepers instead of wikiups crowds thronged the walkways and seeped into the slowed traffic everywhere entrepreneurs had erected booths or tents offering souvenirs of the fun blankets hats posters rental radio sets for eavesdropping on the chatter between driver and crew chief food of every sort drink of every sortno problem with liquor licensing down here everybody just sold whatever they wantedstraw hats after the famous beatup richard petty configuration neckerchiefs sweatshirts tshirts charting the rise of the confederacy damn these folks knew how to party no wonder they called it a nation it was a hootenanny combined with oktoberfest with an office party with a safe return from thirteen months in the land of bad things with a chinese new year with a hoedown with a rock concert and oh yeah the vjday feeling his old man must have had after survivingif barelyfive invasions on five islands across the pacific he shook his head at the frenzy of it the intensity seemed to have increased threeor fourfold since his visit with usmc matt and his crew chief red nichols a few days earlier and he saw that dropping by to see them now was all but an impossibility they were sealed off by crowds and madness as the big day approached finally he topped a low hill and saw his principal obstacle just ahead it loomed gigantically dominating all that was before or around it and he saw it was situated a couple of hundred yards to the left of volunteer parkway he would have to pass it to get beyond the bristol motor speedway looked like some kind of huge ship from space that had crashlanded in this part of the shenandoah it had a kind of familiarity to it he could not again place but then it flashed clear some movie with will smith as a marine fighter pilot but that wasnt but a small part of it it was about an invasion from space and these huge ships came down and dominated the earth the fs fired their mavericks at it and the missiles just popped on the perimeter because of some kind of magic shield it was stupid he realized and wondered why on earth hed wasted the time and money maybe the usmc fighterpilot thing but now he recalled after will and the boys had put the old usmc boot up the ass of the whatevertheyweres from wherevertheycame the big ships crashed and burned thats what it looked like a giant space ship all chrome and sleek streamline and immense scale and circularity some kind of manstructure too regular by far for nature crashed and burning askew in some place where it didnt belong a green valley with whispers of blue mountain ridges to the east and the west in fact it looked like nature had somehow been scrubbed from the scene by the thing so dominating was the manmade structure and so active the little city that had grown up in its shadows but then he noticed almost as an afterthought a high foothill carpeted in forest rising above the speedway it was about a mile off on his left separated from the speedway by a plain now peopled with a frenzied mob where booths and exhibits and tents had been set up hell you hardly noticed the hill at allthis big lump of verticality was all but banished from vision and notice by the hugeness of the speedway and all the frenzy it sustained he thought wonder why they havent knocked that old pile of rocks and trees down and put condos in right there anyhow he struggled down through the thick stopandgo of volunteer parkway until he reached its closest point to the speedway itself and saw that here too everything was on an upswing the grinding buzz of the cars qualifying insidemaybe his new pal matt macready was on the track now sailing along at about thirtyfive degrees at perfilled the air giving every physical thing including bobs rental car and his eardrums a kind of vibration baby sister the boys were burning rubber and hightest today what was new today was that some kind of trailer park had been constructed in the immediate vicinity of the structure itself and proudly wore a kind of midway carnival banner that said nascar village it was all jammed up with pilgrims of the faith he saw that it was a little neighborhood composed entirely of trailers trucks and vans that had the specialized capability of converting to retail outlet by opening up into a kind of high counter from behind that counter dozens of men and women all in nascar regalia sold yet more souvenirs most all of it driver oriented worshiping the cult of the guy that pressed the steel around the oval at speed and risked death in the process he had time to examine the setup at length because the traffic had stalled almost to a creep and it wasnt long before he noted the matt macready trailer just as big and busy as any of them with young matts face emblazoned everywhere and the usmc digitalcamouflage pattern spread everywhere you couldnt but think about the money if it was a religion part of the observance was the cash transaction as dollars were traded for official nascar gear and the official stuff evidently demanded a premium over the chinese crap that the imitators and hustlers sold in their little stalls across the way someones sure getting rich he thought all that damn money turns people to fools then at last the traffic cleared and he sped away from nascar village and the speedway toward the green mountains ahead nine why o heavenly father why he beseeched lord how thou tests me lord i am thy humble servant please send me relief god was busy he didnt answer so the reverend alton grumley was left to his own bitter devices and they told him goddamnit things wasnt happening as theys supposed to curse that girl he left his tiny office off the gym floor of the rec center of the piney ridge baptist prayer camp and stepped out into the heavy pressing heat of an august afternoon in tennessee and in a yard meant to accommodate baptist jumping jacks and deepknee bends saw before him sweaty men struggling with an entirely different set of rigors jesus christ no shouted brother richard to a gaggle of grumleys who fought with a device at the base of a large truck it was a graceful but surprisingly heavy steel construction that rode its own smallish steel wheels it was called a hydraulic jack and was used for lifting the left or right half of a vehicle off the ground it was crude old disobedient and annoyingly stubborn it hated grumleys and grumleys hated it what they had to do with it they had to do fast getting grumleys to do something fast was like getting cats to dance it just hardly didnt ever happen you monkeys screamed brother richard to all the sweaty tattooed grumley beefthe sun was high the sky cloudless bugs and skeeters drawn by the stench of flushed grumley flesh swooped and darted you cant do nothing right you balding guy whats your name again cletus grumley brother richard you dont come across when hes trying to get the air wrench on the lugs you wait till hes got em coming out then you git on around its gotta work smoothly or you get all tangled up the tires roll away and many a race in fact most races are lost in the pits where the big muscle boys like you havent practiced enough and it ends up looking like a chinese fire drill yes sir but mosby stepped on my heel brother richard which is why i done spilled forward wasnt going forward wasnt meaning to just got tripped up by mosby mosby you a cousin or a son or maybe both dont know sir heard it both ways not sure which gal is my real ma was raised by aunt jessie who may have been the reverends third wife or maybe his fourth i tripped on cletus because someone either morgan or allbright pushed me morgan allbright slow down said richard slooowwwww downnnn and he tried to indicate calmness lack of excitement craziness by a kind of universal gesture for calming pressing both flattened hands down as if to say bring it down a notch its morgans sweat said allbright it stinks so it makes me want to throw up aint my sweat said the one who had to be morgan its your own damn farts you be smelling morgan farts more than any white man in this world and most negroes the issue was syncopation an airdriven power wrench and the highstrength hydraulic jack had to be dragged sixty feet set under the edge of the truck and the truck jacked up the power wrench had to tear loose the lugs the old tires had to be yanked off and dumped the new ones slammed on the lugs powerwrenched tight it had to be done fast really fast and the boys had been trying so hard but maybe this wasnt a grumley sort of thing there was no one else though time was short and race day was approaching okay boys said brother richard you knock off now well do it again later when its cooler and dont let allbright eat no beans tonight or cabbage neither richard wiping his neck with a red handkerchief came over to the porch where hed seen the reverend watching grumpily well sir he asked you tell me were these boys just raised by pigs or were they suckled by them too or maybe sired you are the whore of babylon brother richard that wicked tongue will get you smitten brother richard not till after youve had your race day fun old man we both know that so i will amuse myself as i see fit until we have done our jobs and by that time you will be so rich you wont have any thought for brother richard and his sharp tongue now whats going on with the girl i have just heard the reverend said that that daddy of hers has moved her damn said richard damn is right she wakes up and starts singing we are fried in batter maybe she wont wake up before we move or maybe shell die or something you cant take that gamble you know well as i do that girl is trouble she has seen my face and she knows enough to tip off your plan she makes a single phone call to ask a single question to someone who knows a little something and we are finished youre supposed to be a crime lord do something criminal well son thats the problem if we find hershes got to be in either knoxville or raleigh as he moved her by ambulance that much i knowif we find her and make sure then we expose completely the idea that what happened to her was part of a plan or a necessity to protect a plan and maybe that makes all their security go up and the plan is based on their overconfidence that no further security is needed as you well know i do know just as i know said brother richard that the plan is damned smart dont believe nobody never did what youre trying to do the way youre doing it before so how could they figure it out its so damned smart i also know you grumley didnt think it up no sign of a grumley pawprint anywhere on it your ilk may screw it up if they cant get the goddamned tires switched off fast enough and we become peas in a pod for the police shooters but i think theyll just manage it like many men in his profession brother richard had a clear view of what was necessary for his own survival no he explained you cant just hope she doesnt wake up or if she wakes up she doesnt remember even if she wakes up in six months she may know enough to lead law enforcement straight to you and i know youll roll over on me like a mangy dog with an itch that plus she saw my new face i cant have her helping a police artist by drawing a good picture of my new face i spent a fortune on this face and it hurt like hell for months i need a new face to operate you understand old man you have to act on this now and permanently mark get up off your pallet and go to your house rise you cripple on the strength of faith in the lord walk pray work and triumph if the lord is our shepherd we shall not want it aint wanting im worried on its arresting they git me i go to the chair then its frying you think you know all brother richard even dumb old reverend alton knows its now a needle chair needle you still end up dead i am the sinnerman as i have explained i do not want to face a day of reckoning i will run from the lord and try and hide in the sea or the moon or the mountain all on that day you youve got no worries i can face my lord proudly of course because you were born a snake and someone put a mouse before you and you ate it you liked it and that was it you became an eater of mice more mice please that was your code and you never gave a damn about anything more and more mice you ate and you never thought of the family life of the mice the culture the fantasies and religious structures of the mice the history theory and music of the mice for you it was an easy enough thing it was your nature you eat mice end of story now me i chose to become a snake for my own borninhell reasons so i know that mice have as much right to life as i do and that they feel every pain and fear and hatred that i do love their kids make the world go on fight in wars work in or build factories or houses i empathize with mice so when i eat a mouse i know what agony i release in the world and knowing that i take pleasure in it your code more mice please mine i revel in the agony i release and it suits a certain twistedsister part of my brain it fulfills me that reverend and i am proud to say it that is sin i cannot believe a blasphemer like you brother richard thinks it appropriate to lecture me on sin you must wear the number of the beast somewhere on your body no one knows less about sin than a grumley yall are basically animals you may not even be mammals im not sure you just do what your instincts tell you and in a funny way it is gods will lord what snakes these grumleys be hail hail the gangs all here announced itself for one moment interrupting this important eschatological dialogue and of course it was the reverends cellphone which he took out of the inside breast pocket of his powder blue chinese suit hallelujah he said you sure hallelujah he snapped the phone shut it seems that damn girls father has showed up and is asking questions oh lord another test fuck thought brother richard i will send carmody and bj to watch on him if we have to well have to take him down he is old and harmless cant hardly walk straight his hairs all grayed out but you never can tell another mouse thought brother richard ten glad you came by said detective thelma fielding putting out a hand which turned out to conceal a strong grip should have worn a gas mask said bob aint it the truth you get used to it she was referring to a strong scent of atomized carbon that filled the air and left a sheen of grit on all the flat polished surfaces clearly it had drifted over from the coal yard next to the sheriffs department which sat in the old train station that had been converted three years earlier when the passenger service closed down nobody foresaw that when they started dumping coal there now weve had osha in here six days a week and they finally decided to condemn this old building a shame it was a nice building once now its got grit everywhere and nobody can stand it next spring we move into a new building across town well thats something must be hell on white glove occasions she laughed at his joke which even he didnt think was that funny then she said i have some news for you thats great said bob he sat at her desk in the sheriffs department seeing it was neatly kept with a stack of files in an ongoing vertical holder there were a couple of trophies as well displaying a little gold man holding a pistol atop a plastic imitationmarble pedestal reminding him that thelma had won some shooting competitions which perhaps explained her fancy in its strange plastic holster he decided to try and get a gander at the inscriptions on them but couldnt from his angle she was the same as before khakis and a polo shirt her gun held tight to her waist in that plastic holster her arms oddly strong as had been her grip her ducktail blonde hair had just been worked on and her face was tan her eyes expressive also sheriff wells is in and i think you want to meet him dont you mr swagger yes maam well the best news is we got a paint and tire match from the state police crime lab in knoxville just came in she reached over took a file marked swagger nikki incident report cf opened it and took out a faxed form they say its a color called cobalt silver found on chrysler corporation vehicles notably the dodge charger the magnum and the chrysler their muscle cars the tire is a standard goodyear f and damned if that doesnt coordinate with a stolen car of a week earlier a cobalt silver charger lots of chargers go missing this time of year because the charger is the big hoss of nascar and every punk kid or crankhead is in a charger kind of mood so this one was stolen in bristol and my guess is whatever kid did it got himself liquored up and went out looking for someone to intimidate that night as i say i have my snitches working i will circularize but usually folks dont take stolen cars to body shops so i doubt that will pay off they just dump em in the deep woods and maybe we find em and maybe we dont and if we do find em maybe we can take prints and maybe we cant and if we can maybe we can id the car and maybe we cant probably cant but i know who steals cars around these parts and ive got some fellas you wouldnt invite to dinner or let your daughter date looking into it so im sure well come up with a name and then well go visit him i hope you let me come along on that one detective mr swagger you dont have some vigilantekickass thing in mind do you we cant let that happen and if you no no maam an old coot like me no maam i know my limits i just want to be as involved in this as possible well well see cant make any promises probably not a good idea but i am noted for sometimes making the wrong decision more to the point when your daughter awakes well want to interview her whats the word on that bob gave her a brief summary of nikkis medical situation leaving out the detail that hed moved her leaving out as well the results of his independent investigations you will call me when shes ready to talk sir i know youve moved her and i am not even going to ask where because thats your business but i know you will call me as soon as an interview is possible you dont miss much do you detective miss things all the damned time but try not to supposed to pay attention thats what they pay me for she smiled her face lit up and bob noticed what a damned attractive woman she was okay she said lets go and see the boss the office said war war was in the pictures the officer in lean camouflages standing with an m next to middle eastern ruins or in front of huge vehicles with guns everywhere some airborne some treadborne all desert tan all speaking of war a plaque with medals on the wall said war the silver star the biggest of them but there were others impressive a collection of a man whod been in hard places taken his fair share of risks and been shot at much and had lived to tell about it sheriff wells was tall thin hard and tan with closecropped graying hair sharp dark eyes and a languid way of draping himself as if to say that having seen most things nothing on earth would be of much surprise he wore the brown of the johnson county sheriffs department with a gold star on his lapel and a stock glock pistol in his holster as well as the usual duty getup of the police officer the radio unit with curly cord mic attached to his shirt lapel the taser the cuffs none of it taken off because he had to set the example to his men and women that the gear can save your life you wear it all the time thats what you do comfort is not a part of the bargain mr swagger he said after the firm handshake and the direct look to the eyes without evasion or charm nice to meet you though of course i wish the circumstances could be better how is your daughter at this point bob told him succinctly keeping it tight and straight as if he were himself back in service reporting to a superior well we all hope shes going to be all right i hope detective fielding has kept you abreast of our efforts if you need any help please feel free to contact us sometimes a criminal act is harder on the victims close relatives than on the victim herself i know how the thought that someone tried to hurt your child can haunt a father or a mother so please feel free to call us for our part well work hard to keep you in the loop i know how tough it can be to go weeks without hearing a thing from the police ive ordered all my officers to call each victim or nextofkin once a week to keep them uptodate on any investigation or legal proceedings thats our policy and maybe youve guessed that although i am a sheriff by appointment i am still a fullbird colonel by inclination and when i set a policy it is followed you sound like a straight talker sheriff so can i ask you a straight question or two and set my mind to ease you surely can go ahead mr swagger i expressed this to detective fielding as well i know youre all caught up in busting meth labs and youve got this big race in bristol and youre part of the manpower commitment for security on such a big deal and i do worry if therell be time to investigate my daughters situation hard given all that its true most of our issues are manpower issues that plus the goddamned coal dust on everything but given the size of the department its a hard thing patrolling a county thats several hundred square miles in area most of it wooded much of it mountainous what with our problems with narcotics interdiction and this damned race so weve got a lot on our plates but please know that i try and run a professional department and we will give this thing our best effort as time allows my motto is no back burner in my department everythings front burner in johnson county you have my word on that thank you sheriff now i did want to say something to you detective fielding mentioned to me that you had these doubts which are entirely appropriate because i know how upsetting something of this nature might be but she also said that you had mentioned poking around on your own that is my nature sir i am a physical man though you may still hear some arkansas in my voice i live in the west and in the west we are used to doing things for ourselves its not that i doubt detective fielding or the department i just know however that theres only so many hours in a day and there are pressures on you all the time so yes it was my idea to poke around a bit is that a problem the sheriff said look mr swagger i dont mean to be disrespectful but that newspaper and your daughter werent beloved among some people around here any more than i am i take my chances i suppose you could say she took her chances she was focusing a light on methamphetamine in johnson and folks dont like that if i had known she was going to some of the places she wentshe was a brave girl i dont think theres any doubt about thati might have cautioned her or sent a unit into the vicinity just in case now it looks like you might be poking in those places too im talking the places where the meth addicts do business where the trade is practiced where the stuff is cooked all of them unsavory places all of them volatile so i really dont want to be worried about you too my mission is to close these places down not look after an older fellow in over his head i see what youre saying still if someone tried to hurt my daughter id want to get him off the street and into jail as fast as sir you might rile somebody and a fellow of your age wouldnt stand much of a chance against young toughs with secrets to hide were you in the service did a spell in the marines a while back bob said well dont let that give you delusions of grandeur some of these hardscrabble tennessee boys are tougher than nails and they can go off fast and do some bad damage put some liquor in em or some crystal or both hootch and crystal and they can be downright mean even murderous id hate to find you beaten to a pulp in a ditch or worse dead in a ditch me too said bob i was a soldier for many years mr swagger i was executive officer for an armored combat brigade and went to iraq twice three times if you count my time in the sand in the first war when i was a lieutenant its part of my brain and i still am a soldier only now the wars against crystal meth but i have sadly seen a lot of violent death in my profession theres a sayingwhen the shit happens it happens fastthats entirely accurate im telling you around here in some areas it can go to combat fast combat is fast and scary and it takes a trained professional to survive much less prevail in that environment bob sat still working hard to keep his face uninteresting but he knew that colonels were very rarely in combat they supervised they controlled they kept radio contact they took reports they laid plans and bawled out lieutenants and captains when things went wrong but they didnt look through the scope squeeze off the round and watch a man jack hard then melt into sheer animal death they didnt see what the shells did to the people they caught in the open how it made a mockery out of any notion of human nobility when you were just looking at freshly butchered meat they didnt know boys whod never been fucked not even once died screaming and calling for mommy there was a whole lot about war colonels didnt know yes sir do you get my drift you are trying to be polite but you are telling me to keep my nose out of things or i might get eaten up just about that yes let the trained professionals handle it do you hear well ill be careful i swear to you fair enough id rather have your word that youll go sit by your daughters side thats where youre needed yes sir i hear you but i dont hear you agreeing i have a nature to follow that i cant deny sir now you are being polite and telling me to go to hell mr swagger you can get yourself in so much trouble so fast around here i miss my command imperative to reassign you to kitchen duties or public information but i do know trouble comes in two forms trouble with them meaning the bad guys trouble with us meaning the good guys its dangerous for an inexperienced man were you ever in combat i did some time in i tell you mr swagger its not pretty you cannot believe what a bullet can do to a human body yes sir bob said well im not getting from you what i want and i cant compel you to give it to me but i have to warn you that we dont recognize righteous lawbreaking meaning i cant cut you any slack i can and will arrest you on a lot of silly little things like impeding a lawful investigation or disobeying a lawful order if i find you poking around im so hoping i dont have to go that route on a man of your age yes sir said bob again now let me ask you one last thing my daughter had personal effects with her that day im guessing you retrieved them from the wreck id like to have them thelma whats the disposition on that detective thelma briefly checked her file then looked up and said we recovered a laptop seriously damaged by the wreck a cellphone her purse her keys a reporters notebook any of it part of the investigation its all pretty much busted up sheriff then i think we can let mr swagger have those dont you thelma yes sir she said okay mr swagger thelma will get those for you ill walk you out stop somewhere and blow your nose hard to get all the dust before it settles in your lungs well all probably die of the black lung anyhow ill shake your hand sir and tell you once again that i hope to hell i dont run into you in booking or the morgue eleven mountain city population two thousand five hundred was built along the stems of the crossroads of and in a valley between mountain ridges and it had ridden up the mountainsides in some places like towns anywhere it had its nicer side and its notsonice side its profusion of fast food on the big roads leading out of and into town its shabby ignored old main street but also its share of beatendown strip malls off the main drag but in one of them he found a computer store and went in finding it full of bustling earnest young geeks exactly the kinds of boys who wouldnt end up in the united states marine corps they were all gathered around a monitor that showed some kind of war scenario mainly beefy special ops types with super weapons destroying giant insects with their own set of super weapons finally a boy looked up and lumbered over can i help you sir whoa that looks like toast he was referring to the laptop with its spidery fracture lines knifing jaggedly across the bent screen the scuffed and cracked plastic the keys out of whack or sprung the whole mess looking finished for all time i dont know if we can do much with that the boy said you might have to replace the whole unit im guessing yall have a genius here bob said all these places do some real smart kidall the others dislike him hes so smart he wins the alien games all the time and he doesnt mind letting you know what a geek you are charlie how did you know i just figured it out anyhow charlie should be at caltech or mit except he flunked out of community college or got busted for marijuana or some such and he dont mind telling you how much more he deserves thats charlie he flunked out of vanderbilt math scholarship it was the games he is good with the games hes the best you cant beat him id like to see charlie please soon enough charlie was put before him a surly kid in a hooded sweatshirt still wearing a smear of acne but no needles or pins through his flesh charlie i hear youre pretty smart know a thing or two cant help you with that box though mister its completely wasted i can tell you that i dont want it fixed mr charlie i want it mined mined yeah i want you to dig out the hard drive and salvage what information you can data data yeah whatever you can particularly in the last few days it was beaten up in a car accident last thursday today is tuesday im particularly interested in the day of the accident mister i dont know looks like someone took a hammer to it does doesnt it maybe the fbi could tell me but maybe you know more than the fbi wouldnt surprise me and youre here and the fbi is in washington dc are you with law enforcement sir no just an amateur at all this well i can make a try it would be expensive i charge charlie wait a second he pulled out a stockbrokers checkbook dated it signed it but left the name and amount blank he handed it to charlie you start now you work hard you say goodbye to blowing up monsters from space for a while this is a maximum effort and anything you learn you call me asap on my cell no matter the time and when youre done youll know what youre owed you fill it in on the check and go cash it and thats all there is to it are we on the same page yes sir ill get busy right now good man charlie knew i could trust you bob checked into the mountain empire motel and set about the melancholy task of examining what remained of the effects his daughter carried that day the first of course was her key ring which held the volvo keythank god hed bought her a strong automobile for her first job maybe it had saved her lifeand what had to be the key to the kawasaki he saw parked out in front of the apartment building that one was particularly biting as it recalled many happy hours hed spent bombing across the prairie outside crazy horse on his own bike where hed built the new house and shed joined him she couldnt keep up on horseback so shed bought a bike a honda and the two of them went on bounding rides over the low hills under the huge sky in the baking heat those were good days maybe his best and he remembered thinking maybe more necessary than he acknowledged it was about then his hair started to turn it was about then he started having the dreams he saw the yakuza swordsman with his perfect english and his smart feral eyes and his swordsmans ambition and he knew that what everyone told him was true when you saw this man you were looking at death the last faceoff in the snow on the island what was he doing there what had consumed him with the idea that with his week of training suppleness from six months of cutting back brush on his desert property and his anger that he could stand against this guy it wasnt david against goliath it was little davy the threeyearold against goliathsan but hed waded in delusional and learned in seconds he was overmatched now and then as the fight wore on hed unleash a good combination his fourhundredyearold muramasa blade cleaving dangerously close to the japanese killer but the man was playing with him it was killers vanity it was a little game he knew hed die when the man tired of it when the macho chitchat between them no longer amused him when the magic hour came and civilians started coming into the zone there was a moment where he had nothing hed lost everything his lungs were blown he was bathed in sweat fatigued as the other swordsman stalked him it was all gone he remembered the despair why did you ever think you could do this why didnt you bring a gun pull it out blow a grain hardball through the guy and that was it but no you had vanity too you could be in this game too fool bitter fool on the slippery edge of extinction no he didnt think that there hadnt been time in the fight that was imposed later by his subconscious as he reconstructed it in the dream state and in the dream state night after night he saw the yakuza laugh and cut and open him deeply he saw his own blood spurt and felt the dizzy weakness fire through his body felt his knees give then he imagined the man making a witty ripostesorry cowboy time to catch the last stage out of dodge or somethingand then drive forward on the horizontal shimohasso and take his head more than once he awoke with a scream in a sweat seeing the world go atilt and then to blur in the eight seconds of oxygen and glucose a detached brain holds to sustain itself felt the separation felt the loss why had he survived that was the mystery as strange to him as anyone he knew only that at a certain late moment he realized he had a steel hip and he remembered some bit of samurai gibberishsteel cuts flesh steel cuts bone steel does not cut steeland pivoted and opened and the target was too great exhausted himself the great yakuza killer took the easy way out drove the blade through the opening and felt it torque out of control when an inch into swagger it hit the metal that was harder than it was bob came off the blow and cut him hard upward belly to spine and that was that you were so lucky he thought gunfighters luck arriving in the middle of a sword fight or maybe it was just that his subconscious had figured out a way to beat the guy and it emailed him the info just in time maybe it was just that he came from fighters and sired fighters and had a strange gift for fighting but he knew this you will never be that lucky again your weakness turned into your strength and you figured it out one onemillionth of a second in time the memory came at night and each time it came it left his hair grayer the cycle banished that it buried it so much sensation so much freedom so much beauty so much damned fun whats better than to be racing across the wideopen prairie with your child who makes you so proud and the sense that once again you survived then hed come back and it would be mikos turn and theyd work with her on the horse in the ring hed think never got rich in money but got rich in daughters and thats even better he put it down when it was too much for him and quickly called his wife im here she said weve got a room in a hotel across from the hospital and im here with her now so is miko is there any change its looking good the doctors say she could wake up any minute she stirs a lot more like shes asleep it helps her they say to hear our familiar voices so im very optimistic did you yes good im in mountain city ill try and get over there soon i dont think itll be tonight but tomorrow sometime ill be here all day she said hows the security theyre good people okay good love you love you next he turned to nikkis cellphone particularly to the calls dialed folder but somehow the thing was frozen up none of the functions yielded information but hadnt she called the cops from the wreck before she slipped off he made a note to check with some phone expert to see if that indicated something or if it was a common occurrence when phones were damaged then at last he turned to her reporters notebook a standard x pad held together by spiral rings at first its pages were densely covered and he saw that it was her interview with the sheriff then a page or so documented the raid mostly scattered impressions like rush of airhelicopter lands just as team hitskid cops seem to be having time of their life pathetic suspect cubby something sad little mutt he paged through it carefully reading items from her later interviews jimmy wilson mtn c drug rehab clin its so hard its everywhere and it aint no more expensive dont know why or maggie caruthers carter cnty didnt get address used to come to johnson for drugs pushers everywhere then all the busts stopped coming but head price was same came over and it was still everywhere maybe even cheaper superlab nikki had written where is superlab in another place but it petered out with no next step no list of appointments he could glean a little shed started at the sheriffs department in the morning gone on the airborne raid with the sheriff then gone to the drug abuse center and spoken to three people then the rehab center and spoke to four including a supervisor thennothing but how long would that have been would it have taken up the whole afternoon the accident was at pm according to the clock in the volvo where had she gone where had she been he looked carefully at the notebook trying to determine if there was any sign of tampering but there was nothing apparent then it occurred to him to count the pages very carefully he turned the leaves over and came up with exactly seventythree hmm seventythree now its possible all reporters notebooks have seventythree pages but that struck him as odd wouldnt it more likely be an even number like seventyfive he looked into the spirals for signs of what were they called hanging chads little nuggets of paper residue left from some kind of tearing operation nope nothing he went to the last page with writing on it guessing that if pages had been removed theyd have been at the back he found nothing well maybe nothing maybe something he found a light set of inscriptions the tracks of a pen against a paper that had gone through and recorded on the next sheet he couldnt make it out but took it into the bathroom where the light was stronger and holding it a variety of ways to capture the right proportion of light and shadow came across something interesting it seemed to say piney ridge baptist prayer camp and it also saidgunfire twelve the grumleys were the special forces of southern crime the reverend raised them homeschooled them taught them the ways and means of crime strong arm grift con theft and murder exactly as they had been handed down through generations to him he kept them sequestered on the mountaintop compound halfway between hot springs and polk county in arkansas while preaching hellfire and damnation on sundays to keep his religious education accreditation and as excellent camouflage he only trusted family family was the magic bond that made the grumleys invulnerable no grumley had ever snitched out another grumley or a client as was well known and part of the grumley magic but to keep the enterprise going the reverend had to procreate heroically his real product was progeny fortunately he was a man who had found his true calling and with women he was dynamic he had had seven wives and none had ever left him the divorces were pro forma to keep the law at bay and some of the girls may not even have known they were divorced he had children by all of them by most of their sisters and a ma or two he even had a thing for a bit with ida pye of polk county and out of that got his spectacular boy vern though vern for all his skills had issues of pridefulness as demonstrated by his refusal to take the grumley name altons brothers contributed their own seed and the result of all the crossbreeding and the endless nights of bunnyfucking was a tribe of criminals higher by far than scum more disciplined by far than trash and perhaps best of all not the brightest of all the boys in the trade it was a grumley breeding principle to eschew intelligence and when a boy or a girl was born with an uncommon mind he or she was sent to private school far off then college then exile those kids had prosperous if lonely disconnected lives and never knew they were damned by iq their superior intelligence was known to beget inferior criminality because they had imagination introspection questing natures and occasionally the worst attribute of all for criminals irony they were poison it was known among the crime bosses of the south that a grumley on the team meant success grumleys were hard tough loyal mercenaries grumleys could kill rob swindle beat intimidate anybody if a snitch had to be found and eliminated for an atlanta mafia family a grumley could get the job done if a bank had to be tossed in birmingham a grumley team took it down if an issue of enforcement came up in new orleans a grumley fist settled the issue if a loan was past due in grambling louisiana a white grumley was dispatched and it was known that he would be fair and honest in his application of force would never use the word nigger and therefore ruffle no hard feelings he would come beat collect and move on it was only business and everybody appreciated that high level of professionalism it was known too that grumleys didnt go easily and that was part of their reputation if he had to a grumley would shoot it out with the whole fbi hed go down with a gun in each hand hot and smokey just like an oldtimer from the golden age of desperados he didnt mind shooting he didnt mind taking fire and he didnt mind the odds against him heaping up to a thousand to one he wouldnt be one to negotiate this of course meant the cops stayed away if at all possible but if not possible they treated grumleys roughly out of their deep fear no love was lost no sentimentality attached no nostalgia generated cops hatedhatedgrumleys and grumleys hated right back hard and mean grumleys were handsomely paid for their efforts which is why it was so strange for twelve of the youngest and the most promising to have been called from prosperous enterprises in this town or that city and gathered under the reverends watchful eye to this isolated chunk of baptist tennessee called for a caper that even they themselves didnt fully understand under the supervision of a strange fellow calling himselfor come to think of it called by them for he called himself nothingbrother richard who taught them not how to bust safes or shortwire alarm circuits or tap into computer data banks but how to change truck tires at high speed that was really all they knewexcept for all the shooting practice which hot sweet mama promised some funand damnit it was beneath them to do such manual labor under so cruel and arrogant a leader but the reverend insisted and in the grumley universe his word was law he sold obedience and loyalty and it was their job to offer obedience and loyalty and thus it was that two other grumleys two hard ones named bj and carmody were assigned to stay with the damned girls daddy as he had adventures in mountain city what they saw was an old coot with a bristle of whitegray hair and a bad limp they differed on what exactly he represented bjs opinion was strong hell he aint nothing but an old man this heres a waste of time that coot cant get nothing done blow in his ear hell fall down but carmody by trade an armed robber and occasional assassin had a different opinion dont know brother he looks old he moves old but first up i dont like how tan he is tan means hes outdoors a lot and if hes outdoors hes might to be all spry and peppy id like to git a closeup look on that face and see how much age he wears maybe he aint all wrinkly i just know gray hair and a limp makes a man look old and feeble but looking aint being he may have a jump or two might surprise us you are a fool carmody i say we go on in there brace him hard tell him this aint his part of the country and hed best return to the old folks home and watch him run he will run scared like a rabbit i guarantee hes got some sly im telling you some men have natural sly they see into things they git what they want they aint got no need to show bullstrong like your lowerclass white thug them thicknecked fellas the eyetalians think are so tough man wish i had a buck for each one of them i saw fall down and not get up you do have a buck for each one of them you saw fall down and not get up you know what i do anyhows im not at all convinced this fella aint your natural sly they were parked in the parking lot of a hardees across the street from the mountain empire motel where the old man had gone to ground it was boring duty in a onehorse hick town rimmed by mountains and fueled by fast food no decent whores anywhere in sight though maybe a fella could get his motor oils changed somewhere in the little burgs negro section that may have had more to do with grumley lore out of hot springs colorful past however than anything real hohum said bj hofuckinghum oh wait lookie brother thats him it was they saw the old guy hobble out of his room lock it solid and limp to his dumpy rental car in a few seconds he had it fired up and headed back down the road turned left onto the big wide stretch that was they followed in just a bit he pulled into the low logcabin structure that represented the johnson county welcome center just east of town bj driving let him get into the building before pulling into the parking lot it was carmody who drew the duty of trying to get in close and get an overhear he entered the low old place finding it a museum in one half and a travel office in the other with racks of maps and tourist brochures for local attractions such as they were and an earnest crew behind desks servicing the visitors indeed the girls dad was talking intently to an old lady and carmody boldly slipped near reaching for a bed and breakfast brochure on the table and listened so many baptists around here you wouldnt notice if a new one came or an old one went i swear yes maam he heard the man say this one would be new im guessing not a church but some kind of prayer camp piney ridge i th piney ridge well sir why didnt you say so piney ridge is where reverend elmore childress had his needy childs camp in the s until the er unpleasantness since then that property has sat vacant if this new fellow wanted a place for a prayer camp that would be the place and whod notice all the baptists around now my people are episcopalian and have been and its nothing agin the baptists but theres something a little roman about their service if you get my drift and my sister eula and on and on the old bluehair went but carmody was free of the politeness that required he listen he snatched up the b b brochure and trying to keep the leap out of his steps slid out the damned door you see a ghost no sir that bastards already onto paps place what how the hell damn i didnt get a good look at him well looks like pap may be eyeballing him himself he pulled out his cell punched the reverends number meanwhile bj set the car in motion eased out of the space and lot and buzzed a little down toward just to be less visible when he took up the tail on old man swagger the next time he moved pap what is it carmody pap he knows he explained what he had learned to hushed silence on the other end finally his dad said blasphemy blasphemy damnation and hellsmoke that tricky bastard what is he up to pap if he drops by he wont see a damn thing that i guarantee you now you boys dont you lose him we will stay with this trickster hard and if we have to we will snuff him out do you hear me boys i will tell bj you boys load up and lock but keep your thumbs on them safeties if it comes to it you may have to shoot fast and put him down hard thirteen bob followed the old ladys instructions drove the rental up another couple of miles and found with signs pointing out an airport he turned headed through flat farmland though ahead a ridge of mountains rose like some kind of black wave against the surface of the earth he passed the airportdinky toy planes oneengine jobsrose through foothills and then was in the higher elevations the road had been engineered to find its way between the ridges and he slid through valleys and passes seeing many private drives off either side of the road then he noted his fuel light blinking and not knowing how much farther the drive would be pulled into a grocery store lesters grocery the sign said it was a solitary white structure lodged into the slope with a set of gas pumps out front he filled up decided he needed a coke or something and went in the place was dark and grubby staffed by a lounging boy with acne and too much belly and a surly attitude bob got a bottle from a cooler went to the counter and paid say you familiar with a piney ridge baptist prayer camp up this way lady at the tourist center told me it should be along this road no sir said the boy making no eye contact how about a sudden influx of new younger men in clumps keeping to themselves looking prayerful and pious ring a bell no sir said the boy son you said that so fast it seemed to me yous most interested in ending the conversation not thinking hard for an answer same as last time here look at me look at my eyes see that im a human being too try and help me out be surprised what good things can follow from that sullenly the boy looked over bob saw boy was the wrong word guy was maybe in his midto late twenties though still riddled with the face blemishes of adolescence while the features of his face had gone all lumpy with excess weight here as on his body he made the briefest of connections then bobbed away sometimes some fellas come in new fellas he finally said dont seem no baptists though seem more like hoodlums tough guys dont know where theyre from just show and buy up beer and fritos and smokes and pork rinds keeping to themselves paying in cash making comments about lesters store and how shitty it is dont like em much good said bob thanks a lot yes sir said the boy something reminded bob of a certain kind of young marine the loser kid who joins the corps as a way to start over to have a new life to do something well and right some of em dont make it and its just more fuckups until theyre gone with a new set of grudges but now and then you find one who gets to the top of the hill and goes on to become a real marine and maybe has a life he couldnt have imagined when he was fat pimply and sullen without friends and hated by everyone most of all himself that wasnt so hard was it no sir it aint my business but a young fellow like you shouldnt be cooped up in a nowhere place like this and those guys baptists or not are right about how shitty lesters store is yes sir said the boy i know that cant you get a better job no sir cant seem to get my letters straight didnt do well in school quit after two years dont test out good enough to get into the service like to be in the air force work on planes love planes but cant pass the tests lesters only fella that would have me i think he knew my daddy maybe you got something wrong with your eyes or some little deal in your brain makes you see the letters in the wrong order there is such a thing you know you should look into it yes sir said the fellow you should get yourself tested yes sir well i can tell from the way you say it you dont mean a word of it son dont give up take some free advice from an old goat with a limp whos been around a block or two in his time on earth some social service deal in town or off in bristol or wherever will test you for free and if you have a thing wrong come up with a way to fix it up give it a try you dont need to do this shit forever the boy looked at him from darkest abject misery then smiled it seemed nobody had ever talked to him like a human being before the smile showed surprisingly good teeth and maybe a little brainpower in the eyes i will look into it he said thatta boy said bob by the way that baptist place got to be the old pioneer childrens camp where i think a man hung himself when they caught him diddling little children back some years i heard someone rented and moved in its four miles up on the left black metal gate locked all the time they painted it over so the black is shiny but i dont think they changed the pioneer sign you do know a thing or two said bob bob got there soon enough and it was as the fellow had said the gate was newly painted though the sign that read pioneer childrens camp was still shabby with age a dirt road led off into the forest disappearing as it wound through the dense trees in a few yards the gate was still sticky in the august heat and it seemed a lot of bugs had landed and found their fate to be paralyzation in the thick goop someone had slopped all over bob looked for a way in thought it wrong to just climb over the gate and then saw a sstyle intercom relay on the gatepost he pushed the scifi plastic speak button hello there through a rattley smear of electricity the answer was nothing more than a can i help you names swagger he said my daughter was the one nearly killed in an accident on on iron mountain out of town last week im looking into the circumstances and have information suggesting she stopped off here was wondering if i could talk about it to someone the bossman i guess the cackly soup recommenced to jabber from the speaker and bob thought he heard a certainly a clunk of some sort announced that the lock had been sprung from afar so he opened the gate drove through then closed it behind him the road twisted through trees then between a couple of foothills and came finally to an open valley behind elevations that formed obstacles that were green and high but somewhere between hills and mountains maybe what eastern people would call mountains but certainly not what a westerner would so label he saw a small white chapel standing alone a barn a kind of exercise yard of pounded dirt a schoolbus yellow in the sun a dormitory and a kind of gymnasium all of the buildings constructed with sturdy tin tinroofed and a little shiny ballfields basketball courts and the crater of an old and unfilled swimming pool also used up the open space until the forest took over again and shortly thereafter the mountains began their skyward inclination he parked next to the bus in a parking lot where a lot of vehicular traffic had worn a lot of grooves but no other machines were in sight and as he closed his door he looked up to see an old buzzard in some kind of powderblue threepiece suit approaching a cross between colonel sanders and jimmy carter with the formers cornpone stylings and the latters hidden hardness of spirit mr swagger mr swagger we are so sad about your girl said the man rushing urgently to him laying a little too much courtly southernstyle bullshit on him bob stretched out a hand felt a grip stronger than you might expect saw blue deep eyes pink skin smelled cologne saw white fake teeth and a bristle of a genteel mustache as the older fellow announced himself to be one reverend alton grumley of the new freedom baptist church hot springs county arkansas he was up here with a constituency of young men who wanted quiet and solitude to pursue their bible studies the reverend had waves of moussed hairpossibly real but almost certainly not his own by birthand the pinkness of the overscrubbed he told bob that he was welcome to stay as long as he wanted and the reverend would answer any question sir thanks for the time come on in set a spell ill answer any question i can to put your mind at ease oh the poor dear thats sad and a parents pain is sad as well the buzzard fretting about nikki led bob to a porch that overlooked the athletic fields and in time a wellprepared young man in a white shirt and dark trousers came out with a pitcher of iced tea and the two men sat talking and sipping she was such a nice young lady said the reverend grumley my first child said bob so you can see my concern how is the dear girl she shows signs every day of improvement yet shes still in that coma they say she could come out at any moment or never dont mean to give you worries but have you thought of moving her from bristol to a bigger city with more sophisticated hospitals actually i already did that shes in baltimore now where theyve got the best medicine in the world i see said the reverend yes sir the world famous johns hopkins i have heard of it said the reverend im happy shell have the best care shes fortunate to have a father who has resources the horses have been kind to me i own a series of layup barns across the west where they take their horses seriously whats the money for though if not your own children true enough now the police say it was some unruly young man trying to be a nascar star that caused the accident at least according to the paper is that the accepted version it is and i have no cause to doubt it still i want this boy caught so he wont do the same again to another mans daughter now the sheriffs department in this little county is all stretched thin because theyve got to provide a detail for the big race that plus sheriff wellss helicopter raids on the meth labs that youve read so much about which seems to be his obsession at the expense of other duties so i worry this issue may have slid to the back burner i am poking about to see if theres any need to hire a private investigator tell me how i can help you bob said he was reconstructing that last day and was curious as to why she had come out here given the fact a baptist prayer camp didnt seem the sort of place to conceal a methamphetamine lab which was the original intent of her assignment she was just doing her job the old fellow said shed evidently heard reports of gunfire from out here and made a connection between guns and criminals and drug lab security that sort of thing but i explained to herhere come with me mr swagger let me set your mind at rest they walked across the yard then the field and came at last to a small structure a kind of open hut bob looked inside and saw a roboticlooking electric device that was like something out of an old black and white science fiction movie with pulleys and fly wheels and an arm along one side a stack of orange clay disks sat in a kind of magazine assembly up top of course he knew what it was an electric trap for sporting clays skeet or trap it throws birds clay birds the reverend opened up a cabinet and inside were three overunder shotguns he took one an old ithaca broke it open and handed it to bob who looked at it as if hed never seen a gun before many nights the boys gather here and fling birds then try and hit them as they sail off it takes skill concentration judgment a steady hand philosophically it expresses endorsement of our beloved second amendment the discipline to master the gun the wisdom to use it wisely discipline and wisdom exactly what it takes to lead a life in christ id rather have the boys doing something like this than playing basketball or touch football where they smack against each other where strength and size count more than skill and cliques and grudges are formed unhealthy i see and when i explained to your daughter that to the localswere not socializers out here we need the silence to concentrate on the bookthat to the locals the sound of the guns in the twilight was almost certainly what they took as suggestion of some kind of drug activity she understood in a flash she smiled apologized for interrupting and went on her way i see said bob really thats all here watch me with the gun he took the gun back dropped two red cylindrical shells into it and snapped it shut used to be pretty good at this go ahead turn on the machine there itll throw a pair and youll see bob examined the gizmo for a switch found it snapped it and the thing clacked and whirred to life two clays descended from the stack rolled to the arm and settled in some kind of grip the arm suddenly unloosed itself with a springdriven force and flipped the disks in a curving path across the field smoothly the reverend brought the gun to his shoulder as he pivoted in rhythm to the rushing saucers in front of him and he fired twice in the same second both birds dissolved in a puff of red dust ow thats loud said bob clapping his ears sorry should have given you plugs or muffs yes the guns do make a bang though you get used to it the boys do it over and over you can adjust the trap to throw birds in an amazing variety of ways i see said bob now i get it yes sir would you care to try a pair thanks reverend but i dont care for guns havent touched one in years that limp of yours i guessed it might be from a war youd laugh if i told you nothing so dramatic in japan a fellow who was demonstrating an oldfashioned sword he slipped and cut me imagine how surprised he was at how his demonstration turned out i hope you sued him but good no there was no point he learned his lesson anyway thats all forgotten so would you like to see the place or stay for supper or i know the p m prayer service very calming serene a sense of connecting with gods way no sir you have solved that little mystery right swell good sir i am pleased now let me press on you something i give all visitors its a very nice king james bible we give them out quite freely i gave one to your daughter and she seemed grateful to receive it sir i believe theres one in my hotel room but this is a gift and as a gift you might someday turn to it and find wisdom and succor youll pay no attention to a hotel room bible true enough i suppose the old man trundled off and returned with the black book in his hand he gave it over to bob with that i believe i have made a friend for life he said ill not beg you to read it but some night on the road you find yourself hungering for something i think youll find nourishment within its pages thank you sir ill go on now and try and locate other witnesses to my daughters adventures then ive got to call the hospital to check on her the reverend walked him to his car along the edge of the grass and it was there that bob noticed that whoever had raked out the dust field had missed a spot at the margins and at least twice he saw some strange tracks wheel grooves about twelve inches apart deep and evenly cut indicating they had borne something heavy it rang a bell but didnt call up an image and he wondered where hed seen it but then he was at the car again reverend grumley thanks for your cooperation and understanding and hospitality its a privilege brother swagger youre not a baptist i fear no sir well you dont need to be a baptist to figure in my prayers sir i appreciate that sir bob headed back to town but pulled over to the shoulder and stopped the car i need to get all this straight he thought do i have something or is it all coincidence and my own vanity has got me believing theres some deep conspiracy here because im so damned important he tried to think it out each step at a time attempt at murder by professional driver but whats the hard evidence that its a professional driver the interpretation of two expert race people on some aerial photos theyre not professional accident investigators whose word could be trusted maybe they sensed my need to believe and without meaning to fed into it to make me happy but they were so convincing on the subject of cornering and clearly had a mountains worth of experience at that arcane art that is my best evidence a second though admittedly unspecific attempt at the hospital maybe it was maybe it wasnt the pinkerton security man who seemed solid enough just stated that some doctors tried to gain entrance to nikkis room no one ever saw them again no one had ever seen them before still memory and chaos play tricks on peoples minds and given that it was a big busy hospital its easy to understand how it could have been legitimate the possibly missing pages and the destruction of the recorder and laptop also no bible again interpretation not fact she could very easily have torn the pages out herself and the electronic items could very easily have been smashed up in the crash the bible could have been so generic that it wasnt recorded as hers or maybe it was thrown clear of the crash the odd sense of perfection at the church camp as if it had been ohsohastily cleaned up and reverend grumleys seeming to fish for information on nikkis progress while mildly cooperating again it was the nature of religious establishments to keep themselves extremely tidy although the skeet trap in the shed was an unusual touch and it might well double as a kind of subterfuge under which a lot of gunfire could be explained away innocently just in case of curious visitors such as himself and nikki not completely unlikely but again provocative the strange tracks in the dust they reminded him of something but what and why couldnt he remember it where had he seen such tracks on the other hand why were they so strange could have been some kind of cart wheeled out for maintenance of the skeet trap could have been the gardeners cart forbut a gardeners cart would be wider why would it be so narrow and finally the fact that he was being followed maybe that was the best thing it couldnt be thelmas department because they didnt have the manpower to detach two boys to play tag with an annoying stranger all day long but two boys had been playing tag with him all day long ever since his visit to the sheriffs office so someone in the department had a contact with someone he shouldnt have the tail car was a ford crown vic beige hed yet to make direct eye contact with it because a sniper develops instincts for when he himself is being hunted bob had the experience to know that you never let your hunter know that you know hes hunting you so that in actuality youre hunting him so when the prayer camp showed up all clean and sparkly it was no surprise because the boys following him in the carthey had passed him and he knew they were waiting around another two or three turns in the roadhad seen him heading down theyd called ahead to the reverend who got his boys off on a quick and hasty cleanup so that when he got there hed be welcomed warmly and nothing of suspicion would be around okay he thought this is an interesting game all of a sudden so what i will do is go back to my room at the mountain empire and set a spell and after dark i will sneak out a back way and cut open their tires and then unfollowed i will head back here and see what i have got and his cell rang he answered hoping it was julie with good news about nikki but saw an unknown number in the display swagger mr swagger its charlie wingate you know at mountain computers yes charlie well i did some work and couldnt come up with much but i did get it to print out some script and i managed to decode a little of it bob understood that the kid had somehow gotten something off the hard drive go ahead well it was numbers the numbers threesixtwo threesixtwo yes sir and i could tell that it was a sequence of three numbers a dash then four numbers it was the last three numbers in that sequence a phone number thats right so i know a cop and he has a reverse directory andsome computer geniusi just found all the numbers by hand theres only about three thousand people in the countywe found seven numbers ending in threesixtwo go on five were just residencesi have those numbers for youone was a day care center yes and the last was a place called iron mountain armory its a gun store on the north side of town thats great charlie when you write out that check to yourself throw in a milliondollar tip fourteen this one wasnt stolen it was rented although the credit card used to rent it was stolen by the everslick vern pye hed moseyed about the mall in johnson city eyeing teenage girls especially the ones with them little bubble asses you know no real bounce to em yet but tight kind of bursting against the cotton of the shorts andhe saw a fellow just about his own age height and coloring close enough to pass as vern in thumbnail photography but not nearly as handsome he jostled the fellow in a knot of other shoppers leaving the big k smiled excused himself and walked away with one wallet but without another one his fingers were that fast and that good what was that all about you might ask vern knew that what gave away the stolen wallet sooner rather than later was the absence of the weight so when he lifted leather he replaced leather usually with a few fives and ones in it that way the mark wouldnt note the absence of the weight on his hip later when he reached for his wad to pay for something thats when hed make the discovery that hed been boosted there were a few instances though where a guy had actually pulled the new wallet out plucked out a five paid put the wallet back and went about his business some people dont pay no attention at all the truck yellow with two up front and eight in back came from penske and was a stroke ford diesel mover as had been all the rest of the trucks well fords not movers necessarily though this was an when the others had been and even a which brother richard had not been able to use because its electronics varied so now the three of thembrother richard vern and his everpresent sidekick and buddy ernie grumley sat in verns very nice cadillac eldorado along a completely deserted road in the cherokee national forest a few miles west of shady valley vern and ernie smoked their marlboros enjoying the mellowness and getting ready for the show the yellow penske renter sat nearby looks perfect said brother richard as they always are brother richard i do good clean work you know vern was anxious that he not be confused with the lower class of grumley whom brother richard was known to despise okay im guessing under sixty seconds today cant bet agin you brother got that stopwatch yessir okay watch me go all set you call it ernie yessir readysetgo and with that brother richard was off besides certain tools he carried with him a strange rig that consisted of a small green plastic box with xzillaraider imprinted on it a swirl of heavy wire with electronic interface clips at one end with a more complex swirl of lighter wireone for power one for groundinga bypass and a switch connecter it was the xzillaraider unit from quadzilla of fort worth a truck performance shop known in the biz as the cleverest in coming up with ways to gin up the power on a diesel engine there were other techniques of course you could even cut the diesel fuel in the injector by forcing propane from a tank and get a significant power swell but who wanted to be messing with propane in the middle of a gunfight not richard no sir so the xzillaraider was the best for his purposes it was a geniuslevel mesh of electronics that essentially took over the brain of the diesel in the penske and increased performance parameters it fed more fuel to the engine more fuel meant it burned hotter and there was your power upgrade sometimes up to extra horsepower and a torque gain of footpounds the problem was you had to monitor the temp because if you didnt you could melt or ignite the engine the additional problem was that richard wasnt going to have time to mount temp gauges and all the wires of the gizmo not in a gunfight his problem was to find exactly how few wires he could connect and still get the maximum power boost without bothering with all the safety devices it just had to run for a few minutes and after that it didnt matter if the truck burned or not he moved swiftly but didnt try to push it got to the engine of the truck and opened the hood where others might have seen complexity confusion terror he saw the universe of his upbringing the nurture of experience the thrill of godgiven genius about to be engaged expertly he reached deep into the engine space beyond the big architectural structures and into the nest of wires found the map sensor directly behind the fuel filter bowl he quickly disconnected the factory connector and connected the xzilla harness in its place plugging in the male connector to the harness he cut away the wires connected to the injection pump and attached the blue wire tap to the wire closest to the engine block from that point on it was wire work he had to know which wires to cut which wires to reconnect all of them color coded quickly he grounded the engineugh was it really necessary to unscrew the negative terminal connection no not reallyand then cut a hole through the rubber grommet to the right of the master cylinder assembly and shoved the wire harness through it into the cab he dashed into the cab and didnt bother to mount the switch but simply began plugging the wiring harness into the module itself that little green box where the gods of engine monitoring lived and worked he turned the key and watched the modules blinking leds finally signal success after running through the sequence settling in the red the highest power zone he turned the key further and after a grinding clunk and another turn of the key the engine burst to life and brother did it burst the sound was almost like no engine on earth a guttural blast full of implications of the explosive and it rocked the entire vehicle he could hear the engine revving insanely suddenly injected with a power beyond measure almost too much for the confines of the combustion chambers it was on steroids it was the barry bonds of truck engines fiftyseven four yelled vern a new record brother richard goosed the pedal and the engine howled demonically yet it didnt burst into flames he had it he finally had it and pretty goddamned near time too talk about cutting it thin why the deal was only a day or so away and suddenly he saw the paint on the cantilevered hood begin to bubble and crackle and that meant flame invisible to the human eye had burst out of the engine shit he rolled sideways hit the ground and kept rolling as he heard the telltale whoosh of the fuel in the tank igniting not explodingit wasnt under enough pressurebut flinging a blade of hotstar radiance a good thirty bright feet in the air from under mr penskes fine vehicle bleaching the color from the day for just a second then the flames settled back into your normal totaltoast truck burn licking and eating and devouring issuing the rancid odor of scorched metal melting plastic burning rubber vern carefully backed out in the eldorado threw out his cigarette turned on the air conditioner to full to evaporate the sweat on the mens brows soon enough they found a main road and were well gone by the time the fire trucks and poor detective thelma fielding showed up lord amighty that was close howled handsome vern aflame in delight at the excellent adventure youse almost tonights meal im too tough to digest id keep you boys up all night with stomach pains it ran good for a while though said ernie yes it did said richard i think thats it i dont think i had it grounded right youre supposed to remove the nut at the negative battery cable and attach the black wire i didnt take the nut off but just wound the black wire around the terminal naughty naughty next time i will take the few seconds to remove the nut its time well spent and we will be close enough for government work youll see you sure brother richard sure im sure all on that day id hate to burn like a bonfire stead of running like a stallion burning hurts said vern case you hadnt noticed so i hear saw a fellow burn to death once lord god he screamed i had the distinct impression he wasnt enjoying himself a bit nor will you brother true enough brother well boys get that old fraud of a daddy or an uncle or a molester or whatever polysexual archetype hes playing this week to pray hard for you and me or else well all arrive in hell prefried cod well be a goddamned bucket of colonel grumleys chicken extra crispy fifteen bob drove through the town of mountain city sped along a picturesque route toward virginia and soon enough found iron mountain armory of course it had a sign reading guns and surplus and of course it was in an old quonset hut with trees clumped around it with a small parking lot in front of it on route heading north the mountains were to its left casting lateafternoon shadows that buried the place in dimness but he could make out a largescale wooden caliber browning aircooled mockup at the apex of the corrugated steel buildings curve the old trainer showed cutaways displaying red bolt faces and chambers which must have taught six or seven generations of machine gunners their tricks before going on the surplus market and ending up on every gun store roof in the south the gun was rotting though its stout four feet of mock barrel swaddled in cooling sleeve with the omnipresent grid of round perforations certainly looked menacing enough the place like the old machine gun model had that beatendown quality to it a sense of better times having gone by interior rot under the paint he walked it to find what he expected ratty old trophies of bucks and bulls long since killed fish in waxy midleap glowing against polished wood plaques racks of rubbery rain ponchos utilities bdus netting shovels from half the worlds armies web gear chinese knockoffs of current sandbox dutywear multicam and digitalcamo patterns everywhere lots of gun safes sunglass cases for that supertommy tactical look and behind the counter fifty or so rifles racked butt down for easy examination the front case had another fifty or so handguns mostly the black plastic stuff that was taking over the market little of the blue steel and walnut motif that bob and his generation had learned to shoot on except in the used box ars were the predominant theme gun safes second and hunting only a third fella came up to him from the counter older gent heavyset eyes dead not your naturalborn salesman type help you bud hope so sir bob said you the manager close enough my names swagger my daughter is nikki swagger if the names familiar its because she was the girl reporter from bristol who had a bad car accident a week back on coming down the other side of iron mountain someone tagged her and shes still in a coma sorry for your daughter bud but whats it got to do with me the guy said but bob thought he saw just a flash of dread and the beginning soon quashed of a guilty swallow maybe the fellow was just a nervous type well sir my girl wasnt into guns or anything which is why i thought it odd that on her laptop we came up with what appears to be the phone number of this place i dont know why shed call or come by but she may have im trying to track down what happened that day the papers said it was an accident what difference does it make what she did accident dont follow no plan it just happens i know but there are some discrepancies in the official account im just poking about trying to make sense of it all sir sure it dont amount to nothing but i have to do something while im waiting for my daughter to come back to me well i dont know if here let me show you her picture maybe itll jog a memory he pulled his wallet showed the man a nice picture of nikki at last years graduation so beautiful so young so vulnerable the man didnt really look at it just said no no believe me we dont get many young women on their own in here and id remember sometimes a young fellow comes in with his girlfriend and sometimes the wife comes along to buy the glock for home protection but almost never will you find a girl like that in a place like this i see im real sorry for your troubles but i cant help a bit uncle eddie came a call from a workroom behind the counter and a kid peeped out you sure on that i seem billy goddamnit you git to work you got a lot of ammo to break down and get shelved i dont pay you to palaver yes sir goddamn kid said the man to bob girl crazy catch him reading them dirty magazines one more time instead of breaking down all that and his ass is gone i dont care what margaret says i see said bob yep good help is hard to find these days what about a phone call from a woman there wouldnt be a pretty face associated with it mister i get nothing but phone calls some of the damnedest you ever heard can i rent a machine gun will you guarantee a deer how come walmart in johnson city has it for and you got it for is a nine millimeter more powerful than a whats the best gun for home defense can i buy a gun like the soldiers use so maybe i got a call from her and maybe i dont but i sure as hell cant answer you one way the other with certainty billy you get any calls no sir said billy yelling from the back none that i can remember that seems to be all she wrote sir unless you want to buy a nice sks for under a hundred whats an sks asked bob chinese military rifle no i dont think youre the type anyhow thanks you got me scratching another one off my list he turned and left the reverend grumley was thinking about fucking as he almost always did when he wasnt thinking about the next few days he hadnt fucked in about three weeks now and the ordeal was getting harder and harder the images poured over him all the holes that he had filled all over america how the gals just seemed to want to give a man of the cloth a reward for all the natural good he brought into the world he was going insane some of the damn boys beginning to look pretty good to him but the last time the phone rang he answered it there in the office of the chapel and it was bj and carmody reporting that goddamnit that fellow had somehow gone straight straight in a goddamned beeline to eddie ferrols iron mountain armory how in hell he make that connection hed been in the goddamn county two hours and already hed made two big connections on the reverend got the whole story the fellows sit by the roadside going over notes then speeding off he see you nah carmodys too good a driver bj was always boosting carmody and carmody bj because they knew in the scheme of things they were secondstringers to the more glamorous pairing of handsome vern and ernie see thats what the reverend hated all that competition the formation of cliques and rump groups and bitter outsiders it made for bad business and if he wasnt mistaken carmody might actually be verns half brother rather than cousin but hmmm hed have to work that one out later as these issues were never too clear but now wasnt time for lectures on brotherliness you got him yeah hes in there now were parked a good three hundred yards down the road eyeballing him with glass okay hang tight this here thangs gittin a little hard to handle soon as he leaves you call me and ill call eddie see whats what yes sir what yall packing im carmodys git em ready may have to go to guns yessir ill try and think some plan up you know something there he is okay you hang tight he hung up went to his wallet to find eddies mountain armory number but before he did the phone rang again reverend eddie hear you had a visitor goddamnit reverend you done promised me nothing nothing like this going to happen it was clean it was legal it was okay we had the paperwork and everything and goddamnit first that gal shows up with that cardboard piece of box top and now her goddamn father asking questions the old grayhaired guy didnt look so goddamned old to me tell me what he asked tell me what he knew did he know much he said hed heard she called or come out this way it was on her laptop eddie narrated the story of his conversation with swagger but he didnt seem to know nothing about what you got for me what its possible use was what we had planned eddie said no he had no clue hes just grasping the reverend said maybe not reverend but he sure come close and when this thing goes down theres going to be all kinds of commotion and he might be the one to figure it out so even if he dont got no idea now maybe he will then you said nobody could connect all this up and goddamn its already been connected up settle down eddie i see now i got no choice its too close too much is at stake okay you sit tight the reverend will figure on it he hung up repunched bj in carmodys follow car you got him yeah some bad news too okay dont know what this means but he didnt go straight to the car he went around back hes back there five minutes aint there an entrance or something i dont know what hes looking at or doing back there but when he come out he made a beeline to the car and now hes headed back into town you stay with him you understand while i work out a plan hows this for a plan we pop him theres the plan you idiot whyd he get killed you get state polices in here and they much smarter than the johnson smokies and the whole goddamn thing crashes and burns just a few days before got to come up with some way to get rid of him that dont look like grumleys done the work on contract for something else big that goddamn sinnerman is out blowing up trucks with my boy vern and i cant use him again like on the gal you stay with him you hear meanwhile ill think something up reverend in said carmody evidently taking over the cell while driving i worked a memphis hit where we waited till the mark was in a little store we walked in shot him dead beat the shit out of the storekeep took all the money and some peanut butter and was gone they never ever made it to be a hit they may have suspected but they never could do nothing about it hows about that one hmmm said the reverend could goddamn work youd get thelma and that photocrackpot sheriff and maybe some mountain city fellows but theyd be thinking robbery and theyd never link it to nothing else theyd say damn this family sure did run out of luck when it come to johnson county you make certain you dont kill the clerk or any of the other witnesses scare hell out of them you hear so the cops have to wring necks just to get descriptions got it this onell be fun daddy said carmody sixteen bob went to the car then stopped and looked back only one grimy window of the quonset fronted the parking lot and he could see that no one was eyeballing him maybe they were listening so he went to his car turned it on gunned the engine then turned it off he got out walked at an angle to a path around back and followed it there he found the receiving area an open garage door and a loading dock he leaped up some stepsouch the pain in his hip stabbed at himand slipped in there he found the grubby assistant on his hands and knees applying crowbar to a crate of russian x mm ammo by which rough process he liberated twenty boxes junked the wood and loaded the boxes on a cart for eventual shelving howdy bob said the kid looked up one of a type salloweyed furtive maybe a little brighter than the poor boy in the grocery store backwoodsy but not an idiot you aint supposed to be back here mister and you aint supposed to contradict the great eddie when it comes to remembering things sometimes i speak out of turn well maybe you have something to say worth hearing said bob whyd i tell you a thing round here folks treasure loyalty what i see in you is righteousness youre stuck with a moral center so youll know that if it was my daughter in here i have a right to know and eddie aint got no right to clam up eddies not righteous that ill say some things i know couldwell that aint your business but this young woman is he said handing over the picture of nikki shes a finelooking young gal said the boy i have to say she deserved a lot more than getting knocked into a ditch by an asshole playing mr dale the senior im looking for him he and i have business hope you find him okay heres what you want to know yep she was here that afternoon late then near dark like it is now close on closing time i heard her voice and knew it was a younger gal i peeked out and got a good look and damn she was a beautiful young lady sir if you dont mind me saying so takes after her mother what was it all about well took a bit of squirming and i come in late on the conversation see i wiggled over there he pointed up the wall to a hazed window that separated the backroom from the store itselfand i popped the window a bit i suppose i dont know you might think bad of me i just had to figure out what it was sorry to say had to get close or shes an attractive young woman youre a young guy you have hormones its only natural yes sir thank you anyway shes asking about something the bible i think hmmm said bob the bible that bible again somehow between leaving the reverends prayer camp and showing up here the bible had become important this connected with no theory of his daughter he could imagine she had a bible and theyd been talking about a passage i think that was it i was forty feet away now what passage mark mark and she had a bible unless they make other books that have black imitation leather covers and gold page edges it was a bible it was mark whyd she come to a gun store to ask about the bible any ideas well eddie is a lay preacher he does know the book maybe she asked someone to help her on a bible passage and they said hell just down the road eddie ferrol knows his bible times backwards and forwards makes sense to me yeah possibly and thats it well yep except except what son you didnt never hear this from me i never even talked to you you will go away and not come back into my life yes i will eddies twitchy anyhow but suddenly hes real twitchy and i hear him on his cell he goes way over in the corner so nobody can make out what hes saying and hes like totally twitched out almost in tears almost crying almost sobbing and then hes calmed down somehow by whoevers on the other end he says okay okay then he hangs up he comes looking for me tells me to go home earlythats a first let me tell youand only time i ever saw him look like that was two years ago when his wife left him and he went on a binge i know he binged hard that weekend and was a grouchy sonofabitch forwell till now bob knew what happened somehow nikki revealed through a bible passage that she knew something and it scared the hell out of eddie and as soon as she left he called whoever he was in this with whoever he was working for and they called the driver fast and he raced after her which is why he had to leave rubber up and down iron mountain and only just caught her and did his killing thing then only shed gotten too far down the slope and she was too good and he didnt get that roll on her and so she survived boys he thought im getting close and then we will have our business but then another thought hit him you go look you tell me what eddies doing right now the boy went to the hazed window cracked it and peeked out just like then hes over in the corner talking on his cellphone and hes all twitched up seventeen now what it was getting dark and the two boys on him werent holding back anymore theyd gotten up close maybe two hundred yards out could do a sudden turn shake em what would that accomplish you forestall confrontation certainly violence but a cost you tell them youre onto them and suddenly youre the object of a manhunt here in johnson county and you dont have any weapons maybe you dont even shake em theyre damned good they run you down and thats it youre dead after all youve been through some white trash peckerwoods take you down in a gully in passel o toads tennessee or wherever the hell it is no you keep surprise on your side make it work for you make them think youre an idiot youre just bobbobbobbin along singing a song you dont know a thing youre an amateur theyre the professionals i need a gun that was what it came down to without the gun he was an old goat with a limp a grayhaired fool in over his head and he had two gunmen on his tail because hed done exactly what his daughter had done somehow cut trail on somebodys plans even if he didnt know those plans himself or hadnt figured them out something would be happening soon though else why the urgency to kill his daughter and now to kill him whatever it came to one thing i need a gun god made men but only colonel colt can make them equal for without the gun the old the young the weak the meek the silly the soft were nothing but prey to the hard and ruthless predators of the world no matter what the rules say rules are written for nice people in wellguarded zones who laugh and chatter and enjoy their little jokes at cocktail parties but here in the hard world where the shit happened fast and the blood gathered in lakes on the wet pavement without the gun you were just roadkill anytime anyone decided such a thing you lived at their whim and when they decided to take you down for whatever reason down you went cradle and all fuck why didnt i bring a gun i am on the goddamned bullseye and i need a gun and theres no place i can go without he thought drive to the sheriffs department go see detective thelma spend an hour or two there until you figure out whatbut theyd wait so tell her everything shed laugh then shed be pissed because his findings directly contradicted hers and shed shoo him out the door and whered he be theyd wait for him and take him when he was available they were hunters they waited for their shot then he got his hard cold bob the nailer mind back and he thought how will they do it they cant do me with a car again it would be too strange it has to be a firearms thing a shooting what theyll take me put me in the trunk drive me deep in the forest and shoot me then bury me itll be days before anyone figures out im missing that would be one way but even then questions things hard to control things hard to foresee someone might find the car too soon or someone might see them someone might hear them i might get close enough to hurt them or get a gun away from them they dont know who i am no theyd much rather shoot me dead from twentyfive feet and leave me how would they do that then of course he saw how it had to happen he realized he had one card to play and that was he could control where the thing took place and he could only come up with one answer he picked up the cell tried to remember the name of the goddamned place then produced an image of the sign lesters grocery on route he punched gave them the town and name of the place waited for the connection and shortly enough after three and a half rings he heard a familiar voice yeah is this lesters yeah whos this you recognize my voice ise just in there two hours ago old guy gray hair limp gave you a little lecture yes sir i remember okay son you listen hard to me son this aint bullshit okay yes sir im going to get there in about five minutes maybe goddamned sooner i will park come straight in as i park youll see another car pull in behind me in a bit two fellas will get out of it they will have masks and guns oh shit said the boy ill call the you dont call nobody aint time sirensd chase these boys they wouldnt show youd look like a fool and so would i and id still be dead by morning you understand the boy made a sound that sounded like a cross between a whimper and a gulp son you listen to me and you will come out all right you reach under that counter and pull out the gun stashed there an old colt im guessing i know you got one there aint been cleaned or checked in twenty years but its there and lets hope its working just take it out so i can reach it easy i will come in take it up and git ready then when the two men in masks come through the door you hit the deck i will take care of them i we will get through this its the only way and you may even get your picture in the paper and a date with mary sue hed passed through town turned right up and by now it was full dark and he was winding up in the hills scooting by the odd little house here and there otherwise alone on the road except for the headlights of his pursuers a couple hundred yards back i just put the gun on the counter said the young man we will get through this oh this is too good said carmody hes going back to that grocery store he stopped at earlier maybe hes going to visit the reverend again maybe but hell stop there im betting and he thinks he can get something else out of that dumb clerk oh this is too good this is just what the doctor ordered carmody was driving of course so he reached into his belt and touched the piece he always carried just to make sure it was there it was a sig p in with thirteen fastmoving husky hollowpoints tucked into the magazine and another in the chamber meanwhile bj was rummaging around in the glove compartment where he came up with two balaclava hats which could be peeled down to make face masks either for crosscountry skiing or armed robbery depending on the grumley mood he got them then drew his own weapon from his shoulder holster a stainless steel springfield he took the safety down performed a chamber check to make certain there was a grainer nested just where it should be put the safety back on and reholstered the gun we goin kick some ass he said the blood rushing to his extremes and his breathing grew harder and shorter yes we are we are for sure said carmody bob pulled into the parking lot they think theyre hunting me im hunting them it felt familiar and now from somewhere his battle brain took over even as he walked to the store past the pumps up two steps he felt things slowing down yet at the same time enriching in color and texture as if his vision were mutating to something beyond excellence his muscles were turning to flexible iron his breathing was growing nutritious his hearing superattuned so that every sound was crisply isolated in the universe he walked down the wide main aisle to where the boy stood awash in fear his body rooted stiffly his eyes too big his lips covered in white chalk bob could see the gun made it out to be an old colt new service and guessed that it had to be either a colt or a it was like a gun out of an old movie from an old america huge blue and gray where the finish had been eroded or spotted off by exposure to blood it was a humpbacked thing big for the big men who lived big american lives in the generations before and unusually heavy for its size possessed of an almost magic density which in turn gave it a density of purpose he took it up felt the checked wood grips worn flat almost smooth ticked open the cylinder lock and spilled out that tube to see it sustained six brass circles glowing in the fluorescent light each circle wore a smaller circle in its center the primer and around each was inscribed colt he snapped the cylinder shut not hard and flashy like the fools in the movies did but with a soft almost gentle touch for a revolver even a big old boy like this one was a gentle mesh of the strong and the delicate an intricate frail system of pins and levers and springs and arms that had to work in perfect synchronicity in a very nineteenthcentury sense of mission for it was a relic of that far century he felt it and its solidity immediately reached out and embraced him for bob lee swagger it was like reentering a cathedral this is where he was raised to a faith and it had never let him down and he would not let it down he heard the door opening he saw the boys eyes widening which told him what he needed to know that indeed masked armed men rushed at them he turned the gun came up fast in both hands and if he noticed a large man in black with a blackened hooded furious face and a black gun coming up he didnt have time to mark it for in the next nanosecond he pressed the big old colts trigger twice and with each crank felt the guns complexities occurring all the systems were in perfect mesh as the trigger came back under the muscular pressure of his finger the cylinder rotated under the same springconveyed pressure the hammer drew back exactly as sam colt or some forgotten genius engineer working for him had planned it back in hartford under the big gold dome and the dancing pony at the turn of the century as the sight blade rose and became all there was in the universe the hammer fell and in three tenths of a second he sent two grain lead fatboys on their way to somebodys low center chest where they tore an inch apart through skin muscle and rib and blew out large atomized chunks of heart tissue that spewed crazily throughout the chest cavity that one went down with a thump to the floor that sounded comic against the huge reverberation of the two powerful revolver blasts in the closedin space before he got his own gun up the second guy was not dumb and even as he knew his partner was hit fatally and that they had been the victims of not the perpetrators of surprise he moved laterally disappearing behind the rank of shelved can goods before bob could get a fatboy into him bob moved back using the shelf island exactly as his opponent did as a shield between them aware it was not cover but only concealment and suddenly red spray and diamonds filled the aireverybodys ears had switched off so there was no noiseas the gunman fired three times on the oblique guessing where bob would be and hoping that blind shots would bring him down bob was not where the fellow guessed as hed moved to his own left and meant to come around hard left hunched over and just showing a little flesh along with the big piece of hartford iron the gunman saw his mistake and turned to correct it when he was hit in the face with a large can of crisco that arrived in a tight spiral and smacked him hard he lost a step then bent to fire but bob was too far ahead on the trigger curve firing another controlled pair that sounded like one these a little more widely spaced one emptying quarts of coffee coke and fried eggs as it tore through his stomach exiting against the instant coffee in a puff of brown dust the other blowing out even more lung tissue and spinal fluid as it took him on a dead central angle he went to his knees dropped his silver vomited blood copiously and fell forward his butt up in the air in a comic kickme pose and in that frozen joke settled and died jesus christ said the boy good throw said bob i never hit anything i threw at before in my whole life well for one second you were peyton manning thank god it was the right second i have to sit down dont have time you listen to me i have stood and fought with many brave men in my time which includes three tours in vietnam and a whole lot of other crazed stuff you can fight with me any time and you belong with those brave friends iiwe did it yes we did now quick you take this gun and fire the last two shots out the door the boy took the gun it seemed heavy for him and tremblingly he struggled with the heavy trigger and finally managed to get one and then another shot off good work now you have powder residue on your hands and the police will take note of that you see how it happened they came in guns out but you drew and fired hit the first one twice out of your first three shots then the other one fired from behind the shelf missed you scooted to your left and fired three more times then you called the police you got that you me i wasnt here you dont know jack about anyone else you saw masked men heavily armed and you shot these two may turn out to be wanted or to have paper on em any reward is yours and anything you can get off this deal you go ahead you deserve it you stood and fought id pick up that can of whatever you threw wipe it off and put it back on the shelf dont need to tell nobody about that they shot you shot you won end of story are we clear yes sir you did good young man youre a hero okay well iits um i okay i am out of here you can get through this you just tell em the same thing over and over and nobody can doubt you just stick to the simple story i know you can do this thing yes sir so long now i will call you in a few days to check up who are you it dont matter im the guy in the movie who leaves without explanation okay youre clint eastwood if thats his name then i guess im him so long son eighteen it took a while for the news to get there of course since lesters grocery was only four miles as the crow flies from the piney ridge baptist prayer camp the boys all heard the sirens wailing in the night as various police arrived at the scene no one said a thing it could be it could not be who knew who could tell but time passed and there was no news from carmody and bj youd have thought theyd call in right after but maybe the boys went to town instead of beelining back toward the camp and were even now carousing in some low crib theyd found out about drinking and wailing and whoring because they knew that theyd done the grumley work well but after two hours the reverend sent vern and ernie in verns red caddy down to see what the ruckus was whether or not it had anything to do with carmody and bj the call came a few minutes later the reverend took it reverend we are here at lesters yes whole mess of folks all the cops in three counties state boys the works crime lab that detective thelma fielding and sheriff reed wells maybe even fbi up from knoxville tv stations newspaper and radio reporters from all three states the whole shebang even civilians are pulling in drawn by the light and the ruckus they can smell the blood in the air we cant get close theyve cordoned it off but quite a crowd has gathered whats the word there was silence as if neither vern nor ernie wanted to bust the news finally it was ernie who said rumor here in the crowd is that some punk kid shot it out with two armed masked desperados killed em both deader n shit the reverend looked for other possibilities dont mean a thing no sir first off no punk kid is besting carmody and bj grumley no sir not now not ever it has to be coincidence you know that brought some joe blows into the kids gun sights even if carmody and bjs off roaming around to make a job on someone so as to make it look robberylike i know the good lord wouldnt take two grumleys from me no sir not with this big thing coming up two days off and me needing every damn man so you just and then he sort of ran out of words sir ernie finally said thing is i think thats carmodys car in the lot i can make it out and its impounded and theyre dusting it for prints even now and a tow truck is here oh damn damnation hellish damnation flame and spark damnation it just cant be sir i am only telling you what i see was there anything about another fellow theres a shootout our two boys they gone but they got another fellow right tell me thats what its about sir aint heard nothing about no other fellow only about this clerk what a sadsack shmo he was only this time he came up aces a mankiller of the first rank chest to chest and muzzle to muzzle he shot it out and theyre down and gone and hes a hero of the highest damned order the reverend let out an animal howl of rage and pain deep soul ache the blues whatever you may call it a grumleyno two grumleyshad passed his scream so rent the air that from the rec room where theyd been lounging playing cards watching tv on fuzzy black and whites drinking just palavering his progeny and kin came to see him and take the message of despair and vengeance he was putting out you learn what you can boys then you head on home he told vern and ernie yes sir the reverend looked up at his flock we lost em boys both em gone to the maker it aint right what happened sir he told the story as hed heard it no way uhuh no grumley going down in a fight with that puddingass kid seemed to be the consensus pap a voice came this boy he couldna gotten the goods on carmody and bj carmodys a good shot he had a knack hed shoot the ankles off a fly bj aint no slouch either said another remember in and he shot it out with two big black dudes in an alley in st louis and though he got punctured himself he made sure hes standing and theys bagged by the time that fights done several of the wilder grumleys wanted to lock and load and head out for hotblooded vengeance that very second we got the machine guns we can blast the holy jesus out of that town in a minute and a half with that big gun we can blow down all their church steeples we can take that fat sad clown and hang him upside down in burning tar in the town center it was at this time that vern pye and ernie grumley returned from their melancholy mission and they got there in time to hear all the talk of rage and vengeance of burning the flesh of the grumley killer of razing the municipality that spawned him or wreaking biblical vengeance on the transgressors through it all handsome vern kept himself calm finally and calmly he spoke now you listen up boys listen to vern i am the oldest and the most experienced i am maybe the most accomplished i have three homes three wives gals money in the bank and know some countrywestern stars so let me share some wisdom may i speak sir the reverend considered then said son vern you may speak your piece in the grumley fashion thank you reverend you boys yous all arage and full of the fires of hatred and vengeance you want to go in and flatten that place and teach every last man and woman in it the fear of grumley justice and i dont blame you a bit but we are men of a certain creed who live by a certain code and have certain responsibilities that is at our center and is as fierce to us as our baptist faith and our willingness to shed and spill blood so i say hold it in cousins and brothers hold it in cold and tight and squeeze it down now we have a job weve contracted to do weve worked hard on it weve prepared and sacrificed weve taken a stranger into our midst he indicated brother richard who was slouched beneath his richard petty cowboy hat and fake sideburns at the rear of the roomand let that stranger use his waspish words against us as if hes some kind of high and mighty we do that because its part of our contract we are professionals of a creed brothers and cousins and we will be true to that creed so for now it is my conclusion there should be no blood spilling and that clerk should be left alone to enjoy his few minutes of glory but i swear to you and you know that grumley to grumley grumley word is holy i swear to you that when this done finished then we will get to the bottom of this we will have a nice long chat with that lucky boy and we will find out what transpired and we will ascertain blame and we will pay out justice eyeball for eyeball earhole for earhole heart for heart we will inform the world that grumley blood is too precious to be spilled and when it is hell visits in due turn this did not mollify the grumleys it was not what they wanted to hear they turned back to their father and spiritual leader is that it pap is that what you want i have considered i see deeper into this its not about that clerk i agree he be no match for any grumley much less two i see another hand at play he paused who then reverend asked vern who is the master in all this i think that goddamned old man that grayheaded fella come in earlier the father of that gal you seen that fella something bout him i didnt like no cant say i didnt like him wasnt no issue of liking was more like hes too calm for what he says he was i shot a coupla clay birds for him and he said ow its so loud he said aw i dont like guns he said that but hes in my vision when im shooting and he didnt jump none when the gun went off as if hed been around the report of a firearm a time or two and he told me this odd story about how hed got cut up in japan his hip laid open but there was no point in suing the fellow what cut him and he told that story which made no sense without a further explanation almost for his own private pleasure hes takin pride in it hes taking pleasure in some memory of some event of triumph he some kind of undercover man sir is that what youre saying a grumley wondered i dont know whose agent he is if he really is that gals daddy or hes playing a game or what but i have done this work many a year and have developed a nose for certain things and i got a peculiar aura off himits what now i see is mankillers aura there are some born to kill with a gun they have the steel for snuffing out life with a piece of flying lead dont feel nothing about it there was a breed of lawmen like that once mankilling cops old timers who werent afraid of going to the gun i didnt think theres men around like that no more thought the last of them died years ago when they stopped calling killing a mans job and made it like a sickness so a man who wins a fair gunfight should feel ashamed and go into a hospital thatll drive your mankiller into retirement or the graveyard fastern anything thats the only enemy he cant never beat except maybe a grumley boy but this old mans one you should know his kind has been the kind to hunt our kind since ancient days never thought id see his like again thought that breed was vanished from the earth but i think hes back and hunting us so whatll we do reverend well only one thing to do now we hunt him grumley business come first without grumley theres nothing but chaos family matters most so we must hunt and kill this bastard and i want yall out on the streets so as to mark him down and then well finish him but good maybe we get done in time for the job maybe we dont but grumley come first nineteen bob realized as he left lesters grocery and the clerk that without his keepers he now had a free shot to knoxville could check on his daughter talk to his wife and pick up some firepower he turned right out of the parking lot drove up ignoring whatever mysteries lurked behind the locked gates of the baptist prayer camp hit and soon crossed from johnson to carter county on the way west to which would take him south immediately it was apparent that carter was a richer county by far it had a manmade lake marinas bobbing with pleasure boats visible even in the dark bars restaurants vacation homes nightlife at one point a couple of carter county sheriffs cars roared by him sirens blazing lights pumping and now and then a tennessee highway patrol vehicle sped by all of them clearly headed to the site of the shooting where that boy had to hold his line for at least a few more days maybe when this straightened out bob would speak up explain himself to detective thelma fielding take the kid off the spot and face what consequences there might be but it seemed to him that there should be none besides his leaving the scene ofwell of what a crime not hardly fair straight shooting in defense against armed men who had masks on who were moving aggressively toward him pure selfdefense if the law was applied right other things on the todo list make sure to check the press accounts and see who these boys were the second fellow had moved well and intelligently brought fire clearly a veteran of previous firefights of one sort or another a professional to be sure hed have tracks associations a record all that which could tell an interested party a thing or two and then theres the issue of eddie ferrol iron mountain armory owner talk to him and someone tries to kill you who is he why is he in this he doesnt seem smart enough tough enough ruthless enough to be a big part in anything criminal yet for some reason he has an amazing influence on events why is that what does his knowledge of the bible particularly mark have to do with anything why does even abstract useless knowledge of this passage equate to an instant murder attempt eddie looked like the sort whod spill his beans easily enough but almost certainly hed go to ground and make himself hard to find he certainly wasnt going back to the gun store that was for sure and what was his own next move after his time in knoxville should he come back to mountain city and continue to ask questions in hope of coming across a mark explanation would he be targeted again would people pick up on him report on his presence help a new squad of hunters locate him should he go on to bristol return to nikkis apartment spend some time there at least through the weekends big race activities then hire a private eye stop improvising do this thing like a grownup with a mind toward clearing it up and making sure it was safe for his daughter to resume her life he got into knoxville at midnight realized it was probably too late to call his wife in her motelthe call would awaken miko and wouldnt be appreciated so he found an econo lodge off the big highway and paid in cash he hadnt realized how tired he was and that hed been going hard without sleep or food the food could wait he went to bed in the small cheapbutclean room after a shower and fell into a sleep full of portents of children in jeopardy and himself in various gaudy symbolic shapes unable to do anything about it you wouldnt associate the word coma with nikki she looked rosy and merely asleep everybody was full of hope the doctors reported that her vital signs were strong and that she stirred showed normal brain activity and responded to her mothers and sisters voices they all thought it would be a matter of days maybe even hours before she awoke she is such an angel bob said holding miko close daddy maybe shell wake up today i hope she does sweetie i hope and pray she does you and mommy youll stay here and watch over her yes and the pinks will guard her so nobody can harm nikki yes honey theyre very good men he put miko down now mommy and i have to talk honey you stay here for a minute okay yes daddy he and his wife walked wordlessly down the hall to a visitors lounge where they bought bad coffee in styrofoam from a vending machine and sat at a blank table in a blank room the first thing he said was i have satisfied myself that this thing did not come upon nikki out of something i did some years ago when i was off doing this or that it seems that she cut trail on some kind of plani dont know what it is but somewhere in johnson county theres a group of very bad fellows who are planning something equally bad and nikki picked up on some aspect of it and they had to finish her as she was going about her business trying to do an overall story about methamphetamine use in the county shes innocent she was just a young woman full of life who ran afoul of bad customers she may not have even known what it is but it has to be something she was close to figuring out and thats why its so dangerous now i know what the clue is and now people are coming for me he told her his story each discovery at a time each event at a time including mark when he told her hed killed two men the night before her gaze showed nothing she had changed it was her daughter her rage and instinct had been aroused and now she understood that she could not allow anyoneanyoneto harm her daughter you cant go to the police she finally asked wouldnt that be the wisest thing well im not sure how they figure into it i think this detective thelma fielding is okay but the sheriff is a pompous son of a bitch with his eye on something else loves publicity wont stop talking about his time in the war but the real problem with them is they got it all figured out to be a bad kid on a binge looking for somebody to squash thats all they see thats what they want to see thats the file its in they think itll just be a day or so till somebody snitches him out and meanwhile they got other fish to fry so if i go to them i have some kind of institutional inertia working against me to begin with then i have to explain why i ran out after the shooting what my suspicions are and their minds arent equipped to deal with any of that yet its too much information too fast and it challenges the way they do business its like the marine corps used to be on snipers they just dont want to know about it took a war to change their minds what about the fbi can you call nick memphis hed drop anything to help you at least he can put bureau resources behind you and your learning curve will be much quicker hmmm said bob you sure you havent done this before thats a great idea no that didnt occur to me because i been so goddamn caught up in my own drama and not thinking straight yeah i will call him first thing and see what he can get me can you handle this youre older bob maybe not so fast maybe your mind is a little slower than it once was as well as your hands and maybe this time youll run out of luck you know that youll end up face down shot by some kid with a who has no idea hes just murdered achilles i may run out of luck sure and i aint too happy to be a hunted man once again and to have to go to guns once again but its come and i told you i will do with it what i must i need you behind me but it seems since japan youve had doubts even fears i know you thought i was asleep but manys the night you woke with a start all asweat in this kind of game you cant have doubts youve said that many times if i was working for a government or a sheriffs office i might have doubts and they might get me killed on the job but i am working for my daughter so those doubts dont count they went away i have no doubts and last night it was the same old bob lee back gun in hand shooting for blood making the right moves i do need one thing i need you behind me i am behind you she reached into her purse and pulled out a set of car keys with a hertz emblem on the ring its a blue prism tennessee lcd i parked on the fourth floor where theres fewer cars but not on the roof where somebody in an office could see you you pull up to it trunk to trunk there are some goods inside i went to meachums and asked mr meachum what kind of rifle he recommended for selfdefense in a ranch house he was very helpful didnt have any trouble on the flight locked case declared firearm the gal at the counter didnt even want to look inside the handgun was yours under the mattress i bought ammunition for it and the rifle and spare magazines its all in the trunk i spent last night loading magazines the rifle is supposed to hold thirty but i could only get twentyeight in twentyeight is fine said bob its better less pressure on the spring more reliable that way the handgun magazines loaded fine ten in each ten of them thank you he said now im going to go i think i have to get back to mountain city i cant let them think theyve run me they have to know theyre in for a fight and if theyre scared maybe theyll make a mistake she said you find the men who tried to kill our daughter you take care of them he kissed her took the elevator down went to the garage and moved his car up to hers satisfying himself there were no other people on the floor he opened her trunk the rifle was in a doskocil plastic travel case he unlatched it to see what meachum had come up with his first thought was shit because it was an m well an ar as the civilian variant was called as a man of the caliber hed always despised the pipsqueak of the classic ar platform with its tendency to bore tiny holes in people keep going and kill the talented orphankid pianoprodigy while the bad guy didnt blink an eyelash and kept shooting and he noticed it had all sorts of gizmos bolted onan eotech holographic sight that looked like a tv set a forward vertical grip with a surefire flashlight built into it at six oclock just under the muzzle and the muzzlewell it looked a little wider he bent close tried to make out the barrel marking in the dim light and saw that it read dpms mm remington spc as he transferred the gun and case to his trunk he saw a few extra boxes of ammo black hills cracked one and discovered a short round that had a big bullet lets see that meant about caliber and then he remembered hearing that in the sand the special operations people were so pissed at the poor oneshot takedown ratio they were getting from the some of them worked with some people at remington to come up with a bigger more powerful cartridge it functioned in a system using an ar lower and only required a new upper thus saving the government millions of dollars if the government adopted the cartridge it only had to buy the top half of five hundred thousand new weapons maybe that would happen maybe it wouldnt but the cartridge had been combattested and was said to put em down and keep em down that pleased him she had done well the handgun was a super his own model kimber a very nice gun that as he got older he appreciated more for its lack of recoil and muzzle flip in fast strings while completely identical to the in handling and operating procedures the extra boxes indicated the load meachum had chosen was the corbon grain jacketed hollow point p ammo his kydex holster lay beside the case amid the ammo boxes locked and loaded he thought loaded for bear or whatever his cellphone rang he looked at the caller id and saw that it was detective thelma fieldings number he thought a bit what do i do maybe that kid broke she wants me to come in so she dont have to put out an arrest warrant maybe i ought to call a lawyer meantime i have an arsenal in the trunk and no place to stash it damn i wish that boy had lasted longer thought he had the stuff for it he could just not answer of course but what would that tell her hello mr swagger yes howdy detective whats up trying to be nonchalant just in case sir weve had a break in the case a break yes sir soons i get free and clear of an unrelated shooting took place last night im going to make an arrest fellow named cubby bartlett a longtime meth dealer hes the man who tried to kill your daughter got him cold someone snitched him out and im going to pull him in swagger didnt know quite what to feelrelief that the boy had held steady and hadnt given up his name or laughter that poor thelma seemed way up the wrong tree and barking hard or maybe in some way this cubby bartlett fit into it sir you said you wanted to be there for the arrest now if you give me your word you wont cause no trouble i will let you sit stakeout with us tonight and watch as we bring him in ill be there he said and she gave him the details twenty youre an idiot said brother richard brother richard if we dont do this here job and it looks like we wont then your ass aint worth a cowpie in january so is you id get myself long gone cause when grumley business be finished my boys may remember how mean and disrespectful to them yous been and when that happens and specially since they have the taste of blood on their tongues maybe they get a hunger for you youre an idiot repeated brother richard grumley come first said the reverend they sat in his office off the gym floor of the rec center the boys had already locked and loaded and headed out just to keep a watch and see if and when that fellow came back into town after which point all grumleys would coordinate and vengeance would be taken as it mightily should be amen dont you think youre overstating the drama of the two men you lost those boys were professional strongarm men they were begotten of and by violence thats the life they chose they lived high on it scoring kills and drugs my boys dont take no drugs yeah you dont work with them on a daily basis like i have the last few weeks i know grumleys a lot bettern you old man anyhow those two carmody and blow job damn you to righteous flame you bas carmody and blow job had the kills and the swag and the dope and the whores and probably even a good girl or two along the way because there do seem to be some good girls who find outlaws amusing they lived a life of the superego unrestrained like few men the great thrill of the criminal lifestyle and its secret true reward they ran hard and lived hard it was always in the cards that at any second of any day they could run into some country cop who knew how to shoot or take a corner too fast and smear themselves on the concrete thats the cost of doing business in the business of violence and it turned out that their number came up its an anomaly its unfortunate from your twistedsister viewpoint it might even be a tragedy but it is what it is and theres no money in it for any of us and we have worked too goddamned hard to give it up for some nickelanddime sense of vengeance on someone who after all was only defending himself in a square gunfight and appears to have been faster on the trigger and truer on the aiming part than your boys vern was right verns the smartest grumley sir you do not understand family and i am disappointed in son vern sir i do understand family no man you ever met understands family more than me now ill tell you whats interesting in all this its my sense you have been looking for a way to fail i believe you were coerced into this plan by someone smarter and tougher than yourself because it is too clever for a fellow like you to think up youre no strategist your only product is the rawest of force thats what you sell thats all you know but this thing is too cool for words and you are about to give it up not in spite of your best instincts but because of your best interests you want an excuse to fail to go down in some fucking massacre shootout in a blazing barn a gun in each hand you have death wish written all over you goddamnit you have fancy words brother richard and you speak cleverly but your words aint but spit compared to the grumley family tra whats he got on you bet i know this threat alone of all the things brother richard had said shut the old geezer up and when that happened brother richard knew he was right and bored in for the kill its gotta be a sex thing that lizard of yours that babys got to feed what three four times a day youre omnisexual polysexual metasexual youre unisexual there isnt a word for what you are it seems to run in the godhead biz wasnt david koresh and that jim guy who fed all those people koolaid the same yeah yeah thats it isnt it you have all those kids all those wives all their sisters its all about the reverend alton grumley getting his wand wet three four times a day even at your age i will say you are probably more full of sperm than any man born since genghis khan father of us all not just because you know family conspiracies are the only conspiracies that work and so you need a lot of family but also because you have a weird gene that makes you have to fuck three or four times a day i bet you have a cock the size of a trailer hitch come to think of it it all fits togetheryour golden tones your soothing ways your clank of sanctimony your secret ruthlessness boy you are one huge perpetualmotion fucking machine you even see it in number one son vern i picked up on the way his eyes light on the youngest flattest hottest sluttiest twelveyearold he fixes on one of them hes lost to the cause youd best hope that when the big day arrives old verns got his mind on business not on the shockabsorbersized boner in his pocket we need verns sagacity or rather normal verns sagacity not hetup verns insanity the reverend seemed to be getting a little crazy the yveins on his forehead pulsed his eyes sank to the size and color of ball bearings his breathing grew harsh and shallow and he clenched and unclenched his big hands he looked like he wanted to strangle the life out of brother richard and was but a second from doing it but lets leave poor vern out of this hes only your pattern played out what chance did he have with a pa who was so sexed up sometimes he didnt care what kind of hole he put it in am i right oh thats the pattern i see it now hes got video on you and some chicken right some boy whore some boychild even one of those classic cases of the holy man who cant keep his mitts off of little billy and bobby and tells them god commands them to drop their drawers oh thats it i hadnt seen it till now thats got to be it sir you are the whore of babylon the antichrist hiding behind a smiley demeanor and a charming patter but truly inside the beast arf arf said richard now i see youve been leveraged into this job and theres nothing you can do about it but you cannot accept it either because the fulcrum on which it turns is your own darkest secret the one that would destroy you in front of all grumleys so your attitude is classic passiveaggressive and the longer it goes on the longer it annoys the bejesus out of you so now you have it an excuse to quit an excuse to fail an excuse to die the reverend looked skyward lord help the sinnerman all on that day he has nowhere to run to the moon wont hide him because its bleeding the sea wont hide him because its boiling with his education he comes up with terrible ideas and he contaminates those who believe lord god smite him and take him with you and give him a shaking and a talking to so that he knows why it is youre sending him to an eternity of burning flesh in the dark and sulphurous caverns of hell who writes your stuff stephen king or anne rice anyhow let me tell you call in the boys settle em down we need em calm and collected for race day we can do this thing i tell you and i can have my little run through big racings peapatch and we can all go home rich and nobody nobody will ever forget the night of thunder okay concentrate thats how you beat your tormentor you pull the job you get the money you get your filmatelevenministerfingerfuckschoirboy back living well is the best revenge oh and a few years down the line you go back and kill the shit out of whoever was blackmailing you the reverend looked at him sullenly richard continued apostate speak with wisdom no old goat infidel know thing or two eh colonel sanders think on it think on it for gods sake now im going to leave i have to get into bristol and get a look at my little peapatch so i can prepare my own kind of fire and brimstone for whats coming up next im not even going to demand that you change your plan and call those boys in because i know you will thou art sin said the reverend thou wilt burn just so i dont roll said brother richard twentyone on the way back to mountain city bob tried to call nick memphis special agent fbi he had nicks own private cell number and he punched in the numbers as he drove north on from knoxville in the setting afternoon sun but there was no answer only nicks voice mail this is memphis leave a detailed message and i will get back to you nick swagger i have to run something by you and sooner would be so much better than later call me on this number please bud but nick never called him back he was disappointed he loved nick years ago so long ago hed repressed it and most of the memories had vanished nick had believed in him he was on the run set up by some professionals briefly number one on the fbi hit parade every cop in america was gunning for him then along came nick whod looked at the evidence and saw that the narrative everybody was dancing to simply couldnt have happened by the laws of physics too many anomalies too many strangenesses nick looked hard into it then hard into bobs killer eyes and believed bob knew he was reborn that moment that was the moment he came back that was his redemption that gave him the strength to play it out to go hard again to find the lost bob the nailer and put the drunken selfpitying loserloner behind him nicks faith became julies faith became nikkis faith became mikos faith all in a line and let him be what he was meant to be what hed been born to be and it let him almost after all of it get close to the one god he worshiped his great martyred father but nick wasnt there where the hell was nick so he called the number he had for matt macready again he just got the machine this is matt leave a message matt swagger here boy hate to bother you so soon before a race one question recently i saw the tracks of some kind of machine steel wheels maybe eight or ten inches apart cut deep in the dirt hmmm i recall all kinds of tracks in the pits when i visited you any idea what those kinds of tracks could be sure could help me thanks and good luck on race day he did catch up on the news from a knoxville twentyfourhour radio station according to the reporter the two dead men in the johnson county grocery store shootings had been identified as carmody grumley and bj grumley both of no fixed address both known to have organized crime connections and thought to be part of a mobile shifting culture of strongarmed men used in various mob enterprises over the years each man had a substantial rap sheet young terry hepplewhite the grocery clerk who shot it out with the robbers was being hailed as a hero though he had yet to meet with the press and tell his side of the story grumley he thought the grumley boys what is this grumley another question for nick who could dig up a file on grumley instead of going to his motel where he thought these grumleys might have had lookouts waiting bob went to the first church he saw which was john the revelator baptist church of redemption just a onestory building with a steeple that hardly went up twentyfive feet it wasnt a mighty structure but had a rough quality as if it had been slowly assembled brick by brick in the humblest of ways when he entered the hushed devotional space he first thought hed gone astray for two worshipers were black and it occurred to him that their memory of large white men in jeans and boots might not be all that warm but shortly a young black man in a suit and tie came out of a walkway and came over to him may i help you sir do you come to worship you are welcome thank you sir bob said but actually i have a biblical puzzle to solve and i thought someone here might pitch in i can try please come this way the doors led bob to a spare office with many bibles and other books of religious persuasion occupying the shelves on one wall have a seat my name is lionel weston i am the pastor of john the revelator my name is bob lee swagger and im greatly appreciative sir this has to do with a passage that has come to my attention my daughter was interested in it before an accident she had and im wondering what it could mean ill try mark ah said the reverend weston yes of course arise from your bed and go to your home or sometimes arise from your pallet and go to your house christ has just performed a miracle he had restored mobility to a paralyzed man doubters have assailed him even as worshipers have brought the sick and malformed to him not from ego not from pride but from compassion he has restored this mans limbs to strength its one of the great miracles of the text in fact one might say those words express the pure joy of gods power his ability to restore the infirm through faith does that help mr swagger bobs puzzled expression evidently communicated a truth to the minister possibly it has metaphorical meaning to your daughter shes saying i can walk her sickness has been cured shes had a revelation of sorts was she in spiritual or physical pain sir i dont think so in fact this muddies up the waters considerably could it be a code a code word a signal mr swagger i dont think god talks in code words his meanings are clear enough for us you are right sir and i am very grateful for your wisdom i have to think on this and see how it fits in how is your daughter shes recovering i would ask her but shes still unconscious i will pray for her i greatly appreciate it sir i will pray for you mr swagger i hope you solve your riddle and straighten things out i see you as a man who is good at straightening things out i try sir lord how i try leaving the church he checked his watch and saw it was time to head to the sheriffs office he contemplated whether he should slip the kydex holster with the super on and in the end concluded it would be a bad idea a careless move an accident detective thelma would see that he was armed which could lead to embarrassing questions even charges he got there at eight pulling into the lot agh that perpetual shroud of coal dust that hung over this neck of the woods hit him in a second hed have a headache no wonder they were getting the hell out of here bob walked into the station and a clerk nodded him back to the bullpen area where thelma stood by in her polo and chinos while three swat officers with mp submachineguns and ar shorties were gearing up for the nights event mr swagger detective fielding this is our fugitive apprehension team the guys beefy cop types two white one black in their twenties with short hair thick necks and the look of middle linebackers nodded at him without making any sincere emotional commitment wow you must be expecting some kind of gunfight you look like youre going on a commando raid you just want to take precautions i doubt cubby has a fix on going down hard hes a gentle soul as long as he isnt lit up on ice i hope youre right all right sir you drive with me and the fat guys will follow in their van let me brief you i will park down the way and you will stay in the car well wait for the van to park and the boys will take up entry positions in the rear then ill signal air and my brother tom whos the sheriffs helicopter pilot your brothers the pilot tom was shot down as an army aviator three times in two wars the last one in baghdad was bad he had some problems and had to leave the army maybe i started this whole drugwar thing because i put through the justice department grant paperwork to get us the bird so my brother would have someplace to go i see impressive you helped him i tried but you know the law of unintended consequences now i worry thatoh never mind lets get back to it tom will bring the ship in and his copilot will work the highintensity beam in case cubby tries to run ill go in and knock and tell cubby hes coming with me it should go fine but if he bolts hell just run into these fellows and if he goes violent on us then well have to run him down but im not betting on trouble okay you just stay in the car when we bring him in and book him ill let you listen from the next room to the interrogation cubbys no master criminal believe me hell give it up fast and ive set it up with the prosecutors office to have him indicted in the morning paperworks all done then its just a matter of making sure tennessee justice dont drop the ball and i will watch that one very closely i thank you for taking me along i appreciate it they sat on a treelined street in what could never be called the nicer side of town a rundown section east of downtown where the old housesshacks more like it maybe at best bungalowsleaned this way and that and you had the sense that a lot of police action had taken place there before ive been busting cubby for ten years off and on thelma said hell go clean for a while maybe as long as six months but hes always gone back sad to see such a handsome man give his life away for nothing hell gin up a lab hell deal a little hell snitch out somebody to buy more time just scuffling along waiting for a way to amp the scratch to buy another bag of the stuff man its the devils business what it does to folks you have any addiction problems in your family sir detective i am not proud to say that i had some troubles with the bottle years back and to this day i miss my bourbon but one sip and im gone it cost me and i finally beat it down though now and again under trying circumstances i will break down and have a drink i usually end up in the next county engaged to a tattooed chinese woman she didnt acknowledge his joke but my daughters never had a thing to do with it and only now and then drinks a glass of wine weve been so lucky yes you have the wrecked families ive seen let me ask you youre sure on this boy sure as sure is he has a brother who has a car that matches the vehicle idd on the state forensics reports the cobalt charger i checked this morningit was a busy morningand in fact cubby had the car and in fact its banged up where he hit your daughter i looked at the car and i think we can make the presence of your daughters paint in the gash along the side of the charger bob was thinking what the hell is she talking about who is this cubby is he working for eddie ferrol or some mysterious mister big the godfather of johnson county hows it all connected what does this detective know of his connections youll check on his associations once you get him locked up be interesting to see if he was working for somebody last person he worked for was mr mcdonald of the hamburger chain who fired his worthless ass in three weeks he was never able to master the deepfat fryer maybe he has other connections criminal connections doubtful mr swagger but if so well find out tonight when i run the interrogation yes maam now on another thing this sheriffs making a big splash with his chopper but i hear the price of the stuff hasnt gone up which youd expect if all the labs were being closed down whats the feeling nobody knows maybe theres a superlab somewhere but youd think youd smell it because manufacturing crystal meth in quantity produces a terrible rotten egg smell or maybe its being trucked in from somewhere dont know if you know it but theres a shooting last night some grocery clerk got lucky and killed two robbers the robbers were interesting real serious bad actors your whitetrash professional heavy hitter with rumored contacts to a batch of mobs all over the south and participation suspected in a dozen armed robberies them boys ran out of luck in the worst possible way last night anyhow way my mind works im thinking maybe they muled a load of ice from somewhere deeper south and thats where the stuff is coming from i dont know what else would explain their presence here it would go to someone who knew the area had ambitions and a lot of criminal skills dont know who that would be you see any criminal geniuses hiding at arbys on the way over no maam but theres a shady dude at the pizza hut this got a laugh out of her but her mind was elsewhere really as she scanned the shabby front of the house down the street adamonenine you there came a squawky call on the radio she spoke into her throat mic adamonenine copy adamonenine we in place you can go any time airone stat you there tom i read you adam onenine tom you bring it on in and when you see me at the front door you have mike open up with the big lamp on the back of the house you got that i read you adam onenine she turned to swagger please dont make me look bad sheriff doesnt know about this but i figure the dad gets to watch as the fellow who tried to kill his daughter goes down he could tell she was uneasy and the breath came hard and shallow she ran a dry tongue over dry cracked lips and for one second did something amazingly feminine that totally contradicted the image of a tough cop about to make a bust she grabbed a role of lip balm from the dash and smoothed it dainty as an expensive french lipstick across her lips yes maam said bob as she got out of the car and walked slowly to the front door he wondered why they didnt do it bigger ten cars lights flashing loudspeakers but maybe that would spook an icehead like this cubby legendary maker of bad decisions and the next thing thered be another big gunfight give thelma the benefit of the doubt shes done this you havent you dont know so much and as it is you are riding the raw edge of a term in jail on any one of a dozen charges so he sat back and watched the police theater thelma arrived at the doorwell hesitated her hand flew to her pistol made certain it was where it should be and that the retaining device still held it ready and secure until the moment she drew if she drew she knocked she knocked again no answer she slithered next to the door jamb and edged the door open she had a surefire in her nonshooting hand and she used it to penetrate the darkness he heard her yell cubby cubby its detective fielding you in there you come on out now weve got business there was no answer dont go in bob thought oneonone in the dark of a house against a violent offender whose head is all messed up on account of the skank he eats and makes every day whos paranoid maybe crazy oh lady dont go in it isnt necessary drop back watch the exits call for backup let the boys in the tommy tactical outfits earn their dough but thelma slipped in the moments passed and before he knew it bob had gotten out of the car and crouched in the lee of its wheel well watching waiting for shots or something oh christ through the windows he could see the beam of her flashlight dancing against the walls and ceiling of the dark interior of the small place which couldnt have more than a few rooms come on he thought he wanted to see her come out with the suspect cuffed and the boys with the guns come racing around the house to take him away nice job great job good work good old thelma but from under the line of the houseit must have been a cellar window cut against a gap in the foundationhe saw someone squirm free low crawl across the yard into the bushes lining the house next door suddenly a flashbang erupted in cubbys house the loud smack of percussion breaking the still of the night and the helicopter dropped low and its light came on hard and bright the sounds of windows breaking doors being busted in told the story the fat guys were assaulting from the rear maybe thelma had him or hed clonked her and shed just awakened and given the green light to the fat team but the shadowy figure that had slipped out and squirmed across the yard suddenly broke from his hiding place and began to run crazily down the sidewalk trying to put as much distance between himself and his pursuers as he could he raced right toward bob who had a sudden almost comic memory flash over him it was so football the running back broken free of the line of scrimmage scurrying down the sideline the lone safety the only man between him and the end zone he knew it was a bad idea a sixtythreeyearold man with a bum leg and everything but it didnt matter what he knew it only mattered what he did which was to launch himself run through his sudden hip pain find the right angle and close the distance at the last second cubby saw him and from somewhere produced a handgun but bob was too far gone and just plunged ahead driving his shoulder hard into the mans ample gut trying to drive clean through him and bring him flat to the ground hearing some ancient coach from somewhere back in the jurassic scream drive through him bobby take his legs out give him your whole damn shoulder explode through him and thats what he did textbook perfect both men went down in a bonebruising crack lights flashing through each head knees abrading bloodily on the pavement as they tumbled limbs flying breaths knocked free he didnt feel the knee to the head it couldnt have been planned it was just one of those football things when two flying bodies collide and torsos hit with the smack of wet meat falling off the table legs and arms go screwball and it so happened that cubbys knee flew up in a spasm as his breath was belted out of his lungs and the knee hit bob flush upside the head a little forward of the ear it was having your bell rung and bobs rang so loud it knocked pinwheels of light illumination rounds spasms of tracers sparks from a bonfire fly legs and spider heads through his brain he went to the ground all tangled with cubby but his limbs and his brain were momentarily dead in a second he came back to consciousness first to sound the sound of running steps the sound of a powerful helicopter engine then came light as the copter nailed bob and his prey in the bright circle of thirtyfive hundred lumens and they were like as on a stage shadowless and drained of all color except the lamps eerie cold pure moonlight he blinked felt the pain tried to breathe and realized cubby had linked himself to him with an arm around his throat tight squeezing off the breath until bob coughed and shook and the grip loosened a little goddamn you mister you keep still or i will put a goddamned bullet through your head cubby yelled so forcefully that the message was conveyed just as eloquently by the jetstream of saliva that hit bob bob saw something in his peripheral vision and felt it go hard against his head he recognized by its circularity that it was the muzzle of a revolver oh fuck he thought now you have gone and done it goddamn you thelmayou saidyou saidgoddamn you thelma cubby you hold on now dont you do nothing stupid that fella aint a cop you got no grudge against him you let him go and put the gun down and well get all this straightened out he could see her about twentyfive feet away just out of the cone of illumination behind her the three fat officers had gone into good strong kneeling positions their weapons jacked dead on the target which he hoped was cubby and not himself aim small miss small boys go to semiauto think trigger control and breath control he thought gasping for air cubby dont do anything stupid thelma said in a smooth calm voice walking into the light looking calm more like a mom than anything you just let that fella go put the gun down and well work our way through this thelma no you said you saidno i aint going back to all that it aint right goddamn oh why this happening why why why i had her licked this time oh god theys in my head i hears em yelling oh christ no thelma bob was thinking wheres the fucking sniper when you need him did he have a little league game to coach or something a good man on a and a solid position could send grains of federals best match load through cubbys eye and into his ancient snake brain and end this thing in the time it took the bullet to fly at twentythree hundred feet per second to its target but there was no sniper just the woman cop and the three young tommy tacticals looking shaken as they crouched trying to keep good muzzle discipline thelma took another step she had guts and how this screwball could pop one into bob and whirl and fire and take her down before she cleared leather of course the three tacticals would each heroically dump a magazine into him but both he and thelma would be beyond caring why had he done such a stupid thing where could cubby have gone anyway cranked as he was on the ice that ate holes into his brain but his grip on bob and the force of his wrist against bobs throat was iron and bob struggled again for air while smelling his rank body odor and feeling the fear and craziness vibrate through cubbys flesh dont you move goddamn you said cubby pressing the gun muzzle so hard against the thin skin at the crown of bobs head that he cut it a trickle of blood oozed out and bob felt the warmth of the liquid and then the sting of the wound cubby you just calm down nobody has to get hurt now im telling you but you goin send me back dont know why i did it thelma dont remember none i dont know i been so high for so long dont think i hit no car but goddamn i got voices saying you hurt a girl you hurt a girl wouldnt hurt no girl thelma like them girls sometimes they nice to me god they in my headit hurts i cant go backi cant go back it aint righti didnt do nothing i dont want to hurt nobody god thelma it just aint righti cant do this no moreits just no good no more oh thelma you said youd help mei am so sorry i cant bob heard the oily slide of the hammer against the constriction of the frame as cubby drew it back then the slight vibration as it locked the gun was now cocked his finger on the trigger just a singleaction jerk away from firing thelma i will kill this boyyou go wayyall go wayput down your guns let me go dont want to hurt nobody please please it dont have to be this way but goddamn i will squeeze on this here boyyou just lay down your guns and thelma drew and fired with a speed that was almost surreal bob had never seen a hand move so fast so sure so smooth so clean it was like a trick of physics a speed beyond the influence of time that seemed to come from nowhere elegant controlled blazing it was professional shooting at its finest he saw the flash saw the slight buck of the automatic as its slide jacked in supertime saw the spent shell flip away caught in the light and even felt the simultaneous vibration as whatever shed sent off hit its target the sound of bullet on flesh is always the same dense and wet and full of the sense of meat splattering and bone shattering yet compressed into a nanosecond he actually felt cubby die instantly the vivid vital flesh in supertime again alchemizing to dead directionless weight pulled on by impatient gravity as cubby fell his draped arm brought bob down with him harshly and they landed in a heap and the handgun still cocked bounced away bob wriggled free and saw that thelmad hit him left of the nose maybe an inch and that the bullet had drilled a perfect round black hole which in another second began to release a surprisingly thin gurgle of black fluid then his nose began to bleed not copiously just a trickle of black as blood under pressure sought escape the mans eyes were open and so was his mouth behind him a ponytail fanned out on the sidewalk in the harsh light and a puddle of exitwound blood black in the illumination began to delta outward through the hair that must have been a hell of an exit he wore a cutoff ole miss tshirt a pair of tight jeans and was barefoot his feet were dirty with long animallike toenails crusted with grime bob stood up mr swagger are you all right sir i am fine detective that was some shooting he said i am so sad i had to drop him only had to do it once before and it shook me up for a year i am glad you were over your shakes tonight detective the other three officers had gathered around and thelma put her pistol away and knelt next to the fallen man she pried the gun from his fingersa smith kframe probably indecocked it and expertly popped the latch open letting the cylinder rotate out they both looked into it empty she said well i couldnt wait i had to put him down you made the right decision maam thelma one of fat kids said you didnt have no choice you did the right thing thats right thelma said another dont you worry about it nobody could fault you you sure youre okay mr swagger maybe when the medical people get here you might want to have them look at you im fine im fine maybe itll hit me later but right now it just seems unreal detective whered you learn to shoot like that i never thelmas threetimes running ladies uspsa champ of the southeast region tennessee north carolina and kentucky she could go pro shes that good mr swagger paraord sponsors her youre lucky shes here shes probably the best shot of any law enforcement agent in this part of the country maybe the whole damn country a cruiser its lights running hard pulled up and then another and another so on until general delirium took over the scene twentytwo the thing was you couldnt smoke he might see a lit cigarette glowing in the otherwisedarkened interior of verns red cadillac el dorado then bolt agh so both vern and ernie in cranky moods sat grumpily scrunched down in the car in a dimly illuminated zone of the parking lot of the mountain empire motel neither had had a cigarette in hours it was a little after midnight i might sneak out and run around back for a smoke said ernie you will not cousin no sir and take a risk he pulls in just as youre in his lights thats how itll happen you know it is thats how it always happens when you give in to your hungers on a job you be a good bad guy now and do what daddy has said we may get a kill out of this tonight and then we can smoke our asses off vern pye i dont mind saying i didnt enjoy your tone with me just there didnt say id do it now did i no sir said i might just talking youre so high and mighty i see your eyes go all buggy anytime a piece of hot under the age of fifteen with no tits goes on by please watch that tone vern well excuse me sir im just trying to get the job done right and proper so i can go back to my regular line of business and what kind of gal i take a fondness toward aint nobodys business i will say this here stay in scenic mountain city has been as hard on me as it has on you cousin you dont even want to be here that is why you are in such a punky mood no i dont this is not the right move but if the old man says do it i have to do it and so do you even though you agree with me and not him all i know is he says go i go thats how it is even now in this car alone you are afraid to defy him maybe i just respect the rules is all and if you dont no cause to turning all crabby on me but then a car pulled into the lot both squirmed down a little both noted that it was indeed a small ford or toyota the sort the rental companies generally provided it prowled looking for spaces and found one close to room which they knew to be the hits could be said vern pray to god said ernie or maybe its a teenage gal in shortshorts and a halter with the new issue of tiger beat asshole the fellow got out slid around to the trunk opened it took something out and held it tight under his arm looked about for signs of something not in place and then moved gently toward the room but it was the limp that gave him away for real it was like he had pain in that right hip from more than a single wound he was also moving stiffly as if bandaged in a dozen or so places he paused took a look around the lot again satisfied himself that it was all clear then bent to open the door slipped in and locked the door behind him hot doggies said vern i can taste that marlboro right now hes the pilgrim all right cant believe a old grayhair like that dusted carmody and bj but nows the night he learn it dont pay to poke at grumley thats holy baptist writ right there cousin vern slipped his glock from the shoulder rig and edged back the slide to make certain a shell lay nested in the chamber while ernie a wheel gunner with an engraved el paso holster on his belt did the same with his inchbarreled nickelplated python full of corbons vern had figured it out i say we wait a bit let him get settled in brush his teeth check the lot through the window make his calls maybe have a sip or ten on that bottle of bourbon he done brung into the room get all settled and snuggly then we kick the door and empty our guns into the guy on the bed who wont know what hit him and then we head out fast you okay with that cousin vern asked sounds like a

swagger awarded himself a good nights sleep as hed been running without it for two or three days hed gotten back from giving a deposition at the sheriffs office around midnight he jammed a chair under the doorknob to hang up any unexpected intruders stuffed his pillow under the blankets to represent a fellow sleeping on a bed and took his rest in the bathtub boots on with the kimber super as a pillow he had good deep sleep slightly broken by dreams where his father told him how disappointed he was in the man bob had become but this theme presented itself so often it didnt bother him it went with the privilege and the luck of being earl swaggers son he awoke at ten took a shower rebandaged the cut on his knee checked on the swelling around his eyes to see that it had gone down a little took three ibus then changed into new jeans and a new polo shirt next rather than breakfast came coffee brewed in the rooms coffee maker then he got down to it his first call was to his wife well howdy she said and he sensed from the joy in her voice something good had happened is she awake julie she was for almost a whole minute she sat up in bed looked at me and said hi mom then she smiled at miko and said hi little sister then she lay back down and went back to wherever oh great oh thats the best news what do the doctors say its how they come back its never hi whats for breakfast lets go to the movies its a slow swim out of the dark place she may have short periods of wakefulness for a few days going before she comes out of it completely so theyre very very optimistic sometimes the victims dont remember a thing but she knew who i was and who miko was oh its such good news can you come soon itd be so good if you were here when she really came out of it well damn ill try there are some things some issues i have to deal with there was more shooting last night out there i didnt fire a shot in fact my gun was still in the trunk i come through it all right except for a cut knee and a swollen forehead theyre even calling me a hero and some tv station wanted an interview i told em to call my pr rep anyway ill call back in a bit it still aintisnt a good idea for you to call me i just dont know where ill be and the sound of the phone might not do me any good okay but please come soon oh i am so excited the news is great honey the next thing he did was call nick memphis again nope no answer where the hell was he it wasnt like nick to disappear maybe he was overseas or something anyhow bob just left the same message then he called terry the grocery clerk to see how he was doing but got no answer he left a message a second later the callback came you all right bob asked holding up sir its been great i been on the tv a bunch of times i got calls from some producers in hollywood i been in all the papers is that okay am i handling this correct you ride this for all its worth you hear you owe me nor nobody nothing you leverage it for all you can get out of it if you want i wont never call again terry no no sir call me i want to know whats going on and i may need your advice also i feel guilty being called a hero which is the true mark of a hero all heroes feel that way ive known a few but dont kid yourself you stood and fought against two armed men you took one of em down put him on the floor and really won the fight while all i did was squeeze a trigger a few times you are a hero son even if you dont believe it the rest is meaningless details yes sir now i cant tell you anything about the entertainment field its full of sharpies and youd best keep your hand on your wallet is all i know but you do call me if you have any trouble you see anyone dogging you and be careful these fellas was working for other fellas you hear me i do the next call was to charlie wingate the boy genius in the computer store any more for me charlie mr swagger this hard drive is totally fried near as i can tell i only got that little bit im afraid to say wont charge you a thing for that oh yes you will you charge me for a full days work at topscale consultant level and not a penny less you hear yes sir now i want that brain of yours working on something else know anything about the bible not much well i dont either but somethings come up involving a biblical passage mark its where jesus cures a crippled man and says to him get up go home mein fuhrer i can valk said the boy yeah something like that said bob not even close to getting it so what hi want you to do is analyze it from any perspective you can think of is the number significant the twoeleven is the page on the bible significant dont know what it would be what do the commentators say about it what are the different interpretations is there some word translated differently from the original language whatever the hell it was aramaic yeah fine could it be a code what are its other citations or usages in history or whatever are there paintings or something based on it all that stuff youre smart you know what i mean ill try you know the town been here my whole life okay maybe theres some connection between it and this town i dont know what but be creative think outside the box make it fun a puzzle who knows what you might come up with yes sir he disconnected and almost before he could put the phone down it buzzed again he checked the number and realized it was the private number of matt macready the young nascar racer calling him wasnt tomorrow the big race yes matt hello gunny how are you only a week oldern last time i saw you but it feels like a hundred years time do race dont it only thing goes faster than my usmc charger only thing anyhow been thinking and looking and maybe i have something for you go ahead son wheel marks metal close together part of the nascar racing operation well there is something you see it all the time in the pits its everywhere whats the word upbequious hmm dont know that word red says its ubiquitous thats what it is ubiquitous well damn hope i dont forget it ubiquitous everywhere what it is is its the track of our hydraulic jacks for tire changing sir yes sir it aint all the driver part of the art of winning at this game is teamwork on the car i have a good crew reds got em trained up real good they get me gassed watered maybe oiled and retubed in less than fifteen seconds its like choreography the way they work a car in the pits on race day and the key to the tire change of course is the jack its a big heavy dog solid steel and its hydraulic built of cylinders full of lube weighs about fifty pounds runs on steel wheels about an inch wide you have your biggest strongest stud as your jack man he gets it over the wall guides it fast to the wheel well jacks the car off the ground meanwhile your airwrench guy delugs the tire even as the jack is lifting it high enough to clear the wrench guy clears out a guy comes in and grabs the lugs thats his job his only job to keep track of the lugs two other boys the tire men pull the burnedout tire off the axle roll it away and slam on another one which two other boys have rolled to them the wrenchman airblasts the lugs tight and the jackman lowers the car and the whole team of them crash hell for leather to the next tire and repeat the same thing they can get the car rerubbered in fifteen seconds and if you look after a race win lose draw or crash and burn their hands and wrists and especially fingers are all cut to hell but theyre tough boys they dont much care got it and they roll that thing through oil and water and it leaves tracks maybe six to eight inches apart everywhere on the tarmac in the pits everywhere id be willing to bet sir so if you saw a tangle of em youd think someones practicing a wheel change well thats what id think hmmmm swagger tried to press this new information into the pattern hed assembled tire change someone was practicing a speedtire change after the fashion of nascar now why the hell would that be the boys setting this thing up werent racers werent running a pit crew whatd they need a speedtire change for what vehicle came with the wrong tires in place and had to be rerubbered fast what would be the point of the new tires well only way it makes sense is if the first set of tires is burned out now what would burn out a set of tires were they going to steal a racing car those babies were expensive but he didnt then he thought no no its not burned out you change the tires in order to change the performance profile of the vehicle its tiredup one way for one purpose and now you rerubber it and you use it for some other presumably unusual purpose maybe that somehow linked with this fit of exploding trucks around the area maybe they were deviling up the engine as well for that purpose but what truck could it be what new purpose could it have you still there does that help it sure does cant see just how yet but im getting pieces in a row and pretty soon a pattern will be there now let me ask you something this heres a long shot does the biblical passage mark about jesus curing a crippled man mean anything to you would it fit into anything along these lines we really werent people of the book gunny some drivers are but not us so no it doesnt mean anything to me and i dont think it connects to big racing in any way okay well thanks really appreciate your taking the time with all you got do do youre a good fella i can tell my pleasure all you must have to do and you gave me a hand thats marine all the way fact is we dont do much day before well run the car this afternoon for a last minute check i have a signing at my retail trailer in nascar village thatll be a madhouse but will move a lot of souvenir hats and other than that its just relaxing and trying to keep the mind clear well good luck i know youre good enough i just hope the breaks go your way cant control that so never worry about it said the boy bob sat ruminated took notes nothing then he realized he was hungry slipped his super into the kydex holster locked on his belt after checking it for the millionth time to be certain it was cocked and locked and eased out the door nothing seemed to be moving in the blazing august heat a few cars were in the lot but it was mostly dead space a couple of stores down the big road was a dennys so bob headed down to it completely in condition green giving his world a threesixty every few minutes on the hunt for anything unusual looking into shadows looking for irregularities like the exhaust from a parked car or the same hat showing up on different people that sort of thing but it was just a hot day in smalltown america he ate breakfast though it was nearing one and halfway through the meal had an idea of something proactive to do he would read the entire book of mark and maybe that way hed get a feel for verse see something in it that might have given his daughter some insight that would turn eddie ferrol and his associates homicidal so he spent the afternoon in his room reading the bible enjoying it more as a storyit was a great story the way jesus could have run and didnt want to go up on that cross reminding him of too many marines who could have run and didnt and stayed to diethan as anything else when he was done reading the chapter the second time he had nothing think another thing to do was to look up eddie ferrols home then visit it well after dark almost certainly eddie wouldnt be there but who knows what clues he might have left behind then there was the carmody and the bj grumley cousins maybe by now more information on them had emerged but hed have to get that through nick as calling thelma and betraying an unusual interest in that case would not be an intelligent move but nick hadnt called either bob called again and the same thing happenedno answer and there was no call from the kid in the computer store he was tired and felt roombound and restless at the same time after a good start the day was turning out to be worthless hed learned nothing made no progress and he knew the sound the almost liquid sloshing of a heavy airborne engine that could spell only one thing and that was helicopter hed ridden in enough of em and one had saved his life in vietnam by getting him to the field surgical hospital at dak to before his life signs slipped away after a russian sniper had blown a hole in his hip this one was no huey but a larger more powerful craft and it grew louder and louder signifying closeby descent bob went to the window looked out and saw a large ship settle in the empty parking lot its rotors a heavy blur that stirred up whirlpools of dust and debris for a hundred yards it was a blackhawk no less much weathered by the winds of wars here and there across the planet but now wearing the starred emblem of law enforcement and the announcement sheriffs department johnson county tennessee across its nose a handful of grit flew into bobs face and the force of the air beat him back but he saw the chief tommy tactical of them all sheriff reed wells drop heavily from the large cargo hatch and head his way the sheriff wore a black nomex jump suit that was hung with belts containing gas grenades flashbangs knives and radio gear a low slung holster was strapped to his thigh with a trickedup cocked and locked his upper body was encased in a stiffly uncomfortable armored vest with sheriff in white letters across the front both his knees and his elbows were protected by thick plastic and foam pads he had a black baseball cap that bore the star emblem of his department tearshaped shades and carried a shorty m with a round pmag a suppressor and a couple of thousand bucks worth of optical sights flashlights lasers and maybe even a can opener bolted onto various rails that ran around the guns forearm and receiver top lord the man looked war bob stepped back to let the warrior king clamber in all rattley and clanky as if hed just gotten off his horse sometime in the fifteenth century but it wasnt a raid and the sheriff gestured to bob to sit while he himself sat heavily on the bed bob saw immediately that the sheriff couldnt put the m down because it was looped to him by a single strand of sling that ran diagonally around his body but he laid the gun in his lap and took off his hat and glasses outside the noise of the blackhawk lowered as the pilot shifted to an idling pitch mr swagger i am beginning to grow annoyed your daughters case is closed thelma closed it last night we here are very sorry about what happened but i took it for granted that youd move on out of here today yes sir dont mean to overstay my welcome ise just going over some loose ends and was going to type em up and send em off to thelma she did damned well by the way she saved your life as i recall or at least at the time it certainly seemed she did long as i live i will never forget the sound of that hammer being pulled back and the speed of her draw the gal is superfast and shoots straight i was a lucky man and will be forever grateful let me ask you about a few loose ends myself what you went through last night would send most men to the hospital at the least theyd be throwing up in the grass for a week theyd also be changing underpants right away to be crude but truthful and thats just the hostage situation and the trigger pull on the empty chamber on top of that you saw a man killed at close range his brains blown out and the bullet that took his life passed within six inches of your head again a source of major psychological trauma when people see people shot it robs them of sleep for weeks sometimes months sometimes years but from all reports you hardly noticed and were up and perky in seconds bob realized hed misplayed the scene last night some macho twist in his mind made him make certain that thelma and the three fat officers understood he was as much man as they were and his close call was meaningless to a man whod had thousands of close calls duh stupid now they were curious about his fortitude where did it come from what did it mean he should have thrown a weeping jag and pretended to be too distraught to continue but it hadnt occurred to him another foolish old mans mistake it was so fast in the happening and so unreal i still cant believe it happened maybe my rough times are all ahead of me and thats when the sleep goes away i suppose that would be one explanation but another occurred to me youre not a professional a gunman some kind of commando veteran a former swat officer military with a lot of combat something like that thats how you operated i told you i had some military experience years ago we ran your record clean no indictments no felonies id pay that ticket you owe the boise police though and i hope you get the drainage issue on your pima county barn settled you dont want trouble with those environmental groups yes sir i have a lawyer working that one now see i cant help notice that you show up and suddenly this little sleepy village becomes dodge city two nights ago some kid clerk outshoots two hardcore bad guys i mean really outshoots em absolutely the way a trained professional with a knack for gunwork and a commandos sense of aggression might have outshot em youre nowhere connected to that except that i do have an unverified report of a dark sedan probably a rental leaving the grocery store in the immediate aftermath of that shooting we cant crack that kid but i do note you drive a dark green ford rental sedan aint that one interesting sheriff im just a dad trying to figure out and yesterday you take down a fleeing armed man youre sixtythree years old and walk with a pronounced limp yet you have no fear of going oneonone at top speed with an armed drug addict i have twentyfiveyearold twohundredfortypound deputies who wouldnt do that then when he takes you hostage you dont even sweat when he cocks the hammer i didnt hardly have time to react to that sir it happened and thelma fired almost in the same second and when our officer drills him beneath the eye you dont even notice youre hardly curious you dont breathe hard you dont become agitated or nothing its hohum another day in mr swaggers life yawn another headshot another dollar yet your record is curiously curiously clean as if some professionals had taken care of you for whatever reason and theres no paper or reports of any kind on you did you work for cia or something i have known an officer of that agency a very fine lady also some assholes i am friendly with a highly placed fbi agent as well from events years back but theres no paper on me because im just a lucky businessman from outside boise i was in the marines for a time theres no story there this aint some kind of thriller book where everybodys somebody else and everybody knows how to shoot i hope youre telling the truth should i get a lawyer sir am i a person of interest would i be better off with legal representation i suspect youll always be a person of interest mr swagger no you dont need a lawyer what you need is a full tank of gas and a good westward destination yes sir i never argue with a man who has a machine gun but i have paid my nights rental and its now dark so i have no particular interest in driving the far side of iron mountain at this time of night suppose i leave tomorrow bright and early hoping to beat the race day traffic ill finish up the report at my daughters and send it to detective fielding is that acceptable somehow i doubt youre afraid of the dark sir its not the dark its whats in the dark i heard a very capable green beret say the same thing all right mr swagger tomorrow youre gone or we will meet again at booking over and out over and out sheriff twentyfour brother richard looked so much like richard petty youd have thought hed get arrested for impersonating a hero he had that befeathered straw cowboy hat pulled low over his ears the tip and tail of its rakishly cantilevered brim cranked beneath eye level its indian festival of secretly meaningful charms and amulets flopping insouciantly in the breeze his eyes were shielded behind glasses that would have looked equally good on the authentic king richard or jacqueline onassis he had richards scrawny twisty muscular body and he wore a nascar tshirt with a pack of marlboros rolled up in the sleeve he wore tight jeans and comfortable luchese boots the reason he didnt get arrested or beaten up or mobbed by teenage white gals was that where he was every other man looked just the same it was like a carnival of richard petty lookalikes that being but one category others chose the kurt bush paradigm and still others the dale jr huck finn the tony stewart the juan montoya the mike martin the matt macready and there were even hard to believe a few jeff gordons though they had to be from california this was the crowd at nascar village that gridwork of cult and retail sites just outside the mighty bristol speedway which towered above them all while providing a steady deafening roar as the weekends cars whizzed about it a few last times to run the engines at speed for a final checkout it was friday the start of racing weekend under a hot august sky in a shenandoah valley that at this moment was plastered with cars tents recvs suvs everything short of armored personnel carriers the vehicles rode the gentle hills like a gigantic carpet as the hundreds of thousands came to worship live experience glory and fear vicariously drink smoke shove fuck hoot and have a hell of a good time most of them were beyond bliss there was so much happiness in the meandering beast of the crowd you couldnt but crack a smile at the heat of the joy it turned you a little red in fact but none of them were as happy as brother richard as he let the crowd push him this way and that through what really amounted to a nascar casbah the streets werent lined with gold not that is if you were buying though maybe if you were selling for nascar people were spenders they had to take something of the great night of thunder home with them they bought pendants and tshirts and cupholders and beer caddies and hats and thick leather jackets and sweat shirts and polo shirts and pictures and diecast models and bottled water beer and bourbon and corporate propaganda chevy ford toyota and dodge the four sanctioned automobile suppliers had gigantic pavilions and all four had a pedestal inside atop each pedestal was a street shell of the handmade custom machine that would tonight and especially tomorrow night roar four hundred then five hundred times around the stiffly tilted halfmile where dreams could die in seconds sometimes in flames sometimes in the crunch of collapsing metal the track where guts and grit and luck played against each other at per until one boy was smarter tougher braver and luckier than all the others and crossed the line first and tasted however briefly godhood each of the boss drivers had a longhaul trailer set up in the village which theyd converted to a dedicated sales outlet there the heros image or number or both had been imprinted on everything books and videos were added to the swag hats in a hundred variations were on displayand for saleand a crew of cashiers lined up to take your bucks the cash flow must have been amazing the twentydollar bill was the new onedollar bill and although the modern cash registers didnt kaching like the old mechanical marvels from dayton you could tell yourself that you heard a heavenly choir of kachinging even if it werent necessarily true brother richard looked at all that money flowing one way and one way only and briefly considered what might have been but never was and stifling a choking sound he took another hard blast on the bud he carried like everybody else in a bright red foam caddie you could tell who was hot by the crowds both kyles were doing swell and of course everybody had a thing in their heart for the wonderful dale jr inheritor of the mantle and now driving for the beloved football genius joe gibbs there was little business at jeffs the eternal outsiders unit where only malcontents and selfproclaimed mavericks gathered but the hot one just now was the young redhead matt macready just twentytwo already with a handful of major wins at sprint venues in the hunt for the big cup itself still this late in the season somehow richard felt himself pulled by torrents of enthusiasm even love toward the macready locality in a second he realized why there had been such a current in the crowd good lord the boy himself was there brother richard halted and held back he considered it for a second then realized that after his surgery and in his currently repackaged king petty mode he would stir no old memories not to the boy not to red not to any of them so he ambled close slipping in and out of the whirls and eddies of pilgrims and by not pushing it too hard he got pretty close no he wouldnt get in the line where matt was dutifully signing posters hats ts anything with a magic marker accepting goodwill wishes and even lovehorsepowered thumps on the back with grace and ease and charm richard didnt want to halt for motion was the law of the crowd he let it sweep him on by and saw matts calmnessmatt always had thatand his decencymatt really had thatand it made him realize with surprising bitterness that matt was really the beneficiary of all the madness of eleven years ago though nobody could have known it then for matt was just a boy from the second the trophy wife he was goodnatured and unassertive all eyes and ears to the excellent adventure the fates had decreed would be his life yes maam richard heard matt say in that soft voice of his be happy to and he took a threeyearold upon his lap and smiled for a pic then it was time to go and the thousand still in line had to be disappointed matt rose and said into a mic folks i have to get my beauty rest and keep my arm looseygoosey for all them lefthand turns and of course everybody laughed matt waved then he and red left the venue as a golf cart arrived and richard saw how thin and muscular the young man was how lean and graceful he had the racers perfect body the body that the great ones had short and slender so there was no crowding in the drivers seat with muscular forearms and a longish neck which gave him eerie pivoting ability for peripheral vision left and right legs able to reach pedals without cramping in short the whole package the golf cart speedily vanished behind the cyclone fence that marked off the drivers compound that is the fence that marked off the aristocracy from the peasantry richard watched it go until it disappeared and he imagined where it took matt to a luxury recv customized for travel a beautiful woman or four or six a crew of adoring hangerson an accountant maybe rock or movie star pals the big life as imagined by america at this moment in history again melancholy came across him a fleeting image of the eternal what might have been hed steeled himself to believe to the contrary that given certain behavioral dynamics within himself there was no what might have been there was only a what never could happen it wasnt in the cards he didnt have matts goalongtogetalongness his mellow ways his charm he was too fucking outlaw he had to have it his way he was also too smart too selfaware like all athletic and warrior enterprises nascar tended to reward unconscious genius if you had irony had read a book or two had a taste for surrealism and grotesquerie if you hated structure and had a natural guerrillas heart it could never be for you you saw through it too easily it was like a church and you were born with a nonbelievers heart and even if you felt tremendous nostalgia for it the honest bitter goddamned truth was that it was never going to be and could never have been for you for matt it was maybe just perfect given his perfect blend of talents and limits for richard it was too much given his blend of talents and limitlessness no matter what he would have destroyed his inheritance crapped in the church and gone his own outlaw way thats why he was the sinnerman he turned his ipod way way up until his anthem blasted melancholy from his brain sinnerman where you gonna run to gonna run to the sea sea wont you hide me run to the sea sea wont you hide me but the sea it was a boilin all on that day now it was on to business he looked up at the towering speedway its circularity gone this far under its shadow so that it was just a wall of girders and walkways on the underside of the steep auditorium seating next to it silver in the august heat was the fauxstreamline building of the speedway headquarters which looked to him like a greyhound station in about it sat atop a shelf of land and down here beneath it was the grid of lanes of nascar village and all its little retail outlets a gully some kind of drainage arrangement full of dirty water split nascar village in two but there were two bridges across the channel he took out a pen and a notepad and carefully drew a map and on it traced the quickest way from the roadway to the bridge oh that would be the fun part he moseyed over to the far side of the gully and found exactly more of the same for another square mile or so the tents and booths the walkways somewhat tackier here the sense of bizarre for the pilgrims where everything was a holy relic of the faith all for sale and not cheap beyond the village was the hill that lay at the end of a long scut of ridges trending down from the north he let his gaze fall upon the tip of the hill probably a mile off and six hundred feet up through mud and inclined forests he knew that as in many old fables paradise lay atop the mountain i have been to the mountaintop wasnt that it but before you got to the mountaintop you had to cross a river and a plain bringing fire and destruction along with you what was this the bible ah well he thought continuing with his map fuck em if they cant take a joke twentyfive the caravan left at am to avoid race day traffic and observant eyes and to get set up early it consisted of the reverend grumley in the lead car brother richard driving and two senior grumleys a caleb and a jordan both of whom promptly fell asleep in the back in the second vehicle a truck which bore the name piney ridge baptist prayer camp carried most of the heavy equipment the long days toil would demand the third a van also bearing the name of the camp consisted mostly of man and firepower the fourth a pickup bore as its loads the tents and over ten thousand bottles of water as well as ice coolers nascar hats tshirts king richard cowboy straw stetsons kyle busch caps and other nascar trinkets that would justify their presence at the location the fifth another van contained more men though these were the humbler grumleys the tirechange team and others with various and sundry little tasks according to the master plan the five vehicles moved through a desolate almostunlit mountain city across iron mountainthe spot where sinnerman had almost taken out nikki slid by without commentthrough shady valley past the last long abutment holston mountain then full into the shenandoah for the next eighteenodd miles to bristol and its famed speedway there was no chatter brother richard drove with his usual deft touch the car alive in his hands while the reverend stared glumly into the darkness a cellphone rang to the tune of hail hail the gangs all here the reverend took the phone from his powder blue suit jacket and examined the caller id his masters voice said brother richard who elsed have the number and call at this hour yes said the reverend into the cell he listened yes again he listened some more absolutely a few more seconds passed i guarantee it they are well prepared i myself am here to lead it will happen exactly as planned pray to god our luck is high but it should be as the lord favors the bold i prayed hard last night and again this morning and so i am confi brother richard could tell he was cut off finally he said you have my assurances and i have yours then i will see you when we are home free and ready to celebrate he put the phone away his dark mood was not alleviated thats the big boss said brother richard that would be the gent that actually thought this up as it clearly lies beyond the grumley iq pool hes got his doubts about you reverend i can tell he wants reassurances guarantees a big pair of dice are about to be rolled and nervous as a cat like the rest of us he just wants to make certain you have covered all the bases right the reverend was silent sure would like to know whos on the other end of that phone got my ideas yes i do i aint at no liberty to discuss certain business arrangements with a rogue like you brother richard dont think i didnt notice your head went unbowed during my words with the master before we left that is a ticket to damnation sir i am already thrice damned said richard which aint nothing to you old man you are probably thirtyeight times damned or some such for all your sinning heres what intrigues me do you actually believe the baptist bullshit you sling or is it just a performance sustained so long its become second nature are you a con man whos come to believe in his own con hellfire said the old preacher man damnation road streaks of fiery lightning endtimes thats your fate and you will rue it when satan opens the door with his big smile and welcomes you to the flames of eternal torture hoochie mama said richard i like it the sea be aboilin the moon be ableedin and the sinnerman dont got no place to run i embrace it thats why i like myself so much more than i like you reverend i am what i am and i know it i am not a hypocrite i took the cards i was dealt made my decision played the hand hard to this moment you hide behind some kind of selfdelusionary veil claiming the lords interest while youre just a common murderer and thief and you lead a tribe of neopagans to loot the earth rape burn pillage and move on without a glance back youre actually prechristian a phd could make a career studying the grumley way and its roots in the germanic swamps what was the original grummelechtenstein we be scotsirish borderreiver heritage this talk does us no good did he remind you he had video of you and shut your mouth snapped the reverend them boys back there cousin or brother or both at once are sleeping the sleep of the purely innocent nothing weighs on the consciencefree mind nevertheless shut your mouth touchy touchy but i did learn something interesting today yes i did i see now the nature of your relationship with the fellow who runs you you know nothing tell me if im wrong hes somebody you knew before hes somebody close to you he may even be family first off i hear something troubled in your voice and i hear you let him cut you off when no one other than me ever cuts you off so he is familiar to you an old sponsor someone who saved your life a cellmate someone whos profited off you as youve profited off him over long standing i hear intimacy damn whod a thought but that aint all do tell brother you are so full of yourself pride goeth before the fall sir i done already fallen which is why i consort with your likes the second reason is when this is done theres got to be a transfer almost like a dope deal you will deliver him the swag he will take his lions share you and the boys will squabble over whats left this is a tricky transaction i know ive driven kingpins to and from enough buys usually there are a lot of guns involved for security paranoia is running hot and feverish and at any moment for any reason it can all go brokencuckooclocks the guns come out and you got yourself a goddamned major firefight all that cash just there for the taking yet that does not frighten you does it dr grumley when a grumley give his word his word is ironclad except when its not oh theres the leverage the pix of the rev and his boy toy richard i warned you but somehow no one is concerned about the exchange that means it isnt a problem everybody way up front is okay with it damned interesting would it be another grumley so the leverage aint meanspirited more like a suggestion than a threat everybodys all cozy with it especially the guncrazy giant gonads sleeping in the van richard i aint speaking to you no more when this is done i hope never to see you no more never again you been paid upfront so my advice is to do your job and disappear i always do pappy said caleb from the back seat whats paranoia by six the caravan had decamped and unloaded the boys worked swiftly for here was labor hard and simple with strong arms and backs they sank the tent pegs and drove the poles deep into the ground with stout hearts they unpacked and unfolded the tables with dead earnestness they stowed certain boxes containing certain pieces of equipment underneath the tables arranging and stapling the table cloths so that their skirts covered the items beneath then they got the coolers out packed each with ice and began to load the bottles into them each one holding about fifty so the liquid would be readily cold for pilgrims as the sun rose and pulled the temperature with it they stacked the remaining cases behind the tables almost forming a revetment which would keep anyone from noting what they were up to in its dark shadow as they worked of course they were not alone all along the volunteer parkway this close to the venue merchants of various stripes were setting up their wares for this road to and from the speedway would carry by ten in the morning a slowmotion parade as cars crept along its jammed lanes and pedestrians coming from vehicles already parked streamed in the thousands toward the mighty coliseum next to the grumley installation for example was phils fine north carolina barbq where phil and his sons had already lit the coals under the broadbottomed grills that would hold the meat put atop them allowing the juices of phils secret mix of sauces and herbs to permeate it so that by noontime damn the whole place would smell of hot pig and sweet bubbly brown sugar on the other side a tall mr stevens had an elaborate tent that offered a line of extremely fine woven mats some showing drivers standing before their sleek vehicles some showing the flag or elvis or the iwo jima memorial or the twin towers never forget or the flag of the departed confederacy or fs blazing across a sky or horses rearing proudly against a western mesa or osama in the crosshairs of a snipers scope all made of course in china and on and on it went down the parkway that linked the speedway and the city of bristol twelve miles away the parkway that on race day would be a nearfrozen river of automobiles moving an inch at a time but the grumleys had gotten the best spot of all and it took some doing as the permit for this space had been held for a number of years by another baptist church which used to sell souvenirs as well but had been persuaded to turn over its permit in receipt of a large donation so the grumleys had set up almost at ground zero of the nascar explosion directly across from nascar village on the other side of parkway just a bit down from the driveway that led to the parkway from the speedway headquarters an admin building in art moderne aluminum as they labored and the sun rose they could see across the way the hugeness of the speedway itself dwarfed only by the mountain beyond nascar village that topped the wall of the racing structure they were all done by eight bottles hats ts and so forth all displayed under a large banner that read piney ridge baptist prayer camp water hats ts and in smaller letters send a student to prayer camp to learn the way of the gospel and the true meaning of worship it was at long last race day part ii race day twentysix vern knocked on the door he heard awkward reluctant shuffling sensed doubt perhaps even fear but finally the door popped open about two inches held secure by a chain lock and he and his partner faced a pair of ancient asian eyes in an ancient asian face mamasan looked to be in her seventies without much english and quite insecure vern with his gift of gab his easy ways of persuasion his cheap good looks was on the case from the start maam he said with a smile and warmth radiating from his eyes sorry to bother you but we are official inspectors we have to inspect you know only take a moment the womans face collapsed into confusion suddenly a much younger asian face possibly no more than fourteen years old and belonging to a very pretty child leaned beyond the door well hello hello vern thought her skin was fair her eyes almond her hair drawn back she was smooth as a peach and tiny as a fairy princess my grandmother doesnt understand what is it sweetie said vern kneeling to the girl we are official inspectors from the department of official inspection here lookie this he showed her an alabama drivers license in the name of horton van leer see that star means its official just need to come in a second and well be gone have to make a report you wouldnt want to get in trouble with the department now would you the child said theres no such thing as a department of inspections thats an alabama drivers license not a badge or an id go away then she shut the door alas working quickly ernie had already knocked the hinge bolts out and when she slammed it the door almost toppled in catching it vern scooted forward while ernie held the door secured at that moment only by the stillattached chain lock to give his pal some leverage vern smilingly unhooked the chain as if to say to the two terrified women see thats all there is to it he actually managed an expression that suggested he expected some kind of congratulations having entered the apartment ernie swiftly and expertly remounted the door on its hinges replaced the bolts then closed and locked it the two women stared at the intruders horrified whatever visions of american evil they secretly held these two men now liberated meanwhile vern slipped across the room peered through the sliding doors that opened as if onto a balcony but where there was no balcony since this was the first floor instead they opened onto the parking lot across the lot stood another building like this one an undistinguished threestory brick structure with four outdoor stairwells and six units per stairwell the unit directly across from them was nikki swaggers which theyd discovered by checking the mailboxes is it okay vern called ernie who was more or less just intimidating the prisoners with his presence and his baleful charmless stare vern said yeah its fine we can see him good no problem he turned to the two asian women sorry gals said vern but whats got to bes got to be now no need for nobody to git excited we are very easygoing long as you cooperate without violence but with a force that suggested the possibility of violence vern herded the women into the living room now little lady since youre so damned spunky and granny here dont talk the lingo looks like youll have to answer the questions no holding back now little dolly he put his hand friendlylike on her frail shoulder feeling it stiffen are you thieves we have so little but take it and go away my grandmother has been ill a shock could kill her look at her shes scared to death vern hugged grannie there there mamasan it aint nothing you just relax now okay just sit down on the sofa and relax watch a show do some knitting she likes sudoku yeah then do that meanwhile he took the smaller girl back into the bedroom she was one of those scrawnybeautiful scrappers with eyes that glittered fiercely twelve maybe no breasts short a tshirt some running shoes the tshirt said hannah montana tour and had a picture of another kid the child had no sexuality but she was hotter than hell nevertheless as the smart feisty ones always are shed never back down from nobody sweetie please work with me on this its better for everone how many people live here where are they when they gonna be home i dont want no surprises and if im surprised you aint gonna be a happy camper he showed her the grip of his shoulderholstered glock in case you dont get it thats a real gun i am a real bad man and i have to be here for a time i aint gonna hurt you you aint a witness because my names already on a hundred circulars but i am the real thing and there aint no heroes no more nobodys coming to save you so you do what i say exactly or there will be some problems and im the easy one that guy ernie with me he

him really like her a lot maybe too much an idea was starting to form he could get her in the bathroom and she had to do what he said or hed hurt her family so shed have to do it he saw her fear her little body the trembling it excited him ill go get grandma oh and one other thing what do you want on your pizza twentyseven for some reason like an old bear he needed sleep so he violated his promise to the sheriff by sleeping through the clock radio awaking at tenthirty and thinking first of all oh hell where am i that moment of confusion familiar to men beyond sixty his eyes flashed around the banal motel room and he had no idea what he was doing there what time it was why he was so late why in his dreams people seemed so disappointed in him it came back of course but not quickly enough and he needed a good ten minutes for the blood to somehow reach his brain and revive his shortterm memories quickly he took up the kimber super made a quick recon of the parking lot of the mountain empire motel and was satisfied to see it largely empty no sheriffs cars in sight he started the coffee took a shower pulled on his last clean polothere had to be a washer and dryer at nikkisand began his calls the first of course was to his wife the news was great bob shes awake shes back our baby is back bob felt the elation blossom bright like a flare in the night signaling that reinforcements were coming in oh thank god oh christ that is so great when did it happen how whats her condition julie tumbled through the story at about eightfifteen nikki opened her eyes sat up shook her head groggily and said hi mom where am i doctors came and went tests were made nikki gradually seemed to focus and particularly benefited from her little sisters incredible joy the two girls sat on the bed and talked for what seemed hours while all the fuss went on about them now she was getting further tests she doesnt remember anything about the incident but everything else seemed all right hows dadoh my god how much work have i missedoh i have to call my editorwhen can we leaveim hungry oh thats so great said bob it doesnt get much better than the moment you hear your kid has pulled through a tough one his first impulse was to race to the car and beeline to knoxville to be with his family at this precious moment the doctor says the signs are good shell get more memory back over the next few days our little girl is going to make it miko came on delirious and he talked to the second daughter for a while in the language of fathers and daughters both intimate and silly but at a certain point it came back to him yeah shes fine shes okay its all right theres a happy endingif he realized that shed make it if the boys didnt come back to take her out again she was much more dangerous now that she was conscious unconscious there was always the thought that she could pass now revived she was a threat id like to come back he said i wish i could come back but you cant julie said you have work to do yes i do i want the security tightened bob ive already called pinkerton theyre upping the manpower itll cost us a fortune but i dont care whats happening there where are you he told her summing things up wishing he had a definite next step in mind or that a solution would somehow soon be at hand but it remained amorphous strange men tried to kill nikki tried to kill him for looking into it the sheriffs office didnt have a clue nick memphis hadnt returned his phone calls im going to go to bristol now to her apartment thats where theyll know to find me bob be careful maybe i can turn a thing on them if not ill wait a few days until after the race then ill sneak back here and sniff out eddie ferrol if anyone knows anything for sure its him he and ill have a little conversation and then ill be up to speed can you find him i think i can he saw his cell light blinking informing him another call was coming in you know i have to go ill get back to you when im in bristol love you love you he called up received calls and recovered charlie wingates number he punched call and the phone was answered in two seconds charlie mr swagger did you hear no they found the owner of that gun store dead eddie ferrol the guy who owned iron mountain armory someone shot him they found the body off the interstate bob blinked took a swallow of the coffee yeah he said and before he and i could chat remember i gave you the number from your daughters laptop hard drive did you see him i dont bob suddenly saw how it might have looked to the kid you think i tracked him down you think im some kind of hit man no charlie its not that way i saw him and asked him some questions about my daughter he denied ever having seen her but i learned that was a lie i was going to see him again but the next thing i know im the one whos targeted long story been more or less laying low ever since but anyone concerned about me would know that eddies the man id have to get back to if they couldnt get me they could get him especially since they cant have had any confidence in his ability to stand up to tough questions the fastest way out of that jam is a bullet in his head yes sir umam i in any danger dont think so only way would be if whoever im looking for has very sophisticated phone intercept capability government quality no not these boys smokeless powder is about as sophisticated as they get it aint the cia or even the mafia its some boys who arent sure the wheel is going to last charlie im about to leave town you keep working on what i told you and ill check back from bristol okay yes sir this is kind of cool after disconnecting bob tried nick again agh where was he he called terry hepplewhite the clerk at lesters about whom he still worried but he found terry in fine spirits with nothing to report he had half a mind to pay for a vacation or something but saw in an instant that wouldnt work thelmad be all over it if terry suddenly vanished no terry had to sit it out at least until whatever happened happened his case was processed and police interest had moved elsewhere bob thought that was another mistake i shouldnt have involved that kid i should have stuck around and taken the heat man am i losing it i have made a batch of bad decisions on this one and maybe i am just making things more difficult than they are but there was nothing left to do but get out of town so that sheriff didnt drop down in his blackhawk again he threw his laundry into his duffel and went to the car he drove aimlessly hoping to smoke out anybody following but his sudden turns and reverses uncovered nobody for all of it he was in the free and clear the route took him up and down iron mountain on across shady valley where he stopped and refueled and got a bite to eat he then crossed holston mountain and twenty miles out of bristol almost immediately hit the race day traffic hed sworn to avoid by leaving early that plan lost he settled in for the long haul the drive across the valley a backup at the approach to the bridge over holston lake and then into really heavy stuff as he got close to the speedway itself which was twelve miles outside of bristol he hated traffic he was too old for traffic traffic was no fun the only good thing about traffic was that nothing bad could happen in it because nobody who did anything bad could get away there was too much traffic he looked at the map thought maybe he could figure out a way around the mess it might be longer in miles but it would keep him driving and engaged instead of crawling that was always his theory in other situations its better to drive at speed even if it takes longer than to endure the frustrations of the slow stopandgo but none of the other routes really offered much in the way of possibility he had to remember that hundreds of thousands of people were on the march and that every single route would be slowed down it was just physics that many cars on those few roads computed to simple congestion no matter what you had to accept it not let it screw you up so he just tried to stay relaxed giving himself up to the radio running from country western station to country western station occasionally nesting on the knoxville news station hoping there might be new information on the two grumley boys whod tried to kill him but there wasnt that story was dead as was the killing of the meth addict cubby bartlett nothing lasted more than a day in todays news cycle why didnt nick call with nicks help he could find out in minutes who these grumleys were what their involvement foretold and who possibly they were connected to or working for but nick didnt call finally around four he hit the city limits and forty minutes later crawled past the speedway itself it was the same only worse the huge structure dominated the valley but it was aswarm with crowds traffic just crawled and people wandered through it en masse most of the husky fellows who herded families through the merriment seemed to carry coolers full of beer on their shoulders and nascar ball caps were perched on every head from the youngest to the oldest the pilgrims were dressed any old way mainly in cutoff jeans and tank tops and everybody smoked or had a beer in a caddy the women wore flipflops and a few even seemed to have bras underneath their shirts but mainly it was downhome as it could be not a tie or a jacket anywhere in sight just thin clothes heaving flesh a sense of complete ease this was the night of nights the night of thunder on both sides of the roadhed turned from to the volunteer parkwayeven more booths had been set up so that the strip appeared to be a vast bazaar there wasnt hardly anything nascar you couldnt buy except possibly body parts or dna samples and every merchant seemed to be doing landrush business all of it cash smoke hung in the air from the barbecue grills and even the teetotaling baptists were selling water bottles to raise money for their prayers bob found it hard not to feel the joy these folks felt and he connected with it his daughter was all right shed come back she was okay she was going to be fine he again felt rich in daughters and possibilities and wished he could just enjoy it a little but there was the worm someone had tried to kill her might try again theyd tried to kill him theyd kill anyone who got in the way even if that person didnt realize theyd gotten in the way mark i say arise from your pallet and go to your house crippled man arise you are cured i give you your life back that fellow would feel some joy too the sensation leaking into his legs the strength burgeoning the psychological burden of selfloathing of imperfection of isolation all of that gone rejoin the world son welcome back to the land of the whole thats how he felt when the word came that nikki was awakehed risen from his bed able to go to his home again what could it mean what could it mean the thing weighed like an ingot on his brain so much so that he hardly noticed that the traffic had thinned andglory bethat he could accelerate stoplight to stoplight because he was now inside the destination it was the lanes on the other side of the median that were so impossibly jammed up he sped through downtown bristol found the right cross street looked for the kmart that was his tipoff managed a left and wound through the little hidden neighborhood and up a hill into the complex that ultimately yielded her apartment he parked next to a red eldoradowow dont someone have extravagant taste in transporationand stopped to look around see if there was a chance anyone had stayed with him through the endless hours of traffic nope funny though he had a strange feeling of being watched he had good instincts for such kept him alive more than once he looked again saw nothing a parking lot longer than it was wide on each side of it low fourstory brick buildings typical american apartments lots of balconies down the way some kids played but no one new pulled into the lot he looked for activity in the cars for any sight of activity on the balconies and no no there was nothing gunmans paranoia going a little nuts in my old age mankillers anxiety all the boys i put down are coming after me happens to the best of them satisfied no sign existed of threat he climbed the stairs opened the door to her apartment and stepped in as he did a man stood up from her sofa hands flew to guns the weapons came out fingers on triggers slack going out killing time was here but then nick memphis for christs sake hello bob you sure took your time getting here didnt think youd ever make it twentyeight vern dammit i cant do this alone git over here i might miss something i have to pee that was ernie sitting in the dining room chair at the drawn sliding doors peering at the building across the street through a sliver of open curtain but vern didnt answer instead he asked the young vietnamese girl in the bedroom so whats your name while the grandmother looked on with angry eyes she clearly did not think his attentions were appropriate and the way he kept looking over to her and grinning with his big white teeth got on her nerves but then she had never understood these strange white people anyway what was wrong with them they were so stupid about so many things what difference does it make asked the girl well if it dont make no difference might as well tell me as not im guessing susan you look like a susan i do not i look like a hannah hannah ng pronounced ning hannah ng my name is vern pye this aint the

mall git hannah ng any damn thing she wanted new jeans new ts new tank tops new hoodies new sneaks well have a hell of a swell time sweetie vern promises the child shivered this is getting creepy if you didnt fight against it it wouldnt seem so hard honey vern goddamnit get over here yelled ernie now dont you worry about a thing verns got some work to do then well talk some more vern left went to the living room and pulled a chair up to spell ernie so he could go pee bout time what you been doing just talking to the kid vern we got a damn job you stay away from her while we work you hear the old mand be plenty ticked if he knowed youse been mooning on that damn kid when youse supposed to be man hunting when it comes it comes sometimes you dont get a second shot you got to take it things is swell here im going to piss vern sat dreamyeyed and disconnected at the window he didnt see the cars across the parking lot or the building they fronted or the steps up to the doors he saw himself and hannah ng in the bathroom he saw his easy way with her how hed have his way how good it would feel he told himself shed like it too the more he thought about it the better it seemed ernie came back goddamn vern there he is vern snapped out of the hot and sleazy place his brain was in and reentered the known world there indeed not twentyfive yards away was the tall older man named swagger who was their quarry hed parked now he got out and peered about carefully making certain he was unfollowed and unnoticed see hes a careful one yeah he is he aint no pushover but hell go down hard like any man the man then went to the stairwell climbed past second and thirdfloor landings and on the fourth took out a key opened the door to an apartment and stepped in now we really got to watch vern you cant i know i know better call the old man yeah yeah said vern taking out his cell he punched in the number what vern asked the reverend in the background vern could hear hubbub as the boys sold water and reb hats and tshirts to pilgrims going to the race vern could tell that business was landrush scale reverend he done showed just arrived hes there oh thats good thats fine thats swell yes sir we could go over there right now kick in the door be in out in five seconds and itd be done no no said the reverend you never can tell long as hes in there he aint doing us no harm you just watch and wait if he dont never leave you wait till we go at eleven or so then you go that way what the hell the laws have situations at both ends of town with a massive traffic mess in between em they wont never git it sorted out thats when you do em or if for some reason he decides to go somewhere you see him come out and go to his car then we cant know where hes going then you go out and while hes in that car starting up you pop his ass good and hard drop that hammer nail that boy to the wall yes sir bappitybapbap and you all done then you go its so far off no laws will figure it has nothing to do with anything else but thats my second choice best wait till our fun commences before yall go settle grumley accounts got that vern i do pap god said ernie this is turning into an adam sandler movie dopeystupid and crazy someone else just arrived whats next the circus the two boys watched as indeed someone went up the four landings and knocked at the old mans door after some time the door was answered and an awkward transaction took place them guys always come at the wrong time said ernie as the ups man walked down the steps and returned to his brown van twentynine well you look older and dumpier said bob nick had indeed thickened some and let his crewcut grow out a little the years of service had engraved wary lines in his face and now he wore glasses hornrims he still wore the uniform the black suit white shirt and red tie and if you looked you saw his handgun printing high on his right hip he now replaced it as bob replaced his so do you whats with the hair you must have seen a ghost reckon so it just went in two weeks i had a rough spell in japan these folks kept trying to cut me down so to get their attention i cut them down id tell you more about it except youd have to arrest me since i havent seen any interpol circulars on them you seem to have gotten away with it again by the way do you have a license to carry that gun no good same old bob just checking hows that tough little wife of yours she still want to put me in jail more like a mental home anyhow sallys with the us attorneys office in dc now she never liked me much but then few do why should she be any different i never liked you much either if it matters well what i liked about you was youse so far down the totem pole i could say aint and it dont without any career harm and by the way whatre you doing standing in the middle of my daughters living room how is she you know what happened to her as of two days ago pretty much everything i know shes awake with a groggy memory which is why theres no sense talking to her but i will and thats why even as we speak a team of us marshals has taken over security at her hospital shes a valuable federal witness even if she doesnt know it looks like weve got a spell of talking to do mind if i get something to drink you shouldnt drink and carry not a good idea dont mean that kind of drinking drink as in fruit juice or a nice coke something wet you want one no im fine bob got himself a fruit juice from the refrigerator and when he got back nick had sat down on the sofa he reclined in a chair okay old friend lets talk by the way im really glad youre here this thing is very complex and i aint got it half figured out but why didnt you call me back because im looking for a very smart guy i dont know his capabilities but hes a highly organized criminal with amazing technical skills he might know about the task force and he might have penetrated it just a precaution the driver right yeah the driver the guy who tried to kill your daughter the car guy he came damn close you dont know how lucky your daughter is this is a very bad actor hes killed nine federal witnesses and six federal officers over the past seven years he did a family in cleveland three years back the father was an accountant who was going to testify against a teamster local money laundering and extortion never happened the driver hit them and they were gone in a second mother father three kids he may even have more kills that we dont even know about he also freelances for various mob franchises even some overseas outfitswe have interpol circulars on him but were in this because of the federal angle you have a name we dont have a name or even a face all we have is a modus operandi and it took years before we were even on to that what weve been able to learn is that hes some kind of genius with automobiles genius driver genius mechanic genius car thief genius on automotive electronics he can break into any car he wants in about six seconds drive off in three more he seems to like chargers hell steal a car plates and so forth he sets the car up with a heavyduty suspension tunes the engine for max power then he scopes his quarry out waits till theyre on the highway he understands the physics of the accident what it takes to knock a car out of equilibrium where to hit it which angle to take that sort of thing it usually takes only one pass he hits em hard they overcorrect to keep control and they lose it the car flips it rolls it bounces and everyone inside is whiplashed to death in seconds hes gone in a flash the car is never found theres no prints no dna nothing just paint samples that lead back to a stolen car you dont have any idea who he is theres stories some say hes a rogue nascar guy who killed another driver in a fit of rage and had to make himself scarce we have seven names like that all of them accounted for some say he pissed off big racing by fucking one of the familys daughters and they made sure hed never race a sanctioned event again some say hes just pure psycho with a gift for automotives it could be any of those all of them none of them we just know hes good very thorough highly intelligent the fearless classic psychotic but when we heard about nikki we set up a task force out of knoxville somethings up we think i do too so what have you got well someone knocked on the door the two men exchanged looks were you followed dont think so expecting anyone no lets be real careful on this one nick slipped to the right of the door sig in hand tense ready bob went to the left of the door drew the kimber held it behind him thumb riding the safety ready to push it off in a second yeah he demanded loudly ups came the muffled reply just a sec said bob he looked through the peep hole hes in brown i dont know maybe theyre so far into this they have fake ups uniforms i dont know said nick can you just leave it need a signature sir okay said bob he opened the door two inches until the chain restrained it even as he peeled away from it in case somebody fired through it but instead a thin cardboard box slipped through the twoinch opening in the doorway bob grabbed it shook it and tossed it on the floor he opened the door signed his name with a stylus on the computerized notepad and watched the fellow trundle off slightly absurd in his short pants and brown socks those guys always arrive at the wrong time said nick they have a gift for it they sat down again and bob told the whole story from start to finish his arrival in bristol after his daughters accident his investigation the sheriff departments investigation the opposing conclusions of each the two critical incidents that left three dead bobs remorse about leaving poor terry hepplewhite alone back there as the supposed shooter the death of eddie ferrol the police politics of johnson county the situation as it now was with nikki awake so let me sum up your findings nick said he ticked them off the strange economics of methamphetamine in johnson county the baptist prayer camp run by an alton grumley the driver the tirechange jack and possible exercises to refine that skill the night firing of guns the attempts on bobs life by grumleys as he tried to investigate grumleys are a southern crime family headquartered near hot springs nick explained kind of a family training camp for the criminal skills been around for generations they produce all kinds of mischief forcebased mainly but also confidence bunco extortion and kidnapping very tribal group of bad guys if theyre involved im suddenly seeing a lot of dough bob took it in then continued the missing pages in his daughters notebook the crushed car crushed recording devices the trip to the gun store and finally mark thats it said bob now heres my take somehow nikki picked something up so she visited the camp but saw through the reverend she poked around on her own and she found something clearly these grumleys were involved but what she found made her think ofi dont know heres where it gets blurry guns or the bible or both she wouldnt call me to ask about the bible that i guarantee you so maybe it is about guns she tried to call me but i was out in the horse ring so she went to the first baptist minister she heard about who turned out to be eddie ferrol and asked about mark thinking that fella would know and the fact that he owns a gun store is coincidental i dont buy coincidences that big bob stopped yeah this is where it comes apart the bullet or bible issue and she called me first and i dont know jerk about bibles but the fact that he claims she didnt go there and we know thats a lieshe drives home and that guy whos later killed somehow gets to the driver and hes sent after her now he had to be close so he was clearly at the prayer camp run by old man grumley we have his tracks as he raced down to catch up to her that sounds right okay we dont have mark but what do we have heres what im getting it seems to me what theyre planning isnt a conspiracy a murder a scheme a plot that doesnt sound grumley its more of a caper a onetime thing some kind of raid or operation maybe a robbery thats the urgency thats why everything has to happen fast cause theyre up against a tight deadline and what happens happens soon they have to go at a certain moment not before not after and that information has to be protected its so fragile that even the suspicion of something going on would screw things up their plan must depend on total surprise and even minimumsecurity upgrades would defeat it thats why they go after nikki even if she knows nothing she might make phone calls or ask questions and someone else might figure something was up and those upgrades would be made and their plans would be screwed bob thought yeah hes pretty smart thats good for government work could it be a code a signal lets google it again maybe we missed something but they came up with nothing except the endless and seemingly fruitless biblical references let me call this kid charlie hes real smart maybe hes come up with something bob called charlie the boy was apologetic selfdoubting and disappointed because he hadnt come up with anything i even ran it by a guy i know who specializes in codes he looked at it for numerology misplaced letters anagrams displacements upside down writing backwards writing and he came up zilch okay charlie thanks sorry i couldnt do better for you mr swagger well you actually cross out a lot of possibilities son so thats of some help it aint a code it aint nothing from the bible or the numbers or letters in the bible that cuts it way down i wont charge you charlie how many times do i have to say this charge me bob disconnected nothing and if youre right if they have some kind of caper going on against a deadline here we sit with nothing to show for it no progress made could it have to do with the race the big race he looked at his watch hell eightthirty its started could it be a rob but he let it trail off it doesnt make any sense said nick how could they rob something in the middle of the biggest traffic jam in tennessee this year how could they get in get out i suppose they could go on foot but how much could each man carry i just dont see any reasonable methodology here those roads are going to be like parking lots for hours nobodys going anywhere i am at the end of the road man im about to say call it a day maybe tomorrow i can run it by the analysts back in dc and get some genius to look into it and see what we dont i do need a drink a real one but lets ask what do we know the most about the answer is nikki i know nikki i know how her mind works and what a stubborn little cuss she can be so lets think along with her take us through her thoughts on that last night you know shes called you she calls mebut im not answering she gets a burr under her saddle shes got to get it out she calls me i aint there what does she do call someone else who else would she call shes been to a gun store she had a bible she got from the reverend she cant find no satisfaction she calls me im not there who else does she call its early evening most places are closed down who does she call the newspaper could she have called the newspaper but you said she didnt thats right maybe she didnt call anyone maybe she just up and left for home and the driver caught her and no gal wouldnt give up thats not how she was taught shed want to do something positive achieve a sense of progress so somehow shed continue to search so whos open that late who never closes who has information on anything on tap even if youre in the woods in rural tennessee in the dark they looked at each other she had a laptop right said nick wireless right she went to the internet she tried to google mark and came up with what we came up withten thousand explanations of how jesus cured the cripple and sent him home and she couldnt make any sense of it who does she call next they looked at nothing and then they looked at each other again they looked at the package that bob had just dumped on the floor it said amazon she buys a book thirty verns cell rang yes sir whats the word vern ernie whats the word aint no word goddamnit vern and youd know that if you done your job dont know how you can take money for tonight just sittin there hammerin on that poor little girl and her family vern sat next to the little girl on the sofa his big hand draped protectively about her gently hed been caressing her arm for about and hour whispering softly into her ear well sir mr holy water i will do my job same as you and earn my money same as you he went back to the phone sir i vern i heard discord i told yall i didnt want no discord discord is what makes things fall apart that i know true and straight sir ernie and i are fine we just ran into some unexpected situation is all as for that old man he aint peeked out a bit ernie kept a good watch on him yes he did theres no move or nothing okay we are about to let hell out of the jar here the racell be over in a little bittheyre up to lap four eighty or so nowand theyll let the traffic build a bit and then they go and we jump like i said before thats when you go up you bash in the door you hit him with both barrels a lot of shooting it dont matter no police getting there for six hours with the mess we making here then you git gone but good ill call you later sos you can pick up your swag that is a good plan sir boys said the reverend i just want you to know youre doing grumley work tonight but more important you are serving the lord sir he has rewarded me i have met the gal of my dreams here tonight yes sir thirtyone bob tore open the amazon package it was the history of sniping and sharpshooting by major john l plaster a sniper expert and former sog war dog in vietnam who bob actually knew sniping said nick so she was trying to find something about snipers she couldnt have found a gun nobody loses a gun shed found i dont know a piece of equipment a gillie hat a range book or maybe some shellrelated thing the shell itself the box a piece of carton a manifest a bill of lading something with a shell designation on it but it had to be something unusual the girl is my daughter shed been around cartridges her whole life she knew the difference between a and a and between a shell a cartridge and a bullet and it had to be arcane then if she didnt know it right away and sought someone with more informationthe guy in the gun store you finally the book lets try mark bob said he went to the index damn no mark but he was so close now he could feel the answer almost as a palpable presence floating just out of focus in the corner of the room damn said nick i was so sure it wait said bob i think technically they abbreviate em and we never saw the word mark written in her own hand dont know if it really was a mark or some kind of abbreviation i think the military uses mk period as its abbreviation left over from the old days but i dont see go back to the index bob found the designation mk bob turned to page and immediately saw a photo of a group of long big meanlooking cartridges missiles really their sleek brass hulls propped upright as they rested on a rim while at the top a bullet like a warhead promised speed precision and destruction the conical streamlinedtodeathpoint thing itself was sometimes black sometimes blue sometimes red sometimes tipped in these colors all a part of the complex system of military enumeration by which armies on the prowl in far dusty places could keep their logistical requirements coherent and there finally it was mk model o raufoss with greenoverwhite painted tip they read the mk raufoss is a dedicated armorpiercing caliber round meant to penetrate light steel of norwegian manufacture nammo being the name of the firm and design in play in specialized roles in the american war effort in the middle east it consists of a tungsten core buried in the center of the grain bronze bullet and was designed so that the bullet itself traveling at over twentyfive hundred feet per second and delivering four thousand foot pounds of energy at impact would bore through the armor of the vehicle a nanosecond later a small charge would explode thus releasing the tungsten rod within which being heavier and harder would fly into the crew compartment shatter and fragmentize quickly wounding disabling or simply slaughtering the human beings and any delicate electronic equipment inside its for light armored vehicles said bob not a tank but an armored personnel carrier a humvee a car a radar screen an aerial a mobile command center or maybe a bunker or barricade a helicopter a plane on the ground a wiring junction a stoplight a camera or infrared scope any number of military applications which are classified soft targets anything short of the real big mechanized stuff im betting they do a lot of damage wherever theyre deployed the caliber thats the big one nick wanted to know they call the original gun the queen of battle ma deuce from the heavy machine gun designation which is m you rule the battlefield with it in certain situations say on a hill way out in badguy land we used a lot of em in nam we loved em but this heres the newest wrinkle it aint for a machine gun see this mk shits for a rifle built by an outfit called barrett a big son of a bitch just barely manportable six feet long forty pounds or so off a bipod looks like an m on hormones for arnold schwarzenegger you couldnt carry it in a holster to rob a store but placed with a trained operator you could use it to snipe at over a mile to take out trucks and lightly armored defensive positions you could rain havoc and brimstone on your target zone with pinpoint accuracy you could take down people lowflying planes missiles on their launch pads radio and radar installations anything you could use it on the president with that ammo it aint the gun its the ammo its strictly militaryonly banned from civilian use and i dont think even the nra cares about that its for blowing up stuff for multiplying the killing force for bringing down planes or choppers that ammoll go through anything and cut the shit out of whats on the other side so thats what she found said nick some evidence of a caliber rifle with deadly militaryonly ammunition in criminal hands presumably being readied for some kind of kickass caper and thats why they wanted to kill her and when you found out they had to try and kill you but what would the caper be can you guess and when is it going down could it be a kill said bob thats what you could do with this the president i dont know the governor some big guy hes in a box watching the race theyre on the mountaintop which just barely might give you a vantage point on the speedway or somehow theyve gotten into the speedway itself though with a gun that big i dont know how maybe he can zero the big guys box put ten mks into it kill everybody in two seconds im guessing or it could take out an armored limousine turn it to swiss cheese the president isnt there the governor of tennessee is butthe governor of tennessee i suppose i just nick ran out of words somehow it doesnt seem grumley its not their style no no this is good consider it said bob theyre hired by some mob who knows their one value isnt sophistication but silence thats what theyre selling so maybe the governor is organizing some new antiorganized crime task force got em all scared they contract the hit to the grumleys who bring it off with their usual crudeness and violence but also a refusal to snitch em out if caught the tires bob you were the one that discovered the tires were you wrong on that how would that fit in ahhh bob thought clinging to his thesis yeah yeah they could count on their being an suv there in the crowd but not with offroad tires yeah after the hit which takes maybe two seconds they chase a family out of its bronco speedchange the tires and take off cross country maybe to the top of that hill a chopper picks em up it sounds pretty good to me partner but maybe you have biases youre a sniper everything to you looks like a sniper job from ten feet with a mk it aint much like sniping its like blowing stuff up real good okay i think we have to alert this command structure somehow theyve got to get people into the area put a hold on all vip transit and maybei still dont like it it just doesnt seem grumley does it seem grumley to you until today i didnt know a grumley from a dandelion could they shoot up the race from up above fire the ten shells into the lead three cars as they move through the pack on a turn youd get a massive crash cars all over the place the race would be a catastrophe theyd stop it cancel it something bob saw through that and if someone laid money against the oneinamillion shot thered be no winner to the sharpie well that person would win a fortune but hed get a visit from the vegas mob enforcer to make sure his win was on the upandup and since it wouldnt be hed get a swim in lake tahoe with a pair of cement socks and it doesnt seem to need a driver a speedtire change or any of the other stuff it just doesnt seem to make any sense nick said and just to make it more ridiculous the race is almost over its near eleven they start at eight and do the five hundred laps in about three hours man i am so buffaloed come on nick youre supposed to be smart figure it out im tired im old i feel older than you look okay go back to basics what do we know absolutely we know absolutely they have acquired a caliber rifle and a supply of armorpiercing incendiary rounds of a sort the government categorizes as antimatériel so said bob lets pursue this particular line what is matériel okay id answer like this light armor limousines sure or given this environment power lines tv trucks light safes radio installations i dont know mcdonalds signs news helicopters race cars race car trailers propane barbecue tanks it could be any of those im afraid were stuck with just make the call you dont have to designate a target you just have to flood the zone with law enforcement and security and what zone i guess the race zone yeah but hello its full of three hundred thousand happy campers too bad theres not a nice armored car in the middle of this chock full of cash now that would make some sense okay ill make the call and it lay there in the room for a while each man considered what nick had just blurted out yes armored car seemingly impregnable full of cash stuck in traffic yet easily taken down by such a tool as an mk what you just said said bob now that makes some sense it does doesnt it but he had to fight it why would there be an armored car in the middle of all this it doesnt track its a bad idea a red herring it nick took out his cell punched a number ill call a state police captain ive worked with he might know something he said when he got through bob heard him say hey mike its memphis sorry for the late call youve been watching the race cool is it over yet no i could call back its almost over but let me just lay something on you im here in bristol myself sorry but its important he said to bob now hes turning the tv down ah okay mike we have intelligence that some very bad actors are on scene here with a piece of ugly work called an mk raufoss antimatériel round and a caliber rifle to fire the stuff they could use it to do all sorts of things but the more we think about it this group seems criminal not political and were trying to figure out if theres a target they could unzip with it i know it sounds ridiculous but im thinking how ideally suited the ordnance would be against some sort of armored car is there an armored car in play here that you would know anything he listened as faroff mike told him all about it then he said all right can you patch through to your command center im going to try to reach them from my end ill try and get a bureau swat team deployed from knoxville by chopper and then well move on site fast as we can tenfour well said bob come on said nick we dont have time ill explain on the run bob threw on a light khaki sports coat to cover the gun in kydex and mags arrayed in clip holders along his backside its the concession money said nick all of it cash small bills a weeks worth of souvenirs and baseball hats plus tickets for tonight hot dog money beer money all the money from that nascar village operation he says its a six to eight million take now i should say if you rob a bank and get two million youve really only stolen because youve got to move it to an overseas cartel theyve got to launder it and get it back to the us and theyll only pay out one on ten thats universalexcept for this eight million small billsmaybe eight hundred to a thousand pounds of deadweightis eight million no one for ten straight oneforone you can start spending immediately no one can track it its in an armored car asked bob more like a truck they gather it up during the race and haul it to speedway headquarters but theres no vault there so they bale it up and load it aboard that armored car when the race is over that vehicle with a driver and three or four guards moves out into the traffic and begins the long crawl to bristol where its vaulted at one of the big downtown banks the traffic jam thats supposedly the security no one would hit an armored car in a traffic jam because theres no way out but im guessing theyve figured some way it was suddenly clear to bob i see it no they dont take the swag they blow open the car kill or incapacitate the crew it takes ten seconds with an mk they set up perimeter security to deal with the cops who will have to fight the tide of panicked fans in the thousands to even get there this team changes tires fast why because they aint driving down no road the roads are jammed they go offroad they just mounted some kind of powerful offroad heavytread tire they go offroad they grind through the most open area which is that nascar village they just smash through it nothing could stand up to the power of that truck maybe theyve amped the engine somehow to get a lot more power for a few minutes before the engine seizes or catches fire thats something the driver could do he could figure it out yeah but where does that get em it gets em to the mountain the hill whatever up they go and for that ride theyd need the best driver in the world someone whod won hillclimbs and truck demo derbies the whole nine yards they crank up that hill five minutes and fifty dead citizens and cops after they first hit the car up top thats the only safe place for that chopper pickup i came up with earlier the chopper comes down the mountain range way out of reach or even sight of any police firepower on scene it picks them and the dough up and theyre gone in seconds they run through the dark low without lights and nobody will follow them because a they cant see em and b even if they could theyre afraid of that caliber which will easily take a chopper down nick took up the narrative they chopper out of the area land split the swag and theyre gone by dawn we wont even find where theyll land bob made his choice at that moment he knew where theyd land but he had business there too i have to move said nick im going to try and get a chopper in here and get out there you dont have to oh yes i do you need guns ive got one thirtytwo the race was over it was a jimdandy junior won just beating carl by shedding him in a pile of the lapped but persistent tailenders on the last half of number five hundred when junior went low slipped through a gap between food city and bass pro shop buzzed dangerously around the bluegreen dewalt reading the apex of the curvewhich he knew better than his girlfriends inner thighs and which he dreamed of more oftenand hit the last straight in fedexs wake slingshotting off the suck and hitting the checker maybe six feet ahead of carls office depot carl got caught behind cheeriosdamn himthen caught a gap and some sling action of his own but just couldnt overcome junior if it had been a five hundredlapplusthirtyfoot race hed have done it okay so its only one race the boys were all cheering all up and down volunteer parkway outside the gigantic speedway structure where the rug merchants all waited for a last shot at the johns and their families less sincerely the grumleys lurked waiting for their big moment whered usmc finish asked brother richard they havent read off the order yetwait here it is and caleb listened hard to his little radio in the darkness then he said fourth he finished fourth cool said brother richard a halfmile off the speedway was still a source of immense noise even with the engines finally turned off as the hot and smoky cars were rolled to their garages it was the roar of the tribe it was immense the nascar animal in full throat and above the stadium one could see the illumination not merely of the lights that made night racing possible but the thousands upon thousands of flashbulbs pricking off to record the moment when the young dale the junior took his trophy okay boys said the old man time to git er ready say a prayer for fortune if youre with me if you are a secret nonbeliever thats okay cause i will say a prayer for you and as i am close to him he will look out for you the boys began to prepare caleb quietly slipped under the table pulled two large plastic bins out and withdrew into the dark space made by the tent above and the revetment of water bottles behind there in privacy he removed two large constructions of metal the upper and the lower of a barrett caliber m expertly he fitted the two together finding the machined parts connected in the perfect joinery of the wellengineered pins secured the two units into one solid mechanism completed made whole it looked like a standard m assault rifle after six years in the gym the familiar lines where they should be but the whole thing amplified and extended thickened lengthened densified packed with strength and weight another grumleyhe couldnt see who in the darknesshanded him a heavy magazine with ten raufoss armor penetrators locked in and held tense under extreme spring tension he himself slid the heavy thing into the magazine well heard it click solidly as it found its place he drew the bolt back his great strength helping let it slip forward moving one of the quarterpound grain tungstencored big guys into the chamber and locked it all up and down the line the grumley boys were cowboying up most wore bulletproof vests and the guns were a motley of junky but effective third and fourth world subguns from various organized crime arsenals around the south plus some functional american junkers the inventory included a couple of swedish ks a couple of egyptian port saids clones of the k some beatup mks from small american manufacturers after the original s w variant which was itself a k clone an uzi a kickedtoshit west hurley thompson a fullauto ak with all the clicking and snapping as mags were locked in guns were cocked belts of spare mags were strapped on body armor was tightened and ratcheted shut it sounded like chickens eating walnuts on an aluminum floor but in a few seconds or so it was done we all set pap said caleb more or less the sergeant good you boys stay back there in the dark the crowds coming out now lord god almighty theres a vast sea of people and there was the first of about one hundred fifty thousand people slithered out of the speedway gates spread when they hit open air and fanned across the available ground it was an exodus from the church that was nascar and now these good folks had nowhere to go except back into the dreary real world and no way to get there except to take the slowmotion parade in the opposite direction of the afternoons slowmotion parade a few runners made it to their cars early began to pick their way out of the densely packed lots meanwhile seeming to materialize from nowhere the police in their yellowandwhite safety vests with their redlensed flashlights moved onto the roadway to govern or at least moderate the huge outflow of people and vehicles dust hung in the soft summer air shouts mostly of joy the clink of bottle on bottle the pop of cans being sprung to spew brew the friendly jostle of people of the same values the hum of insects drawn by the lights the acrid drift of cigarette and cigar smoke the occasional boastfulness of the young and dumb the wail of a tootired baby a whole human carnival of happy yet exhausted people in just a few minutes gridlock had set in so many cars so many folks so few roads honks filled the air but mostly the crowd had made peace with the ordeal of the egress in short order the lanes immediately in front of the piney ridge refreshment station were jammed with cars full of citizens bumper to bumper and door to door in either direction frozen solid the people in the cars unaware that a commando force heavily armed and full of aggression and craziness lurked just a few feet off in the shadows aint you folks gonna git a thrill in just a minute or so thought richard he was behind the skirmish line unarmed no reason for him to be up front and get himself shot up in the early rush he wouldnt venture out until the truck was taken down the guards either surrendered or murdered he licked his lips which were dry and his tongue was also dry he pulled a bottle of water out now warm popped the cap and slugged some down go easy brother richard you dont want to have to pull over for a piss in the middle of all this everybody laughed why cousin cletus if i do you hold em off while i empty the snake okay more laughter that richard what a joker the minutes dragged on the boys sat patiently a marlboro or lucky firing up in the darkness the drift of the smoke through the tented space i see her said the old man from out front yes sir here she comes trying to edge her way in richard saw it the vehicle technically called a cash in transit truck was a ford f probably from alpine the biggest of the uparmor specialty firms it wore a bank emblem on its flat sides and doors and was a boxy thing ten feet high and twentytwo long with the grace of a milk truck from the s blown up to be a parade float white it gleamed in the cascade of lights the rivets in their grid all over the damned thing cast tiny shadows so unlike the smooth skin and bright primaries of the civilian vehicles this big sluggish baby had texture its grill was a meshwork of slots that looked like but werent gun slits and if the thing was armored to the hilt at the highest upgrade it could withstand anythingexcept what the grumleys had prepared for it that night squared fenders a stout body everything acuteangled off vaultlike it was made to convey the impression of invincibility of a moving fortress atop the upgraded shocks and suspension richard could make out the two doomed drivers blandly sitting behind the threeinchthick windshield glass unaware that hell was about to arrive in spades the two men slouched like the others having made peace with the ordeal ahead and the big thing edged its way down the road from speedway headquarters to the merge with volunteer as it advanced waiting in a line to get in another line it edged ahead ever so damned slowly people poured around it sloshed around it some even clambering on its bumpers as they progressed the whole thing eerie in the brownish lights of the vapormercuries up above it demanded respect twice vehicles with better position moved aside to permit it entrance because it was in some sense magical but everything was rapidly collapsing into a phenomenon of lights with no one feature predominant because there were so many sources of illumination those mercvapors up top the lights from the cars in the various lines in the various lanes the bobbing strobes of the cop monitors the overhead fast movers that were affixed to various news helicopters and a police ship or two beams cut the air this way and thatwas it a lightsaber battle from star wars vii attack of the baptist killer redneck hellraising natural born killersand zones of illumination played on the surface of the clouds of dust or smoke that roiled heavily the whole thing punctuated by sounds of the america of cars kids squeals shouts taunts laughter in the scene the humans were insubstantial almost flickering ghosts and shadows damn said richard to nobody in particular is this a great country or what hell boys said caleb time to git some here he comes caleb you ready yes sir remember you move with purpose like youre doing what youre supposed to be doing remember not through the windows we need that bulletproof glass on the way up the hill yes sir pap i loves you son i loves all you boys you goddamned brave grumley boys we love you daddy brother richard i even love you reverend will you take a shower with me after this is over grumley laughter such a sinnerman said the old man now it was calebs move he stepped onto the roadway with the heavy lengthy weaponthirty pounds fiftyeight inches longand boldly walked across the lanes dipping in and out once waiting patiently as an suv full of kids pulled by two in the backseat bugeyed at the unbelievable image of a blond hulk in a heavy metal tshirt a razorbacks baseball hat plugs in his ears body armor clinging to his upper torso and six feet of the gunliest gun ever made in his hands but no one could really put it together he seemed calm because he was calm he got right up close to the sluggishly moving f at almostpointblank range the muzzle three feet from the steel door the guards looking lazily not around but up the road at the jammedup lanes of cars and their blinking onagain offagain brake lights that yawned before them and then caleb fired thirtythree vern removed the girl from the bedroom with an insincere smile to her cowed family and took her into the bathroom he sat down on the toilet his arm draped across her shoulders the door was closed now sweetie i dont like this she said her eyes looking nervously around now sweetie you just calm down does vern look like a man who could hurt a cute little thing like hannah ng please dont hurt me sweetie i would never hurt you in fact to relax i want you to think about ice cream whats your favorite flavor i dont know i cant think strawberry mine too now what do you do with a nice big pink strawberry ice cream the girl had shut her eyes he held her by the arm you lick it isnt that what you do he forced her to her knees you lick it nice and hard ummm good now hannah lets pretend we got us a nice ice cream right here right now lets go called ernie from the living room damn vern leaned down and gave the little asian girl a kiss on the cheek ill be back for you we got some fun ahead he raced through the apartment out the open sliding doors crossed the lawn and caught up with his cousin just as ernie hit the parking lot they slipped between cars and vern saw ahead of him two men coming down the building steps on the other side of the parking lot lit in the glow of the stairwell who the hell was the other guy too bad for him hes dead too he indexed his finger above the trigger guard of his glock for fast application and he and ernie described a straight line on the interception of the two targets who heading on the oblique were obviously going to a car somewhere farther down in the lot didnt matter was easy them boys didnt know a thing didnt have a prayer or a hope bang bang itd be over he watched them as everything seemed to accelerate in time noting one was the lanky grayheaded older guy a mr swagger pap said who had been their quarry so many times before and who pap said killed carmody and bj the other a beefier guy police beef in a suit with a thatch of hair who was talking into a phone the grumleys had their guns out but the rule was get close as you can then get closer get close enough to touch get close enough so missing isnt on the table shoot em fast in the guts shoot em down then lean over em for the head shot blow their brains out shoot your gun empty then get the hell out of town it was happening now it was happening fast his gun came up his finger flew to trigger it was so easy they picked up their speed on the unsuspecting marks almost running now look out came a cry from behind theyre killers look out it was a young girls voice as they raced down the stairwell nick held a slight lead and bob could hear him talking urgently into his cell officer this is special agent nick memphis fbi fed id lancer youve got to patch me through to the speedway command center whoevers in charge we believe theres going to be a robbery assault at your location no no ive got swat operators inbound from knoxville but itll be a time before theyre on scene this is a heavy tenfiftytwo by an armed team maybe with automatic weapons all units should be alert and ready to move on the sound of the gunfire somewhere in the speedway vicinity please patch me through to your command center and i will need airborne transportation to the site and need a rendezvous point and they cleared the building slid through the darkness to nicks car though bob didnt know which one it was and seemed almost to be on the run when bob heard a voice from across the way screaming look out theyre killers look out in that same second he saw two hunched men rushing at him guns out guns upfront a gun flashed there was no noise but the brightness of the muzzle flash displayed the urgent mug of a handsomeugly guy and bob knew nick was hit stricken he muttered an animal noise lost a step and all rhythm and was struggling for his own gun it happened fast faster by far than the speed of coherent thought faster almost than the pulse rate that was in any event suspended by blood chemicals and each of the four at close range in the dark devolved into creatures of instinct and training and the victory would go to the one with the best instinct and the most training the determining factor was distance up close skill counted for nothing but at ten feet out in the dark it wasnt just who shot fast but who shot best who had the knack to hit movers in bad light on the fly bobs hand flew at a speed which could never be known or measured so fast that he himself had no sense of it happening he just knew that the kimber super was locked in his fist his elbow locked against his side his wrist stiff the weird maybe autistic brainfreak in his head solving the complexities of target identification acquisition alignment that had been the gift of the swagger generations since the beginning his muscles tight all except the trigger finger whichyou get this about ten thousand repetitions into your shooting programflew torqueless and true as it jacked back slipped forward to reset then jacked back again four times all without disturbing the set of the gun in his hand brass bubbles flew through the air as spent shells pitched by the mach speed of the flying slide as it cycled all four within an inch or three of the others and bob put four super corbons into the centermass of the fellow closest to him who immediately changed his mind about killing nick fired bobs opponent fired finally but into the ground the man on nick fired twice more from a smallish silver handgun though crazily and bob vectored in on him and fired three more times in that superfast zone that seems to defy all rational laws of physics the night was rent by flash from afar it must have looked like a photo opportunity as a beautiful star entered a nightclub the air filling with incandescence the smell of something burned and the noise lost in the hugeness of all outdoors but it was just the worlds true oldest profession which is killers killing it was over in less than two seconds bob dumped his notquiteempty mag slammed a new fresh one in and blinked to clear his eyes of strobe then looked for targets the guy he hit second was down flat arms and legs akimbo his silver revolver three or four feet away weirdly gleaming in the dark from a random beam of light the other fellow hit first was not down but he had dropped his gun he walked aimlessly about holding his stomach and screaming daddy i am so sorry bob watched as he went to a big car and settled next to it his face resting on the bumper the lack of rigidity in the body posture told the story bob knelt to nick hit bad partner ah christ said nick can you believe this no but it sure happened im looking i dont see no blood on your chest he hit me in the leg stupid fucker oh christ what a mess by this time people had come to their balconies and looked down upon the fallen men call an ambulance please this officer is hit we are police yelled bob but in seconds another man had arrived a smallish indian with a medical bag i am dr gupta he said the ambulance has been called can i help hes hit in the leg i dont think its life threatening not a spurting artery the doctor bent over quickly ripped the seam of nicks suit pants with scissors and revealed a single wound about an inch inboard on his right thigh maybe offcenter enough to have missed bone the wound did not bleed profusely but persistently it was an ugly mangled hole muscles puckered and torn bad news for weeks or months but maybe not years tie said the doctor bob quickly unlooped nicks tie and handed it to the doctor who wrapped it into a tourniquet above the wound knotted it off then pulled out and cracked open a box removed a traumadex squeeze applicator and squirted a dusting of the clotting agent on the wound to stop the blood flow dont know when the ambulance will arrive in all this traffic can you give him something for pain no no said nick i am all right wheres that damned phone oh shit we cant get a chopper in here oh christ i need to you aint going nowhere said bob except the er oh christ said nick i hope they got my message but even as he said it he knew it was hopeless as did bob the shooters would bring their weapons to bear the cops were strung out the situation was a mess nobody would know a thing it was ill get there said bob how you cant my daughters bike its over there i can ramrod through the traffic ive got some firepower i know where theyre going i can intercept them at the hill put some lead on them maybe stop them from that chopper pickup swagger you cant but then he stopped okay said bob who then you see anybody else around you want these lowlife fucks to get away with this thing and the contempt it shows for all law enforcement for civilians for anything that gets in the way you see anyone else here but there wasnt anybody else around funny there never was here nick finally said maybe thisll stop the cops from shooting you he reached into his shirt and pulled out a badge on a chain around his neck this makes you officially fbi and there goes my career good luck oh jesus you dont have to do this sure why not said bob i got nothing better to do itll be my kind of fun bob threw the chain around his neck so that the badge hung in the center of his chest signifying for the first time since his official righteousness he rose walked through the gathered crowd he walked across the parking lot to his car but next to it came across the curious scene of a vietnamese family standing in a semicircle around the gunman who had fallen against the bumper of his red cadillac one of them was a pretty young girl in a hannah montana tshirt you yelled the warning he asked yes they were in our apartment all day scaring my family to death horrible men monsters can on co em co that gan da va su can dam cua co da cuu sinh mang chung toi he said she smiled he walked to his car popped the trunk he withdrew the dpms rifle and inserted a magazine with twentyeight rounds he looped its sling held by a single cinch diagonally across his body so that the gun was down across his front with enough play to allow him to get it either to shoulder or a prone position he looked at the monitor atop it that eotech thing that looked like a s spacecadet toy figured out which of several buttons turned it on so that if he had to do it in the dark hed know which one to use he threw on the vest julie had provided in which hed inserted in dedicated mag pouches the other nine magazines all full with ammo slamming the trunk he walked back to the stairwell where nikkis bike rested under a tarp he ripped the canvas free and climbed aboard the kawasaki shit the pain in his hip from kondo isamis last cut flared hard and red but he tried not to notice it he turned the key to electrify the bike it took three or four kicks to gin the thing to life but he saw that he had plenty of fuel he heeled up the stand lurched ahead kicked it into gear pulled into the lot evaded the gawkers and took off into the night running hard disappearing quickly nick his leg throbbing but feeling no pain watched him go lone gunman he thought remembering lawrences words defining the american spirit hard stoic isolate and a killer but on the night of thunder so necessary thirtyfour the muzzle flash of the barrett was extraordinary a ball of fire that bleached the details from the night so bright that it set bulbs popping in eyes for minutes caleb who was holding it under his shoulder like a gangsters tommy gun felt the heavy surge of the recoil as the weapon rocked massively against his muscle almost knocking him from his feet while at the same moment fierce blowback from the point of impact lashed against his face without glasses hed have burned out his eyes the muzzle blast expanding radially at light speed ripped up a cyclone of dust from the earth beneath it seemed a tornado had briefly touched down filling the air with substance the grain bullet hit the steel door two inches below the window frame blowing a halfinchsize gaper and leaving a smear of burnt steel peeling away from the actual crater it took both driver and assistant driver down spewing a foam of blood on the far window inside the cab after the tungsten core liberated from the center of the bullet by the secondary detonation flew onward at several thousand miles per hour and ripped them apart jesus christ said caleb himself awestruck and even a little nonplused by the carnage he had unleashed the rear the rear screamed the old man caleb lumbered around behind the truck with the heavy weapon in his hands locked under his shoulder as the grumleys fanned out to surround the vehicle while at the same time gesturing with their submachine guns to frozen passengers in the jammed cars to abandon ship and run like hell gwan git the hell out of here git them kids out of here theres going to be a lot of goddamned shooting caleb closed his eyes fired one more time point blank into the rear of the truck from dead six oclock he even remembered to crouch and hoist the weight to orient the gun at a slight upward angle so that the tungsten rod it flung wouldnt continue forward exit the end of the armored box shred the dash and end up chewing the bejesus out of the engine that would have been a mess again the fireball blinded any who happened to observe the discharge from within a hundred yards though most civilians had abandoned their cars and were running en masse in the opposite direction again the muzzle blast unleashed a cyclone of atmospheric disturbance again the recoil was formidable even if slightly dissipated by the give in calebs arms and body as he elasticized backward from the blow this time for some reason the noise was present in force and caleb even with ear plugs in felt his eardrums cave under pressure of the blast a crater ruptured the upper half of the rear door a grumley leaned close and yelled into the hole almost as if there were a chance in hell anyone inside could hear you boys best open up or hell fire six more in there there was a moment then the door unlatched two uniformed men with darkened faces from the blast their own blood streaming from ear and nose someone elses splattered randomly about them eyes unseeing for the brightness staggered out fightless and dazed instantly the grumleys were on them disarmed them and shoved them to one side of the road where they collapsed and crawled to a gully to try and forget the horror of what they had just seenthe third member of their crew whod evidently taken a full injection of flying tungsten frontally vaporizing the upper half of his body his legs and lower torso lay on the floor like the remains of a scarecrow blown down and scattered by a strong wind the plastic bags of baled cash stacked on racks now wore a bright dappling of his viscera damn thang means business a grumley said go go boys git going no goddamned lollygagging shouted the old man a kind of cheerleader amazingly animated and liberated by the violence watch for them coppers a grumley took up a position at each of the four compass points around the truck the idea was to try and locate approaching police through the lines of cars and engage them far away because with their handguns the cops couldnt bring effective fire from that range meanwhile other grumleys set about their business one dragged the second half of poor officer unlucky out of the truck and dumped him another flew to the bags and began to pull out the ones containing change which he dragged out and dumped no need for extra weight on the upcoming hill now it was richards turn tire guys go go get it done he shouted and as they had so often practiced a grumley team of three hit the rear axle of the vehicle got the heavy powerjack underneath and with swift focused strength jerked the thing atilt meanwhile from roadside two heavy tires with offroad treads meant to bite and tear at the earth in maximum tractorpull traction trundled out driven by grumley power to the site of the armored truck and the changing commenced richard raced to the engine with his trick bag not looking at the cab not wanting to see what remained of the crew hed let grumley minions clear that mess out a grumley struggled against the locked hood then fired a blast of tracer into it the bullets tore and bounced and in seconds had reduced the metal to tatters so that the hood could be lifted and hoisted high richard set to work as flashlights beamed onto the chugging complexities of the engine he waited till a grumley turned it off and it went still it was exactly as he expected a cat stroke diesel producing around horsepower which is why the big truck would always move sluggishly underpowered for the extra weight of the armor quickly he plunged into the nest of wires found the map sensor disconnected it and reconnected the xzillaraider wire harness plug and play was the principle as the grumleys held the flashlights his fingers flew to the right wires cut them and quickly and expertly clipped in the new wires he grounded the assembly this time taking the time to unscrew the negative terminal carefully wrap the grounding wire against the plug then rescrew the cable terminal making sure everything was nice tidy and tight he paid no attention to what was going on around him and so maximized was his concentration that he missed the crash of a helicopter brought down by caleb then he leapt back to the rear of the engine compartment pulled a knife and cut through the rubber grommet and stuffed the wire harness through into the cab ugh now the unpleasantness when he got to the fs cab however the bodies were gone and some grumley with a thoughtful touch had thrown a wad of nascar tshirts on the blood and flesh matter that the mk had blown loose from the drivers it wasnt so bad no hearts or lungs or heads lay about it only looked like several gallons of raspberry sorbet had melted he got to work linking the harness of wires to the xzillaraider module he quickly wired the unit to the fuse box then slid behind the wheel paying no attention to the three gunshots that ricocheted weirdly off the threeinch glass leaving a smear nor to the fact that the whole scene appeared to be lit by an orange glow as the crashed helicopter blazed brightly in the middle of nascar village under normal circumstances who would not stare at an aviation disaster such as that one but these werent normal circumstances and richard was much more fascinated by the blink sequence on the module yep as he turned the key the lights went through their positions and ended up in the red of high power he turned to see the reverend a peacemaker in his hand and a cowboy hat on his head and brother richard said when the tires are finished old man we are good to go while richard worked the old man had been commanding grumley defenses his gunners peered threesixty looking for targets and when a poor police officer approached on foot illuminated by his traffic safety jacket a grumley put a burst of mm tracer into him the tracers were a wonderful idea they made manifest the strength and invincibility of the pap grumley firepower pap watched as a sleek streak of mils raced down the corridor between abandoned cars struck the poor officer who had not even drawn his pistol and flattened him those that missed their targets spanged off the cars on either side pitched skyward into the night air hootchie mama it was the fourth of july it was jubilee it was hell come to earth fire brimstone the whole goddamned armageddon thing good shooting he yelled thatll keep their damned heads down then someone poked him in the ribs and he looked down and saw a black hole in the lapel of his powder blue wah ming chow custom suit fortunately the armored vest underneath stopped the bullet but it meant some cop had fired from nearby up on the hill to the right over there he commanded and two grumleys put out a blaze of noon light in the form of a halfmag apiece if they got the cop or not nobody could say but the bullets sure chewed the hell out of an suv in line to get out of a parking lot fortunately for all concerned it had been long abandoned and so if anyone died it would only have been a copper the sound of shots rang out everywhere as grumleys on the perimeter either saw or thought they saw policemen slithering closer and answered with long probing bursts of tracer now and then something caught fire including the rear of a winnebago a souvenir stand whose supply of ts and ball caps went up in flames a propane heater for a barbecue stand these small disasters added yet more hellish illumination to flicker across the already incredible scene part monster movie the citizens flee the beast part war movie the noise the tracers the screams of the wounded and part nascar documentary the tire crew operates at top speed well choreographed and rehearsed as the grumley tire team having gotten one of the offroad tires rigged switched sides of the f and went hard to work on the other but then a new source of illumination shocked all the grumleys with its relentless quality it was a harsh beam of light from a state police helicopter thirty feet up and fifty yards out catching everything in high remorseless relief drop your firearms came the amplified order you are covered drop your firearms and caleb take er down yelled the old man pap you sure its copper boy they about to fire got it caleb set up the barrett on the hood of an abandoned car next to the f he shouldered the weapon for the first time drew it tight to him and put his eye to the scopehe had no idea but it happened to be a superb schmidt bender x tactical modeland in a second as he adjusted his eye to the focal length saw the black shape of the helicopter behind the blazing radiance of the light which was quadrisected by the cross hairs of the scope he fired the gun kicked so hard it broke his nose ow fuck he screamed thinking wouldnt want to do that again goddammit he put a grain mk into the helicopter right through the engine nacelle and the bird climbed upward abruptly as the pilot realized he was under heavy fire but then all his linkages went and from aircraft the thing alchemized into sheer weight beyond the influence of anything except gravity and it simply fell from the air straight down into nascar village nose forward there it hit its rotors chawing up a circle of dust from every bite it seemed to die like an animal for a few seconds still and broken and then it exploded an incredibly bright oily napalmesque fourthousanddegree burn it lit the scene like day exposing the fleeing masses the fallen and trampled the occasional crouching police officer popping away ineffectively with a handgun from two hundred yards out then the glare dulled and subsided and all detail was lost thatll keep them boys far away yelled the old man id like to git me another pap said caleb you just wait on it son goddamn them other birds is far away and it was true for a mile out a number of choppers had settled into orbit tires done yelled a grumley richard we are set to rock out of here okay yelled richard from the cab git the boys aboard all that want to come time to go fellas with that the grumleys descended upon the f that is the armed grumleys the tire boys had been well prepped and knew there wasnt enough room aboard for all of them instead they moseyed to the edge of the cone of light and there in darkness peeled off armored vests put on new baseball hats and melted off into the trees there were a few grumley cars hidden in outlying spots to which theyd have no trouble proceeding and would rendezvous later for their split of the swag but now it was left to richard and the shooters to get the load out of there richard in neutral rode the pedal as his gunmen jumped aboard pap climbed into the other seat four minutes he said looking at his watch by god we are ahead of schedule dont think weve taken a wound much less a kill and nothing left to do but to drive on out of here richard let them boys shoot at us all they want aint going do no damage richard shifted from neutral gunned ahead battered the car in front away until he had maneuver room he turned the truck found an angle between two abandoned cars pinning him on his right and smashed between them they fought the strength of his vehicle the clang of vibrations loosened everyones dentures the metal screamed but the cars yielded to the pumpedup cit vehicle freed he turned left rode the shoulder for fifty feet then turned right down an access road toward the speedway this road took him to a bridge over a gully and he pulled across it before him pristine but not quite deserted lay the heart of the kingdom the confluence of courage for sale engineering genius soap opera family feud grudge redemption and failure along with hats and shirts and signed portraits the trailers turned to shops the industrial pavilions the souvenir and bricabrac outlets the beer joints and the cash machines that were nascar village it was the only thing between them and the mountain a mile away thirtyfive swagger had no trouble at first and raced through the streets of bristol skewing and fishtailing around curves zipping in and out of the traffic as most people were off the streets or if in their cars intent on the racing news that had turned into robbery news but the traffic began to thicken as he got through downtown and headed out the volunteer parkway toward the speedway and the civic disaster that engulfed it signs of the disaster were everywhere as he buzzed at eighty down the road it seemed that signal lights pulsed from every direction and the traffic soon began to coalesce into something dense and motionless he diverted to the shoulder but found that congested with fleeing citizens he veered back onto the roadway and found the lane between jammed cars also impenetrable because of the panicked crowd he pulled up looking for an alternate route from the mess of fleeing civilians and abandoned cars that solidified the parkway before him when a cop on foot materialized from nowhere and started screaming buddy get that goddamn thing out of here do you know whats but then bob offered him the magic talisman of the fbi badge and the mans eyes slid quickly to the assault rifle bob wore crosswise down the front of his body and his eyes bugged you got an update bob said well its a real bad tenfiftytwo lots of shots fired officers down all over the place they got some kind of cannon or can you get through to command on that thing he indicated the radio unit pinned to the mans lapel its a mess i can try okay tell them fbi recommends they get their swat units to the mountain overlooking the speedway theyre going to try to take that truck up there and go out by helicopter what truck its an armoredcar job they want to take all the baled cash to mexico or wherever and anybody who gets in their way gets shot up now make the call sir we cant move nobody in there now its a mess with thousands of civilians in the immediate and we cant get through em are there secondary routes to the mountain not really lots of little streets but nothing straight that aint jammed with cars okay advise swat to get as close as possible then move out on foot its the only way now someone has to intercept them and i dont see anybody around so it looks like its me you tell me my next move youre it youre the whole fbi a guy on a bike better yet an old guy on a bike we have people incoming by chopper im advised look were wasting time how do i get to that mountain up aheads no good okay sir id fight my way down volunteer best as possible too bad you dont have a siren on that thing i liberated it from a civilian you go down and about a mile before the speedway youll hit groverdale road you leftturn on that follow it to something called cedarwood circle you can cut through somebodys yard there and you want to find shady brooks drive its not much but it curls around behind some houses that have probably given their yards up to parking and thatll take you alongside the hill before it heads back to the parkway you may want to leave the road when youre next to the mountain as im thinking theres nothing up there except fields and stuff and maybe you can move faster im guessing thats the only clear way got it you want my body armor thanks officer i dont have time when this is over ill have to cite you for no helmet and driving off roadways you do that mr hooverll pay the fine who never mind son you get on that squawk box and try and get swat where i told you yes sir good hunting special agent thanks with that bob spurted ahead trying to ease his way between fleeing citizens at last finding a fairly clear path between cars on the wrong side of the road he never got into third gear up ahead the disaster played out it seemed all the squad cars in the world were on the perimeter while the sky above was filled with the lights of orbiting choppers he became aware of glare against the darkness which could only signify something burning hot eating up aviation fuel and that stench seemed in the air as well he could hear no shots because of the sound of the engine and now and then a hardmoving foot patrolman would try to wave him down and get him out of there but the fbi badge made these phantoms depart at last he hit groverdale which took him down a road lined with modest houses where each homeowner had turned his land over to parking use the rate he saw from the remaining signs was a hundred dollars a night most people had been glad to pay it and now most of them were in cars caught in a thermal stew of light dust exhaust cigarette smoke and body odor the cars locked bumpertobumper but bob made pretty good progress just along the edge of the shoulder where the road dissolved into grass and the walkers had moved up a bit giving him room he found himself in a bright culdesac where the illumination blocked out all sense of what lay beyond he had a sense possibly from a new dead quality to the echoes possibly from the imposition of a kind of dampness on the sultry air of a mountain a huge green obstacle close at hand between the houses he could see glimpses of nascar village jiggles of flame and everywhere it seemed emergency service vehicles trying to penetrate the gridlock of wreckage but hopelessly behind the curve unaware of what was happening to whom he thought it was better he had no radio contact with any of this for the network would have been a crazed blur of garbled facts glaring misinterpretations wrong advice command ego reluctance it was like radio traffic during a big attack in that far off fairyland called vietnam all but forgotten these days but still the crucible that burned in bob and made him the man he was he cut between two houses almost putputting along riding the throttle grip and clutch grip and the gears between first and second really defying the bikes true nature which was to rush ahead faster and faster he skidded found himself in a backyard where folks clustered around a radio and looked at him fearfully a shotgun or two seemed to come his direction fbi he yelled holding up the badge which way to the fight a fellow in bermudas with a beer in one hand and a remington in the other gestured onward the direction he was headed you go get em he screamed let me finish this beer and ill be right behind youd best sit this one out sir you need to protect wife and family and inlaws yes sir said the guy settling into a lawn chair fbi with a machine gun on a kawasaki in my back yard goddamn aint i seen everything now bob lurched ahead through a line of bushes into another back yard the bike grinding and chawing through a garden threading between houses he found himself on a stillnarrower roadthis had to be shady brooks drive which was really only wide enough for one car and which was jammed with them all going the way bob wasnt but there was room on the shoulder and he got all the way up into third for a while at last running free of cars then he saw why the road wound back to the right toward the parkway toward nascar village itself and that small metropolis now blazed like london in the blitz something had ramrodded through it strewing wreckage and ruin everywhere but bob saw clearly that proceeding in this direction would prove nothing for it would take him only where his enemies had been he looked to the left saw trees in pale illumination and saw that it had to be the base of the mountain his thought now was to run the edge of the incline and see if he could cut trail and where the boys had gone up follow them it seemed to take forgoddamnedever he couldnt run full outthe way was tough and he had to wiggle this way and that offroad and around natural obstacles he couldnt see far enough ahead to make any speed at all and though the land looked flat it yielded up a bumpiness concealed in the height of the grass he came at last to some sort of installation in the lee of the mountain a complex of corrugated tin buildings sealed off by cyclone fence its approach from some other angle he prowled around the perimeter and came upon a gate that had been smashed in no lawman had made it this far he pulled open the gate found himself at last on level roadway and followed the tracks of a heavy vehicle with borntoraisehell treads on the tires that had churned its way back beyond the buildings at last he found an archway in the trees where a muchdisturbed dirt road and dust in the air signified the recent passing of a major vehicle the road had to lead up bob circled backtracked a hundred or so yards then gunned his engine and jumped gears he hit the road in a fishtail of spewed mud slithered around a boulder penetrated heavy woods and began the stark upward climb his bike fighting the mud below and the gravity that pulled it backward thirtysix brother richard paused for a second feeling the thrill of the moment feeling the low hum of vibration running from the amped diesel to his foot on the pedal feeling his fingers in barest contact with the truck through the wheel feeling all the million little tingles of tremor and jiggle and bounce that signified a vehicle with a load a lot of fuel and a wide open road richard boy goddamn times a wasting said the reverend no no just look for a second look at it now to fix it in your mind what you talkin about boy all this here dont matter a frogs fart just get us to the mountain it matters to me old man he smiled turned and looked at the old man and the reverend saw for the first time how insane richard was he swallowed the driver was one twisted visitor from beyond pluto with his superiority his mechanical and driving genius and now this his weird and furious insistence of enjoying the ride as if it were sex richard winked remember slim pickens in strangelove what the hell the boy talking about the reverend thought this was crazyman talk remember yeehaw the ride down to armageddon the sheer joy of it all well old man its yeehaw time richard punched it with a lurch even its toughenedup shocks couldnt soften the heavy cash truck surged forward first up was some sort of jack daniels tent the center of which was a huge construct of whiskey bottles and cases richard aimed and hit dead zero he felt the flimsy canvas yield without a whisper devoured by the roaring bull of the truck and the whiskey bottles shattered in a spew of brownish chaos asparkle with the light blown this way and that by the big vehicles velocity it was a whiskey explosion he emerged from the mess with a truck bathed in eightyproof jack good for curing colds relieving virgins of their burden burying grudges or exposing them as well as causing the ruin of many good men of high birth and low and being a boon companion on a long flight through lightning richard goddamn boy you just git us to the hill dont you be smashing things but richard had another agenda and the reverend now saw that this thing here this gloryrun through the civilization that was nascar this was the point see them feathers fly richard shouted eyes lit by the glare of superego blitzed on brain chemicals well they shouldnta run he was truly insane particularly to the narrow mind of alton grumley who didnt realize richard was channeling bo hopkins from the first shootout in the wild bunch nor that he had morphed into both holden and borgnine lets go he said then he answered himself why not and let a little sliver of psychos giggle escape just as borgnines dutch had in that movie all those years ago richard richard we dont have the time richard then hit the pedestal on which an orange toyota camry daytona subvariant was mounted twenty feet above all as part of toyotas very polished pavilion he didnt hit it straight on it was more of a glancer the point being to knock the car to the ground in this humble desire he succeeded and the sleek vehicle pitched nose first into the mud then toppled like a flipped turtle onto its back richard continued his war on the japanese by clipping the corner of the toyota structure a piece of airportlike architecture meant to suggest the future and his blow was so well considered that half of the roof went down shattering glass and burying display cars in rubble inside he accelerated took out this or that little place the details were unimportant to him saw people flee before him in both terror and glee andoh boy fun fun fun till daddy took the tbird awayfound himself lined up perfect deadon zero angle for the concourse of driver retail outlets those trailertruck souvenir shops where each of the big guys had heroic portraiture replica clothing ball caps leathers books and related vanities on sale richard revved the truck enjoying himself it was here he noted with amusement a certain base human truth it was not he alone who looked upon the organization of commerce the standardization of currency the capitalist system and had a violent impulse to destroy it all he liked to crush things sure but so did lots of americans yep and it seemed that there were hundreds maybe thousands watching him the moms and the kids and the old guys had fled not the young ones the key nascar demographic of fourteen to thirtysix southern male employed tattooed at least three smoker drinker carouser fighter these guys in the thousands had somehow sensed that a show was about to begin can you hear it old man richard asked the reverend could it was soft a murmur at first but it picked up the chant go go go until it became go go go and richard was nothing if he wasnt the fellow who knew how to play to a crowd he punched the roar rose the windshield blurred with speed then jolted with impact after impact pitching this way then that tossing stuff through the air either whole or in many pieces he fishtailed and jackrabbited his way in a perfect hightest zigzag of destruction hitting and smashing the truck trailers which yielded by tipping or jumping or simply collapsing in shame in thirty loud seconds drivers row looked like battleship row after the first wave of japanese dive bombers for good measure samurai richardsan pounded the snot out of a cash machine at the end of the formation and dollars flew everywhere richard heard the cheer of the crowd he looked in his side mirror and was saddened to see that he had started no fires though hed knocked down some electric wires and they bled sparks in a few places dangerous and beautiful and spectacular at once then suddenly one of them ignited something and the fire rose and leaped at least on one half of drivers row and soon enough flames consumed a great many of the battered retail installations damn that was good do it git better richard my poor grumleys in the back they aint got no seatbelt their heads are too hard for injury you cant hurt a grumley by hitting him in the skull but okay lets go he came next to a little bridge across a gully initially cut off by traffic blocks set in the earth but a less important grumley job had been to wander down there during the race itself and pull them out richard rumbled across the bridge pulled up an incline and came again to flatness and temptation now the speedway was half a mile behind him the mountain half a mile before him and the structures on this side of the gully less substantial go richard shouted the old man this wouldnt be as fun it was all tickytack tents and ramshackle leantos all of it held together by aluminum and canvas and tape and twine representing the lower end of the nascar money pyramid not corporate power but scavenging entrepreneurial nomadism ho hum said richard dont think nothingll burn or electrify sorry to say richard you dont got to narrate everthing this aint a damn movie oh it is old man youre tommy lee jones avuncular and charming but now old and weary im the mean kevin costner not the sensitive kevin caleb is marky mark and maybe somewhere theres a hero wholl bring us down but clint retired and nobody took his place so i dont think so after these important comments richard finally consented to do his job and roared through the lesser precincts of nascar with much less pizzaz as if hed grown bored having the attention span of a gnat it was just snap crackle and pop as the flimsy structures were eaten alive by the power of the cash in transit truck and no pile of hats or chinese confederate flags or funnel cakes or barbecued ribs and sausages could stand against the onrush beer exploded tables of goods were splattered tents billowed as their ropes were cut signs fell but it lacked the fx grandeur of the previous few minutes work as spectacle it had fallen his esthetic sense somewhat blunted he glumly soldiered on but as tactical enterprise the genius of the plan soon became evident there simply was no way any fourwheeled vehicle could have followed them because richard left behind him so much more damage than had been there before and whether or not planned the dynamic of the crowd ebbing this way and that opening before him then solidifying behind him precluded penetration then too of the few roads around nascar village all were impenetrable because all were jammed with civilians headed out not in many of those people had abandoned their cars upon seeing the panicked crowd and hearing stories of machine guns armed guerrillas terrorists klansmen militia so in the vast mess only the armored truck had any maneuverability purely on the strength of its ruthlessness it could and would drive through anything it could and had driven down anybody it was without conscience a moby dick on land or a godzilla or a beast from twenty thousand fathoms that regarded humanity as insects to be crushed it was just diesel nihilism on four tires driven by venality and psychopathology and the fury of sons whod disappointed their fathers and it was unstoppable richard drove on he flattened folks danced in delight some throwing beer bottles at him not so much to stop him but to participate in the wanton pleasure of the evening now and then a police bullet sounded a pitiful ping as it bounced off the heavy armor but failed to penetrate at the far end the anticlimax arrived with a whimper richard found a dirt road that led to a gated installation in the lee of the mountain built up some nice speed and fragmented the cyclone gate with his ford cyclone and roared along the edge of the mountain which presented itself to him as an incline swaddled in trees there tis shouted the old man and indeed up ahead an archway in the trees revealed a dark portal behind which lay the serpentine of a switchbacked track to the top glistening with perpetual mud from a dozen mountain springs its existence all but forgotten a relic left over from logging days heres where you earn all that goddamn money we done paid you think theres a man in america who could get a rig this heavy up a road this steep and sharp well there aint but one and he took the pikes peak hill climb three times running and some other uphills as well and has done the trick on bikes and gocarts and destructo jalopies and tractors and bigdaddy trucks and hell even a kiddie cart or two youd best have it boy hang on grandpappy the elevator is reading up he plunged ahead a lesser man would have wept not caleb his shattered nose blossomed blood and he felt like a piece of popped corn in a corn popper floating this way and that a hard trick with a thirtypound rifle in his hands goddamn him that sumbitch gonna whip his ass screamed another flying grumley immediately before hitting the goddamned wall or sharp shelf or any of the dozens of hard surfaces inside the box the fucking little prick he doin this cause he thinks hes special its his little trick on us poor dumb grumleys he thinks we aint human it was in other words no fun in the box the five boys each were made clumsy by submachine guns their body armor their spare magazines the darkness the claustrophobia it was like a submarine undergoing a depthcharge raid by the japanese they were tossed this way then that without visibility on top of that shrapnel in the form of thirtypound bales of bills in tamperevident plastic bags flew around the interior like really heavy pillows they fucking hurt when they hit you and they could hit you at any time from any angle then there was a lunch box or two maybe a few cans of diet coke and who knew what else afly in the dark atmosphere of the steel box and though the shocks supporting it were thick and strong they did little to protect against the vicissitudes of crumple and crunch that richard produced as he wreaked vengeance on nascar for the crime of being nascar back here a hero was needed a man of strength but these were grumleys greeddriven and sensation hungry the brains scientifically bred out of them so they had no hero no calm voice took over and soothed not even calebs as that unhappy warrior simply sat as still as possible clutching the huge barrett trying to breathe through blood while dreaming of driving the barretts butt into richards strange disguised head and watching it shatter the rest got through the ordeal of the ride on the strength of their considerable sheer meanness their similar hunger to pulp richard when the day was done and dreams of swag and whores and drugs and other cool grumley things it was dialogue it was not oration still less a lecture and least of all some kind of pontification no it was chat conversation attention to nuance cooperation and teamwork this is how you climb a hill that doesnt want to be climbed in a big vehicle that doesnt want to climb it richard listened and talked with the components of the adventure he felt the traction in each tire not a chorus but the voice of each as the expression of a personality he felt the play between torque and transmission even in the crude containment of the automatic gear shift as these two dynamisms bartered their way through the complex transaction he felt the tremble of vibes from the shocks the subtler orchestration of announcements from the enhanced diesel as the xzillaraider had blown out the parameters of the performance package and the diesel fuel burned hot and long and fierce turning its own chambers a molten red threatening to go volcanic at any second on top of that through the imperfect vision cones of the illuminating headlights richard read the curves finding the ideal line in each read the texture of the mud in the road divining where its gelid smoothness contained strength and where only watery treachery he sensed which logs could be crushed which knocked aside and which still strong had to be avoided it was a complex negotiation and he was right that few men in the world could have done it and few would have wanted to it seemed to take forever and richard at a certain point felt his muscles locked against the wheel as if the wheel was the enemy and the addition of his human strength could make a difference he cued himself to relax and felt the iron melt from his neck though bathed in sweat he felt at last a kind of relaxation because it occurred to him that that which he feared mosta sucking pool of mud that would engulf him to above the hubcapswould not befoul him jesus christ said the old man i think you done it boy i think we going to make it the truck broke from gnarled mythic wood into a kind of grassy meadow and it suddenly occurred to richard that there was no more hill to climb he brought the truck to a stop he opened the door and almost fell out limp with exhaustion spent and wasted and hungry for vacation he sucked coolish air felt coolish air against his brow he looked saw stars pinwheels of ancient energy dancing light years off jesus what a fucking thing we here boy we done it sang the old guy from behind came an outpouring of grumleys as the boys liberated themselves and had a moment of pure bliss they were on top of the world ma were on top of the world from hating richard they flew to loving him richard had never been so admired in his life he felt like a rock star as hard grumley hands pounded him on the back okay boys you git that dough on the roof yelled the old man and then turned to speak on the cell tom get that bird in and get us the hell out of here time to go home as behind him the grumleys set about to move the money bales to the roof of the truck so that they could be tossed into the hovering chopper richard moseyed off a few yards and came to a vantage on what he had done he looked down from a thousand feet on the vast structure of the speedway and the nascar civilization that had spread forth and put roots down upon the plains he saw wreckage he saw fire he saw a thousand emergency service vehicles spitting out goobers of red light he saw smoke drifting this way and that in the wind he saw the crushed the broken the smashed the atomized he saw pain disbelief destruction disaster he saw the beast wounded he felt in himself an insane pride in the ruination sure you could have detonated a bomb like some arab boyfucker or opened up with a glock like a sad sick korean kid or any of another dozen methods of highoctane takedown but to drive through it to smash and grind and pulp and express the ultimate contempt in traction and horsepowersay that was pretty fucking cool it was so sinnerman he felt a sense of profound fulfillment fuck em if they cant take a joke but then he heard it they all heard it the sound of a motorcycle as it churned up the same hill theyd just mounted its the goddamned lone ranger somebody said thirtyseven bob hit the hill hard on his kawasaki the bike slid upward attacking sliding right and left inclining on the sudden hairpins spitting mud churning dirt sliding this way and that as it fought for traction up he went feeling between his legs the throb of the pistons beating as he rode the line between second and third foot alive to the quickness of the necessary shifting he smelled gas as it was eaten in cc gulps but he knew it was time to dump the bike when the tracers came floating his way whoever these boys were they werent well schooled they fired too early counting on the display of neon death floating parabolalike through the trees and rupturing wood where it struck to drive him back he might have been a different fellow but bob had taken tracer before even fired batches of it so panic was not what he felt even as random bullets began to kick up stingers and puffs of mud near him he cranked hard put the bike over feeling it bite against the mud as it plowed furrows before it was even still hed scrambled off found cover in the trees and begun his assault he had no targets yet but still his finger flew to the eotech gizmo atop his dpms rifle and pressed the button that was protected against accidental tripping by a plastic sheet across it he nudged it felt it give brought the gun to his shoulder and saw to his surprise a bright orange circle on the x screen you didnt need training so simple was the concept you put the circle on what it was you wanted you pushed the trigger and you ventilated he slithered upward safety off finger indexed along the top of the guard and forty yards out saw two men hunched over weapons on a crestline peering hard for target i think we put him down pap came a cry bob put the orange circle on the center of mass and fired three times this damn gun was no poodleshooter it bucked more by far than a but not so much that it was beyond control with superb trigger control and a stout shooting position bob knew he scored all three and he watched the unfortunate recipient jerk when struck then fall to the left bob came over wasnt quite fast enough on the pivot and by the time he got around the second guy was down under cover gunflashes gave away his position and so did the tracer burst which vectored like splashes of liquid weight toward bob bending as it arched toward him and tore into trees and ground and suddenly other boys were on the line and the hill was alive with the sound of death the guns buzzsawed hellaciously and ripped and the world turned all nasty and full of frags and flying debris and the spritz of nearsupersonic wood chips bob squirmed back aware that they were shooting toward sound rather than actually acquiring a target he waited a bit moved a little more but delicately put his rifle up and waited patiently soon enough a scout popped up to see if he could see a thing and just as quickly bob put one into him center mass again the gun beating into his shoulder with its upward torque the muzzle flash bleaching detail from his night vision illuminating a spent shell as it flew to the right another one down but another cycle of megablasting came abanging as the rest of the boys dumped their mags at him he waited them out would they have the guts to flank would they put people off on his right and his left triangulate and take him out he bet not they werent trying to hold the hill for but a few more minutes and nobody wanted to miss the big bus out and indeed here came the bus it floated out of blackness its rotor kicking up a cyclone huge and messy blowing clouds of dust everywhere he couldnt get a good shot at it however and when it had settled in it was hidden behind the angle of the incline and he could only hear it see its column of rising disturbance then another posse of tracer came his way lighting up his world and almost hitting him one came closer than any round since fifteen years earlier and he had a moment of fear even he the great bob the nailer victor in a hundred gunfights against impossible odds felt the terror of the near miss and he slunk back happy just to be alive the phone rang odd time for a phone call but it rang some chipper computery tune calculated to alert and annoy the sound fortunately buried from his antagonists by the roar of the chopper astounded that he would do such an amazingly stupid thing he obeyed the human rule that no matter what phone calls take precedence over all reality maybe it was fbi or maybe nick had given the number to local authority swagger he said into it after plucking it from inside his vest and slipping it open mr swagger its charlie wingate said the voice charlie well i think i figured mark out it took a thousand hits on the net but its actually mark as in military or industrial model designation capital m small k period then just twoeleven no colon and it refers to a caliber armorpiercing munition that at that moment the tree trunk behind which bob had slithered exploded it atomized as something weighing grains with a secondary explosive and a tungsten core traveling at twentyfive hundred feet per second hit it at zero angle detonated and sent a shockwave through it that all but liquefied the wood structure itself it toppled but could not find room among the other trees to actually hit ground and lay suspended at an angle thanks charlie said bob ill get back to you he flipped the phone away slithered even farther down the hill good old charlie better late than never two more raufosses arrived but the gunner had no target this time not hitting wood he did not get his secondary detonation but only plowed into the dirt kicking up a huge dusty geyser of earth and leaves each blast a bit farther from bob the thrust of the recoil taking him away from his target with each shot bob rolled to the side came up in a good kneeling position put the red circle on his target and guessing that he was bodyarmored shot him in the head now he thought get to the top get some rounds into that bird cripple it then fall back and live happily ever after let the real fbi take over each thirtypound twentyby twentyfourinch plastic tamperevident bag contained approximately twelve thousand bills as baled carefully in the counting room at bristol speedway headquarters the distribution of bills was predictable even immutable per cent of them were ones per cent fives per cent of them tens per cent of them twenties per cent of them fifties and per cent of them one hundreds each bag contained about and all thirtyfive of themroughly million in small unrecorded billsweighed a thousand fifty pounds the reverend needed men so he sent only two gunners to the crestline to search for the ranger on the motorcycle figuring the two could handle it easily enough that left three to unload and hoist and one on the roof to stack the bales in a neat pile for easy tossing into the wideopen chopper door if that goddamned richard were here it would help but the boy had disappeared the grumley inside tossed the bags out to a grumley beside the trucks open rear door and he in turnhusky caleb bloody nose and allheaved it up to the grumley atop the truck when all the bags were out all the grumleys would climb up top and toss the bags into the chopper hovering above it seemed to be going pretty well given that the rotors of the helicopter were tossing up hell and gone when someone wandered up groggily holding his ear pap he yelled he goddamn hit me three times and the last one bounced off the vest and tore off my ear oh lord said pap pap ise hurt bad git me out of here that boy can shoot a lick the reverend made a decision caleb you no nevermind that you git over there you boys too you put this fella down so the whole goddamned team quit their loading and ran to the edge of the hill pap waited as the guns blazed the helicopter hovered and nothing seemed to be happening except time was passing what was taking so long im getting worried hanging here said the helicopter pilot through the phone they git heavy guns up here they can bring this thing down in a second you said wouldnt be no shooting some damn hero trying to win a medal pap said hold her just a second he looked about richard would sure have been a help around now but no richard suddenly the boys was back theyd dumped their mags filled the woods with slugs tore shit out of it no human man could live through and left caleb to hold the fort so it was pap himself who climbed up top the truck from the hood and started lifting and tossing the bales into the chopper hard to believe each chunk of weight was about a quarter mil in swag untraceable immediately spendable investable hell a feller could have himself a great weekend in vegas with just one of em and goddamn he was getting two the boys one each and he found superhuman strength in the power of his greed and tossed them aboard the pilot helped by walking the chopper down the length of the truck so the distance wasnt far and the thirtyfive bags went aboard fast then each scrambled in all helping to get the wounded man aboard wheres caleb sir he aint coming dont believe we seen him go down just a second ago we ought to but the old man didnt need to be told he twisted from the news looked through the entryway from cargo hatch to cockpit where a pilot looked back at him and gave the thumbs up too bad for caleb but that were the grumley way and even though the bird was no rocket they all felt some kind of low gforce as she zoomed skyward straight up into the black with four grumleys and eight mill small unrecorded aboard whooooeeeee pap felt himself gush as the bird climbed and began its outbound jaunt running low hard and without lights nothing could stop them now bob hadnt even made it out of the trees as the birdit was a blackhawk no lesstook off for the moon or other parts ethereal it climbed high until it was damned near invisible and it was out of range in seconds he didnt have a shot shit he thought then he cursed himself for chucking away the phone as he now saw he might have been able to get a call through somehow have gotten word to somebody thatbut he saw that was impossible nah the airwaves were still a mess nobody knew anything no mark arise from your pallet and go to your house mk model o raufoss armorpenetrating incendiary it was time to let jesus speak for himself swagger ran to the fallen man who lay in a fetal position his head bent and crushed by a remington but that wasnt the point the point was cradled in dead hands bob picked up the goddamned barrett rifle all thirty pounds of it and ran back with it to the armored truck he set up over the hood after performing a quick check with the bolt to make certain a shell lay in the chamber and seeing that it did he found a good supported position the heavy thing on its bipod legs he drew it to his shoulder aware from japan that hed find speed in no speed hed find attainment in no attainment hed find it all in smooth and in smooth he ticked them off spotweld check trigger finger check breathing discipline check bones locked check mind numbed to stillness going going going on toward nothing the last time hed fired through a scope was months ago and what was this scope what was its zero who set it up well the bad boys didnt set it up because they used it close in and the shooting theyd done was from the hip at distances of twenty feet or less as witness the beefy guy whod tried to hipshoot him theyd left it alone most likely fearing it a little what was the origin of the gun was it a privately owned weapon used by some rich gun guy for hitting targets a mile out no way too beat up for that not well enough cared for had to be from the same source as the restricted raufoss ammo that is from some justice departmentdefense department equipment program meaning it was a military gun maybe refurbed by barrett after use in the sand declared surplus and turned over to law enforcement cheap for use in the war against drugs and somehow coming all the way to mountain city bob tried to feel its last real shooter and came up with a man like himself a marine nco hard and salty and given to the mastery of the technology his imagination enflamed by the possibility of doing bad guys a mile away and saving the lives of young marines whod otherwise have to close and do it at muzzleblast range hes a mile out he thought and whoever set this up he fired at a mile that was his pride his power he knew with certainty the scope is zeroed at a mile bob settled behind the reticle indexed on his approximation of the angle at which the bird had headed and there it was illuminated in the light of the speedway its occupants had just looted the bird in blur threequarter profile bisected in the milliradiandesignated crosshairs and it all came together in the kind of stroke only someone whod done the deed under pressure a thousand or a million times on training fields and in bad places where they shot back could make happensmooth and beyond attainment or speed or ambition he didnt even feel the recoil in the nanosecond the bird crossed the crosshairs of the scope though it may have been ferocious even as he gave with it rolled backward and let the gun resettle for a second shot he didnt see the blinding muzzle flash as the huge missile with its tungsten core flew onward at well past the speed of sound he didnt feel the noise which was immense he didnt sense the disturbance all those hot roiling gases unleashed he looked again when the show was complete but he couldnt find the bird where had it gone what was it he saw it sliding out of the sky he watched through the magnification of the scope and caught the thing in its downward gyre it wasnt smoking or burning but its internal rhythms were psychotic and the fuselage rotated wildly whipping ever faster until it was just barely flying and at the last the pilot whoever he was got some control and the thing hit with a smash against the empty seating of the speedway its tail boom shearing off and going for a tumble smoke rising now from a dozen different areas then bob saw men spilling crazily out of it even one from this distance in blue then a glare spotlighted him he looked up to see another bird just a few feet up he felt himself pinned silhouetted in the harsh light he raised his hands holding nicks badge up for all to see the bird got even lower and in its own light he now saw kfoxtv written on its boom he climbed up to the roof of the truck and the chopper came even lower he got a foot on the runner launched forward and eager hands pulled him in he was aboard next to a guy with a fancy haircut and a guy with a camera both so excited they looked about to pee but he wedged past them knowing all too well the interior of the huey and leaned into the cockpit the pilot handed him a set of earphones which he slipped on finding a throat mic at the ready im with the fbi he said gesturing with the badge yes sir listen can you run this baby south to then follow all the way over iron mountain out to mountain city sure can when we get there ill talk you in the rest of the way you drop me where i say and then you make tracks read you special agent then lets rock and roll the fuck out of here thirtyeight the boss waited radio reports were incoherent inclusive communicating only chaos and conflicting intelligence choppers down but caleb had to bring a chopper down how many one two three hard to say in the end it was pointless to listen and so the boss turned off the unit the boss checked the time after midnight here so far away the night was calm the sky full of radiance the temperature at last bearable and a sliver of gibbous moon let low gleam smear the southern hemisphere when the hell would it be here why wouldnt the hands on the watch move more quickly why was breath so hard neck so stiff mouth so dry suddenly there it was the boss felt immense relief it felt so good they were here it was done the black bird running low over the mountain crest finding this unlit field behind the prayer camp without a problem he was such a good pilot and now he could be taken care of too the boss lit a flare the only signal necessary its done they said it couldnt be done but i did it now im free and clear and rich and untouchable im a legend theyll wonder for a hundred years what became of me what i did with all that money theyll tell of the boss who beat the game the helicopter set down pitching up a whirl of wind and dust and leaves blowing and bending the grass away from its roar but grumleys didnt jump out that old man in his blue suit didnt leap out dancing as was his way when gleeful and there were no grumleys shouting and pounding and strutting as was expected everybody hungry for their share of the swag neatly precut into bales of cash one for each boy two for the old man and the rest for the boss as planned then the boss would jump aboard the chopper and it would continue its run in the dark low and unfollowable another hundred miles to an obscure rural field where an suv waited along with some phony passports theyd be in mexico in a day but no none of that happened no grumleys got off just one old man bob lee swagger howdy detective thelma bob said nice to see you swagger she said goddamn you i do annoy people she saw the badge you were fbi undercover all the time no maam i am nikki swaggers father pure and simple but i have a great friend in the bureau and we linked up now im working for him but im still working for nikki it wasnt personal it never is the two faced each other in the flicker of the flare as the helicopter skipped away into a high orbit no way that hayseed gun store gets hold of imported norwegian raufoss armorpiercing rounds without someone running a request on police stationery through justice under the sheriffs signature the sort of thing someone running an antimeth lab program might have right thelma but who runs the department that matineeidol sheriff hes so dumb he doesnt know how many feet hes got theyll figure that out down there soon enough i already did swagger dont make me do this i see i have to run hard now and i cant waste time here with you there aint no rush detective thelma i dont think youre going nowhere hmm lets see what else oh yeah sure im betting the superlab is in the coal yard next to the sheriffs office under the stink of all that coal where nobody can sniff it out most of all that sheriff boy you made some monkey out of him but thats why you got to go isnt it thelma oshas closing down the yard and yall are moving the department you cant run the lab if theyre closing down the whole zone youve run meth in johnson for three years now you fed the sheriff the intel let the sheriff take out the competition and you manufactured the stuff by the bagful right under his nose slipstreamed behind him kept the cost of meth the same that network of snitches youre so proud of those are your dealers that poor boy cubby bartlett you shot was a dealer and he was so cranked he didnt have any idea what was going on you grabbed the gun because when you showed up at his place that afternoon and pumped him full of ice you found his piece unloaded it so you had to grab it to justify your prints all over it the upshot is you used the profit to set up this operation to turn an awkward million you shouldnt have had into eight unmarked free and clear hell the pieces were already in place for you the helicopter its pilot being your bangedup gonetohell brother and i know you got him the job the barrett rifle already in the inventory the inside dope on the cash movement the inside dope on how tied in knots law enforcement was all you had to do was get the sheriff to sign off on the raufoss then off you go laughing all the way what you got on old alton to leverage him like that something pretty i imagine damn you swagger howd you get so smart he likes boys he come chickenhawking up here and i heard and set up a sting and got video on him in his circles thats ruination so he does this job and were quits you are a bad girl thelma but we aint quite at the end you knew grumley before you got some strange connection to grumley grumley dont trust no outsiders theyd just roll over you what is it thelma who are you born grumley maybe paps maybe someone elses grumley blood they got rid of me too smart raised in an orphanage but i backtracked and found em pap could never bring himself to shed

halfway around the world i even won a sword fight or two in my time they all had one thing in common they thought they were hunting me and i was hunting them faced many all are sucking grass from the bitter root end herere your choices you can come easy or you can come dead thelma drew she was way fast she was so smooth her hand flew in a blur to the paraord in the speed holster it came up like a sword stroke invisible in its raw speed bob hit her twice in the chest before she even got the safety off she spun hurt so bad and the heavy gun fell from her hand the two corbon supers enabling the ritual of drainage that would take her life from her as they opened up like sharp steel roses she gasped for air finding little and turned to look at the old man with the pistol in his hand just as the flare died by the way he said i was also area uspsa champ five years running nobody ever called me slow part iii last lap thirtynine it took some sorting out and the politics were enormously complicated but the final law enforcement debriefing on the incident of august bristol tennessee managed to get through its business in less than six hours all participantsthe fbi the tricities law enforcement task force representing the municipalities of sullivan county the tennessee highway patrol and the appropriate federal state city and county prosecutors officesremained cordial and tempers were more or less controlled throughout it helped that though the grumley mob had fired over rounds of ammunitionthis was the number of cartridge casings picked up by the fbi evidence recovery team on site at the bristol speedway the day after the incidentno civilians were killed though eleven were wounded one critically it helped that bristol police officers caught the main perpetratorsactually had them signed sealed and delivered when the hijacked johnson county sheriffs departments helicopter crashed conveniently into the speedway itselfwithout difficulty it helped that law enforcement casualties were quite low too a bristol traffic officer was seriously wounded by mm fire as he approached the site of the takedown a state police helicopter pilot was badly burned when his aircraft was shot down by caleb grumley early in the firefight and his copilot broke an ankle pulling him out of the downed machine in the seconds before the fire erupted the real tragedy was the three employees of cash transit service of tennessee killed outright it seemed to bother no one that three perpetratorscaleb another grumley gunman on the hilltop and a corrupt johnson county law enforcement officerwere killed by fbi agents two other grumley gunmen were killed earlier in the evening by another fbi team if anyone could be said to have won the engagement and emerged in extremely positive light it was the bureau with its intrepid penetration of the conspiracy its rapid response and deployment and its heroic swat actions during the incident itself task force director nicholas memphis wounded in the first shooting relating to the events of that evening was singled out for special praise and would almost certainly win another decoration the undercover agent he supervised was never identified to law enforcement personnelthe bureau is notoriously reluctant to share operational details even with other agenciesthough many believed the tall anonymous older gentleman who accompanied the bureau contingent to the meeting might have been that fellow himself some oddities and disappointments became clear though in fact fbi initiative closed the attempt down it was clear from even the most preliminary study that the real failure factor in the criminal enterprise was the odd route the driver of the hijacked cash in transit truck took to the helicopter pickup point had he not diverted to cause maximum damage to nascar village the felons would have made their escape easily running low and without lights by helicopter they would have been impossible to locate they could have split the million cash take and dispersed almost instantly thats how close the bad guys came to getting away with it that led in turn to the one disappointment the failure to apprehend that particular fellow the mysterious driver who had somehow slithered away in all the craziness as for the grumleys themselves they were as they had always been tough silent men who did their crime and were willing to do their time even if as in the case of alton grumley he would certainly perish in prison before that time was over they named no names snitched out no others besides alton three shooters were taken alive and would not name the other grumleys who had helped in the vehicle takedown and then melted away remaining unapprehended the pilot former major thomas fielding united states army would have sold anybody out but he knew nothing he was a wounded combat veteran who had been shot down three times in two wars his last tour of duty had been very rough leading to a history of drinking and other personal problems he quickly turned states evidence though he had little to offer except to point out to any and all that he should never have listened to his little sister finally it was over though adjudication remained the inevitable process by which things get processed in the justice system it would involve many of the cops further investigation much sworn testimony and court time generally inconveniencing everybody and using up millions of dollars but all that was in the future and the heroic nick memphis sure now to become an assistant director left with his party including the quiet older agent who said nothing but watched all the two of them walked to nicks car and they were a sight bob still limped and would always limp from the deep cut across his hip and down to his steel replacement joint nick was on crutches and hobbled along as best he could if we had a drummer wed look like yankee doodle dandy bob joked at one point they got across the parking lot of the bristol police department where the meeting had taken place it was another sultry day in the south with a low gray sky and a threat of rain in the air nick turned to bob i have to say partner you are some kind of cowboy we dont have a guy who could come close to you and weve got some damn good guys whats the secret bob what explains you no one knows you better than me and i dont know a thing my old man was the real hero im just his kid trying to live up to him thats all that plus good old usmc training some kind of natural skill and what can only be called gunfighters luck wyatt had it so did frank hammer mel purvis jelly bryce da parker all those old boys i seem to have just a touch myself you have what they have for sure and it isnt luck its something else arkansas boy like you ought to know the term for it true grit ring a bell if not try japanese samurai sound familiar you were there marine corps the old breed bet you heard that one or go back to the ancient greeks spartan any of it mean a thing dont know nick maybe its just stupid luck and maybe its just who i am thats all okay go home rest enjoy youve earned it get fat have more kids die in bed in forty years i intend to first though im heading back to knoxville to pick up my wife and daughters boy am i sick of that damned drive down and back after i git quit of this part of the country aint never driving that i spur again sorry you didnt get your bad boy that driver that one must sting well get him if he was expecting a cut of the cash he came up short which means hell have to work again soon we know what to listen for this time bet you do get him too if nikki remembersyou know anything but a face would be best you have my number this time ill answer you dont think hes long gone believe me this guy is not hanging around when theres all this law enforcement buzz the two said goodbye with a little hugthe sort masculine men not given to emotion but feeling it nonetheless are given to performand then nick climbed awkwardly into the seat and his driver took him away bob watched his closestmaybe his onlyfriend go then turned and headed to his own car now muchloathed the little green rental ford that had hauled him so many places he had half a mind to buy a really nice dodge charger blood red the big v engine spoilers the works to celebrate surviving another one of his things feeling the omnipresent pain in his hip he negotiated his way to the little vehicle to see astonishingly that someone had pulled up in a brand new dodge charger his dream vehicle though this one was death black and gleamy the door opened and a familiar figure stepped out it was that young matt macready whod taken usmc to a fourth in bristol howdy gunny heard about this meet thought i might find you here well matt how are you congratulations on your run sir it wasnt nothing compared to your run what im hearing i just drive in circles and nobodys shooting well most of what i did was crawl in circles hoping not to get shot sergeant swagger bob i told you son bob big racing wont ever say a thing but i came by to thank you just the same if that thing had come off it would be a stain you stopped it a cop told me you stopped it alone so no stain no ugliness no memories of bad things in fact in some perverted way i think everybody who didnt die or lose their business kind of enjoyed it but the race is still the thing thank you matt everybody seems to think i was an fbi agent and now even the fbis pretending to that one so it looks like itll clear up okay for me and i can get back to my front porch i doubt anythingll keep you on a front porch but theres one more thing whats that this guy the driver yep think i know who he is this got bobs full attention all right that puts you ahead of everyone else in this game hes the man who murdered my father on the track twenty years ago ran him hard into an abutment killed him everybody knew it was murder but there was no investigation because big racing didnt want an investigation and a scandal they just ran him out of the game and made sure he never got on another track again so he was a racer the best would have been a god trained by the hardest taskmaster made hard and cruel by a hard and cruel mentor trained to show no mercy to intimidate to win or die trying a monster or maybe a genius or maybe the best racing mind and reflexes ever put in one body who knows what he might have been i grew up hearing rumors about himanytime there was some strange guy winning an unsanctioned event like a coasttocoast or a mountain climb or some slick driving in a bank robbery getaway i always thought it was johnny you sound like you know him i do i once loved him i guess i still do no matter what hes my brother forty so let me get this straight dad nikki said in my own newspaper it reports an fbi unit pursued the robbers to the top of the hill killing two and bringing down the fleeing helicopter thats what it says so it must be true he answered they dont put it in the paper if it aint true as i understand it he was pushing her in a wheelchair down the hallway from the release office at the knoxville hospital she wore blue jeans a polo shirt an fbi baseball cap that he had brought her and a pair of flipflops but that fbi unitthat was one guy and he wasnt even in the fbi that was you i have no comment for the press and this she added reading more from the paper other federal units converged on piney mountain baptist prayer camp where they encountered johnson county sheriffs department detective thelma fielding with evidence that she planned the robbery tennessees most violent since the s fielding resisted arrest and was shot dead that was you too i dont honestly remember arent you a little old for all that cowboy stuff he laughed it was so good to have her back his chest swelled who said snipers have not hearts or that mankillers are isolate and stark through her he was connected to it all she was all civilization democracy honor civility loyalty the radiance of sheer life itself he felt so damned good she looked wonderful her eyes bright with the furious nikkiintelligence that had always marked her presence on earth her face had color in it her blonde hair was pulled back in a pony tail and she had that cuttothechase directness hed always loved so much she was quite a kid and he thought anew how lucky he was to end up rich most of all in daughters once cowboy always cowboy i guess didnt know i could move so fast nor be so lucky still i suppose im supposed to feel bad about putting those people down in the modern fashion but then i remember they targeted my daughter so i cant work up no tears any tears any tears what boy who loves me can ever compete with you nah youll meet him and forget clean about the old goat thats the way its supposed to be and just getting you back into the world to meet him and have a great life and contribute wherever you go thats enough for me now lets go mommys waiting in the van we have to get you back to bristol he pushed her to the elevator then the lobby people waved at nikki and she waved back and then he took her outside into sunlight and southern heat the clouds had broken the sun shone and the trees flashed green as their leaves played in breeze its so stupid she said i can walk perfectly fine these hospitals have rules you dont go home on your own two feet honey they waited and then julie pulled up in a rented red ford passenger van the door popped open and miko hopped out and threw herself at nikki the two daughters embraced your daddy said nikki your daddy is still a tough old bird sweetie i fear for the boys you start bringing home in a few years i dont like boys says miko i like my daddy shell sing a different tune pretty damn soon said bob gingerly julie and bob got nikki still a little fragile despite her protestations into the backseat of the van julie got in next to her got her seat belt on and miko got into the front seat bob climbed into the drivers seat engaged the engine and pulled out for the long last trek up i from knoxville to bristol brother richard watched them listening to his ipod sinnerman where you gonna run to run to the sea but the sea its aboilin run to the moon but the moon its ableedin sinnerman where you gonna to run to all on that day he was parked two blocks back in a recently stolen dodge charger liter hemi v the car idling smoothly giving no evidence of the horsepower beast under its hood hed been on the swaggers for three days now knowing that sooner or later nikki would leave the hospital he knew theyd rent a van and he idd the handsome woman who was the mother of the girl he had to kill now he watched the little scene at the hospital doors so sweet the theme of family wholeness after an ordeal the subthemes the heroism of the father the faith of the mother the weird special talent of the daughter the innocence of the younger child but he wasnt thinking about the family or themes he was thinking tactically of details involved in the action ahead he knew that no matter how well the van was driven by this extremely competent man it was too tall too slow too stiff had too high a tipping point to stand up to the assault of his charger he knew so much he knew which route theyd have to take to the i ramp and he knew exactly where hed take them right after exit and its outlet mall where the traffic would be thinner the road straight the embankment low and the precipice steep and the jolt would force the van over and down it would go bouncing bouncing snapping the spines of all inside i never meant to do a family he thought but i am the sinnerman and that girl has seen my new face and when she remembers i am done thats what the sinnerman does he does what is necessary bob drove through traffic idly looking neither left nor right paying no particular attention to anything he turned a corner then had a sudden inspiration i could use a nice chocolate softee he said daddy youll get fat ill get a diet softee then he said laughing he pulled into the immediate left a convenience store parking lot julie said okay everybody out mommy i no no just out out fast there was something new and hard in her voice she shepherded the two girls but not into the store for the treat but instead into another rental a car where she directed them to lie low mommy i do it honey just do it now she turned back into the cab of the van where bob had cinched his seatbelt tight she made eye contact with him and spoke not with love but with the missioncentered earnestness of officer to sergeant this time get him all of a sudden they turned right just as he was himself caught in an unexpected snarl of traffic agh theyre getting away brother richard felt a spurt of anger he could control so much but not traffic but just as swiftly it cleared up and he darted ahead took the righthand turn and saw that theyd pulled into a convenience store probably for a coke or something and were now pulling out back on the road he idled by the side of the road let the van put some distance between them then cut back into traffic and began his leisurely stalk he stayed far behind occasionally even losing visual contact but he reacquired the van as it pulled up the ramp to i north again without haste he let some distance build took the ramp and slipped into traffic there it was maybe half a mile ahead the red van completely unaware of his presence he accelerated through the gears the charger growled shivered at the chance to show off its muscularity and all of its horses and brother richard felt that octanedriven bounce as the car flew ahead pressing him into the seat the miles sped by the van always in the slow lane holding steady at fiftyfive richard a mile back forcing himself to keep his powerburner at the same rate hed lose the target on hills or turns but it was always just there ahead of him easily recoverable the exits ticked by until at last almost an hour later exit with its muchballyhooed promise of consumer paradise at cut rate took the majority of the northbound cars we are here he told himself we are where we have to be we are sinnerman he had them the road was clear no smokies had been seen in some time the odd trailer truck or suv dawdled in the slow lane now and then a fastmover passed too aggressively in the lefthand speeders alley but not with any regularity he turned up the music on his ipod that continual loop of the old spiritual with its image of armageddon its sense of the endings of things its image of the sinnerman in all his glory finally facing his ultimate fate the one this sinnerman was now about to make impossible by destroying the one living witness to his deeds and face he hit the pedal the car jacked ahead clear sailing only the red van stumping along across the ridge lines of the bland north tennessee landscape with its anonymous farms and low hills the car sang as it ate up the distance alive under his touch as all cars always had been he closed fast they had no idea the sinnerman was on them it was just like all the others the blindside approach the perfect angle the perfect hit just beyond the left rear quarter panel the satisfaction of the thump as metal hit metal at speed possibly a flash of horror as the doomed driver looked back even as predictably he overcorrected as he felt control vanish and the side of the road beckon not realizing that the overcorrection was the killer then the weirdness visible in the rearview mirror as the car twisted and lost traction always seemingly in slow motion and began to float as it separated from the surface of the planet once it floated it pirouetted almost lovely for a thing so full of death then it hit as gravity reasserted its command and bounced jerked spun disintegrated throwing up heaps of dust possibly it disappeared going off a precipice or down an incline but it didnt really matter for the velocityinterruption of the strike of car to ground produced more torque than any human body could withstand and spines like toothpicks or straws snapped instantly if the car hit a tree hit a rock hit an abutment burned shattered splintered erupted it didnt matter its cargo was corpses by the time the ultimate worked itself out he had them he had them he had them he was in the blind spot he found the angle he veered for the fatal smash where you gonna run to all on that day a curiosity unprecedentedly before he struck the van disappeared no it didnt disappear it braked hard but well instantly jettisoning its speed and in a nanosecond was out of the kill zone as he oversped but as it disappeared it also revealed that revelation was another vehicle just ahead so close to the first that it had been hidden by the height of the van in another nanosecond brother richard discovered that it was a dodge charger like his own only glistening black the v liter hemi horses raring to go in that second too he recognized the profile of its driver it was his brother matt the nascar hero whom hed always adored but whom he also hated for matt had the life that he johnny so wanted matt nodded the sinnerman knew what would happen next matt slid inside him came left hard hit him just beyond the rear quarter panel and he felt the traction going as the car floated left before he could stop himself he overcorrected and the car launched at miles per where you gonna run to all on that day youre not going to run anywhere there was no place to run he was floating his tires lost contact with the surface of the earth the moon was bleeding the sea was boiling the car was rolling all on this day acknowledgments this one began the second i saw the speedway at night loaded with fans frenzy and happiness i thought what they need is a good gunfight i recommend a trip to bristol whether its a racing weekend or not for that view of the hugeness of the structure in the greenness of the valley is shocking and somehow awesome it stands for mans monumental imagination and his ability to impose his will on nature on the other hand if those arent your values youd better stay away anyhow i was down there visiting my daughter amy who like nikki is a reporter for the bristol herald courier and shes just as gallant and intrepid as nikki even if im a far cry from bob lee swagger without giving it a thought i had bumbled into the most fantastic american spectacle id ever seen and knew i had to do something with it the confluence of daughter and setting suggested a plot though it took a while to get it all straightened out in the early going the story was going to revolve around an attempt to fix a race and would have required penetrating nascar culture to a far greater extent ten minutes into a race convinced me that fixing was impossible so i diverted to something more guncentric and fireworksintensive had a hell of a good time doing it too thanks to the usual suspects and some
