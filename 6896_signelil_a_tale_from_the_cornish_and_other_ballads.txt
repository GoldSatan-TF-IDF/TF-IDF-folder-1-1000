shine out had extinguished the lamp of his lustre so great a shepherd exclaimed o twas folly that i my love should bestow upon one never kind upon siris the lovely whose cold cruel mind would suffer unmoved a true lover to die often times when our flocks on the common did browse id approach her to pour in her ear my fond vowsbut unto her companions to haste she was sure o light of my eyes wouldst thou render me blest and wouldst grant me two kisses on thy snowy breast i swear that each one should an hour endure peasant songs of spain when jesu our redeemer to him the twelve did call by threes and fours he called them till they were mustered all and when they all were mustered twas thus to them he spake o which of ye my children will perish for my sake then gazing on each other they stood abashed and still all save saint john the baptist and peter of the hill well die for thee o jesus upon tomorrows morn for him died john the baptist and suffered pain and scorn there stands a stone a rounded stone midst oceans surges hoary on which sweet jesus set his foot when mounting to his glory there grows a rose a blooming rose midst oceans briny waters that oer may pass to hear the mass
