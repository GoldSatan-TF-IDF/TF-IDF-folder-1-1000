ian rankin beggars banquet introduction i started off life as a short story writer actually thats not strictly true i started as a comicbook writer drawing stickmen cartoons with speech bubbles i was about seven or eight and id fold sheets of plain paper until i had a little booklet then id draw my stickmen they would appear in strips about football war and outer space until it was pointed out to me that i couldnt really draw a potentially glorious career nipped in the bud it didnt really bother me by now i was ten or eleven and starting to listen to music but being an obsessive sort of kid it wasnt enough just to listen same as id never just been happy as a reader of comics i did what any sensible person would do started a band problem was none of my friends shared my interest it didnt help that i couldnt read music or play an instrument i didnt need to the music could be stored in my head the lyrics written down so i invented a bubblegum pop group called the amoebas whose roster included ian kaput vocals zed killer macintosh bass and blue lightning guitar i recall the drummer had a doublebarrelled name but forget what it was by writing lyrics for this band i found myself writing poetry doggerel admittedly but poetry all the same in that the lyrics scanned and had a rhyme scheme it wasnt such a leap therefore to write my first proper poem at around the age of sixteen the amoebas were still around then incidentally but had shifted from pop to progressive rock the thing about my poems was they told stories they were about people going to places and the consequences of their actions i think thats why i started writing short stories i wrote several while still at school aided by an english teacher called mr gillespie who seemed to think i had something at that time in our english class we were given topics and had to construct a weekly short story in one instance mr gillespie gave us the phrase dark they were and goldeneyed the rest was up to us my contribution concerned worried parents searching a busy squat for their drugaddict son a lot of my stories were in this ahem vein at home i wrote about kids running away from their smalltown existences only to end up committing suicide in london one longer story took place in my own school where a poster of mick jagger took on devilish powers and persuaded the kids to go on a rampage influenced by lord of the flies maybe more than a smidge at university i wrote poems and short stories both my first proper short story about a shipyard closure came second in a national competition my next based on a real family event won another prize the first story of mine to appear in a collection was an afternoon it was about a seasoned copper patrolling a hibs football match it wasnt good enough for the collection youre about to read so dont bother looking the stories collected here span a decade or more some first appeared on radio others in american magazines they comprise my first short story collection since s a good hanging not all of them are rebus stories theres a good reason for this i tend to write short stories in between books as a way of getting the good inspector out of my system for a while this was certainly true of a deep hole featured here and one of the collections most successful stories in that it won a dagger for best story of the year and was also shortlisted for the prestigious anthony award the really curious thing about a deep hole is that it started life set entirely in edinburgh then an editor called and asked if i had anything set in london for a book he was compiling i tweaked a deep hole and sent it off not a bad move as it turned out another story here herbert in motion also won a dagger for best short story its genesis was an offhand comment by my partner about how government ministers in whitehall could borrow works of art from various galleries and museums this is the beauty of the short story all you need is a single good idea no convolutions or subplots well not many not as many as in a novel certainly stories are also good ways of experimenting with narrative voice structure and methods of economy ive managed to whittle stories down from words to a struggle but useful in that i came to learn just how much it is possible to leave out theres no place for fat on a story it has to be lean and fit glimmer started life as a novella until i realised i was indulging myself whittling away i found the real story peering out at me its still an indulgence giving me a chance to create a mythology around one of my favourite rolling stones songs but now its as lean as it is mean a couple of the stories here the confession and the hanged man started life as pieces for radio another principles of accounts began as a treatment for a tv drama which never came to be strangest of all perhaps is the only true comedian which began as a monologue for radio eventually changed out of all recognition and renamed kings of the wild frontier it appeared as a short tv drama as part of scottish televisions newfoundland series i think i was credited as cowriter but when i sat down to watch the finished product i dont think i heard more than two lines which id written the rest had been altered to suit the medium it seemed to work the actor picked up an award for his performance but all told i was much happier with my short story i like short stories i enjoy reading other peoples as well as writing them myself for a time i mistakenly thought it might even be possible to make a living as a short story writer after all in this jumpcut fastpaced bitesized urban world short stories offer convenience you can start and finish one on a short bus ride or train journey you can read one in your lunch break it might even be possible to write one in your lunch break look around you the ideas are out there sometimes theyre close enough to touch in closing and before you begin i should thank my editor for this collection jon wood the title beggars banquet was his idea a great stones album i hope you enjoy tucking into these morsels ian rankin edinburgh trip trap an inspector rebus story blame it on patience patience coincidence or fate whatever grace gallagher came downstairs that morning and found herself sitting at the dining table with a cup of strong brown tea there was just enough milk in the fridge for one other cup staring at the pack of cards she sucked cigarette smoke into her lungs feeling her heart beat the faster for it this cigarette she enjoyed george did not allow her to smoke in his presence and in his presence she was for the best part of each and every day the smoke upset him he said it tasted his mouth so that food took on a funny flavour it irritated his nostrils made him sneeze and cough made him giddy george had written the book on hypochondria so the house became a nosmoking zone when george was up and about which was precisely why grace relished this small moment by herself a moment lasting from seven fifteen until seven fortyfive for the forty years of their married life grace had always managed to wake up thirty clear minutes before her husband she would sit at the table with a cigarette and tea until his feet forced a creak from the bedroom floorboard on his side of the bed that floorboard had creaked from the day theyd moved into gillan drive thirtyodd years ago george had promised to fix it now he wasnt even fit to fix himself tea and toast grace finished the cigarette and stared at the pack of cards theyd played whist and rummy the previous evening playing for stakes of a penny a game and shed lost as usual george hated losing defeat bringing on a sulk which could last the whole of the following day so to make her life a little easier grace now allowed him to win purposely throwing away useful cards frittering her trumps george would sometimes notice and mock her for her stupidity but more often he just clapped his hands together after another win his puffy fingers stroking the winnings from the table top grace now found herself opening the pack shuffling and laying out the cards for a hand of patience a hand which she won without effort she shuffled again played again won again this it seemed was her morning she tried a third game and again the cards fell right until four neat piles stared back at her black on red on black on red all the way from king to ace she was halfway through a fourth hand and confident of success when the floorboard creaked her name was called and the day her real day began she made tea that was the end of the milk and toast and took it to george in bed hed been to the bathroom and slipped slowly back between the sheets legs giving me gyp today he said grace was silent having no new replies to add to this statement she placed his tray on the bed and pulled open the curtains the room was stuffy but even in summer he didnt like the windows open he blamed the pollution the acid rain the exhaust fumes they played merry hell with his lungs making him wheezy breathless grace peered out on to the street across the road houses just like hers seemed already to be wilting from the days ordinariness yet inside her despite everything despite the sour smell of the room the heavy breath of her unshaven husband the slurping of tea the grey heat of the morning grace could feel something extraordinary hadnt she won at patience won time and time again paths seemed to be opening up in front of her ill go fetch you your paper she said george gallagher liked to study racing form he would pore over the newspaper sneering at the tipsters choices and would come up with a super yankee five horses which should they all romp home as winners would make them their fortune grace would take his betting slip to the bookies on the high street would hand across the stake money less than per day and would go home to listen on the radio as horse after horse failed in its mission the tipsters choices meantime bringing in a fair return but george had what he called inside knowledge and besides the tipsters were all crooked werent they you couldnt trust them grace was a bloody fool if she thought she could often a choice of georges would come in second or third but despite her efforts he refused to back any horse each way all or nothing thats what he wanted you never win big by betting that way graces smile was like a nail file we never win at all george wondered sometimes why it took his wife so long to fetch the paper after all the shop was ten minutes walk away at most yet grace would usually be out of the house for the best part of an hour but there was always the story of a neighbour met gossip exchanged a queue in the shop or the paper not having arrived entailing a longer walk to the newsagents further down the road in fact grace took the newspaper to lossie park where weather permitting she sat on one of the benches and taking a ballpoint pen free with a womans magazine refilled twice since from her handbag proceeded to attempt the newspapers crossword at first shed filled in the quick clues but had grown more confident with the years so that she now did the cryptic often finishing it sometimes failing for want of one or two answers which she would ponder over the rest of the day george his eyes fixed on the sports pages never noticed that shed been busy at the crossword he got his news so he said from the tv and the radio though in fact grace had noticed that he normally slept through the television news and seldom listened to the radio if the weather was dreich grace would sit on a sheltered bench where one day a year or so back she had been joined by a gentleman of similar years which was to say eight or nine years younger than george he was a local a widower and his name was jim malcolm they talked but spent most of the time just watching the park itself studying mothers with prams boys with their dogs games of football lovers tiffs and even at that early hour the occasional drunk every day they met at one bench or another seeming to happen upon one another by accident never seeing one another at any other time of the day or any other location other than those truly accidental meetings in a shop or on the pavement and then a few weeks back springtime standing in the butchers shop grace had overheard the news of jim malcolms death when her turn came to be served grace asked for half a pound of steak mince instead of the usual economy stuff the butcher raised an eyebrow something to celebrate mrs gallagher not really grace had said quietly that night george had eaten the expensive mince without comment today she completed the crossword in record time it wasnt that the clues seemed easier than usual it was more that her brain seemed to be working faster than ever before catching that inference or this anagram anything she decided was possible on a day like this simply anything the sun was appearing from behind a bank of cloud she closed the newspaper folded it into her bag alongside the pen and stood up shed been in the park barely ten minutes if she returned home so quickly george might ask questions so instead she walked a slow circuit of the playing fields her thoughts on patience and crosswords and creaking floorboards and much more besides blame it on patience detective inspector john rebus had known dr patience aitken for several years and not once during their working relationship had he been able to refuse her a favour patience seemed to rebus the kind of woman his parents if still alive would have been trying to marry him off to were he still single which in a sense he was being divorced on finding he was divorced patience had invited rebus round to her surprisingly large house for what she had called dinner halfway through a homebaked fruit pie patience had admitted to rebus that she was wearing no underwear homely but smouldering that was patience who could deny such a woman a favour not john rebus and so it was that he found himself this evening standing on the doorstep of gillan drive and about to intrude on private grief not that there was anything very private about a death not in this part of scotland or in any part of scotland come to that curtains twitched at neighbouring windows people spoke in lowered voices across the divide of a garden fence and fewer televisions than usual blared out the ubiquitous advertising jingles and even more ubiquitous game show applause gillan drive was part of an anonymous workingclass district on the southeastern outskirts of edinburgh the district had fallen on hard times but there was still the smell of pride in the air gardens were kept tidy the tiny lawns clipped like army haircuts and the cars parked tight against the kerbs were old w and x registrations predominated but polished showing no signs of rust rebus took it all in in a moment in a neighbourhood like this grief was for sharing everybody wanted their cut still something stopped him lifting the door knocker and letting it fall patience aitken had been vague wary ambivalent that was why she was asking him for a favour and not for his professional help i mean she had said over the telephone ive been treating george gallagher on and off more on than off for years i think about the only complaints ive ever not known him to think he had are beriberi and elephantiasis and then only because you never read about them in the docs page of the sunday post rebus smiled gps throughout scotland feared their monday morning surgeries when people would suddenly appear in droves suffering from complaints read about the previous morning in the post no wonder people called the paper an institution and all the while patience aitken was saying grace has been by his bedside always patient with him always looking after him the womans been an angel so whats the problem rebus nursed not only the telephone but a headache and a mug of black coffee as well black coffee because he was dieting a headache for not unconnected reasons the problem is that george fell downstairs this morning hes dead im sorry to hear it there was a silence at the other end of the line i take it rebus said that you dont share my feelings george gallagher was a cantankerous old man grown from a bitter younger man and most probably a fairly unsociable teenager i dont think i ever heard him utter a civil word never mind a please or a thank you fine said rebus so lets celebrate his demise silence again rebus sighed and rubbed his temples out with it he ordered hes supposed to have fallen downstairs patience aitken explained he did go downstairs in the afternoon sometimes to watch racing on the telly sometimes just to stare at a different set of walls from the bedroom but he fell at around eleven oclock which is a bit early for him and you think he was pushed rebus tried not to sound cynical her reply was blunt yes i do by this angel whos managed to put up with him all these years thats right ok doc so point me to the medical evidence well its a narrow staircase pretty steep about eleven or twelve steps say if you weighed around thirteen stone and happened to slip at the top youd sort of be bounced off the sides as you fell wouldnt you perhaps and youd try to grab hold of something to stop your fall theres a banister on one wall they were waiting for the council to come and fit an extra banister on the other wall so youd reach out to grab something fair enough rebus drained the sour black coffee and studied the pile of work in his intray well youd have bruising wouldnt you said patience aitken grazes on your elbows or knees thered be marks where youd clawed at the walls rebus knew that she was surmising but could not disagree thus far go on he said george gallagher only has significant marks on his head where he hit the floor at the bottom of the stairs breaking his neck in the process no real bruising or grazing to the body no marks on the wall as far as i can see so youre saying he flew from the top landing with a fair bit of momentum and the first thing he touched was the ground thats how it looks unless im imagining it so he either jumped or he was pushed yes she paused again i know it sounds tenuous john and christ knows i dont want to accuse grace of anything rebus picked up a ballpoint pen from beside the telephone and scrabbled on the surface of his desk until he found the back of an envelope upon which to write youre only doing your job patience he said give me the address and ill go pay my respects the door of gillan drive opened slowly and a man peered out at rebus then ushered him quickly inside laying a soft hand on his arm in ye come son in ye come the women are in the livingroom the kitchens through here he nodded his head then led rebus through a narrow hallway past a closed door from behind which came tearful sounds towards a halfopen door at the back of the house rebus had not even glanced at the stairs as theyd passed them the stairs which had faced him at the open front door of the house the kitchen door was now opened from within and rebus saw that seven or eight men had squeezed into the tiny back room there were stale smells of cooking fat and soup stew and fruit cake but above them wafted a more recent smell whisky here ye are son someone was handing him a tumbler with a good inch of amber liquid in it everyone else had just such a glass nestling in their hand they all shuffled from one foot to another awkward hardly daring to speak they had nodded at rebuss entrance but now gave him little heed glasses were replenished rebus noticed the coop price label on the bottle youve just moved into cashman street havent you someone was asking someone else aye thats right a couple of months ago the wife used to meet mrs gallagher at the shops so we thought wed drop in see this estate son it was miners rows once upon a time it used to be that you lived here and died here but these days theres that much coming and going the conversation continued at the level of a murmur rebus was standing with his back to the sinks draining board next to the back door a figure appeared in front of him have another drop son and the inch in his glass rose to an inch and a half rebus looked around him in vain seeking out a relative of the deceased but these men looked like neighbours like the sons of neighbours the male half of the communitys heart their wives sisters mothers would be in the livingroom with grace gallagher closed curtains blocking out any light from what was left of the day handkerchiefs and sweet sherry the bereaved in an armchair with someone else perched on an arm of the chair offering a pat of the hand and wellmeant words rebus had seen it all seen it as a child with his own mother and as a young man with his father seen it with aunts and uncles with the parents of friends and more recently with friends themselves he wasnt so young now the odd contemporary was already falling victim to the big c or an unexpected heart attack today was the last day of april two days ago hed gone to fife and laid flowers on his fathers grave whether it was an act of remembrance or of simple contrition he couldnt have said his guide pulled him back to the present her daughterinlaws already here came over from falkirk this afternoon rebus nodded trying to look wise and the son eyes looked at him dead these past ten years dont you know that there was suspicion now and rebus knew that he had either to reveal himself as a policeman or else become more disingenuous still these people authentically mourning the loss of someone they had known had taken him as a mourner too had brought him in here to share with them to be part of the remembering group im just a friend of a friend he explained they asked me to look in it looked from his guides face however as though an interrogation might be about to begin but then somebody else spoke terrible crash it was what was the name of the town again methil hed been working on building a rig there thats right said the guide knowledgeably pay night it was theyd been out for a few drinks like on their way to the dancing next thing aye terrible smash it was the lad in the back seat had to have both legs taken off well thought rebus i bet he didnt go to any more hops then he winced trying to forgive himself for thinking such a thing his guide saw the wince and laid the hand back on his arm all right son all right and they were all looking at him again perhaps expecting tears rebus was growing red in the face ill just he said motioning towards the ceiling with his head you know where it is rebus nodded hed seen all there was to see downstairs and so knew the bathroom must lie upstairs and upstairs was where he was heading he closed the kitchen door behind him and breathed deeply there was sweat beneath his shirt and the headache was reasserting itself thatll teach you rebus it was saying thatll teach you for taking a sip of whisky thatll teach you for making cheap jokes to yourself take all the aspirin you like theyll dissolve your stomach lining before they dissolve me rebus called his headache two sevenletter words before beginning to climb the stairs he gave careful scrutiny to each stair as he climbed and to the walls either side of each stair the carpet itself was fairly new with a thickish pile the wallpaper was old and showed a hunting scene horseriders and dogs with a fox panting and worried in the distance as patience aitken had said there were no scrapes or clawmarks on the paper itself whats more there were no loose edges of carpet the whole thing had been tacked down with a professionals skill nothing for george gallagher to trip over no threads or untacked sections and no smooth threadbare patches for him to slip on he gave special attention to where the upstairs landing met the stairs george gallagher probably fell from here from this height further down the stairs his chances of survival would have been much greater yes it was a steep and narrow staircase all right a trip and a tumble would certainly have caused bruising immediate death at the foot of the stairs would doubtless have arrested much of the bruising the blood stilling in the veins and arteries but bruising there would have been the postmortem would be specific so far rebus was trading on speculation and well he knew it four doors led off the landing a large cupboard what rebus as a child would have called a press filled with sheets blankets two ancient suitcases a blackandwhite television lying on its side a musty spare bedroom its single bed made up ready for the visitor who never came the bathroom with a batteryoperated razor lying on the cistern never to be used again by its owner and the bedroom nothing interested rebus in either the spare bedroom or the bathroom so he slipped into the main bedroom closing the door behind him then opening it again since to be discovered behind a closed door would be so much more suspicious than to be found inside an open one the sheets blanket and quilt had been pulled back from the bed and three pillows had been placed on their ends against the headboard so that one person could sit up in bed hed seen a breakfast tray in the kitchen still boasting the remnants of a morning meal cups toast crumbs on a greasy plate an old coffee jar now holding the remains of some homemade jam beside the bed stood a walkingframe patience aitken had said that george gallagher usually wouldnt walk half a dozen steps without his walkingframe a zimmer shed called it but to rebus zimmer was the german for room of course if grace were helping him he could walk without it leaning on her the way hed lean his weight on a stick rebus visualised grace gallagher coaxing her husband from his bed telling him he wouldnt be needing his walkingframe shed help him down the stairs he could lean on her on the bed rested a newspaper dotted with tacky spots of jam it was todays paper and it was open at the racing pages a blue pen had been used to ring some of the runners gypsy pearl gazumpin lot s wife castle mallet blondie five in total enough for a super yankee the blue pen was sitting on a bedside table beside a glass half filled with water some tablets the label made out to mr g gallagher a pair of reading spectacles in their case and a paperback cowboy novel large print borrowed from the local library rebus sat on the edge of the bed and flipped through the newspaper his eyes came to rest on a particular page the letters and cartoons page at bottom right was a crossword a completed crossword at that the pen used to fill in the squares seemed different to that used for the racing form further on in the paper and the hand seemed different too more delicate more feminine thin faint marks rather than the robust lines used to circle the days favoured horses rebus enjoyed the occasional crossword and impressed to find this one completed was more impressed to find that the answers were those to the cryptic clues rather than the quick clues most people favoured he began to read until at some point in his reading his brow furrowed and he blinked a couple of times before closing the paper folding it twice and rolling it into his jacket pocket a second or twos reflection later he rose from the bed and walked slowly to the bedroom door out on to the landing where taking careful hold of the banister he started downstairs he stood in the kitchen with his whisky pondering the situation faces came and went a man would finish his drink with a sigh or a clearing of the throat ay well hed say i suppose id better and with these words and a bow of the head he would move out of the kitchen timidly opening the livingroom door so as to say a few words to the widow before leaving rebus heard grace gallaghers voice a high wavering howl thanks for coming it was good of you cheerio the women came and went too sandwiches appeared from somewhere and were shared out in the kitchen tongue corned beef salmon paste white halfpan bread sliced in halves despite his diet rebus ate his fill saying nothing though he only half knew it he was biding his time not wishing to create a disturbance he waited as the kitchen emptied once or twice someone had attempted to engage him in conversation thinking they knew him from a neighbouring street or from the public bar of the local rebus just shook his head the friend of a friend and the enquiries usually ended there even his guide left again patting rebuss arm and giving him a nod and a wink it was a day for universal gestures so rebus winked back then the kitchen vacant now muggy with the smell of cheap cigarettes whisky and body odour rebus rinsed out his glass and stood it endup on the draining board he walked into the hallway paused then knocked and pushed open the livingroom door as he had suspected grace gallagher as fraillooking as hed thought dabbing behind her fiftiesstyle spectacles was seated in an armchair on the arm of the chair sat a woman in her forties heavybodied but not without presence the other chairs were vacant teacups sat on a dining table alongside an unfinished plate of sandwiches empty sherry glasses the bottle itself and curiously a pack of playing cards laid out as though someone had broken off halfway through a game of patience opposite the television set sat another sunken armchair looking as if it had not been sat in this whole afternoon rebus could guess why the deceaseds chair the throne to his tiny kingdom he smiled towards the two women grace gallagher only half looked towards him thanks for dropping by she said her voice slightly revived from earlier it was good of you cheerio actually mrs gallagher said rebus stepping into the room im a police officer detective inspector rebus dr aitken asked me to look in oh grace gallagher looked at him now pretty eyes sinking into crinkly white skin a dab of natural colour on each cheek her silvery hair hadnt seen a perm in quite a while but someone had combed it perhaps to enable her to face the rigours of the afternoon the daughterinlaw or so rebus supposed the woman on the arm of the chair to be was rising would you like me to rebus nodded towards her i dont think thisll take long just routine really when theres been an accident he looked at grace then at the daughterinlaw maybe if you could go into the kitchen for five minutes or so she nodded keenly perhaps a little too keenly rebus hadnt seen her all evening and so supposed shed felt duty bound to stay cooped up in here with her motherinlaw she seemed to relish the prospect of movement ill pop the kettle on she said brushing past rebus he watched the door close waited as she padded down the short hallway listened until he heard water running the sounds of dishes being tidied then he turned back to grace gallagher took a deep breath and walked over towards her dragging a stiffbacked dining chair with him this he sat on only a foot or two from her he could feel her growing uneasy she writhed a little in the armchair then tried to disguise the reaction by reaching for another paper hankie from a box on the floor beside her this must be a very difficult time for you mrs gallagher rebus began he wanted to keep things short and clear cut he had no evidence had nothing to play with but a little bit of psychology and the womans own state of mind it might not be enough he wasnt sure whether or not he wanted it to be enough he found himself shifting on the chair his arm touched the newspaper in his pocket it felt like a talisman dr aitken told me he continued that youd looked after your husband for quite a few years it cant have been easy id be lying if i said that it was rebus tried to find the requisite amount of iron in her words tried but failed yes he said i believe your husband was well a bit difficult at times i wont deny that either he could be a real bugger when he wanted to she smiled as if in memory of the fact but ill miss him aye ill miss him im sure you will mrs gallagher he looked at her and her eyes fixed on to his challenging him he cleared his throat again theres something im not absolutely sure about concerning the accident i wonder if maybe you can help me i can try rebus smiled his appreciation its just this he said eleven oclock was a bit early for your husband to be coming downstairs whats more he seemed to be trying to come down without his walkingframe which is still beside the bed rebuss voice was becoming firmer his conviction growing whats more he seems to have fallen with a fair amount of force she interrupted him with a snap how do you mean i mean he fell straight down the stairs he didnt just slip and fall or stumble and roll down them he went flying off the top step and didnt hit anything till he hit the ground her eyes were filling again hating himself rebus pressed on he didnt fall mrs gallagher he was helped to the top of the stairs and then he was helped down them with a push in the back a pretty vigorous push at that his voice grew less severe less judgmental im not saying you meant to kill him maybe you just wanted him hospitalised so you could have a rest from looking after him was that it she was blowing her nose her small shoulders squeezed inwards towards a brittle neck the shoulders twitched with sobs i dont know what youre talking about you think i how could you why would you say anything like that no i dont believe you get out of my house but there was no power to any of her words no real enthusiasm for the fight rebus reached into his pocket and brought out the newspaper i notice you do crosswords mrs gallagher she glanced up at him startled by this twist in the conversation what he motioned with the paper i like crosswords myself thats why i was interested when i saw youd completed todays puzzle very impressive when did you do that this morning she said through another handkerchief in the park i always do the crossword after ive bought the paper then i bring it home so george can look at his horses rebus nodded and studied the crossword again you must have been preoccupied with something this morning then he said what do you mean its quite an easy one really i mean easy for someone who does crosswords like this and finishes them where is it now rebus seemed to be searching the grid yes he said nineteen across youve got the down solutions so that means the answer to nineteen across must be something r something p now whats the clue he looked for it found it here it is mrs gallagher perhaps deadly in part four letters something r something p something deadly or deadly in part and youve put trip what were you thinking about i wonder i mean when you wrote that i wonder what your mind was on but its the right answer said grace gallagher her face creasing in puzzlement rebus was shaking his head no he said i dont think so i think the in part means the letters of part make up the word you want the answers trap mrs gallagher perhaps deadly in part trap do you see but you were thinking of something else when you filled in the answer you were thinking about how if your husband tripped down the stairs you might be rid of him isnt that right grace she was silent for a moment the silence broken only by the ticking of the mantelpiece clock and the clank of dishes being washed in the kitchen then she spoke quite calmly myra s a good lass it was terrible when billy died shes been like a daughter to me ever since another pause then her eyes met rebuss again he was thinking of his own mother of how old shed be today had she lived much the same age as this woman in front of him he took another deep breath but stayed silent waiting you know son she said if you look after an invalid people think youre a martyr i was a martyr all right but only because i put up with him for forty years her eyes strayed to the empty armchair and focused on it as though her husband were sitting there and hearing the truth for the very first time he was a sweet talker back then and he had all the right moves none of that once billy came along none of that ever again her voice which had been growing softer now began hardening again they shut the pit so he got work at the bottle factory then they shut that and all he could get was parttime chalking up the winners at the bookies a man gets gey bitter inspector but he didnt have to take it out on me did he she moved her eyes from the chair to rebus will they lock me up she didnt sound particularly interested in his answer thats not for me to say grace juries decide that sort of thing she smiled i thought id done the crossword in record time trust me to get one wrong and she shook her head slowly the smile falling from her face as the tears came again and her mouth opened in a nearsilent bawl the door swung open the daughterinlaw entering with a tray full of crockery there now she called we can all have a nice cup of she saw the look on grace gallaghers face and she froze what have you done she cried accusingly rebus stood up mrs gallagher he said to her im afraid ive got a bit of bad news she had known of course the daughterinlaw had known not that grace had said anything but there had been a special bond between them myra s parting words to rebuss retreating back had been a vicious that bugger deserved all he got net curtains had twitched faces had appeared at darkened windows her words had echoed along the street and up into the smoky night air maybe she was right at that rebus couldnt judge all he could be was fair so why was it that he felt so guilty so ashamed he could have shrugged it off could have reported back to patience that there was no substance to her fears grace gallagher had suffered would continue to suffer wasnt that enough ok so the law demanded more but without rebus there was no case was there he felt right felt vindicated and at the same time felt a complete and utter bastard more than that he felt as though hed just sentenced his own mother he stopped at a latenight store and stocked up on beer and cigarettes as an afterthought he bought six assorted packets of crisps and a couple of bars of chocolate this was no time to diet back home he could conduct his own postmortem could hold his own private wake on his way out of the shop he bought the final edition of the evening paper and was reminded that this was april tomorrow morning before dawn crowds of people would climb up arthurs seat and at the hills summit would celebrate the rising of the sun and the coming of may some would dab their faces with dew the old story being that it would make them more beautiful more handsome what exactly was it they were celebrating all the hungover students and the druids and the curious rebus wasnt sure any more perhaps he had never known in the first place later that night much later as he lay along his sofa the hifi blaring some jazz music from the sixties his eye caught the days racing results on the papers back page gypsy pearl had come home first at threetoone in the very next race gazumpin had won at seventotwo on two races further on lot s wife had triumphed at a starting price of eighttoone at another meeting castle mallet had won the two thirty twotoone joint favourite that left only blondie rebus tried to focus his eyes and finally found the horse its name misprinted to read bloodie though threetoone favourite it had come home third in a field of thirteen rebus stared at the misspelling wondering what had been going through the typists mind when he or she had made that one small but no doubt meaningful slip someone got to eddie they paid me not to make mistakes not that i ever made mistakes thats why i was the man for the job and they knew it i was cautious and thorough discreet and tightlipped besides i had other qualities which they found quite indispensable he was lying on the livingroom floor hed fallen on his back head coming to rest against the front of a leather armchair it looked like it might be one of those reclining armchairs you know with a footrest and everything an expensive item the tv was expensive too but then i dont suppose he ever went out much they dont go out much people like him they stay indoors where its safe the irony of this being of course that they become prisoners in their own homes prisoners all their lives he was still alive breathing badly through his wet nose his hand sort of stroking the front of his tshirt there was a big damp stain there and it was all his his hair had gone grey in the past year or so and hed put on a lot of weight his eyes were darkringed from too many late nights please he whispered please but i was busy i didnt like interruptions so i stabbed him again just the twice probably in his abdomen not deep wounds just enough to give him the hint his head slouched floorwards tiny moaning sounds dribbling from his lips they didnt want a quick painless death it was in the contract they wanted something that was both revenge on him and a message to others oh yes i was the man for the job all right i was wearing overalls and gardening gloves and a pair of old training shoes with the heel coming away from one of them disposable the lot of it fit for little more than a bonfire so i didnt mind stepping in the small pools of blood in fact that was part of the plan id put the overalls and gloves and trainers on in his bathroom this was just prior to stabbing him of course hed been surprised to see me coming out of the bathroom looking like that but of course it hadnt dawned on him till too late always watch your back they say but the advice id give is always watch your front its the guy youre shaking hands with the guy youre talking to who will turn out to be your enemy there arent monsters hiding in the bushes all they hide behind are smiles dont worry about me i always ramble on when im nervous i got to work first i dropped the knife into a plastic bag and placed the package in my holdall i might need it again but at this stage i doubted it he wasnt talking any more instead his mouth opened and closed soundlessly like a fish in an unaerated aquarium you hardly knew he was in pain pain and shock his body was going to wave a white flag soon but the brain was taking a little time to understand it thought it was still in the foxhole head down and safe aquariums and foxholes funny the things that go through your mind at a time like this i suppose its to shut out the reality of the situation never mind virtual reality this was visceral reality i was keeping the gloves on for the moment i walked around the livingroom deciding how the place should look there was a table in the corner with some bottles and glasses on it they could go for a start hold on though some music first there had been no indications that any neighbours were at home id watched outside for an hour and since coming in had been listening for sounds but all the same besides music soothed the soul didnt it what do you fancy i asked him he had a cheap little midisystem and a couple of dozen cds and tapes i switched the system on and opened the drawer of the cd player slipped in a disc closed the drawer and pressed play a bit of mantovani i said needlessly as strings swelled from the small speakers it was a version of the beatles yesterday good song that i turned the volume up a bit played with the treble and bass then went back to the corner table and swept all the stuff on to the floor not with a flourish or anything just a casual brush of the forearm a couple of wine glasses broke nothing else and it didnt make much noise either it looked good though the sofa was next i thought for a moment then pulled a couple of the cushions off letting them drop to the floor it wasnt much was it but the room was looking cluttered now what with the bottles and cushions and the body he wasnt watching any of this though he could probably hear it his eyes were staring at the carpet below him it had been light blue in colour but was now looking like someone had dropped a mug of tea no milk on it an interesting effect in the films blood always looks like paint yes but it depends what you mix it with doesnt it red and blue would seem to make tea no milk suddenly i felt thirsty and i needed the toilet too there was milk in the fridge i poured half a carton down my throat and was putting it back in the fridge when i thought what the hell i tossed it towards the sink milk splattered the work surfaces and poured on to the linoleum floor i left the fridge door open after visiting the toilet i wandered back into the livingroom took the crowbar from my holdall and left the house closing the door after me checking that no one was around i attacked the door jamb splintering wood and forcing my way back inside it didnt make any noise and looked pretty good i closed the door as best i could tipped the telephone table in the hall on to its side and returned to the livingroom his face was on the floor now deathly pale as you might imagine in fact he looked worse than a few of the corpses ive seen not long now i told him i was all but done but decided maybe i should take a recce upstairs i opened his bedside cupboard inside a wooden box there was a wad of folded banknotes tens and twenties i slipped off the rubber band from around them chucked it and the box on to the bed and stuffed the money in my pocket lets call it a tip its not that i wasnt being paid enough but i knew damned fine that if i didnt pocket it some dozy young copper first on the scene would do just the same it was a pretty sad little room this bedroom there were porn mags on the floor very few decent clothes in the wardrobe a couple of empty whisky bottles under the bed along with an unused pack of vendingmachine condoms a transistor radio lying on a chair with some dirty laundry no framed photos of family no holiday souvenirs no paintings on the walls hed been on medication there were four little bottles of pills on the bedside cabinet nerves probably informers often suffer from nerves it comes of waiting for that monster to jump out of the bushes at them ok so after theyve given their evidence and mr big or more usually mr middling has been locked away theyre given protection they get new identities some cash up front a roof over their heads even a job all this comes to pass but theyve got to leave the only life theyve known no contact with friends or family this guy downstairs whose name was eddie by the way his wife left him a lot of the wives do sad eh and these informers they do all this just to save themselves from a few years in the clink the police are good at spotting the weak ones the ones who might just turn they work on them exaggerating the sentences theyre going to get exaggerating the prizes awaiting under the witness protection scheme the witless protection scheme ive heard it called its all psychology and bullshit but it sometimes works often though a jury will throw the evidence out anyway the defence counsels line is always the same can you rely on the evidence of a man who himself is so heavily implicated in these serious crimes and who is giving evidence solely to save his own skin like i say sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt i went downstairs and crouched over the body it was a body now no question of that well id let it cool for a little while ten or fifteen minutes now that i thought of it id broken open the door too soon someone might come along and notice a slight error but an error all the same too late for regrets though the course was set now so i went back to the fridge and lifted out what was left of a roast chicken there was a leg with some meat on it so i chewed that for a while standing in the livingroom watching through the net curtains as the sun broke from behind some cloud want to know what blood smells like it smells like cold chicken grease i stuffed the bones into the kitchen bin id stripped them clean i didnt want to leave behind any teethmarks anything the forensic scientists could begin to work with not that anyone would be working too hard on this case people like me were seldom caught after a hit we just melt into the background were as ordinary as you are i dont mean that we seem to be ordinary that we make a show of looking ordinary i mean we are ordinary these hit men and assassins you read about in novels they go around all day and all night like arnold schwarzenegger but in real life that would get them noticed the last thing you want to be if youre like me is noticed you want to blend into the scenery im running on again arent i it was just about time a final lingering inspection another visit to the toilet i checked myself in the bathroom mirror i looked fine i took my clothes back out of the holdall and stripped off the overalls gloves trainers my shoes were black brogues with new soles and heels i checked myself again in the mirror as i knotted my tie and put on my jacket no telltale flecks of blood on my cheeks or forehead i washed my hands without using soap the fragrance might be identifiable and dried them on toilet paper which i flushed away i zipped the holdall shut picked it up and walked back through the livingroom ciao eddie into the small hallway and out of the house potentially this was the most dangerous part of the whole job as i walked down the path i was pretty well hidden from view by the hedge the hedge eddie must have considered a comfort a barrier between him and prying eyes at the pavement i didnt pause there was no one around anyway no one at all as i walked briskly around the corner to where id parked my car locked the holdall in the boot and started the engine later that afternoon i returned to the house i didnt park on a side street this time i drew right up to the kerb in front of the hedge well as close as i could get anyway there were still no signs of activity in any of the other houses either the neighbours kept themselves to themselves or else they all had places to be i gave my engine a final loud rev before turning it off and slammed the door noisily after me i was wearing a black leather jacket and cream chinos rather than a suit and different shoes plain brown rather than the black brogues just in case someone had seen me often witnesses saw the clothes not the face the real professionals didnt bother with hair dyes false moustaches and the like they just wore clothes they wouldnt normally wear i walked slowly up the path studying the terrain either side then stopped at the door examining the splintered jamb the door was closed but suddenly swung open from inside two men looked at me i stood aside to let them pass and walked into the house the telephone table in the hall was still lying on its side the phone beside it though someone had replaced the receiver the body was where id left it hed been so surprised to see me at his door not wary just surprised visiting the area id explained thought id look in hed led me into the livingroom and id asked to use his loo maybe he wondered why i took the holdall with me maybe he didnt there could have been anything in it after all anything there were two men crouching over the body now and more men in the bathroom the kitchen walking around upstairs nobody was saying anything much you can appreciate why one of the men stood up and stared at me i was surveying the scene bottles and glasses everywhere cushions where id dropped them a carpet patterned with blood whats happened here i asked unnecessarily well sir the detective constable smiled a rueful smile looks like someone got to eddie a deep hole i used to be a road digger which is to say i dug up roads for a living these days im a repair effecter for the councils highways department i still dig up roads sorry highways only now it sounds better doesnt it they tell me theres some guy in an office somewhere whose job is thinking up posh names for people like me for the rubbish collectors and street sweepers and toilet attendants usually they manage to stick in the word environmental somewhere this way were made to feel important must be some job that thinking up posh names i wonder what job title hes given himself environmental title coordination executive eh they call me sam the spade theres supposed to be a joke there but i dont get it i got the name because after robbies got to work with the pneumatic drill i get in about things with the spade and clear out everything hes broken up robbies called the driller killer that was the name of an old horror video i never saw it myself i tried working with the pneumatic drill a few times theres more pay if you operate the drill you become skilled rather than unskilled labour but after fifteen seconds i could feel the fillings popping out of my teeth even now my spine aches in bed at night too much sex the boys say ha ha now daintry his title would be something like last hope cash dispensation executive or in the old parlance a plain money lender nobody remembers daintrys first name he shrugged it off some time back when he was a teenager and he hasnt been a teenager for a few years and some hes the guy you go to on a friday or saturday for a few quid to see you through the weekend and come the following weeks dole cheque or if youre one of the fortunate few pay packet daintryll be waiting while you cash it his hand out for the money he loaned plus a whack of interest while youre only too happy to see daintry before the weekend youre not so happy about him still being around after the weekend you dont want to pay him back certainly not the interest but you do inevitably you do pay him back because hes a persistent sort of fellow with a good line in colourful threats and a ready abundance of physical persuasion techniques i think the chief reason people didnt like daintry was that he never made anything of himself i mean he still lived on the same estate as his clients albeit in one of the twostorey houses rather than the blocks of flats his front garden was a jungle his window panes filthy and the inside of his house a thing of horror he dressed in cheap clothes which hung off him he wouldnt shave for days his hair always needed washing youre getting the picture eh me when im not working im a neat and tidy sort of guy my mums friends the women she gossips with theyre always shaking their heads and asking how come i never found myself a girl they speak about me in the past tense like that like im not going to find one now on the contrary im thirtyeight and all my friends have split up with their wives by now so there are more and more single women my age appearing around the estate its only a question of time soon itll be brendas turn shell leave harry or hell kick her out no kids so thats not a problem i hear gossip that their arguments are getting louder and louder and more frequent there are threats too late at night after a good drink down at the club im leaving you no youre not yes i am well get the hell out then ill be back for my stuff on you go i wouldnt give you the satisfaction well stay if you like just like a ballet eh well i think so anyway ive been waiting for brenda for a long time i can wait a little longer im certainly a more attractive prospect than daintry whod move in with him nobody i can tell you hes a loner no friends just people he might drink with hell sometimes buy a drink for a few of the harder cases then get them to put the frighteners on some latepayer whos either getting cocky or else talking about going to the police not that the police would do anything what around here if theyre not in daintrys pocket they either dont care about the place anyway or else are scared to come near daintry did a guy in once inside the club a sunday afternoon too stabbed him in the toilets police came talked to everyone in the club nobodyd seen anything daintry may be a bastard but hes our bastard besides theres always a reason if you havent crossed him youre none of his business and hed better not be any of yours i knew him of course oh yeah we went to school together same class all the way from five to sixteen years old he was never quite as good as me at the subjects but he was quiet and pretty well behaved until about fifteen a switch flipped in his brain at fifteen actually im lying he was always better than me at arithmetic so i suppose he was cut out for a career as a money lender or as he once described himself a bank manager with menaces god knows how many people hes murdered cant be that many or wed all have noticed thats why i thought all the information i used to give him was just part of his act he knew word would get around about what he was asking me for and those whispers and rumours would strengthen his reputation thats what i always thought i never took it seriously as a result i tapped him for a loan once or twice and he never charged me a penny he also bought me a few drinks and once provided a van when i wanted to sell the piano see he wasnt all bad he had his good side if it hadnt been for him wed never have shifted that piano and itd still be sitting there in the livingroom reminding my mother of the tunes dad used to play on it tunes shed hum late into the night and then again at the crack of dawn it seemed strange at first that hed want to see me he would come over to me in pubs and sling his arm around my neck asking if i was all right patting me and ordering the same again wed hardly spoken more than a sentence at a time to one another since leaving school but now he was smiles and reminiscences and all interested in my job of work i just dig holes he nodded and thats important work believe me without the likes of you my cars suspension would be shot to hell of course his cars suspension was shot to hell it was a ford capri with tinted windows an air duct and a spoiler it was a losers car with dark green nylon fur on the dashboard and the door panels the wheel arches were history long since eaten by rust yet every year without fail it passed its mot the coincidence was the garage mechanic was a regular client of daintrys i could get a new car daintry said but it gets me from a back to a again so whats the point there was something in this he seldom left the estate he lived there shopped there hed been born there and hed die there he never took a holiday not even a weekend away and he never ever ventured south of the river he spent all his free time watching videos the guy who runs the video shop reckoned daintry had seen every film in the shop a dozen times over he knows their numbers off by heart he did know lots about movies running time director writer supporting actor he was always a hot contender when the club ran its trivia quiz he sat in that smelly house of his with the curtains shut and a blue light flickering he was a film junkie and somehow he managed to spend all his money on them he must have done or what else did he do with it his rolex was a fake lighter than air when you picked it up and probably his gold jewellery was fake too maybe somewhere theres a secret bank account with thousands salted away but i dont think so dont ask me why i just dont think so roadworks thats the information i passed on to daintry thats what he wanted to talk to me about roadworks major roadworks you know the sort of thing hed say anywhere where youre digging a big hole maybe building a flyover or improving drainage major roadworks sure enough i had access to this sort of information i just had to listen to the various crews talking about what they were working on and where they were doing the work over tea and biscuits in the canteen i could earn myself a few drinks and a pint glass of goodwill how deep does that need to be daintry would ask i dont know eight maybe ten feet by what maybe three long the same wide and hed nod this was early in the game and i was slow catching on youre probably much faster right so you know why he was asking but i was puzzled the first couple of times i mean i thought maybe he was interested in the whats it the infrastructure he wanted to see improvements then it dawned on me no what he wanted to see were big holes holes that would be filled in with concrete and covered over with huge immovable objects like bridge supports for example holes where bodies could be hidden i didnt say anything but i knew thats what we were talking about we were talking about human resource disposal and daintry knew that i knew hed wink from behind his cigarette smoke using those creased stinging eyes of his managing to look a little like his idol robert de niro in goodfellas thats what daintry would say hed always be making physical comparisons like that me i thought he was much more of a joe pesci but i didnt tell him that i didnt even tell him that pesci isnt pronounced pesky he knew id blab about our little dialogues and i did casually like and word spread and suddenly daintry was a man to be feared but he wasnt really he was just stupid with a low flashpoint and if you wanted to know what sort of mood he was going to be in you only had to visit the video shop hes taken out goodfellas and godfather so you knew there was trouble coming now you really didnt want to cross him but if hed taken out softcore or a steve martin or even some early brando everything was going to be all right he must have been on a gangster high the night he went round to speak with mr and mrs mcandrew in his time mr mcandrew had been a bit of a lad himself but he was in his late seventies with a wife ten years younger they lived in one of the estates nicer houses theyd bought it from the council and had installed a fancy front door doubleglazed windows you name it and all the glass was that leaded crisscross stuff it wasnt cheap these days mr mcandrew spent all his time in the garden at the front of the house he had some beautiful flower beds with the back garden given over to vegetables in the summer you saw him playing football with his grandchildren just like as somebody pointed out marlon brando in the godfather this was apt in its way since like i say despite the gardening mr mcandrews hands were probably cleaner these days than they had been in the past how he got to owe daintry money i do not know but daintry believe me would have been only too happy to lend there was mcandrews reputation for a start plus the mcandrews seemed prosperous enough he was sure to see his money and interest returned but not so whether out of sheer cussedness or because he really couldnt pay mcandrew had been holding out on daintry i saw it as a struggle between the old gangster and the new maybe daintry did too whatever one night he walked into the mcandrews house and beat up mrs mcandrew in front of her husband he had two heavies with him one to hold mr mcandrew one to hold mrs mcandrew either one of them could have dropped dead of a heart attack right then and there there were murmurs in the street the next day and for days afterwards daintry it was felt had overstepped the mark he was out of order to him it was merely business and hed gotten the money from mcandrew so the case was closed but he now found himself shorter of friends than ever before which is probably why he turned to me when he wanted the favour done simply he couldnt get anyone else to do it you want me to what hed told me to meet him in the childrens playpark we walked around the path there was no one else in the park it was a battlefield all broken glass and rocks dog shit was smeared up and down the chute the swings had been wrapped around themselves until they couldnt be reached the roundabout had disappeared one night leaving only a metal stump in place youd be safer sending your kids to play on the north circular its quite simple daintry said i want you to get rid of a package for me theres good money in it how much money a hundred i paused at that a hundred pounds just to dispose of a package but youll need a deep hole said daintry yeah of course it was that kind of package i wondered who it was there was a story going around that daintry had set up a nice little disposal operation which dealt with human resource waste from miles around villains as far away as watford and luton were bringing packages for him to dispose of but it was just a story just one of many a hundred i said nodding all right one twentyfive but its got to be tonight i knew just the hole they were building a new footbridge over the north circular over to the west near wembley i knew the gang wouldnt be working nightshift the job wasnt that urgent and who could afford the shift bonus these days thered be a few deep holes there all right and while the gang might notice a big black binbag at the bottom of one of them they wouldnt do anything about it people were always dumping rubbish down the holes it all got covered over with concrete gone and quite forgotten i hadnt seen a dead body before and i didnt intend seeing one now so i insisted it was all wrapped up before id stick it in the carboot daintry and i stood in the lockup he rented and looked down at the black binliner its not so big is it i said i broke the rigor mortis he explained that way you can get it into the car i nodded and went outside to throw up i felt better after that curried chicken never did agree with me im not sure i can do it i said wiping my mouth daintry was ready for me ah thats a pity he stuck his hands in his pockets studying the tips of his shoes hows your old mum by the way keeping well is she shes fine yeah i stared at him what do you mean nothing nothing lets hope her good health continues he looked up at me a glint in his eye still fancy brenda who says i do he laughed common knowledge must be the way your trousers bulge whenever you see her shadow thats rubbish she seems well enough too the marriage is a bit shaky but what can you expect that harry of hers is a monster daintry paused fingering his thin gold neckchain i wouldnt be surprised if he took a tap to the skull one of these dark nights oh he shrugged just a guess pity you cant he touched the binbag with his shoe you know and he smiled we loaded the bag together it wasnt heavy and was easy enough to manoeuvre i could feel a foot and a leg or maybe a hand and arm i tried not to think about it imagine him threatening my old mum he was lucky im not quick to ignite not like him or itdve been broken nose city and hospital cuisine but what he said about brendas husband put thoughts of my mum right out of my head we closed the boot and i went to lock it hes not going to make a run for it daintry said i suppose not i admitted but i locked the boot anyway then the car wouldnt start and when it did start it kept cutting out like the engine was flooding or something maybe a block in the fuel line id let it get very low before the last fill of petrol there might be a lot of rubbish swilling around in the tank after a couple of miles it cut out on me at some traffic lights in dalston i rolled down my window and waved for the cars behind me to pass i was content to sit for a few moments and let everything settle my stomach included one car stopped alongside me and jesus wouldnt you know it it was a cop car everything all right the cop in the passenger seat called yeah just stalled you cant sit there for ever no if it doesnt start next go push your car to the side of the road yeah sure he made no move to leave now the driver was looking at me too and traffic was building up behind us nobody sounded their horn everyone could see that a cop car was talking with the driver of another vehicle sweat tickled my ears i turned the ignition resisting the temptation to pump the accelerator the engine rumbled then came to life i grinned at the cops and started forwards going through an amber light they could probably arrest me for that it was five minutes before i stopped staring in the rearview mirror but i couldnt see them theyd turned off somewhere i let all my fear and tension out in a rasping scream then remembered the window was still rolled down i wound it back up again i decided not to go straight to the bridgesite but to drive around a bit let all the traffic clear along with my head i pulled into a busstop just before the north circular and changed into my work clothes that way i wouldnt look suspicious good thinking eh it was my own idea one daintry had appreciated i had a question for him now and the question was why wasnt he doing this himself but he wasnt around to answer it and i knew the answer anyway hed rather pay someone else to do dangerous jobs oh yes it was dangerous i knew that now worth a lot more than a hundred and twentyfive nicker sixty of which was already in my pocket in the shape of dirty old pound notes repayments doubtless from daintrys punters grubby money but still money i hoped it hadnt come from the mcandrews i sat at the busstop for a while a car pulled in behind me not a police car this time just an ordinary car i heard the drivers door slam shut footsteps a tap at my window i looked out the man was bald and middleaged dressed in suit and tie a lower executive look a sales rep maybe that sort of person he was smiling in a friendly enough sort of fashion and if he wanted to steal my car and jemmy open the boot well that was fine too i wound down my window yeah i think i missed my turning he said can you tell me where we are roughly roughly i said roughly were about a mile north of wembley and thats west london his accent wasnt quite english not southern english welsh or a geordie or a scouser maybe about as west as you can get i told him yeah the wild west i cant be too far away then i want st johns wood thats west too isnt it yeah not far at all these poor sods you came across them a lot in my line of work new to the city and pleading directions getting hot and a bit crazy as the signposts and oneways led them further into the maze i felt sorry for them a lot of the time it wasnt their fault so i took my time as i directed him towards harlesden miles away from where he wanted to be its a short cut i told him he seemed pleased to have some local knowledge he went back to his car and sounded his horn in thank you as he drove off i know that was a bit naughty of me wasnt it well there you go that was my spot of devilry for the night i started my own car and headed back on to the road there was a sign off saying works access only so i signalled and drove between two rows of striped traffic cones then i stopped the car there were no other cars around just the dark shapes of earthmoving equipment and cement mixers fine and dandy cars and lorries roared past but they didnt give me a seconds notice they werent about to slow down enough to take in any of the scene the existing overpass and builtup verges hid me pretty well from civilisation before unloading the package i went for a recce taking my torch with me and of course there were no decent holes to be found theyd been filled in already the concrete was hard long metal rods poking out of it like the prongs on a fork there were a few shallow cuts in the earth but nothing like deep enough for the purpose hells teeth and gums i went back to the car thinking suddenly how useful a carphone would be i wanted to speak to daintry i wanted to ask him what to do a police car went past i saw its brake lights glow theyd noticed my car but they didnt stop no but they might come back round again i started the car and headed out on to the carriageway only a few minutes later there was a police car behind me he sat on my tail for a while then signalled to overtake drawing level with me and staying there the passenger checked me out they were almost certainly the ones whod seen me parked back at the bridgesite the passenger saw that i was wearing overalls and a standardissue workjacket i sort of waved at him he spoke to the driver and the patrol car accelerated away lucky for me he hadnt seen the tears in my eyes i was terrified and bursting for a piss i knew that i had to get off this road my brain was numb i couldnt think of another place to dump the body i didnt want to think about it at all i just wanted rid of it i think i saw the travelling salesman hurtle past fleeing harlesden he was heading out of town i came off the north circular and just drove around crawling eastwards until i knew the streets so well it was like remote control i knew exactly where id effected repairs and where repairs were still waiting to be carried out there was one pothole on a sharp bend that could buckle a wheel that was down as a priority and would probably be started on tomorrow i calmed myself a little with memories of holes dug and holes filled in the rich aroma of hot tarmac the jokes yelled out by the driller killer id never worked out why hed try telling jokes to someone wearing industrial ear protectors beside a pneumatic drill seeking safety i came back into the estate i felt better immediately my head clearing i knew what i had to do i had to face up to daintry id give him back the money of course less a quid or two for petrol and id explain that nowhere was safe mission impossible i didnt know what hed do it depended on whether tonight was a goodfellas night or not he might slap me about a bit he might stop buying me drinks he might do something to my mum or to brenda id have to talk to him maybe we could do a deal maybe id have to kill him yeah then id just have the two bodies to worry about in order to stop worrying about the first i stopped by the lockup this was one of a culdesac of identical garages next to some wasteland which had been planted with trees and was now termed a conservation area the man in the high street had certainly conserved his energy thinking up that one there were no kids about so i used a rock to break the lock then hauled the door open with my crowbar i stopped for a moment and wondered what i was going to do now id meant to leave the body in the garage but id had to break the lock to get in so now if i left the body there anybody at all could wander along and find it but then i thought this is daintrys garage everybody knows it and nobody in their right mind would dare trespass so i hauled the package inside closed the door again and left a rock in front of it i was confident id done my best so now it was time to go talk with daintry the easy part of the evening was past but first i went home i dont know why i just wanted to see my mum we used to be on the eleventh floor but theyd moved us eventually to the third because the lifts kept breaking and mum couldnt climb eleven flights i took the stairs tonight relieved not to find any of the local kids shooting up or shagging between floors mum was sitting with mrs gregg from along the hall they were talking about mrs mcandrew story she gave her doctor was she fell down the stairs well i think its a shame mum looked up and saw me i thought youd be down the club not tonight mum well that makes a change hallo mrs gregg hallo love theres a band on tonight you know where she rolled her eyes at the club plenty of lovely girls too ill bet they wanted rid of me i nodded just going to my room wont be long i lay on my bed the same bed id slept in since i was well since before i could remember the room had been painted and papered in the last year i stared at the wallpaper lying on one side and then on the other this room it occurred to me was probably the size of a prison cell it might even be a bit smaller what was it eight feet square but id always felt comfortable enough here i heard my mum laughing at something mrs gregg said and pop music from the flat downstairs these werent very solid flats thin walls and floors theyd knock our block down one of these days i liked it well enough though i didnt want to lose it i didnt want to lose my mum i decided that i was probably going to have to kill daintry i packed some clothes into a black holdall just holding back the tears what would i say to my mum ive got to go away for a while ill phone you when i can i recalled all the stories id heard about daintry how some guy from trading standards had been tailing him and was sitting in his car at the side of the road by the shops when a sawnoff shotgun appeared in the window and a voice told him to get the hell out of there pronto guns and knives knuckledusters and a machete just stories just stories i knew he wouldnt be expecting me to try anything hed open his door hed let me in hed turn his back to lead me through to the livingroom thats when id do it when his back was turned it was the only safe and certain time i could think of anything else and i reckoned id lose my bottle i left the holdall on my bed and went through to the kitchen i took time at the open drawer choosing my knife nothing too grand just a simple fourinch blade at the end of a wooden handle i stuck it in my pocket just nipping out for some fresh air mum bye then see you and that was that i walked back down the echoing stairwell with my mind set on murder it wasnt like the films it was just well ordinary like i was going to fetch fish and chips or something i kept my hand on the knife handle i wanted to feel comfortable with it but my legs were a bit shaky i had to keep locking them at the knees holding on to a wall or a lamppost and taking deep breaths it was a fiveminute walk to daintrys but i managed to stretch it to ten i passed a couple of people i vaguely knew but didnt stop to talk i didnt trust my teeth not to chatter my jaw not to lock and to tell you the truth i was relieved to see that there was someone standing on the doorstep another visitor i felt my whole body relax the man crouched to peer through the letter box then knocked again as i walked down the path towards him i saw that he was tall and wellbuilt with a black leather jacket and short black hair isnt he in the man turned his head slowly towards me i didnt like the look of his face it was grey and hard like the side of a house doesnt look like it he said any idea where hed be he was standing up straight now his head hanging down over mine police i thought for a second but he wasnt police i swallowed i started to shake my head but then i had an idea i released my grip on the knife if hes not in hes probably down the club i said do you know where it is no go back down to the bottom of the road take a left and when you come to the shops its up a side road between the launderette and the chip shop he studied me thanks no problem i said you know what he looks like he nodded in perfect slow motion he never took his eyes off me right then i said oh and you might have to park outside the shops the carparks usually full when theres a band on theres a band in the club i smiled it gets noisy you can hardly hear a word thats said to you even in the toilets is that so yes i said that is so then i walked back down the path and gave him a slight wave as i headed for home i made sure i walked home too i didnt want him thinking i was on my way to the club ahead of him short walk mum said she was pouring tea for mrs gregg bit cold cold squeaked mrs gregg a lad your age shouldnt feel the cold have you seen my knife mum asked she was looking down at the cake shed made it was on one of the better plates and hadnt been cut yet i brought the knife out of my pocket here you are mum whats it doing in your pocket the lock on the carboots not working id to cut some string to tie it shut do you want some tea i shook my head ill leave you to it i said im off to bed it was the talk of the estate the next morning how daintry had been knifed to death in a toilet cubicle just as the band were finishing their encore they were some sixties fourpiece still performing long past their sellby thats what people said who were there and theyd compensated for a lack of ability by cranking the sound system all the way up you not only couldnt hear yourself think you couldnt think i suppose they have to make a living as best they can we all do it was the assistant manager who found daintry he was doing his nightly check of the club to see how many drunks had managed to fall asleep in how many hidden places nobody used the end cubicle of the gents much it didnt have any toilet seat but there sat daintry not caring any more about the lack of amenities police were called staff and clientele interviewed but no one had anything much to say well not to the police at any rate but there was plenty of gossip on the streets and in the shops and slowly a story emerged mr mcandrew remember had been a lad at one time he was rumoured still to have a few contacts a few friends who owed him or maybe he just stumped up cash whatever everyone knew mr mcandrew had put out the contract on daintry and as also agreed good riddance to him on a friday night too so anyone whod tapped him for a loan could see the sun rise on monday morning with a big wide smile meantime the body was found in daintrys lockup well the police knew who was responsible for that didnt they though they did wonder about the broken lock kids most likely intent on burglary but doing a runner when they saw the corpse seemed feasible to me too mr mcandrew eh i watched him more closely after that he still looked to me like a nice old man but then it was only a story after all only one of many me i had other things to think about i knew i could do it now i could take brenda away from harry dont ask me why i feel so sure i just do natural selection hellish about anthony christ isnt it six years six

leonard where would we be without you eh always joking am i you know you are paul said lighting a cigarette and passing the pack on were all gutted its a natural reaction what is eh good man matthew put them down there and chalk up another for yourself paul reached into his pocket for the wallet where did all that cash come from by the way leonard asked never you mind paul winked and handed matthew another ten matthew went back to the till you know paul said quietly i sometimes wonder how much matthew hears you mean how much he listens yes matthews all right well he knows everything we talk about in here we never talk jobs dont get me wrong im not saying hed you know whats going on thomas asked appearing not to follow things at all just a natural reaction said philip he was watching

agreed calm again its always too hot in here you could heat pies without a microwave one of those ceiling fans would be nice paul said there used to be one didnt there did there this was before your

neat christ dont be so look just do what i like irnbru me too said philip ach everyone likes irnbru but with vodka i used to drink it that way at school leonard said id steal some voddy from the drinks cabinet and mix it in an irnbru bottle drinks cabinet eh your family had class leonard didnt stop him turning into a criminal at an early age i was born a criminal isnt everybody philip said deep into his drink no said leonard some people have to learn anthony wasnt a born criminal you dont think so he told me so he ran with his big brothers gang he was okay till he started running with them his brother donny thats the one you dont see him in here hes gone away said thomas been away a while theres a lot you dont see in here any more well were here said paul and thats all that matters aye were always here for ever and ever amen where did you get that money though paul paul winked again is it bothering you leonard was it the geegees thomas asked lottery dogs pools ill bet it was a betting thing youd lose your money now either stop asking or stop taking drinks off me thomas laughed nobodyd be that daft no what about you leonard what about me nothing said paul no leonard persisted what is it somethings stuck up your arse and id like to know what it is paul looked amazed me theres nothing bothering me pal what about you leonardo here we go again said philip just cool it compadres youre right philip said paul as ever how come youre always right you never lose your rag do you youre a calm sort controlled isnt he lads paul tapped his own brow there was a sheen of sweat on it but we know theres a lot going on in that head of his its the quiet ones you have to watch said thomas thomas youll never say a truer word out of the mouths of babes as they say jesus philip are you finished already its hot philip said a furnace this thirst philip added i cant seem to shake it christ matthew paul called do something will you like what open the fridge door or something start putting ice in the drinks something were out of ice youll be out of a job if we take our custom elsewhere matthew smiled you four arent going anywhere no talking back to the customers matthew paul said pointing a finger leonard ready for another ive two in front of me apply yourself to the task well have the same again matthew not for me said leonard play the game leonardo give him another matthew the barman walked back to the optics youre wasting your money paul its my money youll be skint again tomorrow who cares about tomorrow suit yourself i always do this is very pleasant said philip its not meant to be pleasant paul said its a wake remember how can i forget levity ill becomes you filipi whats levity thomas asked lightness leonard explained thomas nodded like being light in the head lot of levity about here paul said winking maybe im ill said philip loosening his collar my mouths parched all day could be a lot of reasons for that paul said could be nerves nerves i saw something yesterday thomas said on the telly it was about these insects that eat each other or maybe it was their babies they ate paul and philip looked at one another the way they did when thomas said this sort of thing thats not so rare leonard told thomas his eyes on paul youre a smart one arent you said paul leonard shook his head drained one of his vodkas its all relative he said then he slipped off his barstool first one tonight said paul smiling and as usual its leonard three shorts hes put away but hes bursting for a piss you need a bladder transplant leonardo leonard stopped in front of paul maybe its just nerves paul he said nobody said anything as he left the bar the toilet was reeking there was the constant hiss of a broken ballcock and names scratched into the paint on the dark red wall the urinal was a stainless steel trough it was cooler in here though damp and cool leonard lit a cigarette for himself he reckoned if it werent for the smell this place would be a preferable alternative to the bar itself freezing in winter though bloody awful pub altogether why didnt they just leave well as somebody had said where else was there the door creaked open and matthew came in matthew leonard the barman went to the urinal and unzipped himself loudly his stare was high up the wall when he spoke theyre out for your blood what those three well paul specifically but hell carry the other two hes buying after all what have i done come on leonard paul thinks you shopped anthony then how come hes the one with the money if it was a cop payoff he wouldnt be flashing it about get out right now just run for it ive never run in my life its up to you matthew zipped himself up but if i was in your shoes id be offski where would i go i dont know there was another creak as the door opened paul came in first philip and thomas were right behind him the door closed quietly after them whats that youre saying matthew nothing paul youre a great one for talking arent you no a gossip a right wee sweetiewife talkings in your blood no no this had the look of a snitches convention when i walked in guilty looks all round matthew tried shaking his head easy to confuse guilt with fear leonard said quietly know where that money came from paul said he wasnt speaking to any one of them in particular his eyes were on his shoes examining the toes ill tell you it came from anthony anthony thomas said why did he give you that much money i mean hes usually tight i mean careful hes canny with his money thomass voice died away paul half turned his head and gave thomas a smile full of sympathy you arent half going on tonight thomasino not like you at all its not like him at all is it philip philip was wiping his face with the rollertowel no its not he said hes usually quiet isnt he quiet as the grave philip agreed and even someone as thick as you sometimes appear to be thomas has got to have an inkling why anthony would give me a load of cash he paused dont you want to know philip philip shrugged youll tell us when youre ready paul was smiling you never change philip always the same face the same voice nothing out of place i bet you could do away with your granny and wed never know about it not by looking at you he paused again except tonight youre sweating why is that i think im coming down with something well well see to it you get a doctor when this is over matthew started to open the door shut it paul smiled dont want to let the heat in do we he turned to leonard anthony gave me the money because he wants someone taken care of someone in particular he told me once i was sure in my mind i was to start earning the cash thats what anthony told me in other words he doesnt know thats right leonard funny he asked you he trusts me but what if hes wrong paolo what if hes wrong about that leonard looked to the other men in the cramped space matthew philip thomas what if you grassed him up and we found out theyd all been looking nervous now they were looking interested what would we do yes thomas said quietly getting it what would we do philip was nodding slowly and matthew straightened his back adding an inch to his height theres only one guilty party here leonard paul was saying you really believe that im not saying its you paul was staring into leonards eyes he saw red paint reflected from the walls youre saying its one of us paul the rest of us dont like that leonard took a step forwards pauls hand went to his jacket pocket philip was behind him his arms stretching thomass hands were fists matthew leaned against the door keeping it closed outside it was dark no streetlight no traffic you would bet that it couldnt get any darker but youd be wrong people most often are facing the music an inspector rebus story an unmarked police car interesting phrase that inspector john rebuss car punchdrunk and weatherbeaten scarred and mauled would still merit description as unmarked despite the copious evidence to the contrary oilyhanded mechanics stifled grins whenever he waddled into a forecourt garage proprietors adjusted the thick gold rings on their fingers and reached for the calculator still there were times when the old warhorse came in handy it might or might not be unmarked unremarkable it certainly was even the most cynical lawbreaker would hardly expect cid to spend their time sitting around in a breakersyard special rebuss car was a must for undercover work the only problem coming if the villains decided to make a run for it then even the most elderly and infirm could outpace it but its a stayer rebus would say in mitigation he sat now the drivingseat so used to his shape that it formed a mould around him stroking the steeringwheel with his hands there was a loud sigh from the passenger seat and detective sergeant brian holmes repeated his question why have we stopped rebus looked around him they were parked by the side of queensferry street only a couple of hundred yards from princes streets west end it was early afternoon overcast but dry the gusts of wind blowing in from the firth of forth were probably keeping the rain away the corner of princes street where frasers department store and the caledonian hotel tried to outstare one another caught the winds and whipped them against unsuspecting shoppers who could be seen dazed and numb making their way afterwards along queensferry street in search of coffee and shortcake rebus gave the pedestrians a look of pity holmes sighed again he could murder a pot of tea and some fruit scones with butter do you know brian rebus began in all the years ive been in edinburgh ive never been called to any sort of a crime on this street he slapped the steeringwheel for emphasis not once maybe they should put up a plaque suggested holmes rebus almost smiled maybe they should is that why were sitting here you want to break your duck holmes glanced into the teashop window then away again quickly licking dry lips it might take a while you know he said it might brian but then again rebus tapped out a tattoo on the steeringwheel holmes was beginning to regret his own enthusiasm hadnt rebus tried to deter him from coming out for this drive not that theyd driven much but anything holmes reasoned was better than catching up on paperwork well just about anything whats the longest time youve been on a stakeout he asked making conversation a week said rebus protection racket run from a pub down near powderhall it was a joint operation with trading standards we spent five days pretending to be on the broo playing pool all day did you get a result we beat them at pool rebus said there was a yell from a shop doorway just as a young man was sprinting across the road in front of their car the young man was carrying a black metal box the person whod called out did so again stop him thief stop him the man in the shop doorway was waving pointing towards the sprinter holmes looked towards rebus seemed about to say something but decided against it come on then he said rebus started the cars engine signalled and moved out into the traffic holmes was focusing through the windscreen i can see him put your foot down put your foot down sir rebus said calmly dont worry brian hell hes turning into randolph place rebus signalled again brought the car across the oncoming traffic and turned into the dead end that was randolph place only while it was a dead end for cars there were pedestrian passages either side of west register house the young man carrying the narrow box under his arm turned into one of the passages rebus pulled to a halt holmes had the car door open before it had stopped and leapt out ready to follow on foot cut him off he yelled meaning for rebus to drive back on to queensferry street around hope street and into charlotte square where the passage emerged cut him off sir mouthed rebus he did a careful threepoint turn and just as carefully moved back out into traffic held to a crawl by traffic lights by the time he reached charlotte square and the front of west register house holmes was shrugging his shoulders and flapping his arms rebus pulled to a stop beside him did you see him holmes asked getting into the car no where have you been anyway a red light holmes looked at him as though he were mad since when had inspector john rebus stopped for a red light well ive lost him anyway not your fault brian holmes looked at him again right he agreed so back to the shop what was it anyway hifi shop i think holmes nodded as rebus moved off again into the traffic yes the box had the look of a piece of hifi some slim rack component theyd find out at the shop but instead of doing a circuit of charlotte square to take them back into queensferry street rebus signalled along george street holmes still catching his breath looked around disbelieving where are we going i thought you were fed up with queensferry street were going back to the station what back to the station but what about relax brian youve got to learn not to fret so much holmes examined his superiors face youre up to something he said at last rebus turned and smiled took you long enough he said but whatever it was rebus wasnt telling back at the station he went straight to the main desk any robberies alec the desk officer had a few the most recent was a snatch at a specialist hifi shop well take that said rebus the desk officer blinked its not much sir just a single item thief did a runner nevertheless alec said rebus a crime has been committed and its our duty to investigate it he turned to head back out to the car is he all right alec asked holmes holmes was beginning to wonder but decided to go along for the ride anyway a cassette deck the proprietor explained nice model too not top of the range but nice topoftherange stuff isnt kept out on the shop floor we keep it in the demonstration rooms holmes was looking at the shelf where the cassette deck had rested there were other decks either side of the gap more expensive decks at that why would he choose that one holmes asked eh well its not the dearest is it and its not even the closest to the door the dealer shrugged kids these days who can tell his thick hair was still tousled from where he had stood in the queensferry street windtunnel yelling against the elements as passersby stared at him i take it youve got insurance mr wardle the question came from rebus who was standing in front of a row of loudspeakers christ yes and it costs enough wardle shrugged look its okay i know how it works points system right anything under a fourpoint crime and you lads dont bother you just fill out the forms so i can claim from the insurance what does this rate one point two at the most rebus blinked perhaps stunned by the use of the word lads in connection with him youve got the serial number mr wardle he said at last thatll give us a start then a description of the thief thats more than we usually get in cases of shopsnatching meantime you might move your stock a bit further back from the door and think about a common chain or circuit alarm so they cant be taken off their shelves okay wardle nodded and be thankful mused rebus after all it couldve been worse it could have been a ramraider he picked up a cd case from where it sat on top of a machine mantovani and his orchestra or even a critic said rebus back at the station holmes sat fuming like a readying volcano or at least like a tin of something flammable left for too long in the sun whatever rebus was up to as per usual he wasnt saying it infuriated holmes now rebus was off at a meeting in the chief supers office nothing very important just routine like the snatch at the hifi shop holmes played the scene through in his mind the stationary car causing an obstruction to the already slow movement of traffic then wardles cry and the youth running across the road jinking between cars the youth had half turned giving holmes a moments view of a cheek speckled with acne cropped spiky hair a skinny runt of a sixteenyearold in faded jeans and trainers pale blue windcheater with a lumberjack shirt hanging loose below its hemline and carrying a hifi component that was neither the easiest piece in the shop to steal nor the dearest wardle had seemed relaxed about the whole affair the insurance would cover it an insurance scam was that it was rebus working on some insurance diddle on the qt maybe as a favour to some investigator from the pru holmes hated the way his superior worked like a greedy if talented footballer hogging the ball dribbling past man after man getting himself trapped beside the byline but still refusing to pass the ball holmes had known a boy at school like that one day fed up holmes had scythed the smartarse down even though theyd been on the same side rebus had known the theft would take place therefore hed been tipped off therefore the thief had been set up there was just one big but to the whole theory rebus had let the thief get away it didnt make sense it didnt make any sense at all right holmes said nodding to himself right you are sir and with that he went off to find the young offender files that evening just after six rebus thought that since he was in the area anyway hed drop into mr wardles home and report the lack of progress on the case it might be that time having passed wardle would remember something else about the snatch some crucial detail the description hed been able to give of the thief had been next to useless it was almost as though he didnt want the hassle didnt want the thief caught well maybe rebus could jog his memory the radio came to life it was a message from ds holmes and when rebus heard it he snarled and turned the car back around towards the city centre it was lucky for holmes so rebus said that the traffic had been heavy the fifteenminute journey back into town being time enough for him to calm down they were in the cid room holmes was seated at his desk hands clasped behind his head rebus was standing over him breathing hard on the desk sat a mattblack cassette deck serial numbers match holmes said just in case you were wondering rebus couldnt quite sound disinterested how did you find him with his hands still behind his head holmes managed a shrug he was on file sir i just sat there flipping through them till i spotted him that acne of his is as good as a tattoo james iain bankhead known to his friends as jib according to the file youve arrested him a couple of times yourself in the past jib bankhead said rebus as though trying to place the name yes rings a bell id have thought itd ring a whole fire station sir you last arrested him three months ago holmes made a show of consulting the file on his desk funny you not recognising him holmes kept his eyes on the file i must be getting old rebus said holmes looked up so what now sir where is he interview room b let him stay there then cant do any harm has he said anything not a word mind you he did seem surprised when i paid him a visit but he kept his mouth shut holmes nodded so what now he repeated now said rebus you come along with me brian ill tell you all about it on the way wardle lived in a flat carved from a detached turnofthecentury house on the southeast outskirts of the city rebus pressed the bell on the wall to the side of the substantial main door after a moment there was the muffled sound of footsteps three clicks as locks were undone and the door opened from within good evening mr wardle said rebus i see youre securityconscious at home at least rebus was nodding towards the door with its three separate keyholes spyhole and security chain you cant be too wardle broke off as he saw what brian holmes was carrying the deck good as new said rebus apart from a few fingerprints wardle opened the door wide come in come in they entered a narrow entrance hall which led to a flight of stairs obviously the ground floor of the house did not belong to wardle he was dressed much as he had been in the shop denims too young for his years an opennecked shirt louder than a wee free sermon and brown moccasins i cant believe it he said leading them towards the stairs i really cant but you could have brought it round to the shop well sir we were going to be passing anyway rebus closed the door noting the steel plate on its inner face the doorsurround too was reinforced with metal plates wardle turned and noticed rebuss interest wait till you see the hifi inspector itll all become clear they could already hear the music the bass was vibrating each step of the stairs you must have sympathetic neighbours rebus remarked shes ninetytwo said wardle deaf as a post i went round to explain to her about the hifi just after i moved in she couldnt hear a word i was saying they were at the top of the stairs now where a smaller hallway led into a huge openplan livingroom and kitchen a sofa and two chairs had been pushed hard back against one wall and there was nothing but space between them and the opposite wall where the hifi system sat with large floorstanding speakers either side of it one rack comprised half a dozen black boxes boasting nothing to rebuss eye but a single red light amplifiers wardle explained turning down the music what all of them preamp and power supply plus an amp for each driver holmes had rested the cassette deck on the floor but wardle moved it away immediately spoils the sound he said if theres an extra piece of gear in the room holmes and rebus stared at one another wardle was in his element now want to hear something whats your taste rolling stones rebus asked sticky fingers exile let it bleed that last one said rebus wardle went over to where a twentyfoot row of lps was standing against the wall beneath the window i thought those went out with the ark said holmes wardle smiled you mean with the cd no vinyls still the best sit down he went over to the turntable and took off the lp hed been playing rebus and holmes sat holmes looked to rebus who nodded holmes got up again actually could i use your loo he asked first right out on the landing said wardle holmes left the room any particular track inspector gimme shelter stated rebus wardle nodded agreement set the needle on the disc rose to his feet and turned up the volume something to drink he asked the room exploded into a wall of sound rebus had heard the phrase wall of sound before well here he was with his nose pressed against it a whisky please he yelled wardle tipped his head towards the hall same for him wardle nodded and went off towards the kitchen area pinned to the sofa as he was rebus looked around the room he had eyes for everything but the hifi not that there was much to see a small coffee table whose surface seemed to be covered with arcana to do with the hifi system cleaningbrushes and such like there were some nicelooking prints on the wall actually one looked like a real painting rather than a print the surface of a swimmingpool someone moving through the depths but no tv no shelves no books no knickknacks no family photos rebus knew wardle was divorced he also knew wardle drove a yregistered porsche he knew quite a lot about wardle but not yet enough a healthy glass of whisky was handed to him wardle placed another on the floor for holmes then returned to the kitchen and came back with a glass for himself he sat down next to rebus what do you think fantastic rebus called back wardle grinned how much would this lot cost me rebus asked hoping wardle wouldnt notice how long holmes had been out of the room about twentyfive k youre joking my flat didnt cost that wardle just laughed but he was glancing towards the livingroom door he looked as though he might be about to say something when the door opened and holmes came in rubbing his hands as though drying them off he smiled sat and toasted wardle with his glass wardle went over to the amplifier to turn down the volume holmes nodded towards rebus rebus toasted no one in particular and finished his drink the volume dipped what was that holmes asked let it bleed i thought my ears would wardle laughed he seemed to be in a particularly good mood maybe it was because of the cassette deck listen he said how the hell did you get that deck back so quickly holmes was about to say something but rebus beat him to it it was abandoned abandoned at the bottom of a flight of stairs on queen street rebus went on he had risen to his feet holmes took the hint and eyes twisted shut gulped down his whisky so you see sir we were just lucky thats all just lucky well thanks again said wardle if you ever want some hifi drop into the shop im sure a discount might be arranged well bear that in mind sir said rebus just dont expect me to put my flat on the market back at the station rebus first of all had jib released then went to his office where he spread the files out across his desk while holmes pulled over a chair then they both sat reading aloud from lists the lists were of stolen goods highquality stuff stolen in the dead of night by real professionals the hauls highly selective hauls came from five addresses the homes of wellpaid middleclass people people with things well worth the stealing five robberies all at dead of night alarm systems disconnected art objects had been taken antiques in one case an entire collection of rare european stamps the housebreakings had occurred at more or less monthly intervals and all within a twentymile radius of central edinburgh the connection between them rebus had explained it to holmes on their way to wardles flat nobody could see any connection apart from the fact that the five victims worked in the west end the chief super asked me to take a look guess what i found theyd all had smart new hifi systems installed up to six months before the breakins systems bought from queensferry audio and installed by mr wardle so hed know what was in each house holmes had said and hed be able to give the alarm system a lookover while he was there too could just be coincidence i know oh yes rebus knew he knew he had only the hunch the coincidence he had no proof no evidence of any kind certainly nothing that would gain him a search warrant as the chief super had been good enough to confirm knowing damned well that rebus would take it further anyway not that this concerned the chief super so long as rebus worked alone and didnt tell his superiors what he was up to that way it was rebuss neck in the noose rebuss pension on the line rebus guessed his only hope was that wardle had kept some of the stolen pieces that some of the stuff was still on his premises hed already had a young dc go into queensferry audio posing as a wouldbe buyer the dc had gone in four times in all once to buy some tapes then to look at hifi then to spend an hour in one of the demo rooms and finally just for a friendly chat hed reported back to rebus that the place was clean no signs of any stolen merchandise no locked rooms or cupboards so then rebus had persuaded a uniformed constable to pose as a neighbourhood watch supervisor he had visited wardle at home not getting past the downstairs hallway but hed been able to report that the place was like fort knox metal door and all rebus had had experience of steelreinforced doors they were favoured by drug dealers so that when police came calling with a sledgehammer for invitation the dealers would have time enough to flush everything away but a hifi dealer with a steel door well that was a new one true twentyfive grands worth of hifi was an investment worth protecting but there were limits not that rebus suspected wardle of actually doing the breaking and entering himself no he just passed the information on to the men rebus really wanted the gang but wardle was the only means of getting at them finally in desperation rebus had turned to jib and jib had done what he was told meaning rebus now owed him a large favour it was all highly irregular unlawful if it came to it if anyone found out well rebus would be making the acquaintance of his local broo office which was why as he explained to holmes hed been keeping so quiet about it the plan was simple jib would run off with something anything watched by rebus to make sure nothing went wrong such as a daring citizens arrest by one or more passersby later rebus would turn up at the shop to investigate the theft then later still he would arrive at wardles flat ostensibly to report the lack of progress if a further visit was needed the cassette deck would be found but now he had holmess help so one visit only should suffice one man keeping wardle busy while the other sniffed around the rooms in the flat they sat now poring over the lists trying to match what holmes had seen in wardles two bedrooms with what had been reported stolen from the five luxury homes carriage clock read rebus nineteenthcentury japanese cigar box seventeenthcentury prints of edinburgh by james gordon a swarbreck lithograph holmes shook his head at the mention of each then read from one of his own lists ladies and gents longines watches a hockney print cartier pen firstedition set of the waverley novels ming vase dresden pieces he looked up would you believe theres even a case of champagne he looked down again and read louis roederer cristal value put at six hundred pounds thats a hundred quid a bottle bet youre glad youre a lager man said rebus he sighed does none of this mean anything to you brian holmes shook his head nothing like any of this in either of the bedrooms rebus cursed under his breath hold on he said what about that print which one the hockney yes have we got a photo of it just this said holmes extracting from the file a page torn from an art gallerys catalogue he handed it to rebus who studied the picture why why echoed rebus because you sat with this painting in front of your nose on wardles livingroom wall i thought it was a real painting but this is it all right he tapped the sheet of paper it says here the prints limited to fifty impressions what number is the stolen one holmes looked down the list fortyfour right said rebus that should be easy enough to confirm he checked his watch what time are you expected home holmes was shaking his head never mind that if youre going back to wardles flat im coming too come on then it was only as they were leaving the office that holmes thought to ask what if it isnt the same number on the print then well just have to face the music said rebus but as it turned out the only one facing the music was wardle and he sang beautifully a pity rebus mused later that he hadnt arranged for a discount on a new hifi system first hed just have to wait for queensferry audios closingdown sale principles of accounts it began as a hobby but then quite quickly the hobby became a career and now he was a professional taking a professionals care in the details of his craft true something had been lost that was the trouble when a hobby became mere business but at least he had the consolation of knowing that business was good he saw himself as a value assessor he assessed the value of an item then collected on it the money being insurance against loss he had always been good at accounts economics business studies he loved those subjects at school hardly believing the sheer thrill of balancing books the sums always came out the same either side of the thick vertical centre line he used similar skills now when assessing each item value of item balanced against risk involved not that he ever damaged an item it hadnt been necessary so far but he was very good at pretending he would damage them he could reduce tough fathers to pleas and weeping and all via the telephone the telephone was his friend not any one particular telephone but all phones spread across the country in a matrix of elegantly anonymous paybooths he made a point of spending not more than a minute in each phone box he used timing each call singlemindedness was his real strength determination of purpose the sixtysecond calls had become his trademark people knew when they were dealing with the minute man the media who had coined the nickname they too were his friends stirring up fear building him into a figure of terror he rewarded them with increased circulation and viewing figures while the police held increasingly ineffectual press conferences requesting information playing tapes theyd made of his voices he used several voices none his own he hadnt spoken more than six words to any of his four young items and even then had disguised his voice actually hed used more than six words with the last one the one whose value now sat before him on the table she had been a talker a good talker too shed recited stories and anecdotes even when she couldnt be sure he was there occasionally hed asked a question something to help him get the story straight in his mind she had given him her stories and now her father had given him all this money tonight with an open bottle of cheapish australian chardonnay on the floor beside his chair with his belly full from the meal hed eaten at the indian on the high street tonight was for reflection at the top of the hour he hit the remote to catch the channel news and saw with some pride that he was the main story or rather the item was she blinked a lot nervousness or perhaps the glare of the lights and flashguns her hair had been washed but she wore no makeup and her face looked pale she had lost a little weight her own fault for not eating everything hed given her shed worked out pretty quickly they usually did that the food was laced with tranqs crushedup sleeping pills but like the others shed given in and eaten anyway sensible when the only other alternative was forcefeeding by rubber tube and plastic funnel she stayed on screen only half a minute refusing to answer the yelled questions now she was replaced by a policeman a caption appeared along the bottom of the screen ch supt thomas lancaster ah yes tom lancaster he raised his glass toasting his adversary even though the polices inefficiency was a constant source of irritation to him and i must praise miss websters calm and her bravery lancaster was saying after her release she was able to help us compile this composite photograph of her kidnapper he put down his glass the photo was onscreen now the man were looking for is five feet seven or eight stocky with blue eyes as you can see he has a round face full lips and thick slightly curly hair either black or very dark brown he whooped he got up and danced shed never set eyes on him he never allowed his items the luxury he looked at himself in the mirror he was six feet tall certainly not stocky he had brown eyes short straight lightbrown hair full lips no round face no shed given the police a wholly fictitious account tomorrow the photo would be in every newspaper pinned up outside every police station this was better than he could ever have imagined but why had she done it what was she playing at he didnt like puzzles didnt like it when the accounts failed to balance at the bottom he switched off the tv and put aside his wine one thing was obvious she didnt want him caught only two people could be certain her description was a fiction the item and the minute man he was still deep in thought when ten oclock came round he switched on the tv news again and was thrown into fresh confusion there has been an arrest tonight after the latest minute man kidnap victim was released sitting up he kicked over the wine bottle it poured out its contents unchecked a man believed to be a business acquaintance of gillian websters father has been taken to castle lane police station for questioning we now go over live to castle lane where martin brockman is waiting to speak to us martin any more details now the reporter was on the screen looking cold against a damp nighttime street headlamps flashing past him he wore a sheepskin coat and had one hand pressed to his ear holding in place the earphone he began to speak all police will say is that a man is being questioned in connection with the kidnapping of gillian webster who was released unharmed this morning theres no word yet of whether or not the man will be asked to take part in an identity parade but rumour has it that the man police are questioning is actually known to miss websters father the millionaire duncan webster and that it was mr webster himself who first noticed the resemblance between the photofit and the man police are currently questioning lets get this right martin youre saying mr webster identified his daughters kidnapper i dont think we can go that far just yet but but he had switched off the television whats your game little gillian he said quietly your game or your fathers he felt dizzy confused there had to be a reason for all of this the wine was thumping in his head i hate puzzles he yelled at the blank tv screen i hate puzzles in castle lane police station chief superintendent tom lancaster was about to get some sleep hed phoned his wife to explain that he wouldnt be home he kept a fresh suit shirt and tie in the office anyway and now there was a camp bed there too with an armyquality sleeping bag nothing to the comforts of home but it would have to do tomorrow might be even busier than today he was comforted to know that the press werent going home either some had crawled off to hotels and boarding houses but others were camping out in cars and vans outside the station lancaster slipped off his clothes and into the chilled sleeping bag he wriggled for a few seconds getting warm then reached to the floor where several bulging files lay the transcript of gillian websters conversations with the minute man had been typed up he read through them again it was oneway traffic the minute man had said only a couple of dozen words mostly in the form of abrupt questions his second victim elaine chatham had managed a longer utterance from him shed asked if she could have a book of crosswords to pass the time shed kept on asking until shed forced from him a gruff confession in his geordie accent this time three important little words tom lancaster whispered them to himself i hate puzzles then smiling he reached for the anglepoise and turned off the light it was nearly midday when mrs angelo heard the bell tinkling at the front desk coming she called trying to sound calm her husband tony should have been helping her but he had the flu and was upstairs asleep it was his third bout of flu this year he never wanted the doctor called in the man standing at the desk carried a sports holdall and a sheaf of the morning papers he wore a newsmelling sheepskin jacket and a harassed grin id like a room please he announced just the one night is it well youre a journalist mrs angelo stated youre reporting on that kidnapping and you dont know how long youll need the room am i right you could write our astrology column she checked the rack of room keys on the wall number six has a wash basin or theres number eleven but it doesnt those are the only two ive got she turned to him were busy all of a sudden youve already got reporters staying ones been here all the way through the others moved in yesterday and ive a very nice cameraman and soundman from the bbc only they complain because their reporter is in some posh hotel i told them posh just means expensive number six or number eleven six please only the best eh i dare say youre on expenses she unhooked the key then swivelled the register around for him to sign so which paper are you from he didnt look up from his writing im freelance a few magazines are interested so i thought id you know she swivelled the register back towards her well mr beattie lets hope you get your story eh yes he agreed taking the key from her warm damp fingers lets hope he threw the papers on to the floor beside the single bed the mattress was softer than he liked but the room was clean and fresh it worried him that there were other reporters here he didnt want them asking him questions he unzipped the holdall taking his gillian webster case notes from it included in the file was a packet of black and white photographs hed taken during the weeks leading up to the snatch he looked through them again the websters lived in a large detached house set in a few acres of rambling grounds hed gone out there one sunday with his camera hed been out that way several times before in his car stopping once with engine trouble near the house about a hundred yards from the house there was a clump of bushes and saplings big enough for him to hide in on that particular sunday hed taken his very best zoom lenses for the canon camera then he went strolling with camera and binoculars and a bird identification book what he hadnt expected was that gillian webster would not be home he also had not expected the websters to be entertaining theyd invited a dozen or so people for lateafternoon drinks he was lucky the weather was cool nobody seemed inclined to wander down into the garden towards where he was hiding but a veranda ran the length of the back of the house and some of the guests wandered out on to it so occasionally did the host and hostess he shot off a single roll of film concentrating on webster and his wife she was younger than her husband by at least ten years even so she was showing her age the skin sagged from her face and neck and her short blonde hair looked brittle lying on the bed he paused at one particular photograph a man had been standing alone on the veranda then had been joined by mrs webster it looked as though she were greeting the man they were kissing the man who was holding a champagne flute held mrs websters arm with his free hand drawing her towards him the kiss was no perfunctory peck their lips met were maybe even parted the kiss had seemed to last quite a while he searched through the other photos for a better one of the man yes here he was with mr webster and another guest they looked serious as though discussing business the man was caught faceon he was shorter than webster heavily built with dark wavy hair just covering his ears early on in the party he had loosened his tie and his shirt collar did he merely look serious in this photo or did he look worried there were dark bags under his eyes he lifted a newspaper and stared at the photofit police had issued the one made up from gillian websters description it was the guest from the party he was sure of that the local radio station had set up a van in the police station car park with a tall antenna flexing from its roof it looked as though the journalists had been made to move into the car park probably their cars had been holding up traffic in castle lane as he arrived they were milling around drinking beakers of tea talking into portable phones reading from sheets of paper he looked around one young man stood apart from the others he looked shy and uncomfortable and was wearing cheap clothes there were spots around his mouth and on his neck and he kept pushing slippery glasses back up his nose as he read from his own sheets of paper glancing up from time to time to see what the other journalists were doing he was perfect local are you chief the young man looked up in surprise at the man with the southeast accent the man wearing the expensive jacket sorry you look like the local press the young man twitched im from the post thought so the sheets of paper were plucked from the young mans hands they detailed the mornings media briefing there would be a conference at three oclock and another at seven otherwise the only news was that the man theyd been questioning was to be held for another twentyfour hours what do you think chief the young man looked dazed come on you can tell uncle des theres not much to think he wrinkled his nose folding the press release and shoving it into the young mans anorak pocket dont give me that thats the official line but this is between you and me youre local my son youve got the edge on all of us he nodded towards the scattering of journalists none of whom was taking any notice of this conversation who are you i thought i told you des beattie beattie how long you been in this game son he shook his head sadly the ripper case i covered it for the telegraph freelance now of course i can pick and choose my crime stories a certain magazine has asked me to see if theres an angle in all this he looked the young man up and down you might be in for half the byline could be your ticket out of here chief we all had to start somewhere stefans my name stefan duniec pleased to meet you stefan they shook hands whats that russian is it polish well im des beattie and im from walthamstow only i live in docklands now he winked handy for the newspaper offices so whatve you got well duniec looked around its not really my idea beattie shrugged this aside there was no copyright on news but ive heard that someones got a name for the sod theyre questioning duniec nodded beattie seemed thoughtful maybe itll tie in with my own ideas whats the name stefan bernard cooke beattie nodded slowly bernie cooke the businessman right now duniec nodded does it tie in beattie puckered his mouth might well do i need to check a few facts first i could help the kid was keen all right he didnt want to wear that anorak for ever beattie patted his shoulder stick around here stefan keep your ears open ill go make a couple of calls duniec glanced down at the large pockets of beatties sheepskin beattie grinned we cant all afford cell phones meantime he nodded towards the other reporters you might try writing this up you know something wry about the long wait eight hundred words who knows theres always a market for filler the sundays are nothing but filler these days eight hundred beattie nodded then reconsidered sevenfifty he said heading out of the car park a small engineering works on a purposebuilt estate a helpful sign at the site entrance told him he was looking for unit cooke engineering ltd he drove his rented fiesta slowly through the narrow winding roads giving way to lorries and delivery vans half a dozen cars were parked outside unit in tightly marked bays the building was grey corrugated steel shared by two companies unit manufactured frozen foods driving past it he sized up unit there was a door which would lead to the reception area or offices and a loadingbay door near it both were closed parked in the loading bay was a sporty ford sierra one of the custom jobs in the drivers seat a man was talking on a car phone in the back seat were two more large pastyfaced men they looked like reporters well if a dolt like duniec knew about cooke the professionals would know too and though cooke himself wasnt here though he was sweating and dogtired in one of castle lanes interview rooms a team had been sent to stake the place out he gnawed at his bottom lip and decided to take a calculated risk he drove to the next lot of units parked and walked back towards cooke engineering the door he was approaching having ignored the carful of staring eyes had office printed on it he knocked and entered closing the door behind him hed expected noise after all only a partition wall separated this part of the unit from the actual production line but there was silence punctuated by the slow clack of fingers on a computer keyboard can i help you she sat behind a desk but also behind huge redrimmed spectacles which magnified her already large eyes her tone was hardly welcoming mr cooke he said nervously wondered if i could have a do you have an appointment no well i are you a reporter she examined him hunched over as he was shuffling and twitching and awkward you dont look like one she sighed no cold calling reps by appointment only i take it you are a rep well as it happens i sorry she said seeming to take pity on this particularly pitiful example of an unlovely breed mr cookes not here anyway he looked around place looks dead dead about sums it up business bad lets just say you shouldnt look for too many orders ah he seemed to think of something but the cars outside we let the guys from the frozenfood place park their excess cars there oh dear he nodded towards where he assumed the production line would be just through the wall then youre not were not producing so unless youre selling jobs in the light engineering sector i shouldnt bother he smiled but youre still here only till the weekend no pay by friday im off she went back to her typing her fingers hammering the keys he turned to leave his back and shoulders more hunched than ever then he stopped and half turned what made you think i was a reporter youll read about it only after hed gone did she pause in her work shed seen them all in her time all the types of rep you could imagine but shed never come across one who didnt even bother to bring samples with him across from the industrial estate was a recently built pub doubtless put there by a canny brewing concern who knew there would be plenty of clients from an estate of eightyodd units that was the idea anyway the barman admitted pouring a pint of beer before times got hard what gets me is that none of these financial projections he said the words with distaste ever projected hard times ahead and let me tell you theres no moneyback guarantee with these things he had handed over the drink received a fivepound note and now pressed a key on the till accountants arent all bad said the customer as the barman handed over the change the customer asked a question does a man called bernard cooke drink in here there was a snort from further down the bar where a man on a stool was doing the crossword in the local paper why do you ask asked the barman i was supposed to be seeing him today drove all the way down from bloody lancaster the barman didnt seem about to doubt his northwest accent only theres no bugger about except some right rough types in a car parked outside reporters said the crossword solver oh aye you wont be seeing cooke for a while the crossword solver tipped back the dregs of a halfpint we dont know that snapped the barman dont go jumping to bloody conclusions arthur arthur merely shrugged in compliance staring down at his paper hes in trouble is he asked the traveller maybe bang goes my bloody contract youre lucky then said arthur how do you mean he nodded towards the empty glass get you another thanks i will the barman refilled the glass but wouldnt take one himself arthur sipped and swallowed i mean he said at last bernies been in trouble for yonks money trouble chances are if you were buying from him you wouldnt have got what you ordered and if you were selling you wouldnt have seen the money thanks for the tip ive known for months he was in trouble used to be hed nip in here friday lunchtime for something to eat and a couple of brandies then it got to be twice a week and four brandies and three times a week and six somebody drinks like that its not because theyre flush its that theyre worried i know what you mean all i know chipped in the barman is that he always paid and thats more than some arthur winked at beattie thats a dig at me beattie finished his drink and eased himself off the bar stool back to lancaster he shook his head couple more calls first after hed gone the bar was silent a few moments then arthur cleared his throat what do you think well said the barman he wasnt a reporter im not even sure hes in business how do you make that out no expense account didnt ask for a receipt for the drinks maybe he doesnt need receipts sherlock maybe the barman lifted away the empty glass and washed it placing it on the rack to dry then he wiped the bartop where the man had been sitting and put down a fresh beermat now there was no sign anyone had ever been there just be a second the barman told arthur then he disappeared into the alcove where the telephone was kept at threeforty the journalists slouched out of the press room carrying the latest news release they were talkative if they werent too busy drawing in cigarette smoke some were making calls on their telephones or going off to their cars to make calls they squeezed from the police stations double doors and fanned out across the car park a camera unit had been readied for the tv reporter called martin brockman who was now checking his script while a makeup girl tried to get his hair to stop flying into a vertical peak every time a gust blew stefan duniec walked slowly across the car park not heading towards his car he did not have a car but just keeping moving so he looked as busy and important as the other reporters he was staring down at his notebook and didnt notice the figure blocking his way until hed practically bumped into it hello mr beattie you missed the conference couldnt be helped stef anything to report i got you a copy of the press release good lad beattie started to read from the two stapled sheets gillian webster he read had now given a description of the room shed been kept in during her tenday ordeal not so much a room more a cupboard kept in darkness she could hear distant traffic as though heavy lorries were passing outside but she was tied up mouth taped shut and couldnt cry out beattie read it again well it was true hed kept her mouth taped shut occasionally but everything else was a fabrication another false account interesting he said are they still questioning cooke duniec nodded and i suppose theyll be giving his factory the onceover how do you mean stands to reason stef this cupboard could be in cookes factory ive just come from there hes been laying off staff the only person left is a secretary and i doubt she goes anywhere near the shop floor she might get her hands mucky he glanced again at the paper lorries going past sounds just like an industrial estate i suppose it does duniec said quietly and if hes been laying off men what does that tell you his companys in trouble dead right so tell me young stef is cooke wealthy or skint skint i suppose and desperate so he kidnaps someone he knows how could he hope to get away with it all we know is that he knew the parents we dont know gillian knew him but he let her see him duniec protested he mustve known shed give a description that her father would see it beattie nodded precisely that was just one of the flaws would cooke really have kept her in his factory with someone else on the premises all day how could he feed gillian without the secretary becoming suspicious gillians story was badly flawed but beattie wondered if the police would see that he could see what gillian webster was doing and how she was doing it he just couldnt account for the why but he had an idea now a good idea he only needed to study the photographs again meantime stefan had obviously been considering all the flaws too like you say he must have been desperate he was desperate all right he just wasnt very bright he tapped duniecs shoulder with the rolledup press release ill see you later he winked remember the byline and the sevenfifty words duniec called after him ive already made a start without looking back beattie gave a raised thumbsup duniec watched till he was out of sight then turned back towards the reporters cars three men were in a huddle next to a red porsche excuse me he said interrupting them one man the one with a proprietorial hand resting on the porsches roof spoke for all of them what is it youre terry greig arent you greig puffed out his chest of course he was terry greig king of the tabloid newsroom scourge of copytakers and here was another tyro looking to make his acquaintance what can i do for you lad duniec didnt like that lad but like beatties stef he let it lie did you see that man i was talking to he asked instead in the sheepskin jacket greig nodded little escaped him i saw him earlier he confirmed right said duniec and have you seen him before i mean do you know who he is dont know him from adam football manager is he third division theyre the only buggers would wear a coat like that except for brockman added one of the other reporters except for old brockie greig agreed then they all laughed all except stefan duniec when the laughter had died and they were waiting for him to leave he turned his gaze once more to greig he wrote up the ripper case for the telegraph no he didnt not unless he meant the belfast telegraph they all laughed again even duniecs lips were bent slightly in what might have passed for a smile whats it all about lad asked greig could we step inside the station sir duniec said to anyone standing within earshot it didnt sound much like a question the man who called himself des beattie was packing his bag he tore the ringpull from another can of mcewans and gulped from the can the photographs were lying on the bed he paused in his packing and studied the photos again cooke with duncan webster cooke with mrs webster cooke looking very comfortable with mrs webster cooke looking extremely uncomfortable with duncan webster looking like maybe he owed the man money money he couldnt hope to repay but that wasnt cookes problem no cookes problem was the wife look at the two of them touching kissing with mr webster cooke looked more like a business acquaintance than anything but with mrs webster he looked like a very close friend indeed whether webster knew or not he couldnt tell but the daughter had known gillian webster had found out about cooke and her mother about their affair christ and she was daddys little daughter wasnt she when shed spoken to him of her home life hoping to ingratiate herself hoping he wouldnt harm someone he knew as a real person rather than an item yes shed been clever all right when she had done this she had spoken always of her father first her mother second daddy daddy daddy it had always been daddy while mother had remained just that mother all those hours shed been alone those hours with little to do but struggle against her bonds little to think about but but how to turn this little adventure to her own advantage she would set up bernard cooke she must have known his company was in trouble giving him the motive who would suspect shed lie about something like this no one no one would know except three people cooke himself the mother and the real kidnapper cooke would protest his innocence but it was his word against gillians mrs webster what could she say without revealing the extent of her ties to cooke and as for the kidnapper well was he going to come forward to help cooke of course not it was true wasnt it he wasnt going to do anything he was going to leave this town and never return with cooke inside the heat would be off the police would stop checking airports and seaports yes a foreign holiday somewhere sunny and dry not like this cold miserable island where he worked he could stop by a travel agents tomorrow on the plane out hed order champagne and drink to poor bernard cooke that was that he opened another can and picked up the photo the one of cooke and mrs webster kissing the more he looked at it the more he saw that he could be wrong what if it was just a friendly kiss these types types like mrs webster they could get overfamiliar what if it had nothing to do with the mother what if what if it had to do with gillian instead shed told him daddy doesnt like it when i bring home older men could there have been something between gillian and bernard cooke maybe hed broken it off and she was out for his blood wait think a bit if cooke was single it wouldnt work it only worked if he was married and had to hide the relationship his head began spinning and he tried to stand up how could he be sure how could he be sure that cooke and mrs webster or cooke and gillian had been an item he caught that word item and smiled if theyd been an item people would have seen them together somewhere they felt safe from mr webster maybe that was why cooke started using the pub across from the estate more often nothing to do with his financial troubles it should be easy enough to check hed go there now on his way out of town he thought of stefan duniec stefan who probably wasnt fit to report on a flower show never mind a police inquiry there were some real thick bastards in the world when you thought about it jesus werent there just it was five oclock when he walked into the bar as hed hoped the shift had changed the barman was new whats more arthur had moved on good theyd have thought it more than a little off the lancastrian returning to ask questions about cooke and some woman the beer hed drunk in his room had given him a taste so he ordered a double armagnac with a half of lager to chase it down fuel for the long drive ahead the bar was mediumbusy with workers on their way home from the estate he sat on the same stool as earlier and made a show of checking his watch and keeping an eye on the door waiting on someone the new barman dutifully asked bernard cooke i thought we arranged to meet at five the barman tried the name dont think i know him hes a lunchtime regular i never do lunchtime he nodded miserably and finished the armagnac it burned him all the way down one last time then he usually has a woman with him a bit of posh the barman shrugged and went back to wiping glasses thanks anyway he finished the lager and had another idea it was a bit late but worth a try as he pushed open the door to the outside world he met resistance it was arthur coming in arthur looked surprised beattie switched to a northwest accent hello arthur thought you were off to the wide blue yonder just heading back now ive been hearing cooke has a fancy piece he winked thats an expensive hobby no wonder hes gone broke arthur just stared as though listening to a ghost there was almost it wasnt shock it was more like fear in his eyes beattie persisted nice looker by the sound of her eh they used to come in here did they was the man pissed maybe those crosswords had addled his brain beattie felt good and mellow never mind he said see you around arthur seemed to perk up oh right you are take care now i will arthur i will the secretary having faithfully placed a dustcover over the computer was putting on her coat when he arrived she looked daggers at him and he raised his hands in surrender ill only take a minute he said he hadnt really expected her to still be here how much paperwork could an empty factory produce the reporters had vanished from outside along with most of the cars on the estate youre persistent she said hes not here it was you i wanted to speak to oh he stepped forward and produced the photo from his pocket the one of cooke and mrs webster kissing is your boss married he asked she smiled sourly i knew you werent a rep did i say i was so whats the answer a simple yes or no what business is it of yours he gave a fumey sigh i can find out its not difficult off you go then and find out did you know he was having an affair its only an affair if the persons married oh so cookes a bachelor then thats not what i said mrs websters married though he was seeking a reaction any reaction her daughters single get out her voice was colder than the lager hed just consumed let me guess he persisted you had the hots for him yourself maybe he was stringing you along she picked up the receiver all right im going he put the photo back in his pocket but remember you dont owe him anything its him that owes you just give me a yes or no is he married she started punching telephone buttons so he left she was breathing hard but didnt let it show she stared at the door willing it to stay closed then she was connected police she said i want to speak to chief superintendent lancaster outside he sat in his car thinking about the man called arthur the secretary and stefan duniec then he got out again and started looking for another car any car would do so long as it had a car phone lancaster put down the receiver and looked towards the two people sitting across the desk from him that was your secretary mr cooke bernard cooke nodded hed gathered as much already our man has just turned up again asking if youre married and implying youve been having an affair with mrs webster he looked at the young woman next to cooke or even with you gillian gillian webster snorted lancaster was smiling looks like its worked he said i hate puzzles those three words had set the whole game in motion and the game was about to end right result right team he had a photo with him he went on turning back to bernard cooke you and gillians mother on the veranda at her home that sunday drinks party cooke decided the minute man was watching he thinks cora and i are lovers hes putting two and two together and making five luckily for us if that photo had just shown the two of you talking he might not have suspected anything whereas as it is he thinks he knows why gillians set you up it couldnt have worked out better gillian webster turned to cooke kissing my mother on the veranda cooke tried a nervous smile lancaster shifted in his chair he was nervous for all sorts of reasons the minute man had to solve puzzles even if that meant conjuring an answer out of the thinnest stuff lancaster had invented the conundrum hoping his adversary would be irritated by it and drawn towards it someone even suggested the minute man might pose as a reporter a suitable disguise for showing interest in the case there was a knock at the door and a young man came in lancaster introduced him i dont think either of you has met detective constable duniec duniec nodded a greeting but gillians mind was on the idea of cooke and her mother well stefan lancaster asked the look on duniecs face was bad news he paid his bill and left over an hour ago lancaster nodded hes been back to the foresters a regular called arthur just phoned to tell me and he paid another visit to the factory we know his car sir red fiesta theres a call out for it all exit roads are covered arent they duniec nodded then all we can do is wait lancaster tried to look relaxed bernard cooke had been doubtful of the plan at first but as a friend of gillians hed gone along with it after all partly it had been her idea she was looking pale again shed been ordered to rest by the doctors but had insisted on sticking around the phone rang again lancaster snatched the call red fiesta he said afterwards sighted heading for lower traherne he fixed his eyes on gillian looks like hes heading out to your home then he turned to duniec get on to it stefan duniec nodded and left the room this eventuality too had been covered the websters were in a local hotel under plainclothes protection a driver and unmarked car were waiting outside to take gillian back there the minute man was driving into a trap the phone rang yet again and lancaster picked it up glad of something to do he listened for a moment a muscle going rigid in his jaw when he spoke it was in a dry voice put him through will you and try to get a trace he then pushed a button on the telephone and replaced the receiver a small integral speaker crackled into life a female voice said youre through caller lancaster swallowed and spoke hello superintendent lancaster speaking lancaster watched gillian she was staring at the telephone what little colour she had vanished from her face dont bother with a trace tom i wont be on long you know that we get a dozen cranks a day saying theyre the minute man you know who i am tom why are you phoning because youve got the wrong man lancaster looked to gillian and cooke she looked ready to leap from her seat while cooke seemed pinned against the back of his as if by gforce have we yes shes set him up who has the girl why would she do that hes having an affair with her mother she wants revenge lancaster forced a laugh how can you possibly know that i know i know all of it now the line went dead christ cooke said lancaster checked with the switchboard but the minute man hadnt been on long enough to give them a chance in fact hed been on the line for scarcely a minute lancaster got to his feet i wonder if he still plans to visit lower traherne one way to find out im coming too said cooke rising shakily to his feet gillian was still staring at the telephone neither man needed confirmation that she had recognised the voice when lancaster touched her shoulder she flinched come on gillian he said lets get you back to the hotel they opened the back door of the car for her and she got in the engine was running and the car moved off at once through the car park past the usual ruck of reporters and cameras and out of the iron gates of castle lane police station she didnt want to go to the hotel not really she wanted to go home to lower traherne but she doubted the police driver could be persuaded to take her there she noticed a walkie talkie on the floor by his feet or maybe it was a portable phone whatever happened at the house shed hear of it he was looking at her in the rearview mirror when she looked back he gave her a reassuring smile then she noticed theyd passed the regular turning we should have gone left there he was still smiling the car was building up speed gillian felt a lump swell in her throat the fear nearly choking her i know it all now he said quietly the way lancaster spoke that confirmed it oh yes that balanced both sides of the ledger quite nicely she swallowed shifting the blockage wheres the driver im the driver the policeman you think hes in the boot he shook his head i told him his chief wanted him in the press room she was relaxing a little his voice was calm it had been calm all the time shed been his captive where are we going she asked lower traherne what im taking you home gillian but why he shrugged just to show them i can she thought for a moment while she was thinking he spoke again it was good very good nearly had me fooled except for one scared bloke in a pub she felt the words tumble from her mouth like someone else was speaking theyve got the exit roads covered and there are police at the house inside and outside youll never its all right gillian youll see both sides will balance what do you mean balance so for the rest of the journey the minute man tried to explain to her his own particular theories of the principles of accounts the only true comedian i suppose looking back my schooldays were to blame or maybe it was my parents genes which had left me the smallest boy in my year the popular boys all seemed to be the tough ones the sporty ones the ones who werent shy who were goodlooking i didnt really fit the bill so instead i became the comedian of course they werent laughing with me they were laughing at me i knew it even then as i told my jokes and made my silly faces and did my funny walks they told me i was off my head said i was potty i didnt mind at least they were talking to me at least they were noticing me which meant i was allowed to participate in their games or at least watch from the periphery which was my favoured spot anyway watching them i was able to learn i learned which kids and teachers i could make fun of id go for the younger kids even spottier and uglier than i was or for one of the unlovely girls who stood by the playground railings sad looks on their faces oh i was ferocious with anyone who couldnt bite back it was how i stayed part of the gang the other problem was i wasnt stupid but when i became a member of black alecs gang i had to pretend to be less clever than i was and this pretence could only be carried off if i started slipping in class answering questions wrongly when i knew the right answers my test marks dropping the deputy head had a word with me i think she could see there was a problem she just couldnt figure out what it was my parents were summoned to the school for a discussion they started to take notice of me too helping with homework and revision still i refused to fulfil my potential sometimes i would slip up and answer some question which had stumped everyone else at these times the teacher would peer at me wondering what was going on eventually i was taken to hospital for tests on my brain they glued all these electrodes to my head three washings later my hair still felt sticky and the results had failed to throw up any incongruities when the final exams came i was in a quandary wed all have left school by the time the results were posted so if i wanted to i could do as well as i liked but something made me stay in character maybe it was the thought that though i was leaving school the gang would still be there hanging around their favoured street corner yelling abuse at cars and pedestrians running down to the park with a carrierbag of beer it was a community i understood and my chosen role made me unique within it i was joker or the comedian i wasnt expected to take part in the occasional massed battles with other gangs i proved myself by telling jokes and stories by deriding other gangs especially with reference to their personal hygiene and sexual habits and by improving my range of impressions soon after leaving school however i found that a lot of the gang had drifted away even black alec our leader and mentor had gained employment as a car mechanic the merry band had dwindled to a few losers for whom the daily stint at the street corner had become an unwelcome chore i thought about resitting my exams going on to college or university but black alec was my nextdoor neighbour how could i tell him my plans he wouldnt have understood hed have asked me to do the walk again and afterwards his laughter would have had me craving more more laughter more acceptance more of his approval anyway things didnt work out for him as a mechanic he became a bouncer instead working at a discotheque in kirkcaldy he got into trouble spent a couple of months in jail and when he came out he told us hed just paid a visit to the university of life from now on he said nothing would be beyond him hed only be satisfied with number one at the time i dont think we really knew what he was talking about but we found out soon enough i went to work in a chicken factory it wasnt a bad job the production line was mostly staffed by women and i kept them smiling id sing a song do a little dance whatever it took to please them they were all married kept asking me when id find a girlfriend they wore white overalls and green wellies their hair tucked into white caps sometimes when i met them outside the factory i wouldnt recognise them my first christmas party was a revelation they were wearing dresses and makeup having a drink and a laugh wed taken over the back room of a pub in glenrothes no management just workers there was some entertainment a couple of the women sang songs one of the foremen got up and told some jokes get off the women yelled at him our comedians ten times better than you they meant me i was cajoled persuaded i found myself up on the stage microphone in hand i cleared my throat cleared it some more the sound filling the room someone called out for me to get on with it and then somebody else twigged that i was pretending to be the production supervisor he was always clearing his throat before he gave you bad news there was scattered applause and laughter im sorry to have to inform you all i said that christmas has been cancelled this year you lot might not be happy but ive two thousand capons in the back whore over the moon now everyone understood theyd all clicked into my act and it felt wonderful the hair on my arms was standing up it seemed id been up there a couple of minutes but i was told afterwards id done a twentyminute set women were kissing me telling me i was the best you should turn professional one of them said and eventually plucking up courage thats just what i did i started out at pub talent nights winning a couple of contests the publican might then invite me back for a three or fourweek run i kept up the factory job but now i had a girlfriend emily whod sung the night they drove old dixie down at one of the talent shows id asked her about the song shed no idea what it was all about just got it from one of my mums joan baez albums we had a laugh together emily had a day job too in a shoe shop she came up with the idea of me going fulltime pro she said shed support me till i got rich and famous she said it wouldnt take long her argument was that with my job id no time to write new material she was right i really needed new material so she became my manager finding me bookings and i lay in bed writing jokes and stories it all went well for a while then we realised i was just treading water it was still pubs and clubs you need a portfolio emily said something you can show to agents and the tv companies what i need are some decent gags i replied the writing wasnt working it was never how id worked i was spontaneous my material came from life now that i spent all day mooching around the house there was nothing for me to write about if the act was going to go anywhere i needed to take a few risks and that was what i did i invested in a tape machine and other electronic stuff so i could use funny noises and sound effects in my act then i got measured for a sharp suit blue and sparkly with shirt to match i looked ridiculous in it but then that was the point wasnt it i now looked the part problem was none of it came cheap emily asked where id got the money savings i told her lying through my teeth soon enough i knew as i said it i might not have any teeth left to lie through because id borrowed the money from black alec black alec had almost fulfilled his ambition of becoming number one he was now one of the most feared men on the east coast he ran a string of clubs in fife owned two pubs in edinburgh and had so many fingers in so many other pies it was a wonder he could pick his nose he also ran protection prostitutes and pornography or so the rumours said id never worked in any of his clubs he said they were upmarket mostly musicoriented he said i was lowclass but still he loaned me the money and now with the act flagging it was time to start paying it off beginning with the interest i knew emily was broke the shoe shop had gone bust and she was on jobseekers i knew i didnt have any money and i knew it wouldnt matter to black alec that id once been his nextdoor neighbour and personal jester nothing mattered to him but repayment and violence against the person there were those who said he preferred it when people couldnt pay up that way black alec got to play eventually i broke down and told emily id been fobbing alecs men off as best i could theyd repossessed the electronics and soon it would be time for them to start taking possession of my limbs lungs and lights so we did what we had to do went on the run thing is to keep running we needed money and i only knew one way to make money keep on with the act which made it hard for us to stay ahead of the gbh brigade wed turn up in a town and while i tried to hustle a gig emily would be checking departure times of buses and trains id do my stint grab the cash and wed make for the station up and down the east coast we ran as far north as montrose and south to eyemouth finding that the travelling was using up most of the money i made at this rate there was no way i was going to be able to pay back black alec well go to london emily said thats where the agents and tv people are one spot on des oconnor and you could pay black alec ten times over how are we going to get there first thing is to talk to dess producer i mean how are we going to get to london well hitch she told me all we need is a bit of money for food which meant one last show there werent many places left to try word was out that black alec wanted to see me worse still the rumour was i was washed up that i stank but a pub on rose street in edinburgh was under new management and looking to kickstart a comedy club they said theyd give me a fifteenminute spot if they liked what they saw thered be a twenty in it for me twenty quid id earned more winning talent shows but i said okay of course i said okay that night when i took the stage in my blue sparkly suit there were about two dozen punters in the place a smattering at the tables most of them chatting at the bar the last thing they wanted was me up there spoiling their conversation and meaning the jukebox was turned off but i kicked off anyway nobody was laughing emily was in the djs booth supposedly keeping an eye on my mike level so that there was no feedback right then i thought feedback had a better chance of getting a laugh and then black alec walked in someone had tipped him off and here he came with three of his lads they took a table right at the front alec not taking his eyes off me a little smile on his face it was the first smile id seen all night but it didnt exactly cheer me up a bottle of champagne arrived and just the one glass alec toasted me as he drank suddenly horribly my mind went blank not a single joke in my repertoire could i remember there were slow handclaps from the bar and cries of get off does your mum let you out looking like that i told the heckler look at him face like a bulldog chewing a wasp the hecklers pals laughed at this and i was on a roll i knew only one thing the minute they booed me off i was in for a doing i had to stay on that stage and the only way to do that was to be funny and i was funny inspiration took hold and the stories started pouring out i had stories about working in a factory about shoe shops and workingmens clubs even stories about schooldays they clapped and cheered more punters were coming in and no one was leaving id been on stage about forty minutes but the owner wasnt about to signal timeup the only person in the place not laughing was black alec even his lads had sniggered at a couple of the routines but alec just sat there stonyfaced finishing his champagne eventually tiredness got the better of me i could fall back on lame material or stop while the going was good id have won an audience and be losing my mobility alec looked like he was getting impatient i never liked to keep an old friend waiting ladies and gentlemen i said youve been a great audience even old bulldogfeatures over there this set was dedicated to the one thing ive always enjoyed until this evening namely good health thank you and goodnight i came off to applause whistles cheers i walked right over to black alecs table and sat down opposite him the jukebox came back on the owner brought me a whisky so did a couple of punters congratulating me on the best show theyd seen the owner wanted to book me a regular slot maybe hosting the club and throughout alec didnt take his eyes off me so he said at last that was your routine that was it i said i couldnt see emily maybe shed spotted alec and done a runner it was good he said really good i looked at him was it possible you can warm an audience up he went on i could do with someone like you youre going to take me to one of your clubs and roast me on a spit i guessed and he laughed the way hed laughed when we were kids im offering you work comedian that way i can keep an eye on you while you pay me what you owe me how does that sound it sounds great i said unable to keep the relief out of my voice the same set should do and i nodded while my insides turned to rubber the same set the one id improvised i couldnt remember it couldnt recall a single blessed punchline and then emily was marching towards me waving a cassette whats that i asked i taped you she said leaning down to kiss me now youve got your portfolio and my continuing good health i said kissing her back i used to think comedy came from wanting acceptance wanting to be liked now i know differently i know its all down to fear fear ladies and gentlemen is the only true comedian in town herbert in motion my choices that day were twofold kill myself before or after the prime ministers cocktail party and if after should i wear my armani to the party or the more sober ysl with the chalk stripe the invitation was giltedged too big for the inside pocket of my workaday suit drinks and canapés six pm till seven a minion had telephoned to confirm my attendance and to brief me on protocol that had been two days ago hed explained that among the guests would be an american visiting london a certain joseph hefferwhite while not quite spelling it out they never do do they the minion was explaining why id been invited and what my role on the night might be joe hefferwhite i managed to say clutching the receiver like it was so much straw i believe you share an interest in modern art the minion continued we share an interest he misunderstood my tone and laughed sorry share an interest was a bit weak wasnt it my apologies he was apologising because art is no mere interest of mine art was is my whole life during the rest of our short and onesided conversation i stared ahead as though at some startling new design trying to understand and explain to make it all right with myself attempting to wring out each nuance and stroke each variant and chosen shape or length of line and in the end there was nothing no substance no revelation just the bland reality of my situation and the simple framing device of suicide and the damnation was it had been the perfect crime a dinner party ten years before it was in chelsea deep in the heart of margaret thatchers vision of england there were dissenters at the table only a couple and they could afford their little grumble it wasnt going to make margaret hilda disappear and their own trappings were safe the warehouse conversion in docklands the bmw the cristal champagne and black truffles trappings the word seems so much more resonant now so there we were the wine had relaxed us we were all smiling with inner and selfsatisfied contentment and wasnt that the dream after all and i felt just as at home as any of them i knew i was there as the delegate of culture among the merchant bankers and media figures political jobsworths and somethings and dear god there was an estate agent there too if memory serves that fad didnt last long i was there to reassure them that they were composed of something more lasting and nourishing than mere money that they had some meaning in the wider scheme i was there as curator to their sensibilities in truth i was and am a senior curator at the tate gallery with special interest in twentiethcentury north american art by which i mean paintings im no great enthusiast of modern sculpture yet less of more radical sideshows performance art video art all that the guests at the table that evening made the usual noises about artists whose names they couldnt recall but who did green things or you know that horse and the shadow and everything one foolhardy soul was it the estate agent digressed on his fondness for certain wildlife paintings and trumpeted the news that his wife had once bought a print from christies contemporary art when another guest begged me to allow that my job was on the cushy side i placed knife and fork slowly on plate and did my spiel i had it down to a fine art allow the pun please and talked fluently about the difficulties my position posed about the appraisal of trends and talents the search for major new works and their acquisition imagine i said that you are about to spend half a million pounds on a painting in so doing you will elevate the status of the artist turn him or her into a rich and soughtafter talent they may disappoint you thereafter and fail to paint anything else of interest in which case the resale value of the work will be negligible and your own reputation will have been tarnished perhaps even more than tarnished every day every time you are asked for your opinion your reputation is on the line meanwhile you must propose exhibitions must plan them which often means transporting works from all around the world and must spend your budget wisely you mean like do i buy four paintings at half a mil each or push the pedal to the floor with one big buy at two mil i allowed my questioner a smile in crude economic terms yes do you get to take pictures home our hostess asked some works a few are loaned out i conceded but not to staff then to whom people in prominence benefactors that sort of person all that money the docklands woman said shaking her head for a bit of paint and canvas it almost seems like a crime when there are homeless on the streets disgraceful someone else said cant walk along the embankment without stumbling over them at which point our hostess stumbled into the silence to reveal that she had a surprise well take coffee and brandy in the morning room during which youll be invited to take part in a murder she didnt mean it of course though more than one pair of eyes strayed to the docklanders more in hope than expectation what she meant was that wed be participating in a parlour game there had been a murder her unsmiling husband the cajoled corpse miraculously revivified whenever another snifter of brandy was offered and we were to look for clues in the room we duly searched somewhat in the manner of children who wish to please their elders with half a dozen clues gathered the docklands woman surprised us all by deducing that our hostess had committed the crime as indeed she had we collapsed thankfully on to the sofas and had our glasses refilled after which the conversation came around to crime real and imagined it was now that the host became animated for the first time that night he was a collector of whodunnits and fancied himself an expert the perfect crime he told us as everyone knows is one where no crime has been committed but then there is no crime his wife declared precisely he said no crime and yet a crime if the bodys never found damned hard to convict anyone or if somethings stolen but never noticed see what im getting at i did of course and perhaps you do too the tate like every other gallery i can think of has considerably less wallspace than it has works in its collection these days we do not like to cram our paintings together though when well done the effect can be breathtaking one large canvas may have a whole wall to iself and praise be that bacons triptychs did not start a revolution or thered be precious little work on display in our galleries of modern art for every display of gigantism it is blessed relief is it not to turn to a miniaturist not that there are many miniatures in the tates storerooms i was there with an acquaintance of mine the dealer gregory jance jance worked out of zurich for years for no other reason according to interviews than that they couldnt touch me there there had always been rumours about him rumours which started to make sense when one attempted to balance his few premierleague sales and therefore commissions against his lavish lifestyle these days he had homes in belgravia manhattans upper east side and moscow as well as a sprawling compound on the outskirts of zurich the moscow home seemed curious until one recalled stories of ikons smuggled out of the old soviet union and of art treasures taken from the nazis treasures which had ended up in the hands of politburo chiefs desperate for such things as hard dollars and new passports yes if even half the tales were true then gregory jance had sailed pretty close to the wind i was counting on it what a waste he said as i gave him a short tour of the storerooms the place was cool and hushed except for the occasional click of the machines which monitored air temperature light and humidity on the walls of the tate proper paintings such as those we passed now would be pored over passed by with reverence here they were stacked one against the other most shrouded in white sheeting like corpses or hamlets ghost in some shoddy student production identifier tags hung from the sheets like so many items in a lost property office such a waste jance sighed with just a touch of melodrama his dress sense did not lack drama either crumpled cream linen suit white brogues screaming red shirt and white silk cravat he shuffled along like an old man running the rim of his panama hat through his fingers it was a nice performance but if i knew my man then beneath it he was like bronze our meeting en principe was to discuss his latest crop of worldrenowned artists like most other gallery owners those who act as agents for certain artists jance was keen to sell to the tate or to any other national gallery he wanted the price hike that came with it along with the kudos but mostly the price hike he had polaroids and slides with him in my office i placed the slides on a lightbox and took my magnifier to them a pitiful array of semitalent dulled my eyes and my senses huge graffitistyle whorls which had been in the previous summer in new york mainly in my view because the practitioners tended to die young some neocubist stuff by a swiss artist whose previous work was familiar to me he had been growing in stature but this present direction seemed to me an alley with a brick wall at the end and i told jance as much at least he had a nice sense of colour and juxtaposition but there was worse to come combine paintings which rauschenberg could have constructed in kindergarten some not very clever geometric paintings too clearly based on stellas protractor series and found sculptures which looked like nam june paik on a very bad day throughout jance was giving me his pitch though without much enthusiasm where did he collect these people the unkind said he sought out the least popular exhibits at art school graduation shows more to the point where did he sell them i hadnt heard of him making any impact at all as an agent what money he made he seemed to make by other means finally he lifted a handful of polaroids from his pocket my latest find he confided scottish great future i looked through them how old he shrugged twentysix twentyseven i deducted five or six years and handed the photos back gregory i said shes still at college these are derivative evidence shes learning from those who have gone before and stylised such as students often produce she has talent and i like the humour even if that too is borrowed from other scottish artists he seemed to be looking in vain for the humour in the photos bruce mclean i said helpfully paolozzi john bellanys fish look closely and youll see i paused bring her back in five or ten years if shes kept hard at it if shes matured and if she has that nose for the difference between genius and sham he pocketed the photos and gathered up his slides his eyes glinting as though there might be some moisture there youre a hard man he told me but a fair one i hope and to prove it let me buy you a drink i didnt put my proposition to him quite then of course not over coffee and sticky cakes in the tate cafeteria we met a few weeks later casually as it were we dined at a small place in a part of town neither of us frequented i asked him about his young coterie of artists they seemed i said quite skilled in impersonation impersonation they have studied the greats i explained and can reproduce them with a fair degree of skill reproduce them he echoed quietly reproduce them i said i mean the influences are there i paused im not saying they copy no not that jance looked up from his untouched food are you coming to some point i smiled a lot of paintings in the storerooms gregory they so seldom see the light of day yes pity that such a waste when people could be savouring them he nodded poured some wine for both of us i think i begin to see he said i think i begin to see that was the start of our little enterprise you know what it was of course you have a keen mind you are shrewd and discerning perhaps you pride yourself on these things on always being one step ahead on knowing things before those around you have perceived them perhaps you too think yourself capable of the perfect crime a crime where there is no crime there was no crime because nothing was missing from the quarterly inventory first i would photograph the work indeed on a couple of occasions i even took one of jances young artists down to the storeroom and showed her the painting shed be copying shed been chosen because she had studied the minimalists and this was to be a minimalist commission minimalism interestingly proved the most difficult style to reproduce faithfully in a busy picture theres so much to look at that one can miss a wrong shade or the fingers of a hand which have failed to curl to the right degree but with a couple of black lines and some pink waves well fakes were easier to spot so it was that jances artist saw the work she was to replicate face to face then we did the measurements took the polaroids and she drew some preliminary sketches jance was in charge of finding the right quality of canvas the correct frame my job was to remove the real canvas smuggle it from the gallery and replace it with the copy reframing the finished work afterwards we were judicious jance and i we chose our works with care one or two a year we never got greedy the choice would depend on a combination of factors we didnt want artists who were too well known but we wanted them dead if possible i had a fear of an artist coming to inspect his work at the tate and finding a copy instead there had to be a buyer a private collector who would keep the work private we couldnt have a painting being loaned to some collection or exhibition when it was supposed to be safely tucked away in the vaults of the tate thankfully as id expected jance seemed to know his market we never had any problems on that score but there was another factor every now and then there would be requests from exhibitions for the loan of a painting one wed copied but as curator i would find reasons why the work in question had to remain at the tate and might offer by way of consolation some other work instead then there was the matter of rotation now and again as had to be the case or suspicion might grow one of the copies would have to grace the walls of the gallery proper those were worrying times and i was careful to position the works in the least flattering most shadowy locations usually with a much more interesting picture nearby to lure the spectator away i would watch the browsers once or twice an art student would come along and sketch the copied work no one ever showed a moments doubt and my confidence grew but then then we had loaned works out before of course id told the dinner party as much this or that cabinet minister might want something for the office something to impress visitors there would be discussions about a suitable work it was the same with particular benefactors they could be loaned a painting for weeks or even months but i was always careful to steer prospective borrowers away from the twenty or so copies it wasnt as though there was any lack of choice for each copy there were fifty other paintings they could have the odds as jance had assured me more than once were distinctly in our favour until the day the prime minister came to call this is a man who knows as much about art as i do about home brewing there is almost a glee about his studious ignorance and not merely of art but he was walking around the tate for all the world like a dowager around a department store and not seeing what he wanted voore he said at last i thought id misheard him ronny voore i thought you had a couple my eyes took in his entourage not one of whom would know a ronny voore if it blackballed them at the garrick but my superior was there nodding slightly so i nodded with him theyre not out at the moment i told the pm you mean theyre in he smiled provoking a few fawning laughs in storage i explained trying out my own smile id like one for number ten i tried to form some argument they were being cleaned restored loaned to philadelphia but my superior was nodding again and after all what did the pm know about art besides only one of our voores was a fake certainly prime minister ill arrange for it to be sent over which one i licked my lips did you have one in mind he considered lips puckered maybe i should just have a little look normally there were no visitors to the storerooms but that morning there were a dozen of us posed in front of shrew reclining and herbert in motion voore was very good with titles ill swear if you look at them long enough you really can see beyond the gobbets of oil the pastedon photographs and cinema stubs the splash of emulsion and explosion of colour the figures of a large murine creature and a man running the prime minister gazed at them in something short of thrall is it shrew as in shakespeare no sir i think its the rodent he thought about this vibrant colours he decided extraordinary my superior agreed one cant help feeling the influence of pop art one of the minions drawled i managed not to choke it was like saying one could see in beryl cook the influence of picasso the pm turned to the senior minion i dont know charles what do you think the shrew i think my heart leapt the prime minister nodded then pointed to herbert in motion that one i think charles looked put out while those around him tried to hide smiles it was a calculated putdown a piece of politics on the pms part politics had decided a fake ronny voore would grace the walls of number downing street i supervised the packing and transportation it was a busy week for me i was negotiating the loan of several rothkos for an exhibition of early works faxes and insurance appraisals were flying american institutions were very touchy about lending stuff id had to promise a braque to one museum and for three months at that in exchange for one of rothkos less inspired creations anyway despite headaches when the voore went to its new home i went with it id discussed the loan with jance hed told me to switch the copy for some other painting persisting that no one would know hell know id said he wanted a voore he knew what he wanted but why good question and id yet to find the answer id hoped for a firstfloor landing or some nook or cranny out of the general view but the staff seemed to know exactly where the painting was to hang something else had been removed so that it could take pride of place in the diningroom or one of the diningrooms i couldnt be sure how many there were id thought id be entering a house but number was a warren a veritable tardis with more passageways and offices than i could count i was asked if i wanted a tour of the premises so as to view the other works of art but by that time my head really did ache and i decided to walk back to the tate making it as far as millbank before i had to rest beside the river staring down at its sludgy flow the question had yet to be answered why did the pm want a ronny voore who in their right mind wanted a ronny voore these days the answer of course came with the telephone call joe hefferwhite was an important man he had been a senator at one time he was now regarded as a senior statesman and the american president sent him on the occasional highprofile highpublicity spot of troubleshooting and consciencesalving at one point in his life hed been mooted for president himself but of course his personal history had counted against him in younger days hefferwhite had been a bohemian hed spent time in paris trying to be a poet hed walked a railway line with jack kerouac and neal cassady then hed come into enough money to buy his way into politics and had prospered there i knew a bit about him from some background reading id done in the recent past not that id been interested in joseph hefferwhite but id been very interested in ronny voore the two men had met at stanford initially then later on had met again in paris theyd kept in touch thereafter drifting apart only after heff had decided on a political career there had been arguments about the hippie culture dropping out vietnam radical chic the usual sixties us issues then in ronny voore had laid down on a fresh white canvas stuck a gun in his mouth and gifted the world his final work his reputation which had vacillated in life had been given a boost by the manner of his suicide i wondered if i could make the same dramatic exit but no i was not the dramatic type i foresaw sleeping pills and a bottle of decent brandy after the party i was wearing my green armani hoping it would disguise the condemned look in my eyes joe hefferwhite had known voore had seen his style and working practice at first hand that was why the pm had wanted a voore to impress the american or perhaps to honour his presence in some way a political move as far from aesthetics as one could wander the situation was not without irony a man with no artistic sensibility a man who couldnt tell his warhol from his whistler this man was to be my downfall i hadnt dared tell jance let him find out for himself afterwards once id made my exit id left a letter it was sealed marked personal and addressed to my superior i didnt owe gregory jance anything but hadnt mentioned him in the letter i hadnt even listed the copied works let them set other experts on them it would be interesting to see if any other fakes had found their way into the permanent collection only of course i wouldnt be around for that number sparkled every surface was gleaming and the place seemed nicely undersized for the scale of the event the pm moved amongst his guests dispensing a word here and there guided by the man hed called charles charles would whisper a brief to the pm as they approached a group so the pm would know who was who and how to treat them i was way down the list apparently standing on my own though a minion had attempted to engage me in conversation it seemed a rule that no guest was to be allowed solitude pretending to examine a work by someone eighteenthcentury and flemish not my sort of thing at all the pm shook my hand ive someone id like you to meet he said looking back over his shoulder to where joe hefferwhite was standing rocking back on his heels as he told some apparently hilarious story to two grinning civil servants who had doubtless been given their doting orders joseph hefferwhite the pm said as if i didnt know as if i hadnt been avoiding the man for the past twentyeight minutes i knew i couldnt leave would be reminded of that should i try until the pm had said hello it was a question of protocol this was all that had kept me from going but now i was determined to escape the pm however had other plans he waved to joe hefferwhite like they were old friends and hefferwhite broke short his story not noticing the relief on his listeners faces and swaggered towards us the pm was leading me by the shoulder gently though it seemed to me that his grip burned over towards where the voore hung a table separated us from it but it was an occasional table and we werent too far from the canvas serving staff moved around with salvers of canapés and bottles of fizz and i took a refill as hefferwhite approached joe this is our man from the tate pleased to meet you hefferwhite said pumping my free hand he winked at the pm dont think i hadnt noticed the painting its a nice touch we have to make our guests feel welcome the tate has another voore you know is that so charles was whispering in the pms ear sorry have to go the pm said ill leave you two to it then and with a smile he was gone drifting towards his next encounter joe hefferwhite smiled at me he was in his seventies but extraordinarily well preserved with thick dark hair that could have been a weave or a transplant i wondered if anyone had ever mentioned to him his resemblance to blake carrington he leaned towards me this place bugged i blinked decided id heard him correctly and said i wouldnt know well hell doesnt matter to me if it is listen he nodded towards the painting that is some kind of sick joke dont you think i swallowed im not sure i follow hefferwhite took my arm and led me around the table so we were directly in front of the painting ronny was my friend he blew his brains out your prime minister thinks i want to be reminded of that i think this is supposed to tell me something what im not sure itll take some thinking you british are devious bastards i feel i should object to that hefferwhite ignored me ronny painted the first version of herbert in paris fortynine or fifty he frowned mustve been fifty know who herbert was he was studying the painting now at first his eyes flicked over it then he stared a little harder picking out that section and this concentrating who the champagne flute shook in my hand death i thought would come as some relief and not a moment too soon some guy we shared rooms with never knew his second name he said second names were shackles not like malcolm x and all that herbert was white nicely broughtup wanted to study sartre wanted to write plays and films and i dont know what jesus ive often wondered what happened to him i know ronny did too he sniffed lifted a canapé from a passing tray and shoved it into his mouth anyway he said through the crumbs herbert he didnt like us calling him herb he used to go out running healthy body healthy mind that was his creed hed go out before dawn usually just as we were going to bed always wanted us to go with him said wed see the world differently after a run he smiled at the memory looked at the painting again thats him running along the seine only the rivers filled with philosophers and their books all drowning he kept looking at the painting and i could feel the memories welling in him i let him look i wanted him to look it was more his painting than anyones i could see that now i knew i should say something like thats very interesting or that explains so much but i didnt i stared at the painting too and it was as though we were alone in that crowded noisy room we might have been on a desert island or in a time machine i saw herbert running saw his hunger i saw his passion for questions and the seeking out of answers i saw why philosophers always failed and why they went on trying despite the fact i saw the whole bloody story and the colours they were elemental but they were of the city too they were paris not long after the war the recuperating city blood and sweat and the simple feral need to go on living to go on living my eyes were filling with water i was about to say something crass something like thank you but hefferwhite beat me to it leaned towards me so his voice could drop to a whisper its a hell of a fake and with that and a pat on my shoulder he drifted back into the party i could have died i told jance it was straight afterwards i was still wearing the armani pacing the floor of my flat its not much third floor two bedrooms maida vale but i was happy to see it i could hardly get the tears out of my eyes the telephone was in my hand i just had to tell some body and who could i tell but jance well he said youve never asked about the client i didnt want to know jance i swear to god i nearly died he chuckled not really understanding he was in zurich sounded further away still i knew joe already had a couple of voores he said hes got some other stuff too but he doesnt broadcast the fact thats why he was perfect for herbert in motion but he was talking about not wanting to be reminded of the suicide he was talking about why the painting was there he thought it must be a message jance sighed politics who understands politics i sighed with him i cant do this any more dont blame you i never understood why you started in the first place lets say i lost faith me i never had much to start with listen you havent told anyone else who would i tell my mouth dropped open but i left a note a note for my boss might i suggest you go retrieve it beginning to tremble all over again i went out in search of a taxi the night security people knew who i was and let me into the building id worked there before at night it was the only time i could strip and replace the canvases busy tonight eh the guard said im sorry busy tonight he repeated your boss is already in when did he arrive not five minutes ago he was running running said he needed a pee i ran too ran as fast as i could through the galleries and towards the offices the paintings a blur either side of me running like herbert i thought there was a light in my superiors office and the door was ajar but the room itself was empty i walked to the desk and saw my note there still in its sealed envelope i picked it up and stuffed it into my jacket just as my superior came into the room oh good man he said rubbing his hands to dry them you got the message yes i said trying to still my breathing message i hadnt checked my machine thought if we did a couple of evenings it would sort out the rothko absolutely no need to be so formal though i stared at him the suit he said drinks at number ten i explained how did it go fine pm happy with his voore oh yes you know he only wanted it to impress some american one of his aides told me joseph hefferwhite i said and was he impressed i think so well it keeps us sweet with the pm and we all know who holds the pursestrings my superior made himself comfortable in his chair and looked at his desk wheres that envelope what there was an envelope here he looked down at the floor i swallowed drymouthed ive got it i said he looked startled but i managed a smile it was from me proposing we spend an evening or two on rothko my superior beamed great minds eh absolutely sit down then lets get started i pulled over a chair can i let you into a secret i detest rothko i smiled again im not too keen myself sometimes i think a student could do his stuff just as well maybe even better but then it wouldnt be his would it ah theres the rub but i thought of the voore fake and joe hefferwhites story and my own reactions to the painting to what was when alls said and done a copy and i began to wonder glimmer this is the way the sixties ends someone told you anitas a witch you can believe it when you ask her black or white she says black so you dont put any milk in her coffee she tips some of it on to the carpet leaving room for a measure of jd then she goes to find keith or brian or somebody you screw the top back on the bottle stepping around the coffee patch the floor accepts this latest insult this new recruit to its wash of wash of what come on youre the writer here you need to describe that carpet keep the metaphor going recruit because the floor looks like a battlefield original carpet colour raw liver not much of that on view beneath the layered effluvium of trodden crisps sandwich crusts paper bags butt ends spent matches roaches chocolate wrappings the drinks cans the bottles the music papers and magazines autographed photos flashbulbs envelopes and tape reels how much of this do you need look there beside a cigarette packet three crumpled balls of paper lyric sheets lets pick up one of those unravel it a rough draft just a few lines really searching for an internal rhyme at the top the words tea and sympathy underlined followed by a double question mark the songs working title the band photo might be worth something to the groupies outside except most of them have gone further their bodies are their autograph books they trade stories of scenes theyve been part of tales youd have to tone down even for the sunday scandalsheets its four in the morning now but you can bet therell still be a huddle outside the studio sometimes someone takes pity gives orders for hot tea to be dispensed with or without the sympathy four oclock and london feels like a backwater theres a man seated on the floor in the corner hes asleep he was asleep twelve hours ago twice now youve checked hes still breathing thin grey hair curdled beard clothes from california hes a writer too only hes more famous than you his first novel made him rich hes been working eight years on a followup when he was last awake you interviewed him for your piece this he told you is the beginning of the negation of a generation the cusp of devilment my friend seizing the day and wringing its neck all gods children got wings but only acid has the flight schedule you have the look of a smoker give me a cigarette youd seen him described once as a lost generation guru more than one meaning there friend where did they come from these people they seemed to attach themselves to the band for hours days weeks they seemed to do so with ease but the core of the band youve yet to see anyone penetrate that like theres some inner sanctum someplace no one else is allowed thats what you want your piece to penetrate yours would be the last word the defining statement this was the deal youd made with yourself biography born working class local secondary modern art college and rhythm guitar in a couple of groups then youd written your four angry plays and theyd become a quartet a success on the london stage now touring the provinces nobody got all the jokes nobody got all the anger the thing is youre not angry now but anger is what everyone wants from you youve written five hundred words on the band only another four and a half thousand to go and there are girls outside who would sleep with you for your mere proximity to something they cant have and theres a man asleep in the corner who earns more for a public lecture than you did for your first two plays and as he told you he lectures off the top of his head the head youre itching to kick but not in an angry way and heres anita again and shes saying youre my chauffeur darling handing you some keys she pecks your cheek her eyes smeared black you ask her what your name is and she laughs chauffeurs dont have names liebchen then she leads you out to the bentley the girls outside they dont like anita they offer her dark glances does anita have one of those metaphysical backstage passes the kind marked all areas no you dont think so and it seems to annoy her for all her power all her obvious allure she lacks that final ticket of admission so youre driving through the silent streets getting further and further away from your story and shes spread across the back seat the windows are open and her hair is flying across her face shes singing the same notes over and over oooooo oooooo she asks you what they sound like a train you yell into the wind you know the whistle blowing she smiles youre a romantic well if its not a train what is it she sits upright slides forward so her head is just behind yours banshees she says quietly theyre banshees her mouth is close to your ear oooooo she goes then she sits back you ask her where youre supposed to be going but shes not listening you end up driving along the embankment thinking maybe she wants dropping off at cheyne walk but she doesnt even recognise the place a couple of taxis are pulling away from the houses of parliament end of a latenight debate theres a police car parked at the entrance to downing street you wrote a piece about the government for one of the sunday papers nobody paid much attention when the tramp back at the studio wrote about jfks assassination for playboy they paid him five thousand dollars and he got to spend the day at hefners mansion youre sure the band have been there too anita probably wasnt invited christ she shrieks so that you flinch at the steeringwheel ive had the most amazing idea shes ordering you to turn the car round cursing you for taking her so far from the studio you dont even know whose car it is but you bend to her urgency take the bentley up on to a pavement as you swing back in the direction youve just come back to the studio where anita flies into the recording room and now shes back again gathering everyone together even the writer wakes to her spell theres a french director there too godard isnt it he has a film crew with him he tried to talk to you about anarchy yesterday but his english and your french conspired against the dialogue a circle is forming around the microphone youve all got headphones on and finally after instructions from anita the track begins to play anita leads you all in the dance percussion then the lead vocal with piano accompaniment on the periphery you can see the band theyre in the production suite with the engineer they look tired indulgent maybe just drunk then anita raises her hand its just about time oooooo oooooo oooooo oooooo and youre the banshee in a rock and roll band where is this party the tall windows are draped with black velvet candles red lightbulbs batik scarves thrown over lampshades sweet herbal fug in the air drug cocktails a speciality de la maison the host youve barely spoken with him is minor aristocracy according to one of your sources dabbles in the stock market according to another the food has mostly gone guests have been folding up multiple slices of smoked salmon and cramming them into already bloated cheeks its hard to tell because of the lighting but nobody looks really well faces are pierrot white or would be in daylight in sunshine is there sunshine outside watches are being removed at the door taken away and hidden by the host no clocks no telephones radio tv were out of time hed said smiling this party does not exist in time and we keep on partying till nineteenseventy youd felt like asking him how anyone would know when nineteenseventy arrived but then someone had passed you a joint and you hadnt asked any questions after that for quite a while what was it not just hash hash you can handle some altogether weightier matter a touch of heroin in the mix a welltoked speedball theres music playing and bodies strewn over the floor and the sofas and the scattercushions you were brought here by two of your subjects youve begun to think of them as subjects not that youre their master quite the reverse but now you cant see anyone you know jeff the nose has been and gone klein was invited apparently but no way would he show rumours of contract difficulties of money owed a beatle did a blessed beatle drift past your eyeline an hour or more ago and did he look too mortal kenneth anger was in town but declined your request for an interview he had conversations with your subjects behind closed doors some people think anger is a magus you know who he wants to cast in his next film lucifer rising you know who he thinks would make the perfect lucifer the preterperfect beelzebub everyone knows youve been reading a book the master and margarita marianne gave it to mick bulgakovs novel gave him notions hardened up tea and sympathy turned it into something stranger and more wonderful you wonder if itll get airtime you didnt just sing backing vocals on that song you became part of something bigger something youve so far failed to put into words a woman is handing you a joint her eyelashes are thickened to spider legs her long strawcoloured hair has been braided and piled atop her head looking like coiled snakes medusa you intone will you turn me to stone she ignores the question asks you something about clapton and youre shaking your head as you inhale bailey she tries you shake your head again and she moves away her snakes writhing but thats all right because inside your head you can hear percussion and jungle vocals primal thats the word youve been searching for and now you have it you dont know what to do with it the party is carried along by its own momentum guests come and go but the core group stays becoming stronger then suddenly a decision is made and everyones groping for jackets and scarves flouncing out of the flat and down the stairs its evening and the fresh air feels like nothing youve ever experienced you suck it in and listen to the traffic cars and taxi cabs everyones heading somewhere and youre part of the flow a tenminute ride and youre spilling out of the vehicles scurrying back indoors a nightclub this time the vesuvio youve been here before but never in such exalted company theres someone tugging at your sleeve youre wearing the ruffled white shirt which youve been told makes you ever so slightly byronic an arm around your shoulder lips pressed to your ear from now on sweetcakes you hear everythings strictly off the record deal of course its a deal and youre in is that mccartney over there gifts are being unwrapped its micks twentysixth hard to believe all the history hes made christ anythings possible its and everythings spinning the world reaching out godard youre sure now its him has his arms outstretched a painted woman falls into them is she really naked or does she just look that way youre seeing everything through a lens youre hearing everything in glorious stereophonic youre ceasing to see the world in terms of words except when theyre lyrics the dj announces something very special that percussive opening again really cranked up this time hairs begin to rise on your arms people invade the dance floor they writhe they squirm the wine is bloodred and warm your knees are refusing to lock they send you down on to all fours the glass tumbling and smashing good dog someone says rubbing your hair good and faithful servant hes wearing sandals and tight red trousers you recognise the voice of course you force yourself to look up towards his face but see only radiance and the record plays on a respectful amount of time later when the album has finished and the crowd has finished its applause mccartney hands the dj something his own band have been working on the crowd sway and sing along to the chorus st jude patron saint of lost causes the song seems to go on for ever and its so sad so personal and emotional you begin to cry a week later youre still crying the album isnt going to be released both record companies uk and us want the sleeve changed they dont like toilet humour youd made your own humble suggestions about possible graffiti and managed to feel snubbed when none were taken up toilet wall someone commented brilliant idea just perfect cos thats where this decades headed straight down the shitter you wondered at the time what he was talking about but the first single released into a summer of street riots has already been banned in some american cities the band is never far from a news story which is why your magazine has given you so much leeway not that theyll give you any more money but theyll wait another month or so for the real commentary the last word on the drenched hedonism of rock and roll let them wait the story no longer matters to you what matters is a sense you have of where things are headed which is why youre enraged when mick makes his film and youre not allowed on the set hes acting with anita there are tensions there to be exploited then marianne loses the baby shes been carrying and you cant help wondering about signs and portents you talk to brian about it hes moved into a a milnes old house and wants to show you around he says you can feel free to take a dip in the pool but you refuse his voice always a quiet lisp seems already otherworldly he has big ideas and a nice sense of betrayal he tells you again that you can swim any time you like you were never much of a swimmer and now you feel like youre sinking more uppers more downers and more of everything in between the magazine gives up on you but another shows interest everyone thinks you have access only you know the truth the access you want the only access that matters is the one youll always be denied youve captured barely a glimmer of the story your original employer hears about your new employer and decides to sue ugly bits of paper fly around your head full of legalese and figures lawyers want your notes and tapes they want everything you produced you hand over a single sheet five hundred words you lie about everything else and spend three weeks in your freezing flat promising your agent who has promised a west end producer that youre writing a new play another black comedy but angry yes your agent says you drop the receiver back into its cradle then you get word of the filming a tv special to be recorded over two days the audience will be in fancy dress top acts and circus sideshows you go along but are disappointed on the studio set youre too obviously a spectator rather than a participant theres a distance there that you cannot bridge you pick up a girl take her home she sees your place and immediately becomes less impressed you play her the record but theres no way of proving that you were there that youre part of it you play her a section from one of your interviews but the words seem to bore her she only really perks up when you wheel out the drugs you owe jeff the nose sixty quid for the goods and only went to him because you owe the others so much theyve stopped your supply friends arent as patient as they used to be you were in a pub in camden the other night telling your story and someone called out change the fucking record that ones been played to death everyone laughed until you swept your arm across the table sending the glasses flying your agent is discouraging no ones going to hand over a single halfpenny on the strength of three firstact scenes so you write a fourth and then its and brians out of the group and brians dead youre there for the free concert just another face in the crowd the entourage the powers know you never finished your article they think you never will when the box of butterflies is opened youre close enough to the stage to see that many of them have already expired its july hotter than hells fire mick looks well hes heading for australia to make another film you didnt even bother trying for permission to tag along but you have finished your play it ended up being performed in hampstead didnt transfer to the west end the critics were scornful but it got your name back into contention for a little while and youve been offered some film work script doctoring in hollywood you know a few writers out there brits who went for money over sensibility one novelist who wrote the first two parts of what was going to be englands great postwar trilogy then legged it at the first sniff of dollars and a nicely tanned coastline you spoke to him by telephone he told you to jump at the chance you jumped hated los angeles heard that marianne had recovered from an overdose keith and anita were in cheyne walk and had created a new magic circle of friends people who shared their habits you almost allowed yourself a cruel smile when the money wars became public klein the chief suspect you knew theyd tour theyd have to how else to dig themselves out of the financial hole and you knew theyd hit the west coast and you knew youd be waiting the script doctors got together to tell stories about past hollywood prisoners faulkner fitzgerald chandler all of whom had liked a drink alcohol hadnt bothered the moguls drugs didnt seem to bother them either just as long as the work got done that was your problem hope and work just didnt mix you had an apartment in studio city but the walls were too close together and the view from your window was a concrete wall you joked that there was more room in your car a tbird youd bought from a tv actor who was up on a dui charge he was hoping to persuade the court that he was shedding his old life the consensus was hed win his case he played pretty well to an audience had some stage work behind him you liked to get out of the city drive up the coast even when it was hazy especially when it was hazy you loved the feeling of driving into something you couldnt see loved when each curve in the road surprised you it was like driving into the future you told a girl about your feelings she said the image wasnt new mentioned its use in a novel a few years back it was the first novel by the sleepy american he still hadnt produced a followup and amazingly this had only increased his profile the nonbook taking on heroic status all he had to do was claim hed finished another chapter and it was the talk of the coffee shops you saw him once in haightashbury stumbling along at the roachend of the hippy dream san francisco had the airplane and the dead but la had the doors and it seemed to you that la was the true indicator of the way things were going nobody much cared when lennon handed back his mbe the much greater gesture belonged to charles manson and his family everyone in your circle was talking about that then there was vietnam and the panthers violence no longer content to bubble beneath the haze and then the band came to the los angeles forum riding on the back of hiked ticket prices and rising bad will the underground press no longer underground had the knives out from the start which didnt stop you paying your you made a halfhearted attempt at breaching the backstage defences but didnt recognise any of the faces do you have any authority one of the security goons asked and you had to admit to yourself that you did not the show itself was okay they were playing tracks from the new album your moment of fame was already history the band had moved on the new songs seemed obsessed with downfall and mayhem the last track seemed to you to be waving goodbye to everybodys good times you doubted the panthers and the angels would disagree it was typical of the band to want to replicate woodstocks good feelings typical that they misjudged the way the worlds mood had travelled since then their own free concert was by way of an apology for ticket scams and all that illfeeling you knew it wasnt going to be that easy for a start the drugs had moved on everything was bad diluted cut with poison lethal you were a pro you could probably give keith lessons on where to score you had managed to pull yourself away from the siren call of heroin but the acid seemed to be giving you more bad trips than good ones nevertheless on the day you took a proffered tab from a complete stranger and tripped in cold black light explosions strafing the sky the sound system consisted of alarm bells and artillery the crowd was hungry tired concussed they needed everything they werent getting the medicos couldnt cope with the trauma victims word went around dont touch any acid youre not sure of but you already had and youd handed over money for a single sheet of further trips little purple stars an ironic comment on the war in vietnam who gave a shit you were beyond irony by this point you had about a week to go before your employers threw you out youd added nothing of inspiration to a modern western theyd asked you to pep up had failed dismally to pitch them a black comedy about the drug scene in la you were not justifying their early faith in you you were on the road out of tinseltown back to blighty a dismal prospect youd already traded the tbird to pay off a debt which had come with the promise of a switchblade attached theyd threatened to cut off your eyelids that was the way things were now the most potent threat anyone could make was to stop you ceasing to see youd hitched down here with a friend the traffic had forced you out of the car five miles from the field and youd promptly lost your friend in the crowd not that hed be your friend for long you owed him money too and were planning to fly off without making good you were way past making good you noticed them early on the angels they revved their engines clearing a path for several dozen hogs which they parked in front of the stage creating a security cordon and then the guest bands started coming on and it got colder and trouble flared pool cues and motorbike chains ugly cries and gashed heads pleas from the stage going unheeded an angel going up there to pick a fight with a stoned musician you were standing next to this black guy when the headliners your old muckers finally came on your whole body was numb but your brain was alive with sparks the air felt malign the hairs once more rose on your arms violence broke out again this is heavy the black guy said you offered him a tab of your acid showed him the little purple stars i sang backing on this you shouted the black guy nodded in the studio you persisted im there on the album he nodded again but you knew he wasnt listening you were humming now brimful of brimstone and up there on the stage they were playing your tune this is it man you yelled at your new friend slapping him on the back this is us this is what its all about come on and you gave him a push that sent him jogging down to the front right into the phalanx of guards you stayed back you watched you saw silver flash in the darkness a gun a knife your friend went down and was swallowed up by denim jackets and leathers people started screaming showing bloodied palms to the band on the stage over the microphone a doctor was requested the cusp of devilment my friend you nodded to yourself jungle drums dying in your ears the sacrifice had been made the energy had been earthed angers lucifer had been appeased or whatever and the sky made a song of your cries unlucky in love unlucky at cards unlucky at cards lucky in love isnt that how the saying goes which is why chick morrison went to the casino the night his wife finally walked out shed left a note explaining that she wasnt leaving him it was just that she couldnt stand his habits any longer he tore her note up it had taken her several attempts the rejects were little crumpled balls in the kitchen bin he lifted each one out and spread them on the table trying to work out their chronological sequence it wasnt just a matter of the shortest one being the first attempt each began on a different tack she was leaving him because she felt lost and had to find herself she was leaving him because it would be cruel not to she was leaving him well he had to admire her for all the effort shed taken all the effort shed felt he merited or maybe she just didnt want him going after her the thing was hed already started started and finished really hed been following her on and off for three weeks had seen her enter the mans house had watched her leave patting her hair back into place hed taken to tailing the man too not knowing why wondering maybe if he could learn something something about the kind of man his wife wanted him to be but all hed felt was growing tiredness and in a moment of sharp lucidity that he didnt care any more didnt love her any more which didnt make it any easier to just let her go hed wondered about killing her making ever more convoluted plans he knew the problem with murder was that the spouse was always first in the frame so the murder had to be perfect he needed either a castiron alibi or to make sure the body was never found it was a matter of pride wasnt it for years on and off hed enjoyed the fantasy of being the one to walk out the one to make the break and now shed beaten him to it she was the one starting the new life which meant he was the one whod been left in the lurch he didnt like that he resolved to do something about it what he did was drive into aberdeen park the car and hit the pubs and clubs and at closing time as he was being escorted from the final hostelry hed seen lights and smokedglass doors with an illuminated staircase behind them the casino lucky at cards unlucky in love hed proven the latter it was time to give the former a chance walked in watched for a little while getting a feel for the place that was what he did in his line of work he tried to fit in as quickly as possible melt into the scenery the person you didnt notice as you left your hotel assignation or partook of a final embrace in an apparently empty car park those were the moments when chick would catch you with his camera making sure you were in the frame but that night he felt he wanted to be seen so he sat in on a card game did all right at first losing a little here winning a hand or two there he was not a natural cardplayer he knew how to play knew all about cardcounting but wasnt up to it he liked to pretend games were all about luck rather than the playing of percentages he wrote out a cheque backed it with his bankers card the new stack of chips arrived and he began the dogged task of giving them away his occasional brash bets were whittled away to steady tosses of a single chip into the pot it was late into the night most of the tables were quiet gamblers whod finished for the evening were standing around the table a phalanx which seemed to constrain those still playing to get up and leave in front of an audience it would have been like walking away from a fight he slid another chip across the smooth green cloth received a card there were four people playing but he felt it had become personal between himself and the sweating man opposite he could smell the man could feel his heavy breath brushing his cheek and cooling it the man had an american accent fatcat oilexecutivetype so when his opponent won for the umpteenth time that was enough for chick he had found an escape clause a way to get out without losing face he leapt to his feet accused the man of cheating people were telling him to calm down they were telling him he was just not a very good player saying it wasnt his night but thered be others he was looking around for whoever had said he wasnt any good his eyes landed on those of the american who seemed to be smiling as he pulled the chips in with a thick hairless arm chick pointed at the man ill have you pal if you get lucky the man said then there were security men on chick hauling him out of there as he yelled back at the table face red from embarrassment knowing his escape clause had turned sour on him same as everything else one of the other players was leaning over to talk to the fat man as chick was dragged away he got the idea the man was telling the winner who his opponent had been chick morrison chick called out to the room and dont you ever forget it he spent the next couple of days not answering the phone there was an answering machine behind the sofa and hed lie there listening to the messages usually there was horseracing on tv which he watched with the sound down making mental bets which didnt pay out but didnt cost him anything either the messages were not important there was another machine at his office and it would be collecting any offers of work eventually he knew hed go to the office get back into a routine he tried telling himself he was enjoying the break all he ever did in his job was provide photos for suspicious spouses there was nothing from his wife he thought about heading to her new beaus house wouldnt that surprise them but didnt one or two past and potential clients did call him his home phone number was part of the message they got if they called his office though it warned them to call his home only in an emergency the calls he listened to didnt sound like emergencies a woman who was on her third husband shed had him investigate all three hed reported back that they were all good and true and faithful but she didnt sound convinced a man who was on the run from his wife she wanted maintenance payments money the man said he didnt have now he thought shed hired a private detective and wanted to hire one of his own to find out and how chick wondered was he going to get paid when the man had no money for maintenance some of these people but then she rang and the sound of her voice made him replay the tape and on the third play he found himself reaching for pen and notepad taking down her number calling her back im glad you could come in at such short notice she said it was after hours at the car showroom shed told him the door would be open he could let himself in to get to her office hed walked past a gleaming display of supercars chick had never been inside the showroom before knew there was nothing here hed be able to afford she held out her hand and he took it she was a wellpreserved fifty expensive hair and just the right amount of makeup he told her hed always imagined the j gemmell of j gemmell motors would be a man she smiled surprises a lot of people the js for jacqueline he sat down opposite her asked what it was he could do for her she told him she had a repo job thats what they call it isnt it chick nodded though he wasnt sure himself he took down details as she told him about the car it was a topoftherange lexus bought on credit the last two monthly payments hadnt come through and the buyer had done a bunk i put word out discreetly she told chick i dont want it getting about that im an easy target thats where you come in she told him a garage on the outskirts of inverness had reported the lexus stopping for petrol the driver had told the attendant he was on his way to his holiday place in the hills above loch ness i want you to find him mr morrison and bring my car back here chick nodded he was still nodding as she brought a roll of banknotes from her drawer and proceeded to peel off ten fifties i get a lot of cash customers she said with a wink hard to bank the stuff without the taxman taking an interest chick pocketed the money then he asked for the drivers name jack grover she told him he has a personalised number plate as she went on to describe grover a smile spread over chicks face she saw it and broke off you know him chick told her he thought he did he shrugged like it was the most natural thing in the world and added that knowing people was his job after all she looked impressed as he was leaving he had a thought any chance of a testdrive some day he asked she smiled at him bring back my lexus you can have your pick of the showroom chick was actually blushing as he left he knew a mechanic in peterhead who showed him the best way to get into a lexus and start it up it took the mechanic about a minute and a half he told chick his teenage son could do it in twentyeight seconds flat on the drive west thoughts raced through chicks mind a body could disappear in a loch and never be found then there were the highlands themselves remote and unvisited a corpse could lie there for months becoming unrecognisable and the roads around loch ness were treacherous an accident could have you over the side he asked at the tourist board about holiday cottages in the area got a list but it might be a private house so he bought himself an ordnance survey map each little black dot was a building he made a triangle of inverness beauly and urquhart castle somewhere in here he felt he would find the lexus and its driver jack grover the man whod beaten him at cards the roads were narrow and steep the land empty except for the occasional croft or recently built bungalow he stopped to ask questions not being subtle about it a man in a big silver car had anyone seen him he was living nearby he spent two days like this two days of rejection silence and slow shakes of the head two days spent mostly by himself to save money and the journey back to inverness he slept in his ford mondeo parking it on forest tracks he knew he needed a shave and change of clothes but those could wait he wanted the job finished because now he had a plan of sorts it was stupid to blame his wife to think of harming her her new man well that was for the future maybe but jack grover on the other hand he just had to rub his nose in it just to show him he could he was thinking these things when he found the lexus it was parked in full view outside a twostorey house on the outskirts of milton chick stopped his car by the roadside and looked around the house seemed quiet he drove into milton and left his car there it could be picked up later then taking his camera with him he walked back to the lexus took another look around and got to work he was sweating by the time hed got the door open and started the ignition he got his camera ready and sounded the horn wanting grover to see him making off in the car wanting a photo of the moment of triumph but no one came to the door chick tried again still no one came he felt deflated as he sped out of the driveway and down to the banks of the loch taking the road back into inverness but as he crossed the caledonian canal he felt the cars steering slip and a low juddering from beneath he pulled over and found that he had a puncture cursing silently he kicked the tyre and opened the boot looking for a jack and spare tyre and found instead a body not any old body but that of the card player jack grover chick stumbled backwards and turned his head to be sick on the verge trembling approaching the boot again he took a handkerchief out to wipe his mouth the bundle of notes came with it floating into the boot he reached in for them beginning to wonder now cash in hand untraceable gently he patted the dead mans pockets and reached a hand into one bringing out a wallet he thought he could hear a siren in the distance there were credit cards in the wallet and the same name on all of them james gemmell the jg on the numberplate stood for james gemmell not jack grover he saw it in a flash there was no jack grover no stolen lexus there was just jacqueline gemmells husband who had gone home and told his wife about some drunk in the casino whod been steamed up at him a private detective of all things the sirens were closer now chick rubbed his jaw feeling the rasp of his beard seeing himself dishevelled and dirty recalling all the witnesses who would say hed been looking for a man in a lexus and the witnesses at the casino hed told them to remember his name seeing with absolute clarity the way hed been used by gemmells wife who had found for herself the perfect way to get rid of an unwanted spouse chick had been wrong you didnt need an unbreakable alibi or some obscure hidingplace all you needed was someone like him unlucky in love unlucky at cards someone you could put in the frame video nasty you know the videos i mean they get passed around brought back from trips to germany or france or the united states a case of beer and a few mates round while the ladies are elsewhere you wont see ladies in these videos except on the covers oh yes the models on the covers are dolls but on the tape itself well once inside we are talking gynaecology and the rougher it gets the rougher the women begin to look when one of the men suggests anal sex you can be sure a new woman is about to enter the scene her eyes as tired and heavy as her flesh all pucker and tattoo and bruise i wonder about those bruises sometimes about coercion and persuasion behind the scenes im always invited to watch these videos for two reasons my working knowledge of french and german and my technical ability with video recorders these films arent always compatible with the british vhs players you can lose colour sound or even the picture but with a few homemade cables and boxes of tricks everythings made hunkydory which pleases my friend maxwell no end whats that hes saying kenny which one i can see at least three men the one whos talking idiot hes saying faster faster and maxwell nods he looks like hes watching a buñuel film my translation crucial to his understanding and appreciation of the directors intent but the film were watching along with andrew mark and jimmy has the same dénouement as the dozen or so others in maxwells mews flat despite being a bachelor he keeps these videos tucked away in the wardrobe in his bedroom i think for him the furtiveness is part of the fun perhaps even all the fun i look around at my friends faces they are like kids at a birthday party watching goofy cartoons they say you can choose your friends but thats a lie my life i am sure is a closed loop like the eighttrack cartridges you still find at car boot sales along with betamax video recorders and broken rolf harris stylophones look at maxwell i didnt choose him on our first day at school we just happened to sit together the next day it seemed polite to do the same and besides the other desks and chairs were already occupied we never had much in common more certainly when at school than at university and more at university than since maxwell is still single has a fabulous job with attendant car and home in the right part of town and sees life as a series of challenges i am married in a deadend career with an ailing automobile and a tenement flat my life too is a series of challenges but where maxwell spends his time trying to work out which gorgeous woman to date next or where next to go for a sundrenched holiday i spend my time worrying over mortgage overdraft car insurance and council tax one night a week i slip out from alices clutches for the euphemistic pint with the lads we meet up in the same pub then visit a new pub where maxwell will chat up the barmaid and take carryout food back to his place where we might watch a video or play cards since the videos are all basically the same video maxwell attempts variety by trying to freezeframe the come shot fastforward through the humping or slomo the oral sex i think this irritates the others not just me and at the end of it all maxwell has the same comment ready for me a comment whose surface envy disguises a deeper sense of superiority of course hell say kennys the lucky one he spends all day surrounded by teenage lovelies of course i do its one of the schoolteachers few perks youre asking yourself what does all this have to do with the fact that alice was eventually put away for murder and i answer that its all to do with a video because the barmaid reminded me of a model on the cover of one of maxwells videos the video was called asian brothel orgy no vagueness there video titles are seldom open to misinterpretation you dont look at them and ask yourself hm wonder what that ones about teenage dog orgy would mean just that im afraid of course none of asian brothel orgy took place in asia and only one model bore any resemblance to someone from that part of the globe the cover showed a perky blonde and blueeyed teenager american i suppose like the movie looking coy and positioned so that nude she still showed little of interest to the regular porno customer she was the tease the promise of interior revelation the back cover of course was a different matter medical closeups of penetration and ingestion the front cover model naturally did not appear in the film it took me a while to place her im not suggesting that the new lunchtime barmaid did sparetime modelling for porno cassettes but the two were distinctly similar i went to the pub most lunchtimes but seldom paid attention to the staff being more interested in my beer and the all too occasional presence of jennie muir our french teacher actually it was jennies more frequent absences from the pub which put blinkers on me id sit eating crisps staring into the bag as it emptied wondering what shed make of my friday night translations for maxwell and the others whats she saying now kenny shes saying harder harder faster faster when i wanted to watch a video in my own home id try to rent something french despite alices protests that subtitles were too much like hard work she preferred steve martin or michael caine over the latest gallic smash and had actually unplugged the machine halfway through delicatessen its anything but delicate shed fumed in my short reverie prior to two crushing hours with the sixth years or an hour of shakespeare or poetry id stare into the crisp packet and see it as the interior of a nice flat by the river a small balcony leading to the livingroom where jennie sat on a white leather sofa sipping chablis and chuckling at delicatessen i proffered more wine which she accepted we chinked glasses then i folded the crisp packet tied a knot in it and tossed it into the ashtray it was frank marsh who noticed her new barmaids a smasher he said placing a pint in front of me really frank taught woodwork his working knowledge was of planes and drill bits rather than women hed been fiftysix years a single man never having seen the point of getting bogged down i was a little envious of him i glanced over my shoulder anyway christ i said causing frank to chuckle she was chatting to a customer freshfaced and with a hand resting on one of the beer pumps slender arms appearing from a baggy white tshirt i imagined jennie muir having depths of passion and provocation but there was nothing submerged about the vision in front of me all was glorious surface inside a few days the lunchtime clientele of our unassuming pub had doubled word was getting around only later did i equate donna the barmaids years blonde hair and blue eyes with asian brothel orgy then i happened to mention it to maxwell the biggest mistake of my life just about he turned up one lunchtime with a slap on my shoulder startled i tipped some beer on to my trousers sorry kenny he said here ill fetch a cloth when he returned he already knew her name and her age you were absolutely right he told me watching as i wiped stains from my crotch shes great and she does look like the bird off the front of the vid what the hell are you doing here i knew maxwell worked three miles away from the school and regarded lunchhours as an anachronism he shrugged just passing my names maxwell by the way he shoved a hand out towards frank marsh since kennys not going to introduce us frank blinked towards me maxwell was the only one who called me kenny at school i was ken and to alice i was always kenneth she managed to make it sound like a rebuke i hated kenny and maxwell knew it once or twice id responded in kind with max or even maxie but he just smiled fondly and eventually i came back to maxwell hed managed somehow to avoid abbreviations and nicknames at school while i was thanks to my parents already a kenny when i arrived there the nearest i got to niggling him was to attempt what i call the reverse pun opening our conversations with the line hows maxwell making the hows sound like house get it can i get anyone a drink maxwell asked now frank rapidly finished his pint and tell me do they do food here maxwell stood up no dont bother ill just go ask donna by this time you see donna had replaced jennie muir in my fantasies instead of the riverside apartment there was a stuffy blanketed room walls painted black and hung with animal skins candles flickered on every surface and in the middle of the floor was a mattress sans bedstead bloodred wine replaced the chilled chablis and there was a frenzy of music on the hifi for nearly two weeks id been looking forward to lunchtimes and then going over them again during the subsequent afternoons id broken the ice with donna had ascertained that she liked rock and a little bit of jazz didnt go to watch films but liked clubbing at weekends thats why i work lunchtimes whenever i can keeps the nights free her pale face surrounded crimson lips she wore two gold studs in either earlobe i started to drink a whisky with my beer just so shed turn around towards the row of optics giving me the chance to stare her shape seemed near perfect set off by short hugging skirts and thick black tights surface everything was there not like in the videos where the nakedness was so naked that it became clothing in itself i dont know how you can teach in the afternoons she said one day she meant how could i teach after a couple of pints and a couple of shorts the answer was by remote control literally i used videos more and more in the classroom hogging the tv set showing whatever was vaguely relevant and available shakespeare was easy poetry not id even take a class to the schools video lab we have some excellent facilities due to a goahead rector who realises that technology is where future jobs lie what he doesnt realise is that after hours i often use the video labs facilities for copying maxwells tapes i could fill an hour showing the class how to edit films why the cameraman is so important and how an editor can make a movie work where the director has failed i could do all of this and still have room in my head for candles and music and animal skins until maxwell came along within a week hed fixed a date with donna and the first date was followed by a second one day i hurried to the pub only to find the manager on reluctant duty shes buggered off he informed me took another job a job maxwell had found for her convenient to his own office when he told me this on the phone that evening told me while alice played tv roulette with the remote and ate another packet of crisps i knew i had to do something the livingroom seemed stuffier than ever chip fat and salt blue noise from the television and a sofa full of wife my life felt horribly scripted badly acted its scenes decided long before id been cast for the role splice and edit i thought splice and edit i might not be the director but i could still save the movie just one of those things i thought to myself just one of those crazy things i couldnt get those two lines out of my head as i stood there over maxwells body i was reassuring myself that id only come to his place to talk to talk about what thats what the police would ask to talk about donna whom he was dating and i fancied so you were jealous then sir officer i spend most of my life in a state of jealousy hed only fallen down the stairs of course id been apologising as i walked down after him but hed lain there very still and when i hauled him up by the shoulders his head swivelled wildly neck obviously broken i checked his pulse anyway and found nothing only a fall down the stairs except that i pushed him oh yes wed been arguing or rather id been arguing and maxwell had been laughing at me we hadnt even got as far as his livingroom id been arguing on my way up the stairs arguing ever since hed let me in the door in the hall at the top of the stairs i fairly vented my spleen until i could feel myself emptying the anger lessening catharsis i suppose or exorcism but he was still laughing rocking back on his heels so i stood there and blinked and then gave him a mighty shove i only just managed to stop myself tumbling after him gripping the banister rail i watched him sail backwards and begin the thumping descent its a steep staircase uncarpeted the wood stripped and varnished i remember the varnish was expensive but it meant the wood only had to be redone every five years or so just one of those things i thought to myself it was lucky maxwell lived in a mews those places are like morgues at the best of times this one even boasted a dead end no through traffic ground level was all doors and garages with livingroom windows above nobody was looking as i dragged maxwell out of his own door and into the boot of my car his keys slipped from his trouser pocket along with some loose change i scooped it all up and pocketed it i was supposed to be fetching fish and chips for our supper my excuse to alice for taking so long was car trouble i used maxwells change to buy the food parked outside my own flat and checked the boot was locked over supper id have a think what to do with maxwell since alice slept like a horse id have no trouble sneaking out in the dead of night to get rid of the poor bugger id seen enough crime movies to know that i mustnt panic and i must take care each take had to be a perfect take had to be what directors called a wrap on the way upstairs i unwrapped a hot package and pulled out a chip dropping it into my mouth it had a new and vivid flavour not that alice noticed if a thing wasnt behind glass and wrapped in japanese plastic and changeable with one press of the remote she tended not to see it she didnt see my heightened colour or the way i stared at my smeared plate so passive was she i almost wanted to blurt out a confession just once to surprise her i resisted the temptation of course as soon as its out of your mouth its in the public domain and this had to be kept strictly private strictly between me and god it would be interesting too to see if i possessed such a thing as a conscience by the time we got to bed i felt id explode i wasnt much nearer working out a plan my head full of sitcoms and advertising jingles i cleared my throat alice what do you really think of maxwell she was lying on her side her back to me one hand supporting her head and the other holding a paperback book maxwells all right i didnt say anything i feel sorry for him actually how do you mean i was startled she felt sorry for him she couldnt have surprised me more if shed said she was carrying his child all that bravado of his the macho stuff she left the explanation at that and returned to her book i dont understand that kenneth is because you never see things you and the rest of your cronies what dont we see you dont see anything you dont see anything at all now shut up and go to sleep i lay on my back compliantly wondering whether it was best to feign sleep and wait it out till the wee small hours or try to get some sleep and trust to my internal alarm clock i needed to be clearheaded which suggested sleep so i closed my eyes and dreamed of a long beach on which i walked for hours and hours while friends kept swimming ashore as though from some shipwreck alice woke me with a mug of tea and a couple of biscuits i sat up sluggishly it had been a long exhausting night i looked at the clock five minutes to eight my body was stiff arms aching you look rough alice agreed starting to dress i planted my feet on the cold floor and ran fingers through my hair it took me a while to admit that id done nothing about the body in my carboot id slept the whole night away over breakfast i pressed alice about what shed said in bed her face was grey and puffy like an inmates shed given up looking for a job a year or so ago and filled her days with shopping gossip and tv she gossiped at the shops often discussing the doings in one or other daytime soap her life too was an eighttrack cartridge the sofa had taken her shape so that i no longer felt comfortable sitting on it usually i sat on a beanbag on the floor reminding myself to get it refilled one of these days i even ate breakfast a bowl of cereal on the beanbag while alice sat on the sofa both of us staring towards breakfast tv with its little onscreen clock in the corner telling us it would soon be time for work or in alices case for yet more television she ignored my question so i repeated it what did you mean last night about maxwell hes gay what gay i hooted disbelief who told you that he did well not in so many words but women just know the way he talked to me one day when i dont know a few months back he came round and youd been kept at school by some meeting what did he say he didnt say anything he sort of talked around it you had to read between the lines this from someone who didnt even read a newspaper he goes out with loads of women exactly she said because hes scared to admit the fact i bet the reason hes so successful at dating is because his dates are so safe with him youve been watching too many of those problemairing programmes she shrugged but alice bless her had given me an idea there was a rundown cemetery in the city known to be frequented after dark by gays what a fine ironic place to dump the body then i thought of donna if maxwell was gay id killed him needlessly the whole thing was crazy why didnt you tell me before why should i she gave me one of her looks and disappeared into the kitchen i could hear running water she was washing her cereal bowl she hadnt even thought to take mine empty and on the floor beside me i stared at the tv no more porno evenings at maxwells flat no more fucking around with the remote no reason to leave my own flat on a friday night then without any warning the real plan leapt into my head so focused that it seemed like a gift from above i took a long detour on my drive to school stopping at maxwells the lane was as empty as ever i used his key to let myself in climbed the stairs quietly and opened his bedroom door fingerprints didnt concern me as a close friend and frequent visitor my prints would be everywhere anyway i removed a couple of the videos from maxwells wardrobe and while i was there sniffed around in search of some secret hoard of gay stuff but i didnt find anything other than some football magazines under the bed whatever turns you on i said to myself as i debated bringing the body back into the flat but decided against it i wanted to set everything up before allowing maxwell to be found so he stayed in the carboot all the way to school i did consider rigor mortis i wasnt sure about these things but reckoned he was going to be stiff by the time i got him back to the mews hed be all bunched up i wasnt sure what the police or the pathologist would make of that tv detectives were infallible but i had doubts about their reallife counterparts i hoped my doubts were well founded the two free periods before lunch were my real break there was no one in the video lab so i could edit to my hearts content there were three videos in all two from maxwells wardrobe and one from his livingroom this last video was shot at one of his parties you know the sort of video i mean the camera is aimed at you so you open your mouth and eyes wide and wave wildly into the lens sometimes saying something crass at the same time either that or you studiously ignore the contraption despite the filmmakers enticements and you still look a prat of course maxwell being behind the camera most of the time there were lots of shots of the women in their party dresses with attendant leg and cleavage max calling out a cod directors enthuse darlings i want some passion from you after an hour i had basically what i wanted it didnt look great i wasnt at all sure that it looked even halfway persuasive and i was about to drop the whole scheme but there was fever in my brain now it was all or nothing i was risking all my winnings on another turn of that wheel greedy thats what i was avarice was my sin of the moment to hell with it itll do i knew the police wouldnt be watching for clues anyway theyd be watching for other things and finding them during the lunchhour i drove back to the mews this time pulling maxwell out of the boot and laying him at the bottom of the stairs who could tell maybe the whole thing would be taken for an accident after all i didnt put the porn videos back in the wardrobe they were en route to the dump but i did put my little homemade ensemble in there then i sat down in maxwells study and switched on his word processor id been thinking about the letter and it proved easy to write i read it through and it seemed convincing so i printed it out then i crumpled the sheet of paper and placed it beneath the occasional table at the top of the stairs i was back in the study checking everything was as it should be when the downstairs door opened for a hysterical second i thought its him maxwells back how was i going to explain but then i heard a sort of squeal and a protracted thud i tiptoed into the hall and looked down a middleaged woman was lying inside the door maxwells cleaning lady id never set eyes on her before but i knew he had a mrs mop he never tired of repeating the fact i crept quickly downstairs and out of the door and kept my eyes on the rearview mirror all the way back along the mews it all moved surprisingly slowly i thought in the movies they wrap up these sorts of cases within a good ninety minutes or occasionally a supremely lousy ninety minutes but even after we buried maxwell no one had been asking the obvious questions then one evening mark and jimmy phoned one after the other both had the same story to tell theyd been asked to go along to the police station and there had been shown a video recording both said the same thing they told me not to mention anything to you but i thought you know you being a mate and all and then there was a ring at the doorbell alice answered and after a few moments came back into the livingroom she didnt look well its the police she said they want to talk to me about maxwell down at the station and indeed there were two grimfaced constables loitering on the stairwell whats going on i asked them nothing to worry about sir said the more loquacious of the pair well i thought thank god for that i didnt go with alice i lay along the sofa finding it curiously comfortable the tv wasnt on i stared at the blank screen until hours later there was the sound of a key shivering in the lock alice looked exhausted and numb without demur she flopped on to the beanbag you wont believe this she said they think i had something to do with it i sat up what they think there was something going on between maxwell and me what this time i stood up alice eyed the empty sofa so i sat back down again they think what so she told me about the interrogation she called it that not an interview but an interrogation a nice wpc who didnt say anything except when the two fat male detectives left the room she asked me if i wanted a cup of tea the whole thing had been taperecorded they kept on at me about maxwell how well i knew him what he was like did we ever see one another alone christ he was your friend not mine besides i told them he was gay one of them smiled he didnt say anything but he grinned and shook his head at me she looked like she might cry but only for a moment soon enough she was all anger and retribution shed talk to our solicitor solicitor the one we used to buy this place i told them i said i was going to talk to my solicitor what did they say she swallowed drily they said that might be a good idea the following morning they came for me not constables this time but a detective sergeant and another man the other man drove while we sat together in the back the detective sergeant had bloodshot eyes and was overweight he took me to an interview room where detective inspector claverhouse was waiting there was a tape recorder on the table between us on another table sat a tv monitor with a video player built into its base we had something similar at the school it took a lot of questions some of them about parties id attended at maxwells flat then inspector claverhouse rose from his chair theres something wed like to show you sir just so you can give us an opinion although they must have watched the video a dozen times they still drank it in especially the latter sections then they turned to me well i said the first bit with my wife you recognise your wife then oh yes i said that was her at a party of maxwells i didnt realise hed taken so much film of her he hadnt of course after a while hed handed the camera to me and id concentrated for a few minutes on alice trying to work out if she looked better or worse through a lens better was the answer the distance helped and she did possess a cameraready figure and the er material after that said inspector claverhouse i raised my eyebrows and exhaled looks like something homemade i replied i know its said that couples will rent video cameras for a weekend so they can record you know but they dont need to rent the camera if they already own one said claverhouse true claverhouse ejected the tape and examined it you couldnt identify the participants i smiled bleakly you didnt exactly see their faces of course you didnt id made sure of that but id also chosen models whose physical shape was at least similar to maxwell and alice i didnt think anyone would notice that part of the way through the male model actually changed identity by that stage all you could see was skin and hair claverhouse was looking at the spine of the videotape true enough i just wondered theres some writing on here just initials mg and ab what do you make of that i stared at him then at the detective sergeant and laughed uneasily come on i said what are you trying to say nothing sir you know damned fine mg is maxwell and youre implying ab is my wife your wife is on the tape sir yes but not i nodded towards the machine i mean its not them doing my voice died away again its not i said quietly i did not tell a lie the two detectives understood inspector claverhouse sat down again theres also a letter sir he said sympathetically it appears to be from maxwell gray to someone called alice perhaps youd care to take a look he produced a photocopy of the crumpled sheet for me to read i read through it twice alice theres no easy way to put this i want out pure and simple its not your fault its mine or maybe its neithers fault i dont know any more it would break kennys heart if he found out you know that not that he would find out hes too stupid too guileless but that just makes me feel all the more guilty i hope you can understand i hope we can still be friends maxie two notes jarred he wouldnt have called himself maxie but then the police werent to know that it had just been devilment on my part but neither would he have used a semicolon only people like me use semicolons in this day and age i doubted cid would notice this either i looked up at inspector claverhouse there were tears in my eyes then i broke down altogether and still it dragged on with alice under suspicion i became her champion protecting her from police and media alike she didnt understand any of it how could there be a letter how could there be a video it wasnt her on the video she told claverhouse it wasnt i backed her up i was sweating about that video if the police watched it often enough and i didnt doubt it was required viewing between shifts at the station maybe theyd begin to see discrepancies then again all theyd want to watch were the dirty bits and they would be watching for all the wrong reasons id chosen the seediest most amateurish tapes in maxwells collection they really did look homemade the police meantime were interviewing more friends of maxwells and his colleagues again and again they called us to interview it was a wearing process they knew they were dealing with manslaughter at least the pathologist had been able to say that maxwell had fallen with some force almost certainly not of his own volition whats more the body had been moved then placed back at the foot of the stairs as if someone had thought to dispose of it but been unable to a woman for example might not have the weight and power necessary to shift such a load very far it turned out of course that the police had wanted to prosecute at quite an early stage but the crown office kept pressing for more evidence at one stage it seemed that the inquiry was turning more towards me for a few days i looked like a chief suspect but by then i was confident the police were just fishing and sans hooks at that when theyd wheelbarrowed enough information over to the crown office someone must have decided something should happen everyone took one step forward there was to be a trial a trial not for manslaughter but for murder the police produced a witness a neighbour of maxwells who was sure shed seen a woman of alices description going in and out of the flat at irregular intervals i took a deep breath and began to view alice for the first time with suspicion what if the two of them had really been and all her talk to me of maxwell being gay was just to throw me off the scent was there to be a brilliant twist right at the end of the film i asked alice but she denied and denied shed lost some weight a lot of weight actually and the fire had disappeared from her eyes she wasnt the same woman shed been she was obedient to commands compliant weepily grateful for my many kindnesses in other words shed been broken i liked her more than i had in years i was almost determined that she should be found not guilty and put up a firm performance in the witness box but the looks i got from those in court were still understanding and sympathetic i was the faithful husband faithful right to the end the jury seemed to ignore me altogether and brought back a verdict of guilty the flat seemed so empty but soon filled with my own choice of music and video viewing i worked harder than ever at school but every night i found some space for reminiscence mostly of the trial as a witness i hadnt been able to soak up much of it but afterwards id made it a sort of hobby a preoccupation there had been much talk in court of maxwells promiscuous lifestyle his interest in illicit pornography his affiliations with barmaids waitresses secretaries a little black notebook was produced detailing names and telephone numbers some of the women had appeared in the witness box none admitted to having sex with maxwell but you could see the type of women they were i visited alice when i could it was always an interesting experience id considered writing her a letter explaining that i was a weak man who could not live with the shame and the guilty verdict it was true that at school both pupils and teachers looked at me oddly and telling her id be filing for divorce id considered it but rejected it almost as quickly i dont know why exactly maybe it had something to do with the evenings i spent going over old photographs of the pair of us back in the days of foreign travel and fooling around i still went for a drink some weekends with andrew mark and jimmy and even a few times with frank marsh but mostly i stayed home then one night there was a ring at the doorbell i got the shock of my life when i answered the door it was donna blueeyed blondehaired donna looking exquisite and smelling of recent perfume she just needed to talk to talk with someone whod known maxwell like shed known him she missed him so much so do i i said she collapsed into my gentle arms i smoothed her hair away from one ear shushing her like a friend like a friend talk show an inspector rebus story lowland radio was a young but successful station broadcasting to lowland scotland it was said that the station owed its success to two very different personalities one was the dj on the midmorning slot an abrasive and aggressive shetland islander called hamish macdiarmid macdiarmid hosted a phonein supposedly concerning the days headlines but in fact these were of relatively minor importance people did not listen to the phonein for opinion and comment they listened for the attacks macdiarmid made on just about every caller there were occasional fierce interchanges interchanges the dj nearly always won by dint of severing the connection with anyone more intelligent better informed or more rational than himself rebus knew that there were men in his own station who would try to take a break between tenfortyfive and elevenfifteen just to listen the people who phoned the show knew what theyd get of course that was part of the fun rebus wondered if they were masochists but in fact he knew they probably saw themselves as challengers if they could best macdiarmid they would have won and so macdiarmid himself became like some raging bull entering the ring every morning for another joust with the picadors so far hed been goaded but not wounded but who knew how long the luck would last the other personality always supposing personality could be applied to someone so ethereal was penny cook the softly spoken seductive voice on the stations latenight slot five nights a week on her show whats cookin she offered a mix of sedative music soothing talk and calming advice to those who took part in her own phonein segment these were very different people from those who chose to confront hamish macdiarmid they were quietly worried about their lives insecure timid they had home problems work problems personal problems they were the kind of people rebus mused who got sand kicked in their faces macdiarmids callers on the other hand were probably the ones doing the kicking perhaps it said something about the lowlands of scotland that penny cooks show was said to be the more popular of the two again people at the station talked about it with the fervour usually reserved for tv programmes did you hear yon guy with the bend in his tackle that woman who said her husband didnt satisfy her i felt sorry for that hooker though wantin out o the game and so on rebus had listened to the show himself a few times slumped on his chair after closingtime but never for more than a few minutes like a bedtime story a few minutes of penny cook sent john rebus straight to the land of nod hed wondered what she looked like husky comfortable cometobed the picture of her hed built up was all images but none of them exactly physical sometimes she sounded blonde and tiny sometimes statuesque with flowing raven hair his picture of hamish macdiarmid was much more vivid bright red beard cabertossing biceps and a kilt well the truth would out rebus stood in the cramped reception area of lowland radio and waited for the girl on the switchboard to finish her call on the wall behind her a sign said welcome that colon was important this seemed to be lowland radios way of greeting the personalities whod come to the station perhaps to give interviews today below the welcome written in felt tip were the names jez jenks and candy barr neither name meant anything to rebus though they probably would to his daughter the receptionist had finished her call have you come for some stickers stickers carstickers she explained only were all out of them just temporary well be getting more next week if youd like to call back no thanks anyway im inspector rebus i think miss cooks expecting me oh sorry the receptionist giggled ill see if shes around it was inspector rebus she scribbled the name on a pad and returned to her switchboard an inspector reeves to see you penny rebus turned to another wall and cast an eye over lowland radios small display of awards well there was stiff competition these days he supposed and not much advertising revenue to go round another local station had countered the challenge posed by hamish macdiarmid hiring what they called the ranter an anonymous individual who dished out insult upon insult to anyone foolish enough to call his show it all seemed a long way from the light programme a long way from glowing valves and home counties diction was it true that the bbc announcers used to wear dinner jackets djs in djs rebus thought to himself and laughed im glad somebodys cheerful it was penny cooks voice she was standing right behind him slowly he turned to be confronted by a buxom lady in her early forties only a year or two younger than rebus himself she had permed light brown hair and wore round glasses the kind popularised by john lennon on one hand and the nhs on the other i know i know she said im never what people expect she held out a hand which rebus shook not only did penny cook sound unthreatening she looked unthreatening all the more mysterious then that someone some anonymous caller should be threatening her life they walked down a corridor towards a sturdylooking door to the side of which had been attached a pushbutton array security she said pressing four digits before pulling open the door you never know what a lunatic might do given access to the airwaves on the contrary said rebus ive heard hamish macdiarmid she laughed he didnt think hed heard her laugh before is penny cook your real name he asked thinking the ice sufficiently broken between them afraid so i was born in nairn to be honest i dont think my parents had heard of penicuik they just liked the name penelope they were passing studios and offices loudspeakers placed in the ceiling of the corridor relayed the stations afternoon show ever been inside a radio station before inspector no never ill show you around if you like if you can spare the time no problem they were approaching one studio outside which a middleaged man was in quiet conversation with a spikyheaded teenager the teenager looked sullen and in need of a wash rebus wondered if he were the mans son if so a lesson in parental control was definitely needed hi norman penny cook said in passing the man smiled towards her the teenager remained sullen a controlled pose rebus decided further along having passed through another combinationlock door penny herself cleared things up normans one of our producers and the kid with him kid she smiled wryly that was jez jenks the singer with leftover lunch he probably makes more a day than you and i make in a good year rebus couldnt remember ever having a good year the curse of the honest copper a question came to him and candy barr she laughed at this i thought my own name took some beating mind you i dont suppose its her real name shes an actress or a comedienne or something from across the water of course doesnt sound like an irish name rebus said as penny cook held open her office door i wouldnt make jokes around here inspector she said youll probably find yourself being signed up for a spot on one of our shows the laughing policeman rebus suggested but then they were in the office the door was closed and the atmosphere cooled appropriately this was business after all serious business she sat at her desk rebus sat down on the chair across from her do you want a coffee or anything inspector no thanks so when did these calls start miss cook about a month ago the first time he tried it he actually got through to me onair that takes some doing the calls are filtered through two people before they get to me efficient people too they can usually tell a crank caller from the real thing how does the system work somebody calls in then what sue or david takes the call they ask a few questions basically they want to know the persons name and what it is they want to talk to me about then they take a telephone number tell the caller to stay by his or her telephone and if we want to put the person onair they phone the caller back and prepare them fairly rigorous then oh yes and even supposing the odd crank does get through weve got a threesecond delay on them when theyre onair if they start cussing or raving we cut the call before it goes out over the ether and is that what happened with this guy pretty much she shook a cassette box at him ive got the tape here do you want to hear please she started to load a cassette player on the ledge behind her there were no windows in the office from the number of steps theyd descended to get there rebus reckoned this whole floor of the building was located beneath groundlevel so you got a phone number for this guy only it turned out to be a phone box in some housing scheme we didnt know that at the time we never usually take calls from phone boxes but it was one of those ones that use the phone cards no beeps so nobody could tell she had loaded the tape to her satisfaction but was now waiting for it to rewind after he tried getting through again we phoned his number it rang and rang and then some old girl picked it up she explained where the box was that was when we knew hed tricked us the tape thumped to a stop she hit the play button and sat down again there was hiss as the tape began and then her voice filled the room she smiled in embarrassment as if to say yes its a pose this husky sultry latenight me but its a living and now weve got peter on line one peter youre through to penny cook how are things with you this evening not so good penny she interrupted the tape for a moment this is where we cut him off the mans voice had been sleepy almost tranquillised now it erupted i know what youre up to i know whats going on the tape went dead she leaned back in her chair and switched off the machine it makes me shiver every time i hear it that anger such a sudden change in the voice brr she reached into her drawer and brought out cigarettes and lighter rebus accepted a cigarette from her thanks he said then the namell be false of course but did he give a surname a surname an address even a profession he said he lived in edinburgh but we looked up the street name in the a to z and it doesnt exist from now on we check that addresses are real before we call back his surname was gemmell he even spelt it out for sue she couldnt believe he was a crank he sounded so genuine what did he tell her his problem was drinking too much how it was affecting his work i like that sort of problem the advice is straightforward and it can be helping a lot of people too scared to phone in what did he say his job was bank executive he gave sue the banks name and everything and he kept saying it wasnt to be broadcast she smiled shook her head i mean this nut really was good rebus nodded he seems to have known the setup pretty well you mean he got to the safe without triggering any of the alarms she smiled still oh yes hes a real pro and the calls have persisted most nights weve got him tagged now though hes tried using different accents dialects always a different name and job but he hasnt managed to beat the system again when he knows hes been found out he does that whole routine again i know what youve done blah blah we put the phone down on him before he can get started and what have you done miss cook absolutely nothing inspector not that i know of rebus nodded slowly can i hear the tape again sure she wound it back and they listened together then she excused herself to powder my nose and rebus listened twice more when she returned she was carrying two plastic beakers of coffee thought i might tempt you she said milk no sugar i hope thats all right thank you yes thats just the job so inspector what do you think he sipped the lukewarm liquid i think he said youve got an anonymous phonecaller she raised her cup as though to toast him god bless cid she said what would we do without you the problem is that hes probably mobile not sticking to the same telephone kiosk every time thats supposing hes as clever as he seems we can get bt to put a trace on him but for that youd have to keep him talking or if he gives his number we can trace him from that but it takes time and meanwhile he could be slipping off into the night im afraid so still apart from continuing to fend him off and hoping he gets fed up i cant see what else can be done you dont recognise the voice someone from your past an exlover someone with a grudge i dont make enemies inspector looking at her listening to her voice he found that easy to believe maybe not personal enemies what about the other radio stations they cant be too thrilled about your ratings her laughter was loud you think theyve put out a contract on me is that it rebus smiled and shrugged just a thought but yours is the most popular show lowland has got isnt it i think im still just about ahead of hamish yes but then hamishs show is just well hamish my shows all about the people themselves the ones who call in human interest you could say and theres plenty of interest suffering is always interesting isnt it it appeals to the voyeur we do get our fair share of crank calls maybe thats why all those lonely slightly deranged people out there listening to me me pretending ive got all the answers her smile this time was rueful the calls recently have been getting i dont know whether to say better or worse worse problems better radio better for your ratings you mean most advertisers ignore the latenight slots thats common knowledge not a big enough audience but its never been a problem on my show we did slip back for a little while but the figures picked up again up and up and up dont ask me what sort of listeners were attracting i leave all that to market research rebus finished his coffee and clasped both knees preparing to rise id like to take the tape with me is that possible sure she ejected the tape and id like to have a word with sue is it she checked her watch sue yes but she wont be in for a few hours yet night shift you see only us poor disc jockeys have to be here twentyfour hours i exaggerate but it feels like it sometimes she patted a tray on the ledge beside the cassette player the tray was filled with correspondence besides i have my fan mail to deal with rebus nodded glanced at the cassette tape he was now holding let me have a think about this miss cook ill see what we can do ok inspector sorry i cant be more constructive you were quite right to contact us i didnt suppose there was much you could we dont know that yet as i say give me a little time to think about it she rose from her chair ill see you out this place is a maze and we cant have you stumbling in on the afternoon show can we you might end up doing your laughing policeman routine after all as they were walking down the long hushed corridor rebus saw two men in conversation at the bottom of the stairwell one was a beefy heartylooking man with a mass of rumpled hair and a good growth of beard his cheeks seemed veined with blood the other man proved a significant contrast small and thin with slickedback hair he wore a grey suit and white shirt the latter offset by a bright red paisleypatterned tie ah said penny cook quietly a chance to kill two birds come on let me introduce you to gordon prentice hes the station chief and to the infamous hamish macdiarmid well rebus had no trouble deciding which man was which except that when penny did make the introductions he was proved utterly wrong the bearded man pumped his hand i hope youre going to be able to help inspector there are some sick minds out there this was gordon prentice he wore baggy brown cords and an opennecked shirt from which protruded tufts of wiry hair hamish macdiarmids hand when rebus took it was limp and cool like something lifted from a larder no matter how hard he tried rebus couldnt match this for want of a better word yuppie couldnt match him to the combative voice but then macdiarmid spoke sick minds is right and stupid minds too i dont know which is worse a deranged audience or an educationally subnormal one he turned to penny cook maybe you got the better bargain penelope he turned back to prentice so thats what a sneer looks like rebus thought but macdiarmid was speaking again gordon how about letting penny and me swap shows for a day she could sit there agreeing with every bigoted caller i get and i could get stuck in about her social cripples what do you think prentice chuckled and placed a hand on the shoulder of both his star djs ill give it some thought hamish penny might not be too thrilled though i think she has a soft spot for her cripples penny cook certainly didnt look too thrilled by the time rebus and she were out of earshot those two she hissed sometimes they act like im not even there men she glanced towards rebus present company excluded of course ill take that as a compliment i shouldnt be so hard on gordon actually i know i joke about being here twentyfour hours a day but i really think he does spend all day and all night at the station hes here from early morning but each night he comes into the studio to listen to a bit of my show beyond the call of duty wouldnt you say rebus merely shrugged i bet she went on when you saw them you thought it was hamish with the beard rebus nodded she giggled everybody does she said nobodys what they seem in this place ill let you into a secret the station doesnt keep any publicity shots of hamish theyre afraid it would hurt his image if everyone found out he looks like a wimp hes certainly not quite what i expected she gave him an ambiguous look no well youre not quite what i was expecting either there was a moments stillness between them broken only by some coffee commercial being broadcast from the ceiling but camelot coffee is no myth and mmm it tastes so good they smiled at one another and walked on driving back into edinburgh rebus listened despite himself to the drivel on lowland radio advertising was tight he knew that maybe that was why he seemed to hear the same dozen or so adverts over and over again lots of airtime to fill and so few advertisers to fill it and mmm it tastes so good that particular advert was beginning to get to him it careered around in his head even when it wasnt being broadcast the actors voice was so what was the word it was like being forcefed a tablespoon of honey cloying sickly altogether too much was camelot a myth or is it real arthur and guinevere merlin and lancelot a dream or rebus switched off the radio its only a jar of bloody coffee he told his radio set yes he thought a jar of coffee and mmm it tastes so good come to think of it he needed coffee for the flat hed stop off at the corner shop and whatever he bought it wouldnt be camelot but as a promotional gimmick there was a fiftypence refund on camelot so rebus did buy it and sat at home that evening drinking the vile stuff and listening to penny cooks tape tomorrow evening he was thinking he might go along to the station to catch her show live he had an excuse after all he wanted to speak with sue the telephonist that was the excuse the truth was that he was intrigued by penny cook herself youre not quite what i was expecting was he reading too much into that one sentence maybe he was well put it another way then he had a duty to return to lowland radio a duty to talk to sue he wound the tape back for the umpteenth time that ferocious voice sue had been surprised by its ferocity hadnt she the man had seemed so quiet so polite in their initial conversation rebus was stuck maybe the caller would simply get fed up when it was a question of someones home being called there were steps you could take have someone intercept all calls change the persons number and keep it exdirectory but penny cook needed her number to be public she couldnt hide except behind the wall provided by sue and david then he had an idea it wasnt much of an idea but it was better than nothing bill costain at the forensic science lab was keen on sound recording tape recorders all that sort of stuff maybe he could do something with mr anonymous yes hed call him first thing tomorrow he sipped his coffee then squirmed tastes more like camel than camelot he muttered hitting the play button the morning was bright and clear but bill costain was dull and overcast i was playing in a darts match last night he explained we won for a change the amount of drink we put away youd think scotland had just done the grand slam never mind said rebus handing over the cassette tape ive brought you something soothing soothing wasnt the word costain himself used after listening to the tape but he enjoyed a challenge and the challenge rebus had laid down was to tell him anything at all about the voice he listened several times to the tape and put it through some sort of analyser the voice becoming a series of peaks and troughs costain scratched his head theres too big a difference between the voice at the beginning and the voice when hysterical how do you mean costain always seemed able to baffle rebus the hysterical voice is so much higher than the voice at the beginning its hardly natural meaning id say one of thems a puton probably the initial voice hes disguising his normal tone speaking in a lower register than usual so can we get back to his real voice you mean can we retrieve it yes but the lab isnt the best place for that a friend of mine has a recording studio out morningside way ill give him a bell they were in luck the studios facilities were not in use that morning rebus drove them to morningside and then sat back as costain and his friend got busy at the mixing console they slowed the hysteric part of the tape then managed somehow to take the pitch of the voice down several tones it began to sound more than slightly unnatural like a dalek or something electronic but then they started to build it back up again until rebus was listening to a slow almost lifeless vocal over the studios huge monitor speakers i know what youve done yes there was life there now almost a hint of personality after this they switched to the callers first utterance not so good penny and played around with it heightening the pitch slightly even speeding it up a bit thats about as good as it gets costain said at last its brilliant bill thanks can i get a copy having dropped costain back at the lab rebus wormed his way back through the lunchtime traffic to great london road police station he played this new tape several times then switched from tape to radio christ hed forgotten it was still tuned to lowland and mmm it tastes so good rebus fairly growled as he reached for the off button but the damage the delirious wonderful damage had already been done the wine bar was on the corner of hanover street and queen street it was a typical edinburgh affair in that though it might have started with wine quiche and salad in mind it had reverted to beer albeit mainly of the designer variety and pies always supposing you could call something filled with chickpeas and spices a pie still it had an ipa pump and that was good enough for rebus the place had just finished its lunchtime peak and tables were still cluttered with plates glasses and condiments having paid over the odds for his drink rebus felt the barman owed him a favour he gave the young man a name the barman nodded towards a table near the window the tables sole occupant looked just out of his teens he flicked a lock of hair back from his forehead and gazed out of the window there was a newspaper folded into quarters on his knee he tapped his teeth with a ballpoint mulling over some crossword clue without asking rebus sat down opposite him it whiles away the time he said the toothtapper seemed still intent on the window maybe he could see his reflection there the modern narcissus another flick of the hair if you got a haircut you wouldnt need to keep doing that this achieved a smile maybe he thought rebus was trying to chat him up well after all this was known as an actors bar wasnt it half a glass of orange juice sat on the table the ubiquitous icecube having melted away to a sliver aye rebus mused passes the time this time the eyes turned from the window and were on him rebus leaned forward across the table when he spoke he spoke quietly confidently i know what youve done he said not sure even as he said it whether he were quoting or speaking for himself the lock of hair fell forward and stayed there a frozen second then another and the man rose quickly to his feet the chair tipping back but rebus still seated had grabbed at an arm and held it fast let go of me sit down i said let go and i said sit down rebus pulled him back on to his chair thats better weve got a lot to talk about you and me we can do it here or down at the station and by station i dont mean scotrail ok the head was bowed the careful hair now almost completely dishevelled it was that easy rebus found the tiniest grain of pity do you want something else to drink the head shook from side to side not even a cup of coffee now the head looked up at him i saw the film once rebus went on bloody awful it was but not half as bad as the coffee give me richard harriss singing any day now finally the head grinned thats better said rebus come on son its time if youll pardon the expression to spill the beans the beans spilled rebus was there that night for whats cookin it surprised him that penny cook herself who sounded so calm on the air was before the programme a complete bundle of nerves she slipped a small yellow tablet on to her tongue and washed it down with a beaker of water dont ask she said cutting off the obvious question sue and david were stationed by their telephones in the production room which was separated from pennys studio by a large glass window her producer did his best to calm things down though not yet out of his thirties he looked to be an old pro at this rebus wondered if he shouldnt have his own counselling show rebus chatted with sue for ten minutes or so and watched as the production team went through its paces really it was a twoman operation producer and engineer there was a lastminute panic when pennys microphone started to play up but the engineer was swift to replace it by five minutes to eleven the hysteria seemed over everyone was calm now or was so tense it didnt show like troops just before a battle rebus was thinking penny had a couple of questions about the running order of the nights musical pieces she held a conversation with her producer communicating via mikes and headphones but looking at one another through the window then she turned her eyes towards rebus winked at him and crossed her fingers he crossed his fingers back at her two minutes everyone at the top of the hour there was news and straight after the news a tape played the shows theme music penny leaned towards her microphone which hung like an anglepoise over her desk the music faded hello again this is penny cook and this is whats cookin ill be with you until three oclock so if youve got a problem im just a phone call away and if you want to ring me the number as ever is it was extraordinary and rebus could only marvel at it her eyes were closed and she looked so brittle that a shiver might turn her to powder yet that voice so controlled no not controlled rather it was as though it were apart from her as though it possessed a life of its own a personality rebus looked at the studio clock four hours of this five nights a week all in all he thought hed rather be a policeman the show was running like clockwork calls were taken by the two operators details scribbled down there was discussion with the producer about suitable candidates and during the musical interludes or the commercials and mmm it tastes so good the producer would relay details about the callers to penny lets go with that one she might say or i cant deal with that not tonight usually her word was the last though the producer might demur i dont know its quite a while since we covered adultery rebus watched rebus listened but most of all rebus waited ok penny the producer told her its line two next his names michael she nodded can somebody get me a coffee sure and next she said i think weve got michael on line two hello michael it was quarter to midnight as usual the door of the production room opened and gordon prentice stepped into the room he had nods and smiles for everyone and seemed especially pleased to see rebus inspector he said shaking rebuss hand i see you take your work seriously coming here at this hour he patted the producers shoulder hows the show tonight been a bit tame so far but this looks interesting pennys eyes were on the dimly lit production room but her voice was all for michael and what do you do for a living michael the callers voice crackled out of the loudspeakers im an actor penny really and are you working just now no im what we call resting ah well they say theres no rest for the wicked i suppose that must mean you havent been wicked gordon prentice running his fingers through his beard smiled at this turning to rebus to see how he was enjoying himself rebus smiled back on the contrary the voice was saying ive been really quite wicked and im ashamed of it and what is it youre so ashamed of michael ive been telephoning you anonymously penny threatening you im sorry you see i thought you knew about it but the policeman tells me you dont im sorry prentice wasnt smiling now his eyes had opened wide in disbelief knew about what michael her eyes were staring at the window light bounced off her spectacles sending flashes like laser beams into the production room knew about the fix when the ratings were going down the station head gordon prentice started rigging the shows yours and hamish macdiarmids macdiarmid might even be in on it what do you mean rigging kill it shouted prentice kill transmission hes raving mad cut the line someone here ill do it but rebus had come up behind prentice and now locked his own arms around prentices i think youd better listen he warned out of work actors michael was saying the way hed told rebus earlier in the day prentice put together a you could call it a cast i suppose half a dozen people they phone in using different voices always with a controversial point to make or some nice juicy problem one of them told me at a party one night i didnt believe her until i started listening for myself an actor can tell that sort of thing when a voice isnt quite right when somethings an act rather than for real prentice was struggling but couldnt break rebuss hold lies he yelled complete rubbish let go of me you penny cooks eyes were on prentice now and on no one but prentice so what youre saying michael if i understand you is that gordon prentice is rigging our phoneins so as to boost audience figures thats right michael thank you for your call it was rebus who spoke and he spoke to the producer thatll do the producer nodded through the glass to penny cook then flipped a switch music could be heard over the loudspeakers the producer started to fade the piece out penny spoke into her microphone a slightly longer musical interlude there but i hope you enjoyed it well be going back to your calls very shortly but first weve got some commercials she slipped off her glasses and rubbed the bridge of her nose a private performance rebus explained to prentice for our benefit only the listeners were hearing something else rebus felt prentices body soften the shoulders slump he was caught and knew it for sure rebus relaxed his hold on the man he wouldnt try anything now the camelot coffee ad was playing it had been easy really recognising the voice on the commercial as that of the phone caller rebus had contacted the ad agency involved who had given him the name and address of the actor concerned michael barrie presently resting and to be found most days in a certain citycentre wine bar barrie knew he was in trouble but rebus was sure it could be smoothed out but as for gordon prentice ah that was different altogether the stations ruined he wailed you must know that he pleaded with the producer the engineer but especially with the hatefilled eyes of penny cook who behind glass could not even hear him once this gets out youll all be out of a job all of you thats why i back on in five seconds penny said the producer as though it was just another night on whats cookin penny cook nodded resting her glasses back on her nose the stuffing looked to have been knocked out of her with one final baleful glance towards prentice she turned to her microphone welcome back a change of direction now because id like to say a few words to you about the head of lowland radio gordon prentice i hope youll bear with me for a minute or two it shouldnt take much longer than that it didnt but what she said was tabloid news by morning and lowland radios licence was withdrawn not long after that rebus went back to radio three for when he was driving and no radio at all in his flat hamish macdiarmid as far as he could ascertain went back to a croft somewhere but penny cook stuck around going freelance and doing some journalism as well as the odd radio programme it was very late one night when the knock came at rebuss door he opened it to find penny standing there she pretended surprise at seeing him oh hello she said i didnt know you lived here only ive run out of coffee and i was wondering laughing rebus led her inside i can let you have the best part of a jar of camelot he said or alternatively we could get drunk and go to bed they got drunk castle dangerous an inspector rebus story sir walter scott was dead hed been found at the top of his namesakes monument in princes street gardens dead of a heart attack and with a new and powerful pair of binoculars hanging around his slender mottled neck sir walter had been one of edinburghs most revered qcs until his retirement a year ago detective inspector john rebus climbing the hundreds surely it must be hundreds of spiralling steps up to the top of the scott monument paused for a moment to recall one or two of his runins with sir walter both in and out of the courtrooms on the royal mile he had been a formidable character shrewd devious and subtle law to him had been a challenge rather than an obligation to john rebus it was just a days work rebus ached as he reached the last incline the steps here were narrower than ever the spiral tighter room for one person only really at the height of its summer popularity with a throng of tourists squeezing through it like toothpaste from a tube rebus reckoned the scott monument might be very scary indeed he breathed hard and loud bursting through the small doorway at the top and stood there for a moment catching his breath the panorama before him was quite simply the best view in edinburgh the castle close behind him the new town spread out in front of him sloping down towards the firth of forth with fife rebuss birthplace visible in the distance calton hill leith arthurs seat and round to the castle again it was breathtaking or would have been had the breath not already been taken from him by the climb the parapet upon which he stood was incredibly narrow again there was hardly room enough to squeeze past someone how crowded did it get in the summer dangerously crowded it seemed dangerously crowded just now with only four people up here he looked over the edge upon the sheer drop to the gardens below where a massing of tourists growing restless at being barred from the monument stared up at him rebus shivered not that it was cold it was early june spring was finally lateblooming into summer but that cold wind never left the city that wind which never seemed to be warmed by the sun it bit into rebus now reminding him that he lived in a northern climate he looked down and saw sir walters slumped body reminding him why he was here i thought we were going to have another corpse on our hands there for a minute the speaker was detective sergeant brian holmes he had been in conversation with the police doctor who himself was crouching over the corpse just getting my breath back rebus explained you should take up squash its squashed enough up here the wind was nipping rebuss ears he began to wish he hadnt had that haircut at the weekend what have we got heart attack the doctor reckons he was due for one anyway a climb like that in an excited state one of the witnesses says he just doubled over didnt cry out didnt seem in pain old mortality eh rebus looked wistfully at the corpse but why do you say he was excited holmes grinned think id bring you up here for the good of your health here he handed a polythene bag to rebus inside the bag was a badly typed note it was found in the binocular case rebus read the note through its clear polythene window go to top of scott monument tuesday midday ill be there look for the gun the gun rebus asked frowning there was a sudden explosion rebus started but holmes just looked at his watch then corrected its hands one oclock the noise had come from the blank charge fired every day from the castle walls at precisely one oclock the gun rebus repeated except now it was a statement sir walters binoculars were lying beside him rebus lifted them he wouldnt mind would he and fixed them on the castle tourists could be seen walking around some peered over the walls a few fixed their own binoculars on rebus one an elderly asian grinned and waved rebus lowered the binoculars he examined them these look brand new bought for the purpose id say sir but what exactly was the purpose brian what was he supposed to be looking at rebus waited for an answer none was forthcoming whatever it was rebus went on it as good as killed him i suggest we take a look for ourselves where sir rebus nodded towards the castle over there brian come on er inspector rebus looked towards the doctor who was upright now but pointing downwards with one finger how are we going to get him down rebus stared at sir walter yes he could see the problem it would be hard graft taking him all the way back down the spiral stairs whats more damage to the body would be unavoidable he supposed they could always use a winch and lower him straight to the ground well it was a job for ambulancemen or undertakers not the police rebus patted the doctors shoulder youre in charge doc he said exiting through the door before the doctor could summon up a protest holmes shrugged apologetically smiled and followed rebus into the dark the doctor looked at the body then over the edge then back to the body again he reached into his pocket for a mint popped it into his mouth and began to crunch on it then he too made for the door splendour was falling on the castle walls wrong poet rebus mused but right image he tried to recall if hed ever read any scott but drew a blank he thought he might have picked up waverley once as a colleague at the time had said imagine calling a book after the station rebus hadnt bothered to explain and hadnt read the book either or if he had it had left no impression he stood now on the ramparts looking across to the gothic exaggeration of the scott monument a cannon was almost immediately behind him anyone wanting to be seen from the top of the monument would probably have been standing right on this spot people did not linger here though they might wander along the walls take a few photographs or pose for a few but they would not stand in the one spot for longer than a minute or two which meant of course that if someone had been standing here longer they would be conspicuous the problem was twofold first conspicuous to whom everyone else would be in motion would not notice that someone was lingering second all the potential witnesses would by now have gone their separate ways in tour buses or on foot down the royal mile or on to princes street along george the fourth bridge to look at greyfriars bobby the people milling around just now represented a fresh intake new water flowing down the same old stream someone wanted to be seen by sir walter and sir walter wanted to see him hence the binoculars no conversation was needed just the sighting why rebus couldnt think of a single reason he turned away from the wall and saw holmes approaching meeting his eyes holmes shrugged his shoulders ive talked to the guards on the gate they dont remember seeing anyone suspicious as one of them said all these bloody tourists look the same to me rebus smiled at this but then someone was tugging at his sleeve a small handbagged woman with sunglasses and thick lipstick sorry could i ask you to move over a bit her accent was american her voice a nasal singsong lawrence wants a picture of me with that gorgeous skyline behind me rebus smiled at her even made a slight bow and moved a couple of yards out of the way holmes following suit thanks lawrence called from behind his camera freeing a hand so that he could wave it towards them rebus noticed that the man wore a yellow sticker on his chest he looked back to the woman now posing like the film star she so clearly wasnt and saw that she too had a badge her name diana felttipped beneath some package companys logo i wonder rebus said quietly sir maybe you were asking the wrong question at the gate brian yes the right idea but the wrong question come on lets go back and ask again well see how eagleeyed our friends really are they passed the photographer his badge called him larry rather than lawrence just as the shutter clicked great he said to nobody in particular just one more sweetheart as he wound the film rebus paused and stood beside him then made a square from the thumb and forefinger of both hands and peered through it towards the woman diana as though assessing the composition of the picture larry caught the gesture you a professional he asked his tone just short of awe only in a manner of speaking larry said rebus turning away again holmes was left standing there staring at the photographer he wondered whether to shrug and smile again as he had done with the doctor what the hell he shrugged he smiled and he followed rebus towards the gate rebus went alone to the home of sir walter scott just off the corstorphine road near the zoo as he stepped out of his car he could have sworn he detected a faint wafting of animal dung there was another car in the driveway one which with a sinking heart he recognised as he walked up to the front door of the house he saw that the curtains were closed in the upstairs windows while downstairs painted wooden shutters had been pulled across to block out the daylight the door was opened by superintendent farmer watson i thought that was your car sir rebus said as watson ushered him into the hall when he spoke the superintendents voice was a whispered growl hes still up there you know who sir walter of course flecks of saliva burst from the corners of watsons mouth rebus thought it judicious to show not even the mildest amusement i left the doctor in charge dr jameson couldnt organise a brewery visit what the hell did you think you were doing i had have an investigation on my hands sir i thought i could be more usefully employed than playing undertaker hes stiff now you know watson said his anger having diminished he didnt exactly know why it was that he could never stay angry with rebus there was something about the man they dont think they can get him down the stairs theyve tried twice but he got stuck both times rebus pursed his lips the only way he could prevent them spreading into a wide grin watson saw this and saw too that the situation was not without a trace of humour is that why youre here sir placating the widow no im here on a personal level sir walter and lady scott were friends of mine that is sir walter was and lady scott still is rebus nodded slowly christ he was thinking the poor buggers only been dead a couple of hours and heres old farmer watson already trying to but no surely not watson was many things but not callous not like that rebus rebuked himself silently and in so doing missed most of what watson was saying in here and a door from the hallway was being opened rebus was being shown into a spacious livingroom or were they called drawingrooms in houses like this walking across to where lady scott sat by the fireside was like walking across a dance hall this is inspector rebus watson was saying one of my men lady scott looked up from her handkerchief how do you do she offered him a delicate hand which he lightly touched with his own in place of his usual firm handshake lady scott was in her mid fifties a wellpreserved monument of neat lines and precise movements rebus had seen her accompanying her husband to various functions in the city had come across her photograph in the paper when he had received his knighthood he saw too from the corner of his eye the way watson looked at her a mixture of pity and something more than pity as though he wanted at the same time to pat her hand and hug her to him who would want sir walter dead that was in a sense what he had come here to ask still the question itself was valid rebus could think of adversaries those scott had crossed in his professional life those he had helped put behind bars those perhaps who resented everything from his title to the bright blue socks that had become something of a trademark after he admitted on a radio show that he wore no other colour on his feet lady scott im sorry to intrude on you at a time like this i know its difficult but there are a couple of questions please ask your questions she gestured for him to sit on the sofa the sofa on which farmer watson had already made himself comfortable rebus sat down awkwardly this whole business was awkward he knew the chess players motto if in doubt play a pawn or as the scots themselves would say ca canny but that had never been his style and he couldnt change now as ever he decided to sacrifice his queen we found a note in sir walters binocular case he didnt own a pair of binoculars her voice was firm he probably bought them this morning did he say where he was going no just out i was upstairs he called that he was popping out for an hour or two and that was all what note this from watson what note indeed rebus wondered why lady scott hadnt asked the same thing a typed note telling sir walter to be at the top of the scott monument at midday rebus paused his attention wholly on sir walters widow there have been others havent there other notes she nodded slowly yes i found them by accident i wasnt prying im not like that i was in walters office he always called it that his office never his study looking for something an old newspaper i think yes there was an article i wanted to reread and id searched high and low for the blessed paper i was looking in walters office and i found some letters she wrinkled her nose hed kept them quiet from me well i suppose he had his reasons i never said anything to him about finding them she smiled ruefully i used to think sometimes that the unsaid was what kept our marriage alive that may seem cruel now hes gone i wish wed told one another more she dabbed at a liquid eye with the corner of her handkerchief wrapped as it was around one finger her free hand twisting and twisting the corners to rebus it looked as if she were using it as a tourniquet do you know where these other notes are he asked i dont know walter may have moved them shall we see the office was untidy in the best legal tradition any available flat surface including the carpet seemed to be fair game for stacks of brown folders tied with ribbon huge bulging manilla envelopes magazines and newspapers books and learned journals two walls consisted entirely of bookcases from floor to near the ornate but flaking ceiling one bookcase glassfronted contained what rebus reckoned must be the collected works of the other sir walter scott the glass doors looked as though they hadnt been opened in a decade the books themselves might never have been read still it was a nice touch to have ones study so thoroughly infiltrated by ones namesake ah theyre still here lady scott had slid a concertinastyle folder out from beneath a pile of similar such files shall we take them back through to the morningroom she looked around her i dont like it in here not now her edinburgh accent with its drawn vowels had turned morning into mourning either that thought rebus or shed said mourningroom in the first place he would have liked to have stayed a little longer in sir walters office but was compelled to follow back in her chair lady scott untied the ribbon around the file and let it fall open the file itself was made up of a dozen or more compartments but only one seemed to contain any paperwork she pulled out the letters and handed them to watson who glanced through them wordlessly before handing them to rebus sir walter had taken each note from its envelope but had paperclipped the envelopes to the backs of their respective notes so rebus was able to ascertain that the notes had been posted between three weeks and one week ago and all bore a central london postmark he read the three notes slowly to himself then reread them the first came quickly to its point i enclose a letter there are plenty more where it came from you will hear from me again the second fleshed out the blackmail i have eleven more letters if youd like them back they will cost get the money the third posted a week ago finalised things put the money in a carrier bag go to the cafe royal at pm friday stand at the bar and have a drink leave the bag there and go make a phone call spend two minutes away from the bar when you come back the letters will be there rebus looked up at lady scott did he pay ive really no idea but you could check if you like yes rebus nodded id like to be sure the first note said that a letter was enclosed obviously a letter concerning sir walter but what kind of letter of the letter itself there was no sign twelve apparently incriminating or embarrassing letters for a small price to pay for someone of sir walters position in society whats more it seemed to rebus a small price to ask and if the exchange had taken place as arranged what was the point of the last note the one found in sir walters binocular case yes that was a point did you see the mail this morning lady scott i was first to the door yes and was there an envelope like these others im sure there wasnt rebus nodded yes if there had been i think sir walter would have kept it judging by these he shook the notes all with envelopes attached meaning john superintendent watson sounded puzzled to rebuss ears it was his natural voice meaning he explained that the last note the one we found on sir walter was as it arrived at the house no envelope it must have been pushed through the letterbox id say sometime yesterday or this morning the blackmail started in london but the blackmailer came up here for the payoff and he or she is still here or was until midday now im not so certain if sir walter paid the money he nodded towards lady scott and i would like you to check on that please today if possible if as i say sir walter paid if he got the letters back then what was this mornings little game all about watson nodded arms folded looking down into his lap as though seeking answers rebus doubted theyd be found so close to home he rose to his feet we could do with finding those letters too perhaps lady scott you might have another look in your husbands office she nodded slowly i should tell you inspector that im not sure i want to find them i can understand that but it would help us track down the blackmailer her voice was as low as the light in the room yes of course and in the meantime john watson tried to sound like a man in charge of something but there was a pleading edge to his voice meantime said rebus ill be at the castellain hotel the number will be in the book you can always have me paged watson gave rebus one of his dark looks the kind that said i dont know what youre up to but i cant let anyone else know that i dont know then he nodded and almost smiled of course he said yes off you go i may stay on a little longer he looked to lady scott for her assent but she was busy with the handkerchief again twisting and twisting and twisting the castellain hotel a minutes walk from princes street was a chaos of tourists the large potplanted lobby looked as though it was on someones tour itinerary with one large organised party about to leave milling about as their luggage was taken out to the waiting bus by hardpressed porters at the same time another party was arriving the holiday companys representative conspicuous by being the only person who looked like he knew what was going on seeing that a group was about to leave rebus panicked but their lapel badges assured him that they were part of the seascape tours package he walked up to the reception desk and waited while a harassed young woman in a tartan twopiece tried to take two telephone calls at the same time she showed no little skill in the operation and all the time she was talking her eyes were on the scrum of guests in front of her finally she found a moment and a welcoming smile for him funny how at this time of year there were so many smiles to be found in edinburgh yes sir detective inspector rebus he announced id like a word with the grebe tours rep if shes around shes a he the receptionist explained i think he might be in his room hold on and ill check she had picked up the telephone nothing wrong is there no nothing just want a word thats all her call was answered quickly hello tony theres a gentleman in reception to see you pause fine ill tell him bye she put down the receiver hell be down in a minute rebus nodded his thanks and as she answered another telephone call moved back into the reception hall dodging the bags and the worried owners of the bags there was something thrilling about holidaymakers they were like children at a party but at the same time there was something depressing too about the herd mentality rebus had never been on a package holiday in his life he mistrusted the productionline cheerfulness of the reps and the guides a walk along a deserted beach now that was a holiday finding a pleasant outoftheway pub playing pinball so ruthlessly that the machine tilted wasnt he due for a holiday himself not that he would take one the loneliness could be a cage as well as a release but he would never he hoped be as caged as these people around him he looked for a grebe tours badge on any passing lapel or chest but saw none the edinburgh castle gatekeepers had been eagleeyed all right or one of them had hed recalled not only that a grebe tours bus had pulled in to the car park at around half past eleven that morning but also that the rep had mentioned where the tour party was staying the castellain hotel a small balding man came out of the lift and fairly trotted to the reception desk then when the receptionist pointed towards rebus trotted over towards him too did these reps take pills potions laughing gas how the hell did they manage to keep it up tony bell at your service the small man said they shook hands rebus noticed that tony bell was growing old he had a swelling paunch and was a little breathless after his jog he ran a hand over his babylike head and kept grinning detective inspector rebus the grin subsided in fact most of tony bells face seemed to subside oh jesus he said what is it a mugger pickpocket what is somebody hurt which hospital rebus raised a hand no need to panic he reassured him your charges are all quite safe thank christ for that the grin returned bell nodded towards a door above which was printed the legend diningroom and bar fancy a drink anything to get out of this war zone rebus said you should see the bar after dinner said tony bell leading the way now thats a war zone as bell explained the grebe tours party had a free afternoon he checked his watch and told rebus that they would probably start returning to the hotel fairly soon there was a meeting arranged for before dinner when the next days itinerary would be discussed rebus told the rep what he wanted and bell himself suggested he stay put for the meeting yes rebus agreed that seemed sensible and meantime would tony like another drink this particular grebe tours party was american theyd flown in almost a month ago for what bell called the full british tour canterbury salisbury stonehenge london stratford york the lake district trossachs highlands and edinburgh this is just about the last stop he said for which relief much thanks i can tell you theyre nice people mind im not saying theyre not but demanding yes thats what it is if a brit doesnt quite understand whats been said to him or if something isnt quite right or whatever they tend to keep their gobs shut but americans he rolled his eyeballs americans he repeated as though it explained all it did less than an hour later rebus was addressing a packed seated crowd of forty american tourists in a room off the large diningroom he had barely given them his rank when a hand shot into the air er yes the elderly woman stood up sir are you from scotland yard rebus shook his head scotland yards in london she was still standing now why is that she asked rebus had no answer to this but someone else suggested that it was because that part of london was called scotland yard yes but why was it called scotland yard in the first place the woman had sat down now but all around her was discussion and conjecture rebus looked towards tony bell who rose from his own seat and succeeded in quietening things down eventually rebus was able to make his point were interested he said in a visitor to edinburgh castle this morning you may have seen someone while you were there someone standing by the walls looking towards the scott monument he or she might have been standing there for some time if that means something to anybody id like you to tell me about it at the same time its possible that those of you who took photographs of your visit may have by chance snapped the person were looking for if any of you have cameras id like to see the photos you took this morning he was in luck nobody remembered seeing anyone suspicious they were too busy looking at the sights but two photographers had used polaroids and another had taken his film into a sameday processor at lunchtime and so had the glossy photographs with him rebus studied these while tony bell went over the next days arrangements with the group the polaroid photos were badly taken often blurry with people in the background reduced to matchstick men but the sameday photos were excellent sharply focused mm jobs as the tour party left the room en route for dinner tony bell came over to where rebus was sitting and asked the question he knew he himself would be asked more than once over dinner any joy maybe rebus admitted these two people keep cropping up he spread five photographs out in front of him in two a middleaged woman was caught in the background staring out over the wall she was leaning on leaning on or hiding behind in another two a man in his late twenties or early thirties stood in similar pose but with a more upright stance in one photo they could both be seen half turning with smiles on their faces towards the camera no tony bell was shaking his head they might look like wanted criminals but theyre in our party i think mrs eglinton was sitting in the back row near the door beside her husband you probably didnt see her but shaw berkely was in the second row over to one side im surprised you didnt see him actually i take that back he has this gift of being innocuous never asks questions or complains mind you i think hes seen most of this before oh rebus was gathering the photos together he told me hed been to britain before on holiday and theres nothing between him and rebus was pointing to the photograph of the man and woman together him and mrs eglinton bell seemed genuinely amused i dont know maybe she certainly mothers him a bit rebus was still studying the print is he the youngest person on the tour by about ten years sad story really his mother died and after the funeral he said he just had to get away went into the travel agents and we were offering a reduction for late bookings his fathers dead too then thats right i got his life story one night late in the bar on a tour i get everyones story sooner or later rebus flipped through the sheaf of photos a final time nothing new presented itself to him and you were at the castle between about half past eleven and quarter to one just as i told you oh well rebus sighed i dont think inspector it was the receptionist her head peering around the door theres a call for you it was superintendent watson he was concise factual withdrew five hundred pounds from each of four accounts all on the same day and in plenty of time for the rendezvous at the café royal so presumably he paid up but did he get the letters back mmm has lady scott had a look for them yes weve been through the study not thoroughly theres too much stuff in there for that but weve had a look that we sounded comfortable sounded as though watson had already got his feet under the table so what now john im coming over if youve no objection sir with respect id like a look at sir walters office for myself he went in search of tony bell just so he could say thanks and goodbye but he wasnt in the musty conference room and he wasnt in the diningroom he was in the bar standing with one foot on the bar rail as he shared a joke with the woman he had called mrs eglinton rebus did not interrupt but he did wink at the phonebound receptionist as he passed her then pushed his way out of the castellain hotels double doors just as the wheezing of a buss air brakes signalled the arrival of yet more human cargo there was no overhead lighting in sir walter scotts study but there were numerous floor lamps desk lamps and anglepoises rebus switched on as many as worked most were antiquated with wiring to match but there was one newish anglepoise attached to the bookcase pointing inwards towards the collection of scotts writings there was a comfortable chair beside this lamp and an ashtray on the floor between chair and bookcase when watson put his head around the door rebus was seated in this chair elbows resting on his knees and chin resting between the cupped palms of both hands margaret that is lady scott she wondered if you wanted anything i want those letters i think she meant something feasible like tea or coffee rebus shook his head maybe later sir watson nodded made to retreat then thought of something they got him down in the end had to use a winch not very dignified but what can you do i just hope the papers dont print any pictures why dont you have a word with the editors just to be on the safe side i might just do that john watson nodded yes i might just do that alone again rebus rose from his chair and opened the glass doors of the bookcase the position of chair ashtray and lamp was interesting it was as though sir walter had been reading volumes from these shelves from his namesakes collected works rebus ran a finger over the spines a few he had heard of the vast majority he had not one was titled castle dangerous he smiled grimly at that dangerous all right or in sir walters case quite lethal he angled the light farther into the bookcase the dust on a row of books had been disturbed rebus pushed with one finger against the spine of a volume and the book slid a good two inches back until it rested against the solid wall behind the bookcase two uniform inches of space for the whole of this row rebus reached a hand down behind the row of books and ran it along the shelf he met resistance and drew the hand out again now clutching a sheaf of papers sir walter had probably thought it as good a hiding place as any a poor testament to scott the novelists powers of attraction rebus sat down in the chair again brought the anglepoise closer and began to sift through what hed found there were indeed twelve letters ornately fountainpenned promises of love with honour of passion until doomsday as with all such youthful nonsense there was a lot of poetry and classical imagery rebus imagined it was standard private boys school stuff even today but these letters had been written half a century ago sent from one schoolboy to another a year younger than himself the younger boy was sir walter and from the correspondence it was clear that sir walters feelings for the writer had been every bit as inflamed as those of the writer himself ah the writer rebus tried to remember if he was still an mp he had the feeling he had either lost his seat or else had retired maybe he was still on the go rebus paid little attention to politics his attitude had always been dont vote it only encourages them so here was the presumed scandal hardly a scandal but just about enough to cause embarrassment at worst a humiliation but then rebus was beginning to suspect that humiliation not financial profit was the price exacted here and not even necessarily public humiliation merely the private knowledge that someone knew of these letters that someone had possessed them then the final taunt the taunt sir walter could not resist come to the scott monument look across to the castle and you will see who has been tormenting you these past weeks you will know but now that same taunt was working on rebus he knew so much yet in effect he knew nothing at all he now possessed the what but not the who and what should he do with the old love letters lady scott had said she wasnt sure she wanted to find them he could take them away with him destroy them or he could hand them over to her tell her what they were it would be up to her either to destroy them unread or to discover this silly secret he could always say its all right its nothing really mind you some of the sentences were ambiguous enough to disturb werent they rebus read again when you scored no and afterwards we showered when you stroke me like that after rugger practice ach he got up and opened the bookcase again he would replace them let time deal with them he could not but in placing his hand back down behind the line of books he brushed against something else not paper but stiff card he hadnt noticed it before because it seemed stuck to the wall he peeled it carefully away and brought it into the light it was a photograph black and white ten inches by eight and mounted on card a man and woman on an esplanade arm in arm posing for the photographer the man looked a little pensive trying to smile but not sure he actually wanted to be caught like this the woman seemed to wrap both her arms round one of his restraining him and she was laughing thrilled by this moment thrilled to be with him the man was sir walter a sir walter twenty years older than the schoolboy of the love letters mid thirties perhaps and the woman rebus stared long and hard at the woman put the photograph down and paced the study touching things peering through the shutters he was thinking and not thinking he had seen the woman before somewhere but where she was not lady scott of that he was certain but hed seen her recently seen that face that face and then he knew oh yes he knew he telephoned the castellain half listening as the story was given to him taken ill suddenly poorly decided to go home airport flying to london and catching a connection tonight was there a problem well of course there was a problem but no one at the hotel could help with it not now the blackmail over rebus himself had inadvertently caused the blackmailer to flee he had gone to the hotel hoping such a slim hope for help not realising that one of the grebe tours party was his quarry once again he had sacrificed his queen too early in the game he telephoned edinburgh airport only to be told that the flight had already taken off he asked to be rerouted to security and asked them for the name of the security chief at heathrow he was calling heathrow when watson appeared in the hall making quite a few calls arent you john not personal i hope rebus ignored his superior as his call was connected mr masterson in security please he said and then yes it is urgent ill hold he turned to watson at last oh its personal all right sir but its nothing to do with me ill tell you all about it in a minute then we can decide what to tell lady scott actually seeing as youre a friend of the family and all you can tell her thatd be best wouldnt it sir there are some things only your friends can tell you after all arent there he was through to heathrow security and turned away from watson the better to talk with masters on the superintendent stood there dimly aware that rebus was going to force him to tell margaret something she would probably rather not hear he wondered if she would ever again have time for the person who would tell her and he cursed john rebus who was so good at digging yet never seemed to soil his own hands it was a gift a terrible destructive gift watson a staunch believer in the christian god doubted rebuss gift had come down from on high no not from on high the phone call was ending rebus put down the receiver and nodded towards sir walters study if youll step into the office sir he said theres something id like to show you shaw berkely was arrested at heathrow and despite protestations regarding his health and cries for consular aid was escorted back to edinburgh where rebus was waiting brisk and definitive in interview room a of great london road police station berkelys mother had died two months before she had never told him the truth about his birth spinning instead some story about his father being dead but in sorting through his mothers papers shaw discovered the truth several truths in fact his mother had been in love with walter scott had become pregnant by him but had been as she herself put it in her journal discarded in favour of the better marriage provided by margaret wintonaddams shaws mother accepted some money from scott and fled to the united states where she had a younger sister shaw grew up believing his father dead the revelation not only that he was alive but that he had prospered in society after having caused shaws mother misery and torment led to a sons rage but it was impotent rage shaw thought until he came across the love letters his mother must at some point have stolen them from scott or at least had come out of the relationship in possession of them shaw decided on a teasing revenge knowing scott would deduce that any blackmailer in possession of the letters was probably also well informed about his affair and the bastard son he used the tour party as an elaborate cover and also he admitted because it was a cheap travel option he brought with him to britain not only the letters but also the series of typed notes the irony was that he had been to edinburgh before had studied there for three months as part of some exchange with his american college he knew now why his mother though proud of the scholarship had been against his going for three months he had lived in his fathers city yet hadnt known it he sent the notes from london the travel partys base for much of its stay in england the exchange letters for cash had gone ahead in the café royal the bar having been a haunt of his student days but he had known his final note delivered by hand would tempt sir walter would lead him to the top of the scott monument no he said he hadnt just wanted sir walter to see him to see the son he had never known shaw had much of the money on him stuffed into a money belt around his waist the intention had been to release wads of money sir walters money down on to princes street gardens i didnt mean for him to die i just wanted him to know how i felt about him i dont know but jesus he grinned i still wish id let fly with all that loot rebus shuddered to think of the ramifications stampede in princes street hundreds dead in lunchtime spree biggest scooroot ever no best not to think about it instead he made for the café royal himself it was late morning the day after berkelys arrest the pub was quiet as yet but rebus was surprised to see dr jameson standing at the bar fortifying himself with what looked suspiciously like a double whisky remembering how he had left the doctor in the lurch regarding sir walters body rebus grinned broadly and offered a healthy slap on the back morning doc fancy seeing you in here rebus leaned his elbows on the bar we mustnt be keeping you busy enough he paused there was a twinkle in his eye as he spoke here let me get you a stiff one and he laughed so hard even the waiters from the oyster bar came to investigate but all they saw was a tall wellbuilt man leaning against a much smaller more timid man and saying as he raised his glass heres to mortality to old mortality so all in all it was just another day in the café royal the wider scheme it is of course by no means unusual to find a solicitor in a police station were called there at all hours of the day and night sometimes by clients sometimes by the police themselves there is something about those stations something unwholesome and it leaves its mark on you put me in a room full of lawyers and ill tell you which ones spend a lot of time in police cells and interview rooms and hanging around corridors and empty offices fingers tapping impatiently against briefcases those laywers have a tired drawn look they look like morticians they lose colour and smile less than they used to and they look nervous and cynical at the same time their eyes flitting over you as if youd been accused of something today i was sitting in detective inspector jack prestons office hes a friend of mine insofar as weve been known to share a drink a meal a joke we have met socially at parties full of other cid men and lawyers thats why he was doing me what he called a favour we were having a quiet word the door closed about a client of mine jack was keen to see my client put away but knew i could mount a reasonable defence he wanted to do some trading he would drop a couple of charges if my client changed his plea this is the way the law works its the only thing that stops the courts blocking up completely plumbing jack calls it he says were all plumbers mates trying to keep the merde flowing i was putting the case for my client not really trying too hard just enjoying the exercise when there was a knock at the door yes jack called a head appeared round the door sorry sir i know you didnt want to be disturbed jack waved the young man inside and introduced him as dc derek halliwell what is it derek the eleven oclock identification dc halliwell said jack checked his watch it was two minutes to eleven christ he said i smiled time flies it was true id been in his office a while wed been chatting thats all some gossip a few stories a cup of coffee do it without me jack said its not that sir were one short for the lineup have you had a look around nobodys available jack thought about it well she knows me i cant do it then he had an idea he turned to me i widened my eyes you want me to appear in an id parade youd be doing us a big favour roddy would it take long he smiled you know it wouldnt i sighed a little theatrically only too pleased inspector to help police with their inquiries jack and dc halliwell had a laugh as i got to my feet most people i know when they think of an id parade they imagine the american system twoway mirror the witness hidden from view but its not like that here here the witness is facetoface with the lineup he or she walks along the line then walks back along it it can be distressing for all concerned when jack told me which case this present identification was concerned with i felt pretty distressed myself we were standing in the anteroom you might have warned me i said im telling you now jack said it was the marshall case sophie marshall had been mugged and had died of her injuries before help could arrive her attacker had left her propped against a wall and had taken only cash and jewellery the hell of it was id known sophie marshall well id met her a few times as had jack shed been a court usher wed met her both professionally and at drinks parties shed been a goodlooking young woman full of life thing is jack confided you know and i know that the mo fits barry cooke i nodded barry cooke was a young thug of the district who had mugged before and served time hed left the victim propped against a wall i recalled his barrister saying in mitigation that cooke had left the victim in that position to make him more comfortable from the moment they found sophie marshall the police suspected cooke they took him in for questioning but he had a good alibi and a keen young solicitor the evidence against him was circumstantial it wouldnt hold up in court but now youve got a witness i said interested jack nodded he seemed nervous a young woman says she saw somebody near the scene about the time sophie marshall was attacked weve brought cooke in see if she can point the finger he shrugged that would just about do it good i said who is she the witness jack shrugged again lighting a cigarette for himself despite the no smoking signs on all four walls and above the door just someone who lives near there actually she lives on the floor above marshall but she didnt know her shes not what youd call the perfect witness how do you mean wait till you see her cropped hair ring through her nose tattoos shes ray boyds girlfriend know him i shook my head hes got a bit of a temper on him he was in court a couple of days ago for assault got off with it though i nodded i think i recall the case the other members of the lineup were milling around and now the anteroom door opened and barry cooke was led in i didnt look at him there was a quick briefing from jack and we were told to go into the id room there we were arranged into a line i was wearing a jacket borrowed from dc halliwell to make me look more casual and id taken off my tie i still looked a good deal more formal than the others in the lineup one of whom was a police officer i ended up as number four barry cooke was right next to me he was about a foot shorter than me with thick unkempt hair tied back into a matted ponytail his mouth was missing a few teeth and his face was scarred with acne i tried to look straight ahead of me but of course he knew who i was youre a lawyer arent you he said no talking one of the policemen ordered then the witness was brought into the room jack was with her along with cookes solicitor an upstart called tony barraclough barraclough recognised me but didnt let it show hed probably been forewarned by jack the witness was about cookes height and age it struck me that they might know one another but then this parade wouldnt have been necessary she was an ugly little thing except for her eyes her eyes were pretty the way shed once been pretty all over but shed scraped and savaged herself pierced herself she wore her underclass like a uniform she stopped in front of number one then passed two and three and stopped in front of me i stared straight ahead and she moved on to barry cooke but she walked right past him to number six i could see hope fade from jacks face his shoulders sagged eventually she walked past us again i thought this time she was going to stop at cooke but she was standing in front of me then she reached up and tapped my shoulder thats him she said thats the bastard jack shuffled his feet are you sure oh im sure all right definitely him bastard and she slapped me hard across the face two uniformed officers led her away still screaming everyone looked a bit shaken up i rubbed my cheek where it stung barry cooke was watching me intently jack was having a quiet word with tony barraclough jack was smiling barraclough nodding then the lineup was dismissed cooke went off with barraclough and jack came over to me sorry about that he said do you think i should press a charge for assault what do you reckon i shrugged you say her boyfriends often in trouble not often maybe shes seen me in the courts yes thats possible decided to have a go at you that makes sense otherwise well i mean you and cooke youre chalk and cheese further apart than that i think well anyway sorry he pointed to my cheek i can see the outline of her fingers i rubbed the cheek again i hope it fades before i go home i didnt know your wife was the jealous type jack put a hand on my shoulder roddy these identity parades work less often than youd think ive been picked out myself once or twice no problem i said trying to smile but i was worried all the same the shock wore off and i found i had an idea i wanted to see if it was possible that ray boyd himself could have been sophie marshalls attacker i knew from jack that boyd had a temper that hed been in court for assault it didnt take me too long to find what i was looking for in the court records but his previous arrests were for assaults on men not women they usually took place in the form of onesided fights outside pubs boyd was a good fighter by all accounts in that he tended to lose his head and become a whirlwind all arms and attitude feet and ferocity he didnt care if you hit him back he shrugged blows off and kept on pummelling on the last occasion it had taken several bystanders to drag him off his cowed opponent there was no mention of a girlfriend and i didnt want to ask jack about her i didnt want him involved not at this stage but i had boyds address so i drove myself out there thanking god i hadnt yet got rid of my ford sierra and traded up to the mercedes or bmw which id been promising myself where ray boyd lived even a newish sierra turned heads it was a mazy block of flats eight storeys high and the colour of old dishwater i parked my car in a bay and sat for a while wondering what to do next fortunately my wife is a birdwatcher her own car having been out of action last weekend shed borrowed mine so she and her fellow twitchers could drive to some godforsaken spot to stare at a rare siberian visitor her binoculars were still in the car they were her secondbest pair compact in size and sheathed in green rubber i scanned the tiers of the tower block on the other side of the block there were only anonymous windows but i was parked in a kind of inner arena this side there were long walkways and front doors liftshafts and stairwells boyds flat was which i soon realised meant floor flat scanning what thirdfloor doors i could see i eventually picked out flat it looked no better or worse than its neighbours i put the binoculars away and sat there keeping an eye on it pretending to read a newspaper even the paper i realised was wrong for this part of town not many broadsheets around here you make a lousy detective i told myself a few children playing with a ball came to look at me i dont know who they thought i was but they were properly mistrustful of authority and soon went away again i could have been a policeman a debt collector or anyone it struck me how ridiculous this was me sitting here but i wanted to get a look at ray boyd to size him up as it were when his flat door opened boyd came out accompanied by the witness i wished i knew her name but at least i knew where she stayed jack had told me boyd and his girlfriend were walking i tried following them in the car but they were walking too slowly for this to be feasible so i parked by the side of the road and followed on foot after a quarter of a mile i reckoned i knew where they were headed the girlfriends flat on the horseshoe estate where sophie marshall had lived id seen enough i headed back to my car a policeman had already ticketed it barry cooke himself was next again i used the court records i even had a quiet word with his solicitor meeting casually we spoke of the identity parade and laughed about it then i asked him about barry cooke barraclough didnt seem surprised or suspicious that i was asking we were just two lawyers enjoying a bit of a chat the more i looked at barry cooke the more feasible it all seemed a mugging gone wrong violence taken too far and the mo fitted his own i knew that already all he had on his side were his alibi his protestation of innocence and the fact that the witness had singularly failed to identify him he was still the chief suspect however the police had no reason to disbelieve the witness to suspect that she was playing some game not unless it could be shown that she was i had a picture in my head an apparent witness who has come forward not to assist the inquiry but to ensure it takes a wrong turn that she picked me out was an accident it could have been anybody anybody but the actual culprit i liked this picture and wondered if jack could see it too as i was leaving the court i saw a figure dart round a corner i went to my car and sat in it for a moment pretending to look for something in my briefcase but really keeping an eye on my wing mirror the figure reappeared seeking me out it was barry cooke i drove out of the car park and a couple of hundred yards down the road to a burger restaurant where i pulled in i waited but there was no sign of a following car now that i thought about it id read in one of the court reports that barry cooke could not drive it was on his side in the marshall case for as barraclough had said cookes alibi was that he was at a party four miles away from where sophie marshalls body had been found no way could he have walked that distance and back someone would have to have driven him there which as barraclough said with a smile was most unlikely still barry cooke had been to court several times so had ray boyd and so in all probability had boyds girlfriend any one of them might have seen sophie marshall before maybe shed been picked out none of which got me any further proof was the thing the police needed proof i waited but there was no sign of barry cooke so i started the car again and drove home to my wife next morning as i parked the car outside my offices i saw him again he was good at being furtive but solicitors deal with furtive people all the time and i spotted him straightaway i locked the car and started towards him at first i thought he was going to run for it but he decided instead to stand his ground he put his hands in his pockets and waited for me are you following me i asked barry cooke shook his head got a right to be here havent i i saw you yesterday skulking he shrugged so so why are you following me he considered a response bad liars usually take their time that witness picked you out he eventually said yes but the coppers are still hassling me you want me to do something about it he frowned no i just that witness picked you out dont be ridiculous she made a mistake thats all i paused maybe she was paid to make a mistake he narrowed his eyes how do you mean but i just shrugged now i said are you going to stop following me or must i call di preston he screwed up his face preston that bastard youre all in it together you lot all matey all favours and stuff i dont know what you mean he just made another face and walked away i watched him go then trembling a little i went into my office and opened a fresh bottle of brandy i knew i had to talk to the witness the problem was would she talk to me it was difficult i was finding it harder to get things straight in my mind i knew i was in dangerous territory and that things might get worse still i spent all the rest of that day watching for barry cooke but i never saw him maybe my warning was enough maybe he was keeping his distance for reasons of his own but someone did scratch my car i phoned my wife and told her about it explaining that after work i was going to get respray estimates from a couple of garages then i headed out to sophie marshalls estate i parked at a distance and had to walk down the very alley where shed been attacked it was a dreary spot a narrow corridor bordered by high brick walls covered in graffiti there was a railway line nearby trains thundering past a terrible place to die i had to stop for a moment and control my breathing but i went on it is difficult more difficult than id imagined to hang about on these estates while remaining inconspicuous people came to their windows and children stopped playing to stare at me so i climbed the stairwell and walked about a bit outside the lines of flats looking like i knew where i was going it was hopeless after a nervous halfhour i decided to return to my car i was sitting in the drivers seat hands clutching the steering wheel trying to calm myself down when i saw her she walked on loud highheeled boots spiky things as spiky as she herself was she wore tight black denims ripped at the knees and a baggy black tshirt she hadnt brought boyd with her thank god i didnt want to have to deal with boyd not if i could help it she had her head down either sullenly or just to avoid eye contact with other pedestrians standard practice these days sad to say she passed within feet of my car but didnt so much as glance at it i gave her half a minute to walk down the alley then got out of the car locked it and followed i was giving her plenty of time by the time i got to the far end of the alley she had already crossed the quadrangle and was somewhere in the block then i saw her appear on the third floor she walked to the fourth door from the stairs and opened it with a key i followed i stood outside her door for the best part of a minute then bent down to look through her letterbox i could hear music probably a radio but no voices no other sounds i stood up again and looked at the nameplate on the door it was a piece of cheap lined paper stuck to the paintwork with tape afflick it said i knocked a fourbeat rhythm a friendly knock then waited there was no spy hole so when she came to the door she opened it no security chain either i pushed the door open wide and went in hoi she said her voice a squeal what the hell her voice died as she recognised me her cheeks went red i just want to talk thats all five minutes of your time ill yell bloody murder she said i smiled i dont doubt it look i wouldnt have come here but i need to speak to you what about i think you know can we sit down she took me into the livingroom which was little more than a hovel she went straight to the fireplace switched off the radio opened a packet of cigarettes and lit one for herself she never took her eyes off me she looked scared i cleared a space and sat down on the sofa i crossed my legs trying to look relaxed hoping she wouldnt see me as a threat i didnt want that what do you want she said do you know a young man called barry cooke never heard of him she said defiantly no he was on that lineup with me he was standing right next to me short hair tied back scruffy youve got a nerve coming here she had pulled herself together ill give her that she was strongwilled barry cooke i continued is the man the police think killed sophie marshall they were hoping youd identify him i identified you it was you i saw i smiled and looked at the floor between us the police are trying to pin down barry cooke so what so you could help them what you could remember something about the man you saw that night you could change your mind i reached into my jacket pocket and brought out an envelope whats that she said curious now money a lot of it a oneoff payment for your cooperation you want cooke convicted i want someone convicted and it may as well be him well hadnt i left sophies body that way on purpose remembering cookes mo hadnt i taken her money and jewellery but i hadnt counted on cooke having such a strong alibi i hadnt counted on there being a witness look i said take the money but it was you i saw that night that doesnt matter i said feeling this to be the truth what did it matter a brief affair gone badly wrong a threat to tell wife and colleagues a chase through an alley what did any of it matter in the wider scheme you killed her i didnt mean to but you did and now you want to fit up cooke what i want i said quietly is to give you some money what have you got to lose the police didnt believe you when you pointed me out at the lineup theyll never believe you you might as well take the money and tell them some other story she came towards me her eyes on the envelope i handed it up to her she took it and placed it on the mantelpiece barry cooke she said quietly short i said grubby with a ponytail and spots and a few missing teeth hes mugged women before youd be doing society a favour she stared at me right she said sourly a favour i stood up and buttoned my jacket i think we understand one another i said then i walked out into her hall i was opening the front door when she called to me i turned she was standing in the livingroom doorway she had the cigarette in her mouth her eyes slitted against the smoke and she was hauling at the hem of her tshirt with both hands tugging it up i didnt realise what she was doing then i saw there were strips of tape on her stomach and a thin snaking black wire attached to a black transmitter she was bugged i yanked open the front door and jack preston was standing there in front of me hello roddy he said we sat in interview room a having a chat jack explained it all quite quickly how gayle afflick had seen me in the courts the day her boyfriend ray was up for assault and how she had recognised me as the man shed seen that night her boyfriend told her i was a solicitor and this worried her who would take her word against that of a solicitor she knew one decent copper someone who might believe her di jack preston that time in jacks office it had been a setup neatly played by jack and halliwell to get me into a lineup where gayle afflick could identify me jack wanted to see how id react what id do he had a good idea id want to talk to the witness afterwards it all fitted as far as he was concerned there were rumours around the court that sophie marshall had been seeing a married man it figured that this man most probably knew her from her professional life she didnt have much of a social one when jack found that my car had been ticketed on a road near the horseshoe estate a long way off my usual patch he knew he was on to something so hed had gayle afflick tailed and had her wired up too taking the whole thing carefully nice and slow because he knew how easy it would be to lose me but he hadnt lost me he had it all now the whole story and he had me he asked if i wanted a solicitor of course i want a solicitor i hear tony barracloughs good jack said that smell was in my nostrils that police station smell there were i decided suddenly worse smells far worse smells in the wider scheme of things unknown pleasures nelly sat with his head in his hands he could feel the sweat except it was more viscous than sweat more like a sheen of cooking oil the tenement stairwell smelt of deepfried tomcat and the cold step beneath him was stained and scuffed over the years thousands of pairs of feet must have pulled themselves up here tired or drunk or ailing but no one in the whole history of the tenement had ever come near to feeling as bad as he did right now eleven oclock an hour shy of the millennium and the only way he was going to make it was if he got some stuff hunter was mean at the best of times doubly mean at this festive period reverse goodwill he called it chimes outside nelly counted eleven the crowds would be gathering in princes street laser shows and live bands promised then the fireworks he could have some fireworks of his own here on the stairwell but only if he got some stuff which was why hed climbed the three flights to mrs mcivers flat he knew she was out cormacks bar every night eight till eleven she was in her seventies wouldnt swap her eyrie for a retirement home with a lift and ramp in her seventies and well pickled rum and black when she laughed her tongue was an inky tentacle hed nothing against her only hed figured her door would be easiest so hed shouldered it and kicked it and shouldered it again nothing shed morticed it even though she was only round the corner so now he sat with his head in his hands soon as the pain got to him hed top himself couldnt see any other way hed leave a note grassing up hunter revenge from the grave and all that there was nothing in his flat worth hawking and nobody to hawk it to at this time of night this night of all nights everyone was on the outside hunter and sheila and dickie and his mum and gran part of the party that was edinburgh kissing strangers and wishing happy new years less than an hour from now should auld acquaintance be forgot his acquaintance was the big h and no way was it letting him forget it methadone was a joke he sold his some chemists had started taking the junkies in ten at a time shutting up shop while each dose was dispensed standing in a line like cub scouts or something one wee plastic cup with jellies hard to come by what was the alternative there is no alternative thats what heroin would have said it wasnt true it would kill you it was the crap they cut it with did that anybody who could afford a good big habit of the nice stuff they could go on for ever look at keef learned to ski used to whip jagger at tennis made exile on main street skagged out the whole time skagged out and playing tennis nelly started to laugh he was still laughing when the sound of the tenement door closing came crashing up the stairwell slow steady steps he rubbed tears from his eyes his shoulder hurt where it had connected with mrs mcivers door and here she was now climbing towards him whats the joke nelly he stood up to let her past she was getting her keys out of her bag big canvas bag with las vegas painted on the side in loopy red writing looked like big red veins to nelly he could see a newspaper and a library book and a purse nothing really mrs mciver a purse whatre you doing up here anyway thought i heard something wanted to check you were all right you must be hearing things i thought youd be out on the town night like this i was just heading out he stepped on to her landing she had her key in the door eh mrs mciver as she turned her head his fist caught her on the cheek johnny hunter was holding court in his local he was in his favourite corner seat both arms draped round the necks of the blondes hed chatted up at chapters on boxing day evening hed given them champagne driven them around in his saab convertible keeping the top down even though it was cold hed told them they needed fur coats said hed measure them up theyd laughed the littler one margo hed told her that was the name of an expensive wine the other one juliet was quieter a bit stuckup maybe but not about to duck out not with the hunter throwing his money and his weight around hed done a few deals tonight nothing cataclysmic the punters wanted speed to keep them going coke to lend an air of celebration to the new beginning hed steered a couple of them towards smack instead fashion was cyclical whether it was hemlines or recreational drugs heroin was back in style that was his pitch and its safe hed tell them just follow the instructions on the box and with a wink hed be off rearranging the lines of his armani jacket eyes open to the possibilities around him margo seemed to be cosying into him maybe to get away from panda who was seated next to her panda was the scariest thing in the pub which was the whole point of him he was paid to be a deterrent and also did the deals outside the hunter didnt touch the goods if he could help it the cops had come after him three times already this year never enough for a prosecution and now he had a pair of ears in the drugs squad a hundred a week just for the odd phone call cheap insurance caldwell had agreed when hunter had told him about it cheap for caldwell at any rate hunter didnt know how much caldwell was making ten fifteen grand a week had to be house down in the borders apparently more a castle than a house six cars each one better than the saab hunter wanted to be caldwell he knew he could be caldwell he was good enough but caldwell had the contacts and the money and the muscle caldwell had made people disappear and if hunter didnt keep business moving he might find himself on the wrong end of his boss there were other dealers out there younger just as hungry and edging on the desperate which meant reckless all of them would like hunters power and his clothes and car his women and money they all wanted his money and now nelly of all runts was giving him grief just by his very existence caldwells goons making sure hunter knew what had to be done making him acknowledge just how low he was on the ladder itll be you takes the fall one of them had said you or him so make it clean oh hed make it clean if that was what it took he knew hed no choice much as he liked nelly are we clubbing or what billy bones talking skinny as a wisp of smoke seated the other side of juliet whose legs hed been staring at for the past halfhour one more hunter said the pub was heaving table service impossible there were a dozen empty glasses on the table hunter reached out an arm and swept them to the floor patrick caldwell examined himself in his bathrooms fulllength mirror he was casually dressed brogues chinos yellow shirt and a ralph lauren red vnecked sweater nearing fifty he was pleased that he still possessed a good head of hair and that the only grey was provided by touches at either temple his face was tanned and his eyes sparkled with selfsatisfaction it had in the words of the song been a very good year less merchandise apprehended by the authorities demand steady in some areas increasing in others a very satisfactory year but still something niggled him the more money he made the more contented he should be wasnt that the dream but the things he really wanted seemed still intangible seemed further away than ever yet so close he could almost taste them he turned out the light and headed back downstairs where his guests were waiting the cheeseboard was being placed on the table a huge log fire crackled and spat in the hearth the room was woodpanelled and fifty feet long a devil to heat but nobody looked uncomfortable the whiskies and champagnes and wines had done their trick armagnac still to come and the best champagne kept for midnight itself on his way to his chair he leaned down and kissed his wifes head which drew smiles from the guests eight of them all but two staying the night his driver would take these two home that way they could both drink ill have no sobersides tonight hed told them his guests were all professional people wealthy in their own right and as far as they were concerned caldwell made his pile in a variety of property deals security transactions and foreign investments the tomkinsons ben and alicia were seated nearest caldwell ben had made his money early in life a communications company in the city hed been a lowly bt engineer before founding his company taking his one big risk in life now twenty years on he had homes in kent scotland and barbados and liked to talk too readily about fishing but caldwells wife got on well with alicia ten years younger than ben and a real beauty jonathan trent had been an mp for two years resigning finally and famously because the hours were too long the pay laughable hed returned to his merchant bank and was these days one of caldwells many advisers trent didnt mind where caldwells money came from didnt ask too many questions his first piece of advice to his client get the best accountants money can buy these days caldwell was shielded as much by his small army of legal people and moneymen as by his hulking mercedes and bodyguard even tonight crispin was on duty somewhere on the property revealing himself only to any unwelcome visitors caldwell glanced at trents wife who was as usual putting away double the drinks her husband was not that she couldnt hold the stuff but it was always quantity over quality with stella and this irked caldwell put the finest burgundy in front of her and she slugged it like it was off the bottom shelf at threshers hed seated parnell wilson next to her in the hope that the racing drivers tanned good looks would take stellas mind off grain and grape but wilson was too obviously besotted with his girlfriend fran who sat directly opposite him from their looks caldwell knew they were playing some provocative game of footsie under the table and why not fran was like all wilsons conquests tiny and gorgeous and leaping out of what dress there was naked skin the only cloth that would really suit her caldwell had a large share in the syndicate which owned wilsons racing team not that caldwell enjoyed the sport frankly he could see no point to it but he did enjoy the travelling italy brazil monte carlo and he always met interesting people some of whom turned into useful contacts final guests sir arthur lorimer and his museumpiece of a wife lorimer was a judge and nearneighbour and it pleased caldwell to have the old soak here cultivate the establishment trents second piece of advice his reasoning if youre ever found out it reflects badly on them and as a result theyll try to ignore what misdemeanours they can caldwell hoped hed never have to put this to the test but that might be up to hunter thered been a phone call earlier from franz in dortmund just to wish him a happy and prosperous new year with your help franz caldwell had said they never said very much on the phone you never knew who was listening even at hogmanay it was all codes and intermediaries your partys tonight in full flow im sorry you couldnt make it business so often interrupts my pleasures but im sending a little token patrick a gift for the millennium franz you neednt have oh but its nothing really i look forward to seeing you soon my friend and enjoy whats left of your party enjoy whats left they were on dessert when the doorbell rang caldwell decided to answer it himself thinking of franzs gift a man was standing on the porch he was dressed all in black smiling pointing a gun directly at caldwells heart franz knew he was going to have to head up to denmark those damned hells angels and their little squabbles all that tribalism was so bad for business not that they cared much about business all they cared about was themselves they reminded him of nothing so much as feuding families in some american cartoon book a faceoff between two mountain shacks it had started as a question of territory almost always his business disputes were to do with encroachment that was why meetings were so important so lines of demarcation could be drawn but these bikers put them in a room together and the hate was like some fug in the air sucking out oxygen and replacing it with toxic gas he needed couriers to denmark and the angels were good at their job but they lacked dedication and he definitely didnt need a war starting up between rival chapters he needed that like he needed a hole in the head he thought of caldwells gift and allowed himself a smile no visitors to franzs home this night few visitors on that day of the year he conducted business from an office in the city and travelled often but here in this fortress he had constructed spending the best part of dm on security alone here he felt safe felt a certain tranquillity at times these were the moments when his thinking was at its best when he could plan and debate beloved mozart on the stereo and tonight not the requiem not on a night that should be a blossoming of hope and fresh intentions his second fresh intention after the diplomatic trip to denmark a further trip to afghanistan hed heard worrying reports of depleted harvests and of crops and fields being burned by suddenly efficient soldiers hed asked an associate in chicago what the hell they thought was going on blame our fucking dickdipping president hes trying the same shit he pulled in south america be my friend he tells them let me loan you money billions of dollars of clean government money use it to rebuild your infrastructure or line your private zurich bank vault but just get rid of all the shit you grow its all politics as usual the voice from chicago was distorted a sideeffect of the scrambler at least no one would be listening in i dont understand franz had said though he did i thought we had arranged for friends to be placed where they could help us what can they do cbs go primetime on a field of burning poppies then up pops the prez to say he did it his ratings jump a couple of points franz this guy would do his dear departed grandma in the ass for a couple of points end of conversation sad really to think that decisions taken a continent away could affect one so much but thrilling too because franz saw himself as part of a network which embraced the globe and felt his importance his place in the scheme of things if they ever set up colonies in space he wanted to be supplying them dealer to the universe by appointment to infinity mozart silent now he hadnt realised but midnight had come and gone then a buzzer sounding the guardroom one of his men informing him of intruders entering the compound it was not yet quite dawn and kejan lay in the darkness as he had for the preceding five hours his eyes staring ears attuned to his wifes light breathing three of their children slept in the room with them hama the youngest coughed and turned made a slight moan before relaxing again kejan didnt know if hed ever relax again in his life ever sleep again on this earth would the soldiers fulfil their promise and return to torch the shacks by the side of what had once been fields full of crops those fields had been kejans future not that hed owned them the owner was a brutal man a slavedriver but kejan had mouths to feed and what other work was there now with the fields reduced to cinders he could only wait and wonder would the soldiers drive the families away or would the bossman chase them off his land now that there was no work for them it was a matter of time it was for the future he tried to envisage a future for his wife his three children he had more than once caught the bossman staring at his wife running his tongue over his bottom lip and talking to her once too though she would not even admit it kept her eyes on the ground as she denied and denied kejan had slapped her then the bruise a lasting smudge against her cheekbone it didnt seem to want to go away there were so many things kejan didnt understand the soldiers passed around lighted torches their commander arguing with the bossman the bossman saying that he always paid that he always kept everyone sweet the commander not listening the bossman persistent soldiers fingering their weapons noting that the bossmans men were better armed with newer gleaming automatics orders the commander kept saying and just let us get on with it for now for now meaning things might be okay later that this had some deeper meaning which the commander felt unable to share but later later there would be other workers willing workers new people could always be found later now was what mattered to kejan he lived from moment to moment in this dark overcrowded room he waited for the moment he knew was coming when the future would become the present and he would be consigned to the road with his family or perhaps please no without them he had hit his wife the bossman had smiled at her the bossman would take her and kejan couldnt be sure she wouldnt go would she take his children would the bossman want them would he treat them right his wifes breathing so shallow the room a little lighter now so he could see the outline of her neck the way it was angled against the stemfilled sack she used as a pillow slender neck brittle neck kejan touched it with the tips of his fingers heard a child cough and pulled his fingers away like theyd been too close to a torch he sat up then looked down on the dark curved shape twisted his own body around so that it was easier to reach down with both hands and heard the sound of lorries on the rough track outside coming closer an aggrieved hells angel sat in franzs study and it was all franz could do not to reach into his desk drawer for the pistol and blow the mans brains all over the walls defilement that was what it felt like engine oil and cigarette smoke had invaded his most private space and even when the man had gone those taints would remain the rest of the gang was outside one on one franz had demanded it and the leader had agreed a dozen of them theyd scaled the perimeter wall a dozen of them armed and franz with only three guards on duty but now more were on their way calls had been made and meantime the three guards faced off the leatherclad bandits while their leader and franz sat with only the antique rosewood desk between them nice place the angel said his name was lars well over six feet tall hair stretched back into a thin ponytail denim waistcoat allimportant colours worn over leather jacket and his jackboots up on franzs desk hed grinned when franz had stopped short of telling him to take his feet off the desk but franz was biding his time waiting for his other men to arrive and wanting to rise above all this to be the diplomat so hed offered lars a drink and lars now rested a bottle of beer against his crotch and looked relaxed youre financing our rivals the gang leader said getting down to business in what way were in a war no room for neutrals and youre funding their side of things i pay them to act as my couriers thats all im not financing any conflict but its your money theyre using when they buy guns and ammo franz shrugged and whose money are you using my friend are your mortal enemies at this very moment confronting your employer he smiled do you see the absurdity of the situation im not happy because here you are invading my privacy and i dont suppose your employer will be feeling any different im a businessman i am neutral business always is what youre doing right this second is fucking with my business my instinct naturally is to get out which is what you want yes he had lost the biker who nodded slowly exactly but what if the same thought is going through your employers mind where does that leave you with no money no prospects franz shook his head my friend the best thing you can do for all our sakes is to begin discussions with your rivals settle this thing then we can all get back to what we want to be doing making money franz reached into a drawer held one hand up to let lars know nothing tricky was coming he produced a fat bundle of deutschmarks and tossed it to the gangleader see he said now im funding both of you does that make me neutral lars studied the notes stuffed them into a zippered pocket let me set up a meeting franz went on blandly get all sides together anyone who has an interest thats the way business works youre full of bullshit the biker said but he was grinning should your employer ever wish to dispense with your services franz continued you may wish to contact me he wrote a number on a sheet of paper ripped it from the pad this is my private line maybe next time youre thinking of coming to see me we could arrange an appointment a nice big smile lars slid his feet from the corner of the desk his heels had left marks on the woodwork as he reached for the paper franz snatched it back one thing my friend try something like this again without an appointment and ill destroy you is that clear between us lars laughed and took the number stuck it in the same pocket as the money franzs mobile phone rang it was in the desk drawer and he opened the drawer again shrugging telling lars there was no rest for the wicked hello a hushed voice one he knew weve got every one of those dirty fuckers in our sights fine franz said making to replace the phone in its drawer bringing out the pistol in its place lars was already reaching across the desk hed pulled a combat knife from one boot franz was leaning back to take aim when the gunfire started outside caldwell was in the library hed locked the door and when his wife had come knocking saying the judge and his wife were thinking of leaving hed hissed at her to fuck off he sat in a burgundy leather chair hands on his knees while his visitor stood four feet away the gun steady in his left hand my bodyguard caldwell asked tied up outside lets hope someone releases him before hypothermia sets in its a bitter night we wouldnt want any unnecessary deaths youve come from franz the man nodded his accent was english he had a heavy body thick at the neck and cropped hair exforces caldwell presumed with a message the man said a typical gesture by franz he always had to show his puissance caldwell thought he knew now what this was about and felt a mixture of emotions the thrill of fear fury at franzs little game embarrassment that his guests would be wondering what the hell was going on everythings set caldwell told the man really does franz have any reason to doubt me thats what im here to find out its nearly midnight everything was supposed to be finalised by midnight everything is caldwell made to rise from his chair but the gun waved him back down again links in a chain mr caldwell thats all we are the weakest links have to be taken out the strong ones reconnected you think id put myself on the line for a little turd like that i think you like to operate at a distance and franz doesnt he always uses the best people im not sure hunter falls into that category hunterll do as hes told will he ive heard he might have a personal stake in all of this caldwell frowned how do you mean his wife knocked at the door again her voice artificially bright darling sir arthur and lady lorimer are leaving ive asked foster to bring the bentley round her voice grated it always had the way she spoke now like shed been to elocution classes like shed been saying darling and sir this and lady that all her life and all she was was a piece of crumpet hed picked up early on in his travels through life too early on he could have done better for himself still could given the chance send her off with a settlement or bring some mistress into the equation it seemed to caldwell that he hadnt really started living yet apologise will you he called im on the phone important business he lowered his voice again mind half on his life to come half on the gun in front of him how do you mean he repeated you see the man said thats the difference between my employer and you he takes the trouble to know things to know people hes a thousand miles away and he knows more about your operation here than you do what does he know there was a slight tremble in caldwells hands why would franz be so interested in caldwells territory unless he was planning some incursion or to move in some new operator unless he thought caldwell wasnt his best bet any more hunter the gunman was saying hes tough but just how tough i mean thats what well find out tonight isnt it if things go the way theyre supposed to nellys just a runt hunter wont have any trouble with him no the man got right into caldwells face what if i tell you something about nelly such as caldwells voice nearly failed him his surnames hunter you fucking idiot hes johnny hunters kid brother hunter was in the club chainsmoking eyes everywhere he didnt feel like dancing the bass was like gods heartbeat the lights his eyes shining down across the little world hunters right knee was pounding speed working its way to his fingertips and toes he sat alone at the table panda not six feet away just standing there so nobodyd bother his boss unless the boss wanted to be bothered he hadnt much left to sell not much at all his friends were whooping on the dancefloor waving to him occasionally they probably thought he was cool sitting the dances out smoking his smokes he rattled a cube of ice into his mouth and crunched down on it another drink replaced the empty glass fast service in the club because he owned thirty per cent thirty per cent of all of it but he knew that fiftyone was the only percentage that mattered fiftyone meant control he was waiting for nelly hoping not to see him knowing hed come here eventually hunter could have gone elsewhere but what did it matter nelly would always find him it was like the guy had a homing instinct nelly young and whacked out and terminally stupid hunter had always tried to keep things between them strictly business he could have refused to deal with nelly but then nelly would have gone elsewhere maybe gotten into worse trouble but hunter had never done him any favours no dope better than anyone else was getting no discounts for family strictly business only tonight nelly was going to get better dope he was going to get the best stuff going caldwells orders hey hunter a girl he knew short skirt any tighter and youd have to call it skin waving him on to the floor he waved back in the negative she blew him a kiss anyway margo and juliet were off somewhere maybe at the ladies or whisked away by other raptors they were meat the windowdressing in a butchers shop hunter didnt give a fuck about them he didnt give a fuck about anyone but himself number one looking out for ah shit nelly hunter punched the table with his fist it was all about the future about nellys versus his no contest was it nelly all fucked over anyway while hunter was just starting out there was never going to be any contest but all the same he hoped the crowds outside the swoop and swirl of this millennial midnight would keep nelly away maybe the tide would wash him down on to princes street and hed score there or maybe the cops would grab him spot him at last for the one they wanted which was just what caldwell didnt want no telling who nelly would grass up no telling where the trail would lead so instead there was to be a deal there was to be the purest heroin going stuff that would stop your heart dead caldwells orders and caldwell was acting on orders too and the person above caldwell hunter had the idea it was some german or dutch guy that was who hunter had to impress because he had to make a name for himself pronto had to get ahead of the game had to stake his place as caldwells replacement had to make contact had to make good yo his chest tightened lanky and dripping sweat unlikely ever to be let in by the bouncers if they didnt know he was hunters brother here came nelly nodding towards panda sliding into the booth and tipping the remains of someones lager down his neck thought i was never going to find you man hunter gazed at his brother couldnt find any words happy new year n at nelly said its not midnight yet another couple of minutes oh right nelly nodding not really giving a toss about any of this conversation or any emotions his brother might be feeling only needing a taste dosh nelly said sliding the money across you know the score nelly panda takes care of that panda standing there with one packet in his pocket exclusively for nelly hunters orders and when nelly odd panda would know hunter had balls everyone would know nobodyd ever try to screw him the word would be made flesh suicide a small price to pay for that big bright future nelly was already thinking of getting to his feet he had no business now with hunter his business his most urgent and necessary business was with panda but he had to make a bit more conversation pretend hed a bit more respect for hunter than was the case eh man just to say nelly twitched like sorry about the kid are you christ man how was i to know hed take the whole shot i didnt know he was a virgin but you sold him your methadone right needed the dosh man and he was fourteen nelly twitched again its going to be cool though i mean the police and the newspapers are going apeshit looking for ive got friends nelly theyll take care of it nellys face brightened youre the best johnny on his feet now dont let any of the bastards tell you different hunter got up they hugged wished one another happy new year as the siren in the club sounded releasing balloons the dj put on auld lang syne and it was like they were kids again getting to stay up late this one night of the year ginger cordial and madeira cake sneaking into the kitchen for swigs of whisky and brandy giggling at each new pleasure revealed to them and when hunter let his brother go and watched him put an arm around panda and saw them vanish into the haze in front of his eyes he felt a stab of terror for what he would have to become in this new millennium and for all the things he would do and the pleasures he would of necessity forgo in the frame an inspector rebus story inspector john rebus placed the letters on his desk there were three of them small plain white envelopes locally franked the same name and address printed on each in a careful hand the name was k leighton rebus looked up from the envelopes to the man sitting on the other side of the desk he was in his forties fraillooking and restless he had started talking the moment hed entered rebuss office and didnt seem inclined to stop the first one arrived on tuesday last tuesday a crank i thought some sort of malicious joke not that i could think of anyone who might do that sort of thing he shifted in his seat my neighbours over the back from me well we dont always see eye to eye but they wouldnt resort to this his eyes glanced up towards rebus for a second would they you tell me mr leighton as soon as hed said this rebus regretted the choice of words undoubtedly kenneth leighton would tell him rebus opened the first envelopes flap extracted the sheet of writingpaper and unfolded it he did the same with the second and third letters and laid all three before him if it had been only the one kenneth leighton was saying i wouldnt have minded but it doesnt look as though theyre going to stop tuesday then thursday then saturday i spent all weekend worrying about what to do you did the right thing mr leighton leighton wriggled pleasurably well they always say you should go to the police not that i think theres anything serious i mean ive not got anything to hide my lifes an open book an open book and an unexciting one rebus would imagine he tried to shut out leightons voice and concentrated instead on the first letter mr leighton weve got photos you wouldnt want your wife to see believe us think about it well be in touch then the second mr leighton for the photos that seems fair doesnt it you really wouldnt want your wife to see them get the money well be in touch and the third mr leighton well be sending one reprint to show we mean business youd better get to it before your wife does there are plenty more copies rebus looked up and caught leighton staring at him leighton immediately looked away rebus had the feeling that if he stood behind the man and said boo quite softly in his ear leighton would melt all down the chair he looked like the sort of person who might make an enemy of his neighbours complaining too strenuously about a noisy party or a family row he looked like a crank you havent received the photo yet leighton shook his head id have brought it along wouldnt i and youve no idea what sort of photo it might be none at all the last time somebody took my picture was at my nieces wedding and when was that three years ago you see what im saying inspector this doesnt make any sense it must make sense to at least one person mr leighton rebus nodded towards the letters they had been written in blue ballpoint the same pen which had been used to address the envelopes a cheap blue ballpoint leaving smears and blots of ink it was anything but professionallooking the whole thing looked like a joke since when did blackmailers use their own handwriting anyone with a rudimentary education in films tv cop shows and thriller novels knew that you used a typewriter or letters cut out of newspapers or whatever anything that would produce a dramatic effect these letters were too personal to look dramatic polite too that use of mr leighton at the start of each one a particular word caught rebuss attention and held it but then leighton said something interesting i dont even have a wife not now youre not married i was divorced six years ago six years and one month and wheres your wife now mr leighton remarried lives in glenrothes i got an invite to the wedding but i didnt go cant remember what i sent them for a present leighton was lost in thought for a moment then collected himself so you see if these letters are written by someone i know how come they dont know im divorced it was a good question rebus considered it for a full five seconds then he came to his conclusion lets leave it for now mr leighton he said theres not much we can do till this photo arrives if it arrives leighton looked numb watching rebus fold the letters and replace them in their envelopes rebus wasnt sure what the man had expected fingerprints lifted from the envelopes by forensic experts a telltale fibre leading to an arrest handwriting identified saliva from the stamps and the envelopeflaps checked psychologists analysing the wording of the messages themselves coming up with a profile of the blackmailer it was all good stuff but not on a wet monday morning in edinburgh not with cids caseload and budget restrictions is that it rebus shrugged that was it were only human mr leighton for a moment rebus thought hed actually voiced his thoughts he had not leighton still sat there pale and disappointed his mouth set like the bottom line of a balance sheet sorry said rebus rising ive just remembered said leighton what six wine glasses thats what i gave them caithness glass they were too very nice im sure said rebus stifling a postweekend yawn as he opened the office door but rebus was certainly intrigued no wife these past six years and the last photograph of leighton dated back three years to a family wedding where was the material for blackmail where the motive means motive and opportunity means a photograph apparently motive unknown opportunity leighton was a nobody a middleaged civil servant he earned enough but not enough to make him blackmail material he had confided to rebus that he barely had in his building society account hardly enough to cover their demand he had said as though he were considering actually paying off the blackmailers even though he had nothing to hide nothing to fear just to get them off his back or because he did have something to hide most people did if it came to it the guilty secret or two or more many more stored away just below the level of consciousness the way suitcases were stored under beds rebus wondered if he himself were blackmail material he smiled was the pope a catholic was the chief constable a mason leightons words came back to him hardly enough to cover their demand what sort of civil servant was leighton anyway rebus sought out the daytime telephone number leighton had left along with his home address and phone number seven digits followed by a threefigure extension number he punched the seven digits on his receiver waited and heard a switchboard operator say good afternoon inland revenue rebus replaced the receiver with a guilty silence on tuesday morning leighton phoned the station rebus got in first you didnt tell me you were a taxman mr leighton what a taxman what does it matter what did it matter how many enemies could one taxman make rebus swallowed back the question he could always use a friend in her majestys inland revenue for personal as well as strictly professional use i know what youre thinking leighton was saying though rebus doubted it and its true that i work in the collectors office sending out the demands but my names never on the demands the inspector of taxes might be mentioned by name but im a lowly cog inspector even so you must write to people sometimes there might be somebody out there with a grudge ive given it some thought inspector it was my first thought but in any case i dont deal with edinburgh oh i deal with south london rebus noted that phoning from his place of work leighton was less nervoussounding he sounded cool detached he sounded like a tax collector south london but the letters had local postmarks another theory sealed under cover and posted into eternity no return address the reason im calling leighton was saying is that i had another letter this morning with a photo yes theres a photo and its difficult to explain i could come to the station at lunchtime dont bother yourself mr leighton ill come to the tax office all part of the service rebus was thinking of backhanders gifts from grateful members of the public all the pubs where he could be sure of a free drink chip shops that wouldnt charge for a feed all the times hed helped out for a favour the way those favours accumulated and were paid off tax forms asked you about tips received rebus always left the box blank had he always been accurate about amounts of bank interest more crucially several months ago he had started renting his flat to three students while he lived rentfree with dr patience aitken he had no intention of declaring well maybe he would it helped to know a friendly taxman someone who might soon owe him a favour thats very good of you inspector leighton was saying not at all sir only it all seems to have been a mistake anyway a mistake youll see when i show you the photograph rebus saw he saw a man and a woman in the foreground was a coffee table spread with bottles and glasses and cans an ashtray full to overflowing behind this a sofa and on the sofa a man and a woman lying along the sofa hugging one another the photographer had caught them like this their faces just beginning to turn towards the camera grinning and flushed with that familiar mix of alcohol and passion rebus had been to these sorts of party parties where the alcohol was necessary before there could be any passion behind the couple two men stood in animated conversation it was a good clear photo the work of a mm camera with either a decent flashgun or else no necessity for one and heres the letter said leighton they were seated on an uncomfortable spongy sofa in the tax offices reception area rebus had been hoping for a sniff behind the scenes but leighton worked in an openplan office with less privacy even than the reception area few members of the public ever visited the building and the receptionist was at the other end of the hallway staff wandered through on their way to the coffee machine or the snack dispenser the toilets or the postroom but otherwise this was as quiet as it got a bit longer than the others leighton said handing the letter over mr leighton here is the photo we have plenty more plus negatives cheap at the lot and your wife will never know the money should be in fives and tens nothing bigger put it in a william lows carrierbag and go to greyfriars kirkyard on friday at pm leave the bag behind greyfriars bobbys gravestone walk away photos and negatives will be sent to you not exactly the quietest spot for a handover rebus mused although the actual statue of greyfriars bobby sited just outside the kirkyard was more popular with tourists the gravestone was a popular enough stopoff the idea of leaving a bagful of money there surreptitiously was almost laughable but at least now the extortion was serious a time and place had been mentioned as well as a sum a sum to be left in a willie lows bag rebus more than ever doubted the blackmailers professionalism you see what i mean leighton said i can only think that if it isnt a joke then its a case of mistaken identity true enough leighton wasnt any of the three men in the photo not by any stretch of the will or imagination rebus concentrated on the woman she was small heavy somehow managing to fit into a dress two sizes too small for her it was black and short rumpled most of the way to her bum with plenty of cleavage at the other end she also wore black tights and black patentleather shoes but somehow rebus didnt think he was looking at a funeral i dont suppose he said this is your wife leighton actually laughed the sound of paper shredding thought not rebus said quietly he turned his attention to the man on the sofa the man whose arms were trapped beneath the weight of the smirking woman there was something about that face that hairstyle then it hit rebus and things started to make a little more sense i didnt recognise him at first he said thinking out loud you mean you know him rebus nodded slowly only ive never seen him smile before thats what threw me he studied the photo again then stabbed it with a finger the tip of his finger was resting on the face of one of the other men the two behind the sofa and i know him he said i can place him now leighton looked impressed rebus moved his finger on to the recumbent woman whats more i know her too i know her quite well leighton didnt look impressed now he looked startled perhaps even disbelieving three out of four rebus said not a bad score eh leighton didnt answer so rebus smiled reassuringly dont you worry sir ill take care of this you wont be bothered any more well thank you inspector rebus got to his feet all part of the service mr leighton who knows maybe youll be able to help me one of these days rebus sat at his desk reading the file then when he was satisfied he tapped into the computer and checked some details regarding a man who was doing a decent stretch in peterhead jail when hed finished there was a broad grin on his face an event unusual enough in itself to send dc siobhan clarke sauntering over in rebuss direction trying not to get too close fear of being hooked but close enough to register interest before she knew it rebus was reeling her in anyway get your coat he said she angled her head back towards her desk but im in the middle of youre in the middle of my catchment siobhan now fetch your coat never be nosy and always keep your head down somehow siobhan clarke hadnt yet learned those two golden rules of the easy life not that anything was easy when john rebus was in the office which was precisely why she liked working near him where are we going she said rebus told her on the way he also handed the file to her so she could read it through not guilty she said at last and im robbie coltrane said rebus they were both talking about a case from a few months before a veteran hard man had been charged with the attempted armed holdup of a security van there had been evidence as to his guilt just about enough evidence and his alibi had been shaky hed told police of having spent the day in question in a bar near his mothers home in muirhouse probably the citys most notorious housing scheme plenty of witnesses came forward to agree that he had been there all day these witnesses boasted names like tam the bam big shug the screwdriver and wild eck the look of them in the witnessbox police reasoned would be enough to convince the jury of the defendants guilt but there had been one other witness miss june redwood quoted dc clarke rereading the casenotes yes said rebus miss june redwood an innocent dressed in a solemn twopiece as she gave her evidence at the trial she was a social worker caring for the most desperate in edinburghs most desperate area needing to make a phone call and sensing shed have no luck with muirhouses few public kiosks she had walked into the castle arms probably the first female the regulars had seen in the saloon bar since the landlords wife had walked out on him fifteen years before shed asked to use the phone and a man had wandered over to her from a table and with a wink had asked if shed like a drink shed refused she could see hed had a few more than a few his table had the look of a lengthy session about it empty pint glasses placed one inside another to form a leaning tower ashtray brimming with butts and empty packets the newspapers racing page heavily marked in biro miss redwood had given a quietly detailed account at odds with the loud confident lies of the other defence witnesses and she was sure that shed walked into the bar at pm five minutes before the attack on the security van took place the prosecution counsel had tried his best gaining from the social worker the acknowledgement that she knew the accuseds mother through her work though the old woman was not actually her client the prosecutor had stared out at the fifteen jury members attempting without success to plant doubt in their minds june redwood was a rocksolid witness solid enough to turn a golden prosecution case into a verdict of not guilty the accused had walked free close as the fairground saying went but definitely no goldfish rebus had been in court for the verdict and had left with a shrug and a low growl a security guard lay in hospital suffering from shotgun wounds now the case would have to be looked at again if not by rebus then by some other poor bugger who would go through the same old steps knowing damned fine who the main suspect was and knowing that he was walking the streets and drinking in pubs and chuckling at his luck except that it wasnt luck it was planning as rebus now knew dc clarke finished her second reading of the file i suppose you checked on redwood at the time of course we did not married no boyfriends no proof not even the faintest rumour that she knew keith clarke looked at the photo and this is her its her and its him keith leyton and it was sent to it was addressed to a mr k leighton they didnt get the spelling right i checked in the phone book keith leytons exdirectory either that or he doesnt have a phone but our little tax collector is in there under k leighton and they sent the letters to him by mistake they must know keith leyton hangs out in muirhouse his mum lives in muirhouse crescent where does kenneth leighton live rebus grinned at the windscreen muir wood crescent only its not in muirhouse its in currie siobhan clarke smiled too i dont believe it she said rebus shrugged it happens they looked in the phone book thought the address looked right and started sending the letters so theyve been trying to blackmail a criminal and instead theyve found a taxman now rebus laughed outright they must be mad naïve or built like a hydroelectric station if theyd really tried this bampot caper on with leyton hed have dug a fresh grave or two in greyfriars for them ill give them one thing though whats that they know about keiths wife his wife rebus nodded she lives near the mum big woman jealous thats why keith would keep any girlfriend secret thats why hed want to keep her a secret the blackmailers must have thought that gave them a chance that hed cough up rebus stopped the car he had parked outside a block of flats in oxgangs the block was one of three each one shaped like a capital h lying on its face caerketton court rebus had once had a fling with a schooldinner lady who lived on the second floor i checked with june redwoods office he said shes off sick he craned his neck out of the window tenth floor apparently lets hope the lifts working he turned to siobhan otherwise well have to resort to the telephone the lift was working though barely rebus and siobhan ignored the wrapped paper parcel in one corner neither liked to think what it might contain still rebus was impressed that he could hold his breath for as long as the lift took to crackle its way up ten flights the tenth floor seemed all draughts and highpitched winds the building had a perceptible sway not quite like being at sea rebus pushed the bell of june redwoods flat and waited he pushed again siobhan was standing with her arms folded around her shuffling her feet id hate to see you on a football terrace in january said rebus there was a sound from inside the door then the door itself was opened by a woman with unwashed hair a tissue to her nose and wrapped in a thick dressinggown hello there miss redwood said rebus brightly remember me then he held up the photograph doubtless you remember him too can we come in they went in as they sat in the untidy livingroom it crossed siobhan clarkes mind that they had no way of proving when the photo was taken and without that they had nothing say the party had taken place after the trial it could well be that leyton and june redwood had met then in fact it made sense after his release leyton probably would want to throw a party and he would certainly want to invite the woman who had been his saviour she hoped rebus had thought of this she hoped he wasnt going to go too far as usual i dont understand said june redwood wiping her nose again come on june said rebus heres the proof you and keith together in a clinch the man you claimed at his trial was a complete stranger do you often get this comfortable with strangers this earned a thin smile from june redwood if so rebus continued you must invite me to one of your parties siobhan clarke swallowed hard yes the inspector was going to go too far had she ever doubted it youd be lucky said the social worker its been known said rebus he relaxed into his chair doesnt take a lot of working out does it he went on you must have met keith through his mum you became friends lets call it i dont know what his wife will call it blood started to tinge june redwoods neck you look better already said rebus at least ive put a bit of colour in your cheeks you met keith started going out with him it had to be kept secret though the only thing keith leyton fears is mrs keith leyton her names joyce said redwood rebus nodded so it is i could know that from the trial she snapped i wouldnt have to know him to know that rebus nodded again except that you were a witness june you werent in court when joyce leyton was mentioned her face now looked as though shed been lying out too long in the nonexistent sun but she had a trump card left that photo could have been taken any time siobhan held her breath yes this was the crunch rebus seemed to realise it too youre right there he said any time at all up to a month before keiths trial the room was quiet for a moment the wind found a gap somewhere and rustled a spiderplant near the window whistling as though through wellspaced teeth what said june redwood rebus held the photograph up again the man behind you the one with long hair and the tattoo uglylooking loon hes called mick mckelvin it must have been some party june when bruisers like keith and mick were invited theyre not exactly your cocktail crowd they think a canapés something you throw over a stolen car to keep it hidden rebus smiled at his own joke well someone had to what are you getting at mick went inside four weeks before keiths trial hes serving three years in peterhead persistent b and e so you see theres no way this party could have taken place after keiths trial not unless peterheads security has got a bit lax no it had to be before meaning you had to know him before the trial know what that means rebus sat forward june redwood wasnt wiping her nose with the tissue now she was hiding behind it and looking frightened it means you stood in the witnessbox and you lied just like keith told you to serious trouble june you might end up with your own social worker or even a prison visitor rebuss voice had dropped in volume as though june and he were having an intimate têteàtête over a candlelit dinner so i really think youd better help us and you can start by talking about the party lets start with the photograph eh the photo june redwood looked ready to weep the photo rebus echoed who took it did he take any other pics of the two of you after all at the moment youre looking at a jail sentence but if any photos like this one get to joyce leyton you might end up collecting signatures rebus waited for a moment until he saw that june didnt get it on your plaster casts he explained blackmail said rab mitchell he was sitting in the interview room and he was nervous rebus stood against one wall arms folded examining the scuffed toes of his black dr martens shoes hed only bought them three weeks ago they were hardly broken in the tough leather heelpieces had rubbed his ankles into raw blisters and already hed managed to scuff the toes he knew how hed done it too kicking stones as hed come out of june redwoods block of flats kicking stones for joy that would teach him not to be exuberant in future it wasnt good for your shoes blackmail mitchell repeated good echo in here rebus said to siobhan clarke who was standing by the door rebus liked having siobhan in on these interviews she made people nervous hard men brutal men they would swear and fume for a moment before remembering that a young woman was present a lot of the time she discomfited them and that gave rebus an extra edge but mitchell known to his associates as roscoe for no known reason would have been nervous anyway a man with a proud sixtyaday habit he had been stopped from lighting up by a tutting john rebus no smoking roscoe not in here what this is a nonsmoker what the fwhat are you blethering about just what i say roscoe no smoking five minutes later rebus had taken roscoes cigarettes from where they lay on the table and had used roscoes scottish bluebell matches to light one which he inhaled with great delight nonsmoker roscoe mitchell fairly yelped you said so yourself he was bouncing like a kid on the padded seat rebus exhaled again did i yes so i did oh well rebus took a third and final puff from the cigarette then stubbed it out underfoot leaving the longest most extravagant stub roscoe had obviously ever seen in his life he stared at it with open mouth then closed his mouth tight and turned his eyes to rebus what is it you want he said blackmail said john rebus blackmail good echo in here blackmail what the hell do you mean photos said rebus calmly you took them at a party four months ago whose party matt bennetts roscoe nodded rebus had placed the cigarettes back on the table roscoe couldnt take his eyes off them he picked up the box of matches and toyed with it i remember it he said a faint smile brilliant party he managed to stretch the word brilliant out to four distinct syllables so it really had been a good party you took some snaps youre right id just got a new camera i wont ask where from ive got a receipt roscoe nodded to himself i remember now the film was no good how do you mean i put it in for developing but none of the pictures came out not a one they reckoned id not put the film in the right way or opened the case or something the negatives were all blank they showed me them they at the shop i got a consolation free film some consolation thought rebus some swap to be more accurate he placed the photo on the table roscoe stared at it then picked it up the better to examine it how the remembering there was a woman present roscoe swallowed the rest of the question here said rebus pushing the pack of cigarettes in his direction you look like you need one of these rebus sent siobhan clarke and ds brian holmes to pick up keith leyton he also advised them to take along a backup you never could tell with a nutter like leyton plenty of backup just to be on the safe side it wasnt just leyton after all there might be joyce to deal with too meantime rebus drove to tollcross parked just across the traffic lights tight in at a bus stop and watched by a frowning queue made a dash for the photographic shops doorway it was chucking it down no question the queue had squeezed itself so tightly under the metal awning of the bus shelter that vice might have been able to bring them up on a charge of public indecency rebus shook water from his hair and pushed open the shops door inside it was light and warm he shook himself again and approached the counter a young man beamed at him yes sir i wonder if you can help said rebus ive got a film needs developing only i want it done in an hour is that possible no problem sir is it colour yes thats fine then we do our own processing rebus nodded and reached into his pocket the man had already begun filling in details on a form he printed the letters very neatly rebus noticed with pleasure thats good said rebus bringing out the photo in that case you must have developed this the man went very still and very pale dont worry son im not from keith leyton in fact keith leyton doesnt know anything about you which is just as well for you the young man rested the pen on the form he couldnt take his eyes off the photograph better shut up shop now said rebus youre coming down to the station you can bring the rest of the photos with you oh and id wear a cagoule its not exactly fair is it not exactly and take a tip from me son next time you think of blackmailing someone make sure you get the right person eh rebus tucked the photo back into his pocket plus if youll take my advice dont use words like reprint in your blackmail notes nobody says reprint except people like you rebus wrinkled his nose it just makes it too easy for us you see thanks for the warning the man said coolly all part of the service said rebus with a smile the clue had actually escaped him throughout not that hed be admitting as much to kenneth leighton no he would tell the story as though hed been sherlock holmes and philip marlowe rolled into one doubtless leighton would be impressed and one day when rebus was needing a favour from the taxman he would know he could put kenneth leighton in the frame the confession it was tonys idea he says shifting in his seat tonys my brother a couple of years younger than me but he was always the brainy one it was all his idea i just went along with it hes still trying to get comfortable its not easy to get comfortable in the interview room the cid man could tell him that he could tell him that the chair hes wriggling in has been modified ever so slightly a quarterinch taken off its front legs the chair isnt designed with rest and relaxation in mind so tony says to me one day he says ian this is one plan that cannot fail and he tells me about it we spend a bit of time bouncing it around you know me trying to pick holes in it i have to admit it looked pretty good well thats the problem really thats why im here it was just too bloody good all round he looks around again studying the walls as if expecting twoway mirrors secret listening devices the one thing hes not been expecting is the quietness its eleventhirty on a weekday night the police station is like a ghost town he wants to see lots of activity lots of uniforms yet again in his life hes being let down tony had noticed the sliproad he drove from fife to edinburgh most saturday nights taking a carful of friends they went to pubs and clubs danced chatted up women a latenight pizza and maybe a couple of espressos before home tony didnt drink he didnt mind staying sober while everyone around him had a skinful he always liked to be in control on the a south of the forth road bridge hed seen the signpost for the sliproad hed seen it before mustve passed it a hundred times but this one night something about it bothered him the next morning he headed back the sign said department of transport vehicle check area only he took the sliproad found himself at a sort of roundabout in the middle of nowhere he stopped his car and got out there was grass growing in the middle of the road he didnt think the place got used much a hut nearby and a metal ramp that might have been a weighbridge another sliproad led back down on to the a he stood there for a while listening to the rush of traffic below him an idea slowly forming in his head see ian went on tony had worked for a time as a security guard and he still had a couple of uniforms hanging in his wardrobe hes always had the idea of robbing someplace always knew those uniforms would come in handy one of his pals guy called malc he works i should say worked in a printing shop so tony brought malc in said we could trust him have you got a cigarette the detective points to the no smoking sign but then relents hands over a packet of ten and some matches thanks so you see lighting up exhaling noisily it was all tonys idea and malc had a certain expertise too i didnt have anything it was just that i was family so tony knew he could trust me i havent worked in eight years used to be in heavy engineering up in leven got laid off in the slump if somebody could do something about the manufacturing industry in this country thered be a lot less crime bit of advice there free of charge he flicks ash into the ashtray brushes some stray flecks from his trousers im not saying i didnt play a part obviously i wouldnt be here otherwise i just want it on record that i wasnt the brains of the operation i think i can go along with that the detective says ian asks him if he shouldnt be taking notes or something were trained lad elephants memory so ian nods goes on with his story the interview room is small and airless it carries the aromas of every person whos ever been through it all of them telling their stories a few of them even turning out to be true so we make a few recces and never once do we see the place being used we stopped the car on the sliproad a few nights plenty of lorries steaming past but nobody so much as notices us or asks what were up to this is what tony wanted to know we set the thing up for last wednesday why a wednesday the detective asks ian just shrugs tonys idea he says all i did was go along with him he was the mastermind thats the word ive been wanting mastermind he shifts again in his chair stares at the walls again remembering wednesday night tony and ian were dressed in the uniforms tony had a friend with a haulage truck it had been easy to borrow it for the night the story was they were helping someone move house malc had come up with ids for them theyd had their photos taken at a passport booth and the laminated cards each in its own wallet looked authentic they took the truck up to the roundabout left the car near the bottom of the sliproad malc was dressed in a leather jacket and baseball cap he was supposed to be a truck driver tony would head back down the ramp and use a torch to signal a lorry on to the sliproad then hed ask the driver to go to the test area where ian would be apparently interviewing another lorrydriver this was so the real driver wouldnt suspect anything it worked ian says thats whats so unbelievable first lorry he stopped the driver brought it up to the roundabout stopped it and got out tony comes driving up gets out of his car asks to see the delivery note then says he wants to check the cargo the detective has a question what if it turned out to be cabbages or fish or something first thing tony asked was what they were carrying if it had been something we couldnt sell hed have let them go but we came up gold at the first attempt washing machines two dozen of them at three hundred quid apiece only problem was by the time wed squeezed them into our own lorry wed no room for anything else and we were creamcrackered anyway otherwise i think we could have kept going all night ian pauses youre wondering about the driver arent you there were three of us remember all we did was tie him up leave him in his cab we knew hed get himself free eventually quiet up there we didnt want him starving to death and off we went with the haul we had about fifteen of the machines and were already thinking of who we could sell them to storage was no problem tony had a couple of lockups we left them there theres a local villain name of andy horrigan he runs a couple of pubs and cafés so i thought maybe hed be in the market we were being careful see once the news was out that someone had boosted a consignment of washerdryers well we had to be careful who we sold to he pauses only wed already made that one fatal mistake one mistake he asks for another cigarette his hand is shaking as he lights it he cant get it out of his head the insane bad luck of it even before hed had a chance to say anything to andy horrigan horrigan had something to ask him here ian heard anything about a heist washerdryers nicked from the back of a lorry i didnt see anything in the papers ian had replied quite honestly too it had surprised them the way there had been nothing in the press or on the radio and tv ian could see horrigan was bursting to tell him he knew right away it couldnt be good news not coming from horrigan it wasnt in the papers never will be neither and as hed gone on to explain it ian had felt his life ebb away hed run to the lockup finding tony there tony already knew it was written on his face he knew they had to get rid of the machines dump them somewhere but that meant getting another lorry from somewhere hang on though tony had said his brain slipping into gear eddie hart isnt after the machines is he he only wants whats his eddie hart at mention of the name ian could feel his knees buckling steady eddie was the dundee godfather a man with an almost mythical status as mover and shaker entrepreneur and hammerwielding maniac if you crossed steady eddie he got out his carpentry nails and according to the local word eddie was absolutely furious hed probably put a lot of thought into the scheme he needed to move drugs around and had hit on the idea of hiding them inside white goods after all a lorryload of washerdryers or fridgefreezers they could saunter up and down every motorway in the country all you needed were some fake dockets listing origin and destination it just so happened that tony had hit on one of eddies drivers and now eddie was out for blood but tony was right if they handed back the dope got it back to eddie somehow maybe theyd be allowed to live maybe it would be all right so they started tearing the packing from the machines unscrewing the back of each to search behind the drum for hidden packages and when that failed they emptied out each machines complimentary packet of washing powder they went through both lockups they checked and doublechecked every machine and found nothing ian thought maybe the stuff had been hidden in one of the machines theyd left behind use your loaf his brother told him if that were true why would he be after us wait a minute though and he went back counting the machines there was one missing the brothers looked at one another headed for tonys car at malcs mothers house malc had just plumbed the machine in the old twintub was out on the front path waiting to be junked malcs mother was rubbing her hands over the front of her new washerdryer telling the neighbours whod gathered in the kitchen what a good laddie her son was saved up and bought it as a surprise even ian knew that they were in real trouble now everyone in town would get to hear about the new washing machine and word would most definitely travel they took malc outside explained the situation to him he went back indoors and manoeuvred the machine out of its cubbyhole explaining that hed forgotten to remove the transit bolts his hands were trembling so much he kept dropping the screwdriver but at last he had the back of the machine off and started handing brownpaper packages to tony and ian tony explained to the neighbours that they were weights to stop the machine slipping and sliding when it was in the back of the lorry like bricks one neighbour asked and when he agreed with her sweat pouring down his face she added a further question why cover bricks in brown paper tony beyond explanations put his head in his hands and wept the detective brings back two beakers of coffee one for himself one for ian hes been checking up using the computer making a couple of phone calls ian sits ready to tell him the last of it we couldnt just hand the stuff back had to think of a way to do it so we drove up to dundee night before last steady eddie has a nightclub we put the stuff in one of the skips at the back of the club then phoned the club and told them where they could find it thing is the club gets its rubbish collected privately and the company works at night so that night the skip got emptied well that wouldnt have mattered only only it was me made the call and there were two numbers in the phonebook instead of the office id got through to the public phone on the wall beside the bar it must have been some punter who answered i just said my piece then hung up i dont know maybe they nipped outside and got the stuff for themselves maybe they didnt hear me or thought i was drunk or something his voice is choking hes close to tears mr hart didnt get the stuff the detective guesses ian nods agreement and now your brother and malc have gone missing eddie got them he must have done and you want us to protect you witness relocation you can do that cant you i mean theres a price on my head now youve got to the detective nods we can do it he says but what exactly is it youre a witness to theres no record of a lorry being hijacked nobodys reported such a loss you dont seem to have any evidence linking mr hart to anything illegal much as id love it if you did the detective draws his chair closer it wasnt a slump that led to you losing your job ian it was threatening your foreman he didnt like your attitude and you started spinning him some story about having a brother whos a terrorist and whod stick a bomb under his car you scared the poor man half to death until he found out the truth see ive got all of that in the files ian what i dont have is anything about washing machines drugs wrapped in brown paper or missing persons ian leaps from his seat begins pacing the room you could send a team out to the dump if the drugs are there theyll find them or or go to the lockups the washing machines will still be there unless steady eddies taken them i wouldnt put it past him dont you see im the only one left who can testify against him the detective is on his feet now too i think its time you were off son ill see you as far as the door i need protection the detective comes up to him again their faces are inches apart get your brother the terrorist to protect you his names billy isnt it only you cant do that can you because you havent got a brother called billy or a brother called tony if it comes to that the detective pauses you havent got anybody ian youre a nobody these stories of yours thats all they are stories come on now its time you were home your mum will be worrying she got a new washing machine last week ian says softly the man who delivered it he said sorry for being so late hed been stopped at a checkpoint it is quiet in the interview room quiet for a long time until ian begins weeping weeping for the brother hes just lost again the hanged man the killer wandered through the fairground it was a travelling fair and this was its first night in kirkcaldy it was a thursday evening in april the fair wouldnt get really busy until the weekend by which time it would be missing one of its minor if wellestablished attractions hed already made one recce past the small white caravan with its chalkboard outside pinned to the board were a couple of faded letters from satisfied customers a doublestep led to the bead curtain the door was tied open with baling twine he didnt think there was anyone in there with her if there was shed have closed the door but all the same he wanted to be careful care was his byword he called himself a killer which was to say that if anyone had asked him what he did for a living he wouldnt have used any other term he knew some in the profession thought assassin had a more glamorous ring to it hed looked it up in a dictionary found it was to do with some old religious sect and derived from an old arabic word meaning eater of hashish he didnt believe in drugs himself not so much as a half of lager before the job some people preferred to call it a hit which made them hit men but he didnt hit people he killed them stone dead and there were other more obscure euphemisms but the bottom line was he was a killer and for today the fair was his place of work his hunting ground not that it had taken a magic ball to find the subject shed be in that caravan right now waiting for a punter hed give it ten more minutes just so he could be sure she wasnt with someone not a punter necessarily maybe sharing a cuppa with a fellow traveller ten minutes if no one came out or went in hed make himself her next and final customer of course if she was a real astrologer shed know he was coming and would have hightailed it out of town but he thought she was here he knew she was he pretended to watch three youths on the firing range they made the elementary mistake of aiming along the barrel the sights of course had been skewed probably the barrel too and if they thought they were going to dislodge one of the moving targets by hitting it well best think again those targets would be weighted reinforced the odds were always on the side of the showman the market stretched along the waterfront there was a stiff breeze making some of the wooden structures creak people pushed hair out of their eyes or tucked chins into the collars of their jackets the place wasnt busy but it was busy enough he didnt stand out nothing memorable about him at all his jeans lumberjack shirt and trainers were work clothes at home he preferred a bit more style but he was a long way from home today his base was on the west coast just down the clyde from glasgow he didnt know anything about fife at all kirkcaldy what little hed seen of it wouldnt be lingering in his memory hed been to towns all over scotland and the north of england in his mind they formed a geography of violence in carlisle hed used a knife making it look like a drunken saturday brawl in peterhead it had been a blow on the head and strangulation with orders that the body shouldnt ever be found a grand and a half to a fishingboat captain had seen to that in airdrie arbroath ardrossan he didnt always kill sometimes all that was needed was a brutal and public message in those cases he became the postman delivering the message to order he moved from the shooting range to another stall where children tried to attach hoops to the prizes on a carousel they were faring little better than their elders next door no surprise with most of the prizes ohsoslightly exceeding the circumference of each hoop when he checked his watch he was surprised to find that the ten minutes had passed a final look around and he climbed the steps tapped at the open door and parted the bead curtain come in love she said gypsy rosa the sign outside called her palms read your fortune foretold yet here she was waiting for him close the door she instructed he saw that the twine holding it open was looped over a bent nail he loosed it and closed the door the curtains were shut which was ideal for his purpose and lacking any light from outside the interior glowed from the halfdozen candles spaced around it the surfaces had been draped with lengths of cheap black cloth there was a black cloth over the table too with patterns of sun and moon embroidered into it and there she sat gesturing for him to squeeze his large frame into the banquette opposite he nodded he smiled he looked at her she was middleaged her face lined and rouged shed been a looker in younger days he could see that but scarlet lipstick now made her mouth look too large and moist she wore black muslin over her head a gold band holding it in place her costume looked authentic enough black lace red silk with astrological signs sewn into the arms on the table sat a crystal ball covered for now with a white handkerchief the red fingernails of one hand tapped against a tarot deck she asked him his name is that necessary he asked she shrugged it helps sometimes they were like blind dates alone in a restaurant the world outside ceasing to matter her eyes twinkled in the candlelight my names mort he told her she repeated the name seeming amused by it short for morton my father was born there its also the french for death she added i didnt know he lied she was smiling theres a lot you dont know mort thats why youre here a palmreading is it what else do you offer the ball she nodded towards it the cards he asked which she would recommend in turn she asked if this was his first visit to a psychic healer that was what she called herself a psychic healer because i heal souls she added by way of explanation im not sure i need healing he argued oh my dear we all need some kind of healing were none of us whole look at you for example he straightened in his chair becoming aware for the first time that she was holding his right hand palm upwards her fingers stroking his knuckles she looked down at the palm frowned a little in concentration youre a visitor arent you dear yes here on business id say yes he was studying the palm with her as though trying to read its foreign words mmm she began running the tip of one finger down the welldefined lines which crisscrossed his palm not ticklish she chuckled he allowed her the briefest of smiles looking at her face he noticed it seemed softer than it had when hed first entered the caravan he revised her age downwards felt slight pressure as she seemed to squeeze his hand as if acknowledging the compliment doing all right for yourself though she informed him i mean moneywise no problems there no dear your problems all stem from your particular line of work my work youre not as relaxed about it as you used to be time was you wouldnt have considered doing anything else easy money but it doesnt feel like that any more does it it felt warm in the caravan stuffy with no air getting in and all those candles burning there was the metal weight pressed to his groin the weight hed always found so reassuring in times past he told himself she was using cheap psychology his accent wasnt local he wore no wedding ring his hands were clean and manicured you could tell a lot about someone from such details shouldnt we agree a price first he asked why should we do that dear im not a prostitute am i he felt his ears reddening and besides you can afford it we both know you can whats the point of letting money get in the way she was holding his hand in an ever tighter grip she had strength this one hed bear that in mind when the time came he wouldnt play around wouldnt string out her suffering a quick squeeze of the trigger i get the feeling she said youre wondering why youre here would that be right i know exactly why im here what here with me or here on this planet living the life youve chosen either both he spoke a little too quickly could feel his pulserate rising he had to get it down again had to be calm when the time came part of him said do it now but another part said hear her out he wriggled trying to get comfortable what i meant though she went on is youre not sure any more why you do what you do youve started to ask questions she looked up at him the line of business youre in i get the feeling youre just supposed to do what youre told is that right he nodded no talking back no questions asked you just do your work and wait for payday i get paid upfront arent you the lucky one she chuckled again but the moneys not enough is it it can never recompense for not being happy or fulfilled i could have got that from my girlfriends cosmopolitan she smiled then clapped her hands id like to try you with the cards are you game is that what that is a game you have your fun with words dear euphemisms thats all words are he tried not to gasp it was as if shed read his mind from earlier all those euphemisms for killer she wasnt paying him any heed was busy shuffling the outsized tarot deck she asked him to touch the deck three times then she laid out the top three cards ah she said her fingers caressing the first one le soleil it means the sun i know what it means he snapped she made a pout with her lips i thought you didnt know any french he was stuck for a moment theres a picture of the sun right there on the card he said finally she nodded slowly his breathing had quickened again second card she said death himself la mort interesting that the french give it the feminine gender he looked at the picture of the skeleton it was grinning doing a little jig on the ground beside it sat a lantern and an hourglass the candle in the lantern had been snuffed out the sand in the hourglass had all fallen through dont worry she said it doesnt always portend a death thats a relief he said with a smile the final card is intriguing the hanged man it can signify many things she lifted it up so he could see it and the three together he asked curious now she held her hands as if in prayer im not sure she said at last an unusual conjunction to be sure death and the hanged man a suicide maybe she shrugged is the sex important i mean the fact that it is a man she shook her head he licked his lips maybe the ball would help he suggested she looked at him her eyes reflecting light from the candles you might be right and she smiled shall we as if they were not prospective lovers now but children and the crystal ball little more than an illicit dare as she pulled the small glass globe towards them he shifted again the pistol barrel was chafing his thigh he rubbed his jacket pocket the one containing the silencer he would have to hit her first just to quiet her while he fitted the silencer to the gun slowly she lifted the handkerchief from the ball as if raising the curtain on some miniaturised stageshow she leaned forward peering into the glass giving him a view of crêped cleavage her hands flitted over the ball not quite touching it had he been a gerontophile there would have been a hint of the erotic to the act dont you go thinking that she snapped then seeing the startled look on his face she winked the ball often makes things clearer what was i thinking he blurted out you want me to say it out loud he shook his head looked into the ball saw her face reflected there stretched and distorted and floating somewhere within was his own face too surrounded by licking flames what do you see he asked needing to know now i see a man who is asking why he is here one person has the answer but he has yet to ask this person he is worried about the thing he must do rightly worried in my opinion she looked up at him again her eyes were the colour of polished oak tiny veins of blood seemed to pulse in the whites he jerked back in his seat you know dont you of course i know mort he nearly overturned the table as he got to his feet pulling the gun from his waistband how he asked who told you she shook her head not looking at the gun apparently not interested in it it would happen one day the moment you walked in i felt it was you youre not afraid it was a statement rather than a question of course im afraid but she didnt look it and a little sad too he had the silencer out of his pocket but was having trouble coordinating his hands hed practised a hundred times in the dark and had never had this trouble before hed had victims like her though the ones who accepted who were maybe even a little grateful you know who wants you dead he asked she nodded i think so i may have gotten the odd fortune wrong but ive made precious few enemies in my life hes a rich man very rich she conceded not all of it honest money and im sure hes well used to getting what he wants she slid the ball away brought out the cards again and began shuffling them so ask me your question he was screwing the silencer on to the end of the barrel the pistol was loaded he only had to slide the safety off he licked his lips again so hot in here so dry why he asked why does he want a fortuneteller dead she got up made to open the curtains no he commanded pointing the gun at her sliding off the safety keep them closed afraid to shoot me in daylight when he didnt answer she pulled open one curtain then blew out the candles he kept the pistol trained on her a head shot quick and always fatal ill tell you she said sliding into her seat again she motioned for him to sit after a moments hesitation he did so the pistol steady in his right hand wisps of smoke from the extinguished candles rose either side of her we were young when we met she began i was already working in a fairground not this one one night he decided there had been enough of a courtship she looked deep into his eyes his own oakcoloured eyes oh yes hes used to getting what he wants you know what im saying she went on quietly there was no question of consent i tried to have the baby in secret but its hard to keep secrets from a man like him a man with money someone people fear my baby was stolen from me i began travelling then and ive been travelling ever since but always with my ear to the ground always hearing things her eyes were liquid now you see i knew a time would come when my baby would grow old enough to begin asking questions and i knew the babys father would not want the truth to come out she reached out a shaking hand reached past the gun to touch his cheek i just didnt think hed be so cruel cruel so cruel as to send his own son our son to do his killing he shot to his feet again banged his fists against the wall of the caravan rested his head there and screwed shut his eyes the oakcoloured eyes mirrors of her own which had told her all shed needed to know hed left the pistol on the table she lifted it surprised by its weight and turned it in her hand ill kill him he groaned i swear ill kill him for this with a smile she slid the safety catch on placed the gun back on the table when he turned back to her blinking away tears she looked quite calm almost serene as if her faith in him had been rewarded at last in her hand she was holding a tarot card the hanged man it will need to look like an accident she said either that or suicide outside the screams of frightened children waltzers and big wheel and ghost train one of his hands fell lightly on hers the other reaching for his pistol mother he said with all the tenderness his parched soul could muster window of opportunity an inspector rebus story bernie fews jailbreaks were an art and over the years he had honed his art his escapes from prison his shrugging off of guards and prison officers his vanishing acts were the stuff of lightsout stories in jails the length and breadth of scotland he was called the greaseman the blink and many other names including the obvious houdini and the notsoobvious claude claude rains having starred as the original invisible man bernie few was beautiful as a petty thief he was hopeless but after capture he started to show his real prowess he wasnt made for being a housebreaker but he surely did shine as a jailbreaker hed stuffed himself into rubbish bags and mail sacks taken the place of a corpse from one prison hospital squeezed his wiry frame out of impossibly small windows sometimes buttering his naked torso in preparation and crammed himself into ventilation shafts and heating ducts but bernie few had a problem once hed scaled the high walls waded through sewers sprinted from the prison bus or cracked his guard across the head once hed done all this and was outside again breathing free air and melting into the crowd his movements were like clockwork all his ingenuity seemed to be exhausted the prison psychologists put it differently they said he wanted to be caught really it was a game to him but to detective inspector john rebus it was more than a game it was a chance for a drink bernie would do three things one hed go throw a rock through his exwifes livingroom window two hed stand in the middle of princes street telling everyone to go to hell and other places besides and three hed get drunk in scotts bar these days option one was difficult for bernie since his exwife had not only moved without leaving a forwarding address but had at rebuss suggestion gone to live on the eleventh floor of an oxgangs tower block no more rocks through the livingroom window unless bernie was handy with ropes and crampons rebus preferred to wait for bernie in scotts bar where they refused to water down either the whisky or the language scotts was a villains pub one of the ropiest in edinburgh rebus recognised half the faces in the place even on a dull wednesday afternoon bail faces appeal faces they recognised him too but there wasnt going to be any trouble every one of them knew why he was here he hoisted himself on to a barstool and lit a cigarette the tv was on showing a satellite sports channel cricket some test between england and the west indies it is a popular fallacy that the scots dont watch cricket edinburgh pub drinkers will watch anything especially if england are involved more especially if england are odds on to get a drubbing scotts as depressing a watering hole as you could ever imagine had transported itself to the caribbean for the occasion then the door to the toilets opened with a nervejarring squeal and a man loped out he was tall and skinny looselimbed hair falling over his eyes he had a hand on his fly just checking prior to departure and his eyes were on the floor see youse then he said to nobody opening the front door to leave nobody responded the door stayed open longer than it should someone else was coming in eyes flashed from the tv for a moment rebus finished his drink and rose from the stool he knew the man whod just left the bar he knew him well he knew too that what had just happened was impossible the new customer a small man with a handful of coins had a voice hoarse from shouting as he croakily ordered a pint the barman didnt move instead he looked to rebus who was looking at bernie few then bernie few looked at rebus been down to princes street bernie rebus asked bernie few sighed and rubbed his tired face time for a short one mr rebus rebus nodded he could do with another himself anyway he had a couple of things on his mind neither of them bernie few police officers love and hate surveillance operations in more or less equal measure theres the tedium but even that beats being tied to a cid desk often on a stakeout theres a good spirit plus theres that adrenal rush when something eventually happens the present surveillance was based in a secondfloor tenement flat the owners having been packed off to a seaside caravan for a fortnight if the operation needed longer than a fortnight theyd be sent to stay with relations the watchers worked in twoman teams and twelvehour shifts they were watching the secondfloor flat of the tenement across the road they were keeping tabs on a bandit called ribs mackay he was called ribs because he was so skinny he had a heroin habit and paid for it by pushing drugs only hed never been caught at it a state of affairs edinburgh cid were keen to rectify the problem was since the surveillance had begun ribs had been keeping his head down he stayed in the flat nipping out only on brief sorties to the corner shop hed buy beer vodka milk cigarettes sometimes breakfast cereal or a jar of peanut butter and hed always top off his purchases with half a dozen bars of chocolate that was about it there had to be more but there wasnt any more any day now the operation would be declared dead in the water they tried to keep the flat clean but you couldnt help a bit of untidiness you couldnt help nosy neighbours either everyone on the stairwell wondered who the strangers in the tully residence were some asked questions some didnt need to be told rebus met an old man on the stairs he was hauling a bag of shopping up to the third floor stopping for a breather at each step help you with that rebus offered i can manage it wouldnt be any bother i said i can manage rebus shrugged suit yourself then he climbed to the landing and gave the recognised knock on the door of the tullys flat dc jamphlar opened the door a crack saw rebus and pulled it all the way open rebus nipped inside here he said handing over a paper bag doughrings thank you sir said jamphlar in the cramped livingroom dc connaught was sitting on a dining chair at the net curtain peering through the net and out of the window rebus joined him for a moment ribs mackays window was grimy but you could see through the grime into an ordinarylooking livingroom not that ribs came to the window much connaught wasnt concentrating on the window he was ranging between the secondfloor window and the groundfloor door if ribs left the flat jamphlar went haring after him while connaught followed ribss progress from the window and reported via radio to his colleague initially thered been one man in the flat and one in a car at street level but the man at street level hadnt been needed and looked suspicious anyway the street was no main thoroughfare but a conduit between clerk street and buccleuch street there were a few shops at road level but they carried the look of permanent closure connaught glanced up from the window afternoon sir what brings you here any sign of him rebus said not so much as a tweet i reckon i know why that is your birds already flown no chance said jamphlar biting into a doughring i saw him half an hour ago in scotts bar thats a fair hike from here mustve been his double but rebus shook his head when was the last time you saw him jamphlar checked the notebook we havent seen him this shift but this morning cooper and sneddon watched him go to the corner shop and come back that was sevenfifteen and you come on at eight yes sir and you havent seen him since theres someone in there connaught persisted ive seen movement rebus spoke slowly but you havent seen ribs mackay and i have hes out on the street doing whatever he does he leaned closer to connaught come on son what is it been skiving off half an hour down the pub a bit of a thirstquencher catching some kip on the sofa looks comfortable that sofa jamphlar was trying to swallow a mouthful of dough which had become suddenly dry weve been doing our job he said spraying crumbs connaught just stared at rebus with burning eyes rebus believed those eyes all right he conceded so theres another explanation a back exit a convenient drainpipe the back doors been bricked up connaught said stiffly theres a drainpipe but ribs couldnt manage down it how do you know i know connaught stared out through the curtain something else then maybe hes using a disguise jamphlar still chewing flicked through the notebook everyone who comes out and goes in is checked off hes a druggie said connaught hes not bright enough to fool us well son thats just what hes doing youre watching an empty flat tvs just come on said connaught rebus looked out through the curtain sure enough he could see the animated screen i hate this programme connaught muttered i wish hed change the channel maybe he cant said rebus making for the door he returned to the surveillance that evening taking someone with him thered been a bit of difficulty getting things arranged nobody was keen for him to walk out of the station with bernie few but rebus would assume full responsibility damned right you will said his boss signing the form jamphlar and connaught were off cooper and sneddon were on whats this i hear cooper said opening the door to rebus and his companion about ribs no said cooper about you bringing the day shift a selection of patisseries come and take a look sneddon called rebus walked over to the window the light was on in ribss livingroom and the blinds werent shut ribs had opened the window and was looking down on to the nighttime street enjoying a cigarette see sneddon said i see said rebus then he turned to bernie few come over here bernie few came shuffling over to the window and rebus explained the whole thing to him bernie thought about it rasping a hand over his chin then asked the same questions rebus had earlier asked jamphlar and connaught then he thought about it some more staring out through the curtain you keep an eye on the secondfloor window he asked cooper thats right and the main door yes you ever think of looking anywhere else cooper didnt get it neither did sneddon go on bernie said rebus look at the top floor bernie few suggested rebus looked he saw a cracked and begrimed window covered with ragged bits of cardboard think anyone lives there bernie asked what are you saying i think hes done a proper switch on you turned the tables like he smiled youre not watching ribs mackay hes watching you rebus nodded quick to get it the change of shifts bernie was nodding too theres that minute or two when one shifts going off and the others coming on a window of opportunity bernie agreed he watches sees the new shift arrive and skips downstairs and out the door and twelve hours later said rebus he waits in the street till he sees the next shift clocking on then he nips back in sneddon was shaking his head but the lights the telly timer switches bernie few answered casually you think you see people moving about in there maybe you do but not ribs could just be shadows a breeze blowing the curtains sneddon frowned who are you an expert witness rebus said patting bernie fews shoulder then he turned to sneddon im going over there keep an eye on bernie here and i mean keep an eye on him as in dont let him out of your sight sneddon blinked then stared at bernie youre buttery bernie bernie shrugged accepting the nickname rebus was already leaving he went to the bar at the streets far corner and ordered a whisky he sluiced his mouth out with the stuff so that it would be heavy on his breath then came out of the bar and weaved his way towards ribs mackays tenement just another soak trying to find his way home he tugged his jacket over to one side and undid a couple of buttons on his shirt he could do this act sometimes he did it too well he got drunk on the method he pushed open the tenement door and was in a dimly lit hallway with worn stone steps curving up he grasped the banister and started to climb he didnt even pause at the second floor but he could hear music from behind ribss door and he saw the door was reinforced just the kind dealers fitted it gave them those vital extra seconds when the drug squad came calling sledgehammers and axes their invitations seconds were all you needed to flush evidence away or to swallow it these days prior to a house raid the drugs squad opened up the sewers and had a man stationed there ready for the flush on the topfloor landing rebus paused for breath the door facing him looked hard done by scarred and chipped and beaten the nameplate had been hauled off leaving deep screw holes in the wood rebus knocked on the door ready with excuses and his drunks headdown stance he waited but there was no answer he listened then put his eyes to the letterbox darkness he tried the door handle it turned and the door swung inwards when he thought about it an unlocked door made sense ribs would need to come and go in a hurry and locks took time rebus stepped quietly into the short hallway some of the interior doors were open bringing with them chinks of streetlight the place smelt musty and damp and it was cold there was no furniture and the wallpaper had peeled from the walls long strips now lay in wrinkled piles like an old womans stockings come to rest at her ankles rebus walked on tiptoe he didnt know how good the floors were and he didnt want anyone below to hear him he didnt want ribs mackay to hear him he went into the livingroom it was identical in shape to the surveillance livingroom there were newspapers on the floor a carpet rolled up against one wall tufts of carpet lay scattered across the floor mice had obviously been taking bits for nesting rebus went to the window there was a small gap where two pieces of cardboard didnt quite meet through this gap he had a good view of the surveillance flat and though the lights were off the streetlight illuminated the net curtain so that anyone behind the curtain who moved became a shadow puppet someone sneddon or cooper or bernie few was moving just now you clever little runt rebus whispered then he picked something up off the floor it was a singlelens reflex camera with telephoto lens attached not the sort of thing you found lying in abandoned flats he picked it up and focused on the window across the street there was absolutely no doubt in his mind now it was so simple ribs sneaked up here watched the surveillance through the telephoto while they thought they were watching him and at eight oclock walked smartly out of the tenement and went about his business youre as good as gold bernie said rebus then he put the camera back just the way hed found it and tiptoed back through the flat where is he stupid question considering sneddon just shrugged he had to use the bathroom of course he did said rebus sneddon led him through to the bathroom it had a small window high on one wall the window was open it led not to the outside but merely back into the hall near the flats stairwell door he was in here a while so i came looking banged on the door no answer managed to force the thing open but he wasnt here sneddons face and neck were red with embarrassment or maybe it was just the exercise i ran downstairs but there was no sign of him i dont believe he could have squeezed out of that window rebus said sceptically not even bernie few the window was about twelve inches by nine it could be reached by standing on the rim of the bath but the walls were white tile and rebus couldnt see any signs of scuff marks he looked at the toilet its lid was down but didnt sit level with the pan rebus lifted the lid and found himself staring at towels several of them stuffed down into the pan what the sneddon couldnt believe his eyes but rebus could he opened the small airing cupboard beneath the sink it was empty a shelf had been lifted out and placed upright in the back of the cupboard there was just about room inside to make for a hiding place rebus smiled at the disbelieving sneddon he waited till youd gone downstairs then what said sneddon you mean hes still in the flat rebus wondered no he said at last shaking his head but think of what he just told us about how ribs was tricking us he led sneddon out of the flat but instead of heading down he climbed up a further flight to the top floor set into the ceiling was a skylight and it too was open a walk across the rooftops said rebus sneddon just shook his head sorry sir he offered never mind said rebus knowing however that his boss would at seven next morning ribs mackay left his flat and walked jauntily to the corner shop followed by sneddon then he walked back again enjoying a cigarette not a care in the world hed shown himself to the surveillance team and now they had something to tell the new shift something to occupy them during the changeover as usual the changeover happened at eight and exactly a minute after jamphlar and connaught entered the tenement the door across the street opened and ribs mackay flew out rebus and sneddon snug in rebuss car watched him go then sneddon got out to follow him he didnt look back at rebus but he did wave an acknowledgement that his superior had been right rebus hoped sneddon was better as a tail than he was as a watcher he hoped theyd catch ribs with the stuff on him dealing it out perhaps or taking delivery from his own supplier that was the plan that had been the plan throughout he started the ignition and drove out on to buccleuch street scotts bar was an early opener and john rebus had an appointment there he owed bernie few a drink the serpents back this was mind you back in or edinburgh was a better place then nothing ever happens here now but back then back then everything was happening back then a caddie was indispensable if you happened to be visiting the town if you wanted someone found if a message needed delivering if you wanted a bed for the night fresh oysters a shirtmaker or the local hoor you came to a caddie and if the claret got the better of you a caddie would see you safely home see the town wasnt safe lord no the streets were mean the highfalutin were leaving the old town and crossing the nor loch to the new they lived in princes street and george street or did until they could no longer stand the stench the old loch was an open sewer by that time and the old town not much better i was called cullender cully to my friends no one knew my first name they need only say cullender and theyd be pointed in my direction that was how it was with young master gisborne he had newly arrived by coach from london and feared hed never sit down again are you cullender my good friend mr wilks told me to ask for you wilks he was here for some weeks a medical student i nodded i recall the young gentleman particularly i lied i shall require a clean room nothing too fancy my pockets arent bottomless how long will you be staying master he looked around im not sure im considering a career in medicine if i like the faculty i may enrol and he fingered the edges of his coat it was a pale blue coat with bright silver buttons like master gisborne it was overdone and didnt quite fit together his face was fat like a whelps but his physique was lean and his eyes shone his skin had suffered neither disease nor malnourishment he was i suppose a fine enough specimen but id seen fine specimens before many of them stayed seduced by edinburgh i saw them daily in the pungent howffs or slouching through the narrow closes heads bowed none of them looked so fresh these days had they been eels the fishwives would have tossed them in a bucket and sold them to only the most gullible the most gullible of course being those newly arrived in the city master gisborne would need looking after he was haughty on the surface cocksure but i knew he was troubled wondering how long he could sustain the act of worldliness he had money but not in limitless supply his parents would be professional folk not gentry some denizens would gull him before supper me i was undecided i picked up his trunk shall i call a chair he frowned the streets here are too narrow and steep for coaches havent you noticed know why theyre narrow i sidled up to him theres a serpent buried beneath he looked ill at ease so i laughed just a story master we use chairmen instead of horses good strong highland stock i knew he had already walked a good way in search of me hauling his trunk with him he was tired but counting his money too lets walk he decided and you can acquaint me with the town the town master i said will acquaint you with itself we got him settled in at lucky seatons lucky had been a hoor herself at one time then had been turned to the moderate movement and now ran a christian rooming house we know all about medical students dont we cully she said while gisborne took the measure of his room the worst sinners in christendom she patted master gisborne on his plump cheek and i led him back down the treacherous stairwell what did she mean he asked me visit a few howffs and youll find out i told him the medical students are the most notorious group of topers in the city if you discount the lawyers judges poets boatmen and lords thisandthat whats a howff i led him directly into one there was a general fug in what passed for the air pipes were being smoked furiously and there were no windows to open so the stale fumes lay heavy at eye level i could hear laughter and swearing and the shrieks of women but it was like peering through a haar i saw onelegged jack balancing a wench on his good knee two lawyers sat at the next table along heads close together a poet of minor repute scribbled away as he sat slumped on the floor and all around there was wine wine in jugs and bumpers and bottles its sour smell vying with that of tobacco but the most noise came from a big round table in the furthest corner where beneath flickering lamplight a meeting of the monthly club was underway i led gisborne to the table having promised him that edinburgh would acquaint itself with him five gentlemen sat round the table one recognised me immediately dear old cully what news from the world above no news sir none better than that whats the meeting this month sirs the hot air club cully the speaker made a toast of the words we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of mr tytlers fight by montgolfier over this very city this had to be toasted again while i explained to master gisborne that the monthly club changed its name regularly in order to have something to celebrate i see youve brought fresh blood cully mr gisborne i said is newly arrived from london and hopes to study medicine i hope he will too if he intends to practise there was laughter and replenishing of glasses this gentleman i informed my master is mr walter scott mr scott is an advocate not today said another of the group today hes colonel grogg more laughter gisborne was asked what he would drink a glass of port my hapless charge replied the table went quiet scott was smiling with half his mouth only port is not much drunk in these parts it reminds some people of the union some people would rather drink whisky and toast their jacobite king oer the water someone at the table actually did this not heeding the tone of scotts voice but were one nation now scott continued that man did like to make a speech and if youll drink some claret with us we may yet be reconciled the drinker whod toasted bonnie prince charlie another lawyer whose name was urquhart now turned to gisborne with his usual complaint to englishmen rule britannia he said was written by a scot john bull was invented by a scot he slumped back having to his mind made his point master gisborne looked like he had tumbled into bedlam now now scott calmed were here to celebrate montgolfiers he handed gisborne a stemless glass filled to the brim and new arrivals but youve come to a dangerous place sir how so my master enquired sedition is rife scott paused as is murder how many is it now cully three this past fortnight i recited the names dr benson macstay the coffinmaker and a wretch called howison all stabbed scott informed gisborne imagine murdering a coffinmaker its like trying to murder death himself as was wont to happen the monthly club shifted to another howff to partake of a prix fixe dinner and thence to another where scott would drink champagne and lead a discussion of the chest the chest in question had been found when the castles crown room was opened during a search for some documents the crown room had been opened according to the advocate by special warrant under the royal sign manual no one had authority to break open the chest the crown room was locked again and the chest still inside at the time of the union with england the royal regalia of scotland had disappeared it was scotts contention that this regalia crown sceptre and sword lay in the chest gisborne listened in fascination somewhere along the route he had misplaced his sense of economy he would pay for the champagne he would pay for dinner a brothel was being discussed as the next destination luckily scott was taking an interest in him so that gisbornes pockets were still fairly full though his wits be empty i sat apart conversing with the exiled comte dartois who had fled france at the outset of revolution he retained the habit of stroking his neck for luck his good fortune being that it still connected his head to his trunk he had reason to feel nervous prompted by events in france sedition was in the air there had been riots and now the ringleaders were being tried we were discussing deacon brodie hanged six years before for a series of housebreakings brodie a cabinetmaker and locksmith had robbed the very premises to which hed fitted locks respectable by day hed been nefarious by night to the comte who knew about such matters this was merely the human condition i noticed suddenly that i was seated in shadow a man stood over me he had full thick lips a meaty stew of a nose and eyebrows which met at the central divide the way warring forces sometimes will cullender i shook my head and turned away youre cullender he said this is for you he slapped his paw on to the table then turned and pushed back through the throng a piece of paper neatly folded sat on the wood where his hand had been i unfolded it and read outside the tolbooth quarter before midnight the note was unsigned i handed it to the comte you will go it was already past eleven ill let one more drink decide the tolbooth was the city jail where brodie himself had spent his final days singing airs from the beggars opera the night was like pitch nobody having bothered to light their lamps and a haar rolled through from the direction of leith in the darkness i had trodden in something i did not care to study and was scraping my shoe clean on the tolbooths cornerstone when i heard a voice close by cullender a womans voice even held to a whisper i knew it for that the lady herself was dressed top to toe in black her face deep inside the hood of a cloak im cullender im told you perform services im no minister lady maybe she smiled a small bag appeared and i took it weighing the coins inside theres a book circulating in the town said my new mistress i am keen to obtain it we have several fine booksellers in the luckenbooths you are glib sir and you are mysterious then ill be plain i know of only one copy of this book a private printing it is called rangers second impartial list of the ladies of pleasure in edinburgh you know it have you seen it its not meant for the likes of me i would like to see this book you want me to find it its said you know everyone in the city everyone that matters then you can locate it its possible i examined my shoes but first id need to know a little more when i looked up again she was gone at the cross the caddies were speaking quietly with the chairmen we caddies had organised ourselves into a company boasting written standards and a magistrate of caddies in charge of all we regarded ourselves superior to the chairmen mere brawny highland migrants but my best friend and most trusted ally mr mack was a chairman he was not however at the cross work was nearly over for the night the last taverns were throwing out the last soused customers only the brothels and cockpits were still active not able to locate mr mack i turned instead to a fellow caddie an old hand called dryden mr dryden i said all businesslike i require your services the fee to be agreed between us dryden as ever was willing i knew he would work through the night he was known to the various brothelkeepers and could ask his questions discreetly as i might have done myself had the ladys fee not been sufficient to turn me employer me i headed home climbing the lonely stairs to my attic quarters and a cold mattress i found sleep the way a pickpocket finds his gull which is to say easily next morning dryden was dead a young caddie called colin came to tell me we repaired to the nor loch where the body still lay face down in the slime the town guard town rats behind their backs fingered their lochaber axes straightened their tall cocked hats and tried to look important one of their number a redfaced individual named fairlie asked if we knew the victim dryden i said he was a caddie hes been run through with a dagger fairlie delighted in telling me just like those other three but i wasnt so sure about that i went to a quiet howff a drink steadying my humour dryden i surmised had been killed in such a way as to make him appear another victim of the citys stabber i knew though that in all likelihood he had been killed because of the questions hed been asking questions id sent him to ask was i safe myself had dryden revealed anything to his killer and what was it about my mistresss mission that made it so deadly dangerous as i was thus musing young gisborne entered the bar on fragile legs did i have anything to drink last evening he asked holding his head master you drank like it was your last day alive our hostess was already replenishing my wine jug kill or cure i said pouring two glasses gisborne could see i was worried and asked the nature of the problem i was grateful to tell him any listener would have sufficed mind i held back some this knowledge was proving dangerous so i made no mention of the lady and her book i jumped from the messenger to my words with dryden the thing to do then my young master said is to track backwards locate the messenger i thought back to the previous evening about the time the messenger had been arriving the lawyer urquhart had been taking his leave of the monthly club well talk to urquhart i said at this hour hell be in his chambers follow me gisborne followed me out of the howff and across the street directly into another there in a booth papers before him and a bottle of wine beside them sat urquhart im pleased to see you the lawyer announced his eyes were bloodshot his nose like a stoned cherry his breath i avoided altogether aged somewhere in his thirties urquhart was a seasoned dissolute he would have us take a bumper with him sir i began do you recall leaving the company last night of course im only sorry id to leave so early an assignation you understand we shared a smile at this tell me gisborne to which house of ill fame did the gang repair i dont recollect gisborne admitted urquhart enjoyed this then tell me did you awake in a bed or the gutter in neither mr urquhart i awoke on the kitchen floor of a house i did not know while urquhart relished this i asked if hed taken a chair from the tavern last night of course a friend of yours was frontrunner mr mack urquhart nodded you didnt happen to see a grotesque sir i described the messenger to him urquhart shook his head i heard a caddie was murdered last night urquhart said we all know the town rats cant be expected to bring anyone to justice he leaned towards me confidentially are you looking for justice cully i dont know what im looking for sir which was a lie for now i was looking for mr mack i left gisborne with urquhart and found mack at the cross yes he said i saw that fellow going in a big fatlipped sort with eyebrows that met in the middle had you seen him before mack nodded but not here over the loch the new town mack nodded then show me where mack and his fellow chairman carried me down the steep slope towards the building site yes building site for though princes street and george street were finished yet more streets were being artfully constructed just now the builders were busy on what would be called charlotte square we took the simpler route down past trinity hospital and the college kirk then along princes street itself there were plans to turn the nor loch into either a canal or formal gardens but for the moment it was a dumping ground i avoided looking at it and tried not to think of poor dryden joining the loch to the old town sat the mound an apt name for a treacherous heap of new town rubble all change eh cully mr mack called to me soon therell be no business in the old town for the likes of you and me he had a point the nobility had already deserted the old town their grand lands now housed wheelwrights and hosiers and schoolmasters they all lived in the new town now at a general distance from the milling rabble so here the foundations were being laid not for the new town alone but for the death of the old we passed into george street and the sedan chair was brought to rest it was here i saw him mr mack said he was marching up the street like he owned the place i got out of the chair and rubbed my bruised posterior mr macks companions had already spotted another likely fare i waved them off i must needs talk to my mistress and that meant finding her servant so i sat on a step and watched the workcarts grinding past overloaded with rocks and rubble the day passed pleasantly enough perhaps two hours had gone by when i saw him i couldnt be sure which house he emerged from he was some way along the street i tucked myself behind some railings and watched him head down towards princes street i followed at a canny distance he was clumsy his gait gangling and i followed him with ease he climbed back up to the old town and made for the luckenbooths here he entered a bookshop causing me to pause the shop belonged to a mr whitewood who fancied himself not only bookseller but poet and author also i entered the premises quietly and could hear whitewoods raised voice he was towards the back of his shop reciting to a fawning audience of other soidistant writers and people to whom books were mere fashion the servant was pushing his way to the front of the small gathering whitewood stood on a low unsteady podium and read with a white handkerchief in one hand which he waved for dramatic effect he needed all the help he could get i dealt daily with the improvers the selftermed literati ill tell you now what an improver is hes an imp who roves id seen them dragging their carcasses through the gutter and waylaying hoors and scrapping with the tourists the servant had reached the podium and the bookseller had seen him without pausing midstanza whitewood passed the wretch a note it was done in an instant and the servant turned back towards the door i slipped outside and hid myself watching the servant head as if towards the courts i followed him into the courthouse i followed him into one particular court and there was brought up short lord braxfield the hanging judge was deciding a case he sat in his wig at his muckle bench and dipped oatcakes into his claret sucking loudly on the biscuits as he glared at the accused there were three of them and i knew they were charged with sedition being leaders of a popular convention for parliamentary reform at this time only thirty or so people in edinburgh had the right to vote for the member of parliament these three sad creatures had wanted to change that and a lot more besides i glanced at the jury doubtless handpicked by braxfield himself the accused would be whipped and sent to botany bay the public gallery was restless there were guards between the populace and the bench the servant was nodded through by one of the guards and handed whitewoods note to braxfield then he turned quickly and left by another door i was set to follow when the hanging judge noticed me cullender approach the bench i bit my lip but knew better than to defy braxfield even if it meant losing my quarry the guards let me through i forbore to look at the accused as i passed them yes my lord braxfield nibbled another of his infernal biscuits he looked like hed drunk well too cullender he said youre one of the least honest and civil men in this town am i correct i have competitors my lord he guffawed spitting crumbs from his wet lips but tell me this would you have a man live who committed treason i swallowed aware of three pairs of eyes behind me i might ask myself about his motives my lord braxfield leaned over the bench he was unquestionably ugly eyes black as night in his seventies he grew increasingly eccentric he was what passed for the law in this city then its as well im wearing this wig and not you he screeched he wagged a finger the nail of which was sore in need of a trim youll see australia one day my friend if youre not careful now be gone ive some justice to dispense it had been a long time since braxfield and justice had been even loosely acquainted outside the servant was long gone cursing my luck and the law courts both i headed down to the canongate i engaged mr macks services regarding my ladys book warning him to be extra vigilant and telling him of drydens demise he suggested going to the authorities then realised what he was saying the law was as effectual as a scented handkerchief against the pox and we both knew it i sat in a howff and ate a dish of oysters having been to look at the university master gisborne joined me itll be fine when its finished was his opinion i supped the last of the juice and put down the platter remember i told you about the serpent master his eyes were redrimmed face puffy with excess he nodded well i continued thoughtfully perhaps its not so far beneath the surface as i thought you need only scratch and youll see it remember that even in your cups he looked puzzled but nodded again then he seemed to remember something and reached into his leather bag he handed me a wrapped parcel cully can you keep this somewhere safe what is it just hold it for me a day or so will you do that i nodded and placed the parcel at my feet gisborne looked mightily relieved then the howff door swung inwards and urquhart and others appeared taking gisborne off with them i finished my wine and made my way back to my room halfway there i met the tailor whose family lived two floors below me cully he said men are looking for you what sort of men the sort you wouldnt have find you theyre standing guard on the stairwell and wont shift thanks for the warning he held my arm cully business is slow if you could persuade some of your clients of the quality of my cloth depend on it i went back up the brae to the cross and found mr mack here i said handing him the parcel keep this for me whats wrong im not sure i think i may have stepped in something even less savoury than i thought any news of the list mack shook his head he looked worried when i left him not for himself but for me i kept heading uphill towards the castle itself beneath castle hill lay the catacombs where the towns denizens used to hide when the place was being sacked and where the lowest of edinburghs wretches still dwelt i would be safe there so i made my way into the tunnels and out of the light averting my face where possible from each interested unfriendly gaze the man i sought sat slouched against one of the curving walls hands on his knees he could sit like that for hours brooding he was a giant and there were stories to equal his size it was said hed been a seditionary a rabblerouser both pirate and smuggler he had almost certainly killed men but these days he lay low his name was ormond he watched me sit opposite him his gaze unblinking youre in trouble he said at last would i be here otherwise i need somewhere to sleep for tonight he nodded slowly thats all any of us needs youll be safe here cullender and i was but next morning i was roused early by ormond shaking me men outside he hissed looking for you i rubbed my eyes is there another exit ormond shook his head if you went any deeper into this maze you could lose yourself for ever these burrows run as far as the canongate how many men i was standing up now fully awake four i held out my hand give me a dagger ill deal with them i meant it too i was aching and irritable and tired of running but ormond shook his head ive a better plan he said he led me back through the tunnel towards its entrance the tunnel grew more populous as we neared the outside world i could hear my pursuers ahead examining faces snarling as each one proved false then ormond filled his lungs the price of corns to be raised he bellowed new taxes new laws everyone to the cross voices were raised in anger and people clambered to their feet ormond was raising a mob the edinburgh mob was a wondrous thing it could run riot through the streets and then melt back into the shadows thered been the porteous riots anticatholic riots pricerise riots and prorevolution riots each time the vast majority escaped arrest a mob could be raised in a minute and could disperse in another even braxfield feared the mob ormond was bellowing in front of me as for me i was merely another of the wretches i passed the men whod been seeking me they stood dumbfounded in the midst of the spectacle as soon as the crowd reached the lawnmarket i peeled off with a wave of thanks to ormond slipped into an alley and was alone again but not for long down past the luckenbooths i saw the servant again and this time he would not evade me down towards princes street he went down geordie boyds footpath a footpath that would soon be wide enough for carriages he crossed princes street and headed up to george street there at last i saw him descend some steps and enter a house by its servants door i stopped a sedan chair both chairmen knew me through mr mack that house there one of them said in answer to my question it used to belong to lord thorpe before he left for london a bookseller bought it from him a mr whitewood i asked blithely the chairman nodded i admit i dont know that gentleman well is he married married aye but you wouldnt know it shes seldom seen is she donald rarely very rarely the second chairman agreed whys that has she the pox or something they laughed at the imputation how would we know a thing like that i laughed too and bid them thanks and farewell then i approached the front door of the house and knocked a good solid knock the servant when he opened the door was liveried he looked at me in astonishment tell your mistress i wish to speak with her i said sharply he appeared in two minds at least but i sidestepped him and found myself in a fine entrance hall wait in here the servant growled closing the front door and opening another ill ask my lady if shell deign to see you i toured the drawingroom it was like walking around an exhibition though in truth the only exhibition id ever toured was of bedlam on a sunday afternoon and then only to look for a friend of mine the door opened and the lady of the house swept in she had powdered her cheeks heavily to disguise the redness there either embarrassment or anger her eyes avoided mine which gave me opportunity to study her she was in her mid twenties not short and with a pleasing figure her lips were full and red her eyes hard but to my mind seductive she was a catch but when she spoke her voice was roughhewn and i wondered at her history what do you want what do you think i want she picked up a pretty statuette are we acquainted i believe so we met outside the tolbooth she attempted a disbelieving laugh indeed its a place ive never been you would not care to see its innards lady yet you may if you continue in this manner no amount of powder could have hidden her colouring how dare you come here my life is in danger lady this quieted her why what have you done nothing save what you asked of me have you found the book not yet and ive a mind to hand you back your money she saw what i was getting at and looked aghast but if youre in danger i swear it cannot be to do with me no a man has died already mr cullender its only a book its nothing anyone would kill for i almost believed her why do you want it she turned away that is not your concern my chief concern is my neck lady ill save it at any cost i repeat you are in no danger from seeking that book if you think your life in peril there must needs be some other cause she stared at me as she spoke and the damnation of it was that i believed her i believed that drydens death braxfields threat the men chasing me that none of it had anything to do with her she saw the change in me and smiled a radiant smile a smile that took me with it now get out she said and with that she left the room and began to climb the stairs her servant was waiting for me by the front door holding it open in readiness my head was full of puzzles all i knew with certainty was that i was sick of hiding i headed back to the old town with a plan in my mind as halfbaked as the scrapings the baker tossed out to the homeless i toured the town gossips starting with the fishwives then i headed to the cross and whispered in the ears of selected caddies and chairmen then it was into the howffs and dining establishments and i was glad to wash my hard work down with a glass or two of wine my story broadcast i repaired to my lodgings and lay on the straw mattress there were no men waiting for me on the stairwell i believe i even slept a little it was dark when i next looked out of the skylight the story id spread was that i knew whod killed dryden and was merely biding my time before alerting the town rats would anyone fall for the ploy i wasnt sure i fell to a doze again but opened my eyes on hearing noises on the stair the steps to my attic were rotten and had to be managed adroitly my visitor a lone man i surmised was doing his best i sat up on the mattress and watched the door begin to open in deep shadow a figure entered my room closing the door after it with some finality good evening cully i swallowed drily so the stories were true then deacon brodie true enough he said coming closer his face was almost unrecognisable much older more careworn and he wore no wig no marks of a gentleman he carried a slender dagger in his right hand i cheated the gibbet cully he said with his old pride but i was there i saw you drop and you saw my men cut me down and haul me away he grinned with what teeth were left in his head a wooden collar saved my throat cully i devised it myself i recalled the red silk hed worn ostentatiously around his throat a scarf from a female admirer the story went it would have hidden just such a device youve been in hiding a long time i said the dagger was inches from me i fled edinburgh cully ive been away these past five and a half years what brought you back i couldnt take my eyes off the dagger aye brodie said seeing what was in my mind the doctor who pronounced me dead and the coffinmaker who was supposed to have buried me i couldnt have witnesses alive not now and the others dryden and the wretch howison both recognised me curse them then you started to snoop around and couldnt be found but why why are you back the dagger was touching my throat now id backed myself into a corner of the bed there was nowhere to go i was tempted back cully a temptation i could not resist the crown jewels what his voice was a feverish whisper the chest in the crown room i will have its contents my last and greatest theft alone impossible but im not alone i have powerful allies he smiled braxfield for one he believes the theft of the jewels will spark a scots revolution but you know this already cully you were seen watching braxfield you were seen in whitewoods shop whitewoods part of it too you know he is romantic fool that he is the point of the dagger broke my skin i could feel blood trickle down my throat if i spoke again they would be my last words i felt like laughing brodie was so wrong in his surmisings everything was wrong a sudden noise on the stair turned brodies head my own dagger was hidden beneath my thigh i grabbed it with one hand my other hand wrestling with brodies blade when gisborne opened the door what he saw sobered him immediately brodie freed himself and turned to confront the young englishman dagger ready but not ready enough gisborne had no hesitation in running him through brodie stood there frozen then keeled over his head hitting the boards with a dull dead sound gisborne was the statue now he stared at the spreading blood i got to my feet quickly where did you get the blade i asked amazed gisborne swallowed i bought it new today heeding your advice you saved my life young master i stared down at brodies corpse but why are you here gisborne came to his senses i heard you were looking for a book i was what of it we were both staring at brodie only to tell you that i am in possession of it or i was the lawyer urquhart gave it to me he said i would doubtless find it useful who was this man i ignored the question and glared at him you have the book he shook his head i darent keep it in my room for fear my landlady might find it i blinked that parcel gisborne nodded i felt a fool a dumb fool but there was brodies corpse to dispose of i could see little advantage in reporting this his second demise to the authorities questions would be asked of master gisborne and a young englishman might not always receive a fair hearing especially with braxfield at the bench god no the body must be disposed of quietly and i knew just the spot mr mack helped us lug the guts down to the new town propping brodie in the sedan chair the slumped corpse resembled nothing so much as a sleeping drunk in charlotte square we found some fresh foundations and buried the remains of deacon brodie within we were all three in a sweat by the time wed finished i sat myself down on a large stone and wiped my brow well friends i said it is only right and proper what is gisborne asked breathing heavily the old town has its serpent and now the new town does too i watched gisborne put his jacket back on it was the blue coat with silver buttons there was blood on it and dirt besides i know a tailor i began might make something fresh for an excellent price next morning washed and crisply dressed i returned to my ladys house i waved the parcel under the servants nose and he hurried upstairs my lady was down promptly but gave me no heed she had eyes only for the book book it was little more than a ragged pamphlet its pages wellthumbed scribbled marginalia commenting on this or that entry or adding a fresh one i handed her the tome the entry you seek is towards the back i told her she looked startled you are i suppose the masked lady referred to therein a lady for daylight assignations only and always masked speaking in a whisper her cheeks were crimson as she tore at the book scattering its shreddings better have the floor swept i told her you wouldnt want mr whitewood to find any trace that was your reason all along was it not he is a known philanderer it was only a matter of time before he got to read of the masked lady and became intrigued to meet her her head was held high like she was examining the rooms cornices im not ashamed she said nor should you be she saw i was mocking her i am a prisoner here with no more life than a doll so you take revenge in your own particular manner i understand lady but you must understand this two men died because of you not directly but that matters not to them only one deserved to die for the other i jangled the bag of money shed given me that first night these coins will buy him a burial then i bade her good day and left the whole shining new town behind me with its noises of construction and busyness let them build all the mighty edifices they would they could not erase the stain they could not erase the real town the old town the town i knew so intimately i returned to the howff where gisborne and mack awaited me ive decided the young master said to study law rather than medicine cully he poured me a drink edinburgh needs another lawyer dont you think the image of braxfield came unasked into my mind like it needs another plague master but i raised my glass to him anyway no sanity clause an inspector rebus story for christmas it was all edgar allan poes fault either that or the scottish parliament joey briggs was spending most of his days in the runup to christmas sheltering from edinburghs biting december winds hed been walking up george iv bridge one day and had watched a downandout slouching into the central library joey had hesitated he wasnt a downandout not yet anyway maybe he would be soon if scully aitchison msp got his way but for now joey had a bedsit and a trickle of state cash thing was nothing made you miss money more than christmas the shop windows displayed their magnetic pull there were queues at the cash machines kids tugged on their parents sleeves ready with something new to add to the present list boyfriends were out buying gold while families piled the food trolley high and then there was joey nine weeks out of prison and nobody to call his friend he knew there was nothing waiting for him back in his home town his wife had taken the children and tiptoed out of his life joeys sister had written to him in prison with the news so eleven months on joey had walked through the gates of saughton jail and taken the first bus into the city centre purchased an evening paper and started the hunt for somewhere to live the bedsit was fine it was one of four in a tenement basement just off south clerk street sharing a kitchen and bathroom the other men worked didnt say much joeys room had a gas fire with a coinmeter beside it too expensive to keep it going all day hed tried sitting in the kitchen with the stove lit until the landlord had caught him then hed tried steeping in the bath topping up the hot but the water always seemed to run cold after half a tub you could try getting a job the landlord had said not so easy with a prison record most of the jobs were for security and nightwatch joey didnt think hed get very far there following the tramp into the library was one of his better ideas the uniform behind the desk gave him a look but didnt say anything joey wandered the stacks picked out a book and sat himself down and that was that he became a regular the staff acknowledged him with a nod and sometimes even a smile he kept himself presentable didnt fall asleep the way some of the old guys did he read for much of the day alternating between fiction biographies and textbooks he read up on local history plumbing and winston churchill nigel tranters novels and national trust gardens he knew the library would close over christmas didnt know what hed do without it he never borrowed books because he was afraid theyd have him on some blacklist convicted housebreaker and petty thief not to be trusted with loan material he dreamt of spending christmas in one of the towns posh hotels looking out across princes street gardens to the castle hed order room service and watch tv hed take as many baths as he liked theyd clean his clothes for him and return them to the room he dreamt of the presents hed buy himself a big radio with a cd player some new shirts and pairs of shoes and books plenty of books the dream became almost real to him so that he found himself nodding off in the library coming to as his head hit the page hed been reading then hed have to concentrate only to find himself drifting into a warm sleep again until he met edgar allan poe it was a book of poems and short stories among them the purloined letter joey loved that thought it was really clever the way you could hide something by putting it right in front of people something that didnt look out of place people would just ignore it thered been a guy in saughton doing time for fraud hed told joey three things a suit a haircut and an expensive watch if youve got those its amazing what you can get away with hed meant that clients had trusted him because theyd seen something they were comfortable with something they expected to see what they hadnt seen was what was right in front of their noses to wit a shark someone who was going to take a big bite out of their savings as joeys eyes flitted back over poes story he started to get an idea he started to get what he thought was a very good idea indeed problem was he needed what the fraudster had called the startup meaning some cash he happened to look across to where one of the old tramps was slumped on a chair the newspaper in front of him unopened joey looked around nobody was watching the place was dead who had time to go to the library when christmas was around the corner joey walked over to the old guy slipped a hand into his coat pocket felt coins and notes bunched his fingers around them he glanced down at the newspaper there was a story about scully aitchisons campaign aitchison was the msp who wanted all offenders put on a central register open to public inspection he said lawabiding folk had the right to know if their neighbour was a thief or a murderer as if stealing was the same as killing somebody there was a small photo of aitchison too beaming that selfsatisfied smile his glasses glinting if aitchison got his way joey would never get out of the rut not unless his plan paid off john rebus saw his girlfriend kissing santa claus there was a german market in princes street gardens that was where rebus was to meet jean he hadnt expected to find her in a clinch with a man dressed in a red suit black boots and snowywhite beard santa broke away and moved off just as rebus was approaching german folk songs were blaring out there was a startled look on jeans face what was that all about he asked i dont know she was watching the retreating figure i think maybe hes just had too much festive spirit he came up and grabbed me rebus made to follow but jean stopped him come on john season of goodwill and all that its assault jean she laughed regaining her composure youre going to take st nicholas down the station and put him in the cells she rubbed his arm lets forget it eh the fun starts in ten minutes rebus wasnt too sure that the evening was going to be fun he spent every day bogged down in crimes and tragedies he wasnt sure that a mystery dinner was going to offer much relief it had been jeans idea there was a hotel just across the road you all went in for dinner were handed envelopes telling you which character youd be playing a body was discovered and then you all turned detective itll be fun jean insisted leading him out of the gardens she had three shopping bags with her he wondered if any of them were for him shed asked for a list of his christmas wants but so far all hed come up with were a couple of cds by string driven thing as they entered the hotel they saw that the mystery evening was being held on the mezzanine floor most of the guests had already gathered and were enjoying glasses of cava rebus asked in vain for a beer cavas included in the price the waitress told him a man dressed in victorian costume was checking names and handing out carrier bags inside he told jean and rebus youll find instructions a secret clue that only you know your name and an item of clothing oh jean said im little nell she fixed a bonnet to her head who are you john mr bumble rebus produced his nametag and a yellow woollen scarf which jean insisted on tying around his neck its a dickensian theme specially for christmas the host revealed before moving off to confront his other victims everyone looked a bit embarrassed but most were trying for enthusiasm rebus didnt doubt that a couple of glasses of wine over dinner would loosen a few edinburgh stays there were a couple of faces he recognised one was a journalist her arm around her boyfriends waist the other was a man who appeared to be with his wife he had one of those looks to him the kind that says you should know him she was blonde and petite and about a decade younger than her husband isnt that an msp jean whispered his names scully aitchison rebus told her jean was reading her information sheet the victim tonight is a certain ebenezer scrooge he said and did you kill him she thumped his arm rebus smiled but his eyes were on the msp aitchisons face was bright red rebus guessed hed been drinking since lunchtime his voice boomed across the floor broadcasting the news that he and catriona had booked a room for the night so they wouldnt have to drive back to the constituency they were all mingling on the mezzanine landing the room where theyd dine was just off to the right its doors still closed guests were starting to ask each other which characters they were playing as one elderly lady miss havisham on her nametag came over to ask jean about little nell rebus saw a redsuited man appear at the top of the stairs santa carried what looked like a halfempty sack he started making his way across the floor but was stopped by aitchison jaccuse the msp bawled you killed scrooge because of his inhumanity to his fellow man aitchisons wife came to the rescue dragging her husband away but santas eyes seemed to follow them as he made to pass rebus rebus fixed him with a stare jean he asked is he the same one she only caught the back of santas head they all look alike to me she said santa was on his way to the next flight of stairs rebus watched him leave then turned back to the other guests all of them now tricked out in odd items of clothing no wonder santa had looked like hed stumbled into an asylum rebus was reminded of a marx brothers line groucho trying to get chicos name on a contract telling him to sign the sanity clause but as chico said everyone knew there was no such thing as sanity clause joey jimmied open his third room of the night the santa suit had worked a treat okay so it was hot and uncomfortable and the beard was itching his neck but it worked hed breezed through reception and up the stairs so far as hed worked the corridors all hed had were a few jokey comments no one from security asking him who he was no guests becoming suspicious he fitted right in and he was right under their noses god bless edgar allan poe the woman in the fancy dress shop had even thrown in a sack saying hed be wanting to fill it how true in the first bedroom hed dumped out the crumpled sheets of old newspaper and started filling the sack clothes jewellery the contents of the minibar same with the second room a tap on the door to make sure no one was home then the chisel into the lock and hey presto thing was there wasnt much in the rooms a notice in the wardrobe told clients to lock all valuables in the hotel safe at reception still he had a few nice things camera credit cards bracelet and necklace sweat was running into his eyes but he couldnt afford to shed his disguise he was starting to have crazy thoughts take a good long soak ring down for room service find a room that hadnt been taken and settle in for the duration in the third room he sat on the bed feeling dizzy there was a briefcase open beside him just lots of paperwork his stomach growled and he remembered that his last meal had been a mars bar supper the previous day he broke open a jar of salted peanuts switched the tv on while he ate as he put the empty jar down he happened to glance at the contents of the briefcase parliamentary briefing law and justice subcommittee he saw a list of names on the top sheet one of them was coloured with a yellow marker scully aitchison the drunk man downstairs that was where joey knew him from he leapt to his feet trying to think he could stay here and give the msp a good hiding he could he picked up the roomservice menu called down and ordered smoked salmon a steak a bottle each of best red wine and malt whisky then heard himself saying those sweetest words put it on my room will you then he settled back to wait flipped through the paperwork again an envelope slipped out card inside and a letter inside the card dear scully it began i hope it isnt all my fault this idea of yours for a register of offenders i havent a clue said rebus nor did he dinner was over the actor playing scrooge was flat out on the mezzanine floor and rebus was as far away from solving the crime as ever thankfully a bar had been opened up and he spent most of his time perched on a high stool pretending to read the background notes while taking sips of beer jean had hooked up with miss havisham while aitchisons wife was slumped in one of the armchairs drawing on a cigarette the msp himself was playing ringmaster and had twice confronted rebus calling for him to reveal himself as the villain innocent mlud was all rebus had said we think its magwitch jean said suddenly breathless by rebuss side her bonnet at a jaunty angle he and scrooge knew one another in prison i didnt know scrooge served time rebus said thats because youre not asking questions i dont need to ive got you to tell me thats what makes a good detective he watched her march away four of the diners had encircled the poor man playing magwitch rebus had harboured suspicions too but now he was thinking of jail time and how it affected those serving it it gave them a certain look a look they brought back into the world on their release the same look hed seen in santas eyes and here was santa now coming back down the stairs his sack slung over one shoulder crossing the mezzanine floor as if seeking someone out then finding them scully aitchison rebus rose from his stool and wandered over have you been good this year santa was asking aitchison no worse than anyone else the msp smirked sure about that santas eyes narrowed i wouldnt lie to father christmas what about this plan of yours the offender register aitchison blinked a couple of times what about it santa held a piece of paper aloft his voice rising your own nephews serving time for fraud managed to keep that quiet havent you aitchison stared at the letter where in hell how the journalist stepped forward mind if i take a look santa handed over the letter then pulled off his hat and beard started heading for the stairs down rebus blocked his way time to hand out the presents he said quietly joey looked at him and understood immediately slid the sack from his shoulder rebus took it now on you go youre not arresting me whod feed dancer and prancer rebus asked his stomach full of steak and wine a bottle of malt in the capacious pocket of his costume joey smiled his way back towards the outside world death is not the end an inspector rebus story one is loss redeemed by memory or does memory merely swell the sense of loss becoming the enemy the language of loss is the language of memory remembrance memorial memento people leave our lives all the time some we met only briefly others wed known since birth they leave us memories which become skewed through time and little more the silent dance continued couples writhed and shuffled threw back their heads or ran hands through their hair eyes darting around the dance floor seeking out future partners maybe or past loves to make jealous the tv monitor gave a greasy look to everything no sound just pictures the tape cutting from dance floor to main bar to second bar to toilet hallway then entrance foyer exterior front and exterior back exterior back was a puddled alley full of rubbish bins and a merc belonging to the clubs owner rebus had heard about the alley a punter had been knifed there the previous summer mr merc had complained about the bloody smear on his passengerside window the victim had lived the club was called gaitanos nobody knew why the owner just said it sounded american and a bit jazzy the larger part of the clientele had decided on the nickname guisers and that was what you heard in the pubs on a friday and saturday night going down guisers later the young men would be dressed smartcasual the women scented from heaven and all stations south they left the pubs around ten or half past thats when it would be starting to get lively at guisers rebus was seated in a small uncomfortable chair which itself sat in a stuffy dimly lit room the other chair was filled by an audiovisual technician armed with two remotes his occasional belches of which he seemed blissfully ignorant bespoke a recent snack of spring onion crisps and irnbru im really only interested in the main bar foyer and out front rebus said i could edit them down to another tape but wed lose definition the recordings duff enough as it is the technician scratched inside the sagging armpit of his black tshirt rebus leaned forward a little pointing at the screen coming up now they waited the view jumped from back alley to dance floor any second another cut main bar punters queuing three deep the technician didnt need to be told and froze the picture it wasnt so much black and white as sepia the colour of dead photographs interior light the audiovisual wizard had explained he was adjusting the tracking now and moving the action along one frame at a time rebus moved in on the screen bending so one knee rested on the floor his finger was touching a face he took out the assortment of photos from his pocket and held them against the screen its him he said i was pretty sure before you cant go in a bit closer for now this is as good as it gets i can work on it later stick it on the computer the problem is the source material to wit one shitty security video rebus sat back on his chair all right he said lets run forward at halfspeed the camera stayed with the main bar for another fifteen seconds then switched to the second bar and all points on the compass when it returned to the main bar the crush of drinkers seemed not to have moved unbidden the technician froze the tape again hes not there rebus said again he approached the screen touched it with his finger he should be there next to the sex goddess the technician belched again yes spun silver hair almost like a cloud of candyfloss dark eyes and lips while those around her were either intent on catching the eyes of the bar staff or on the dance floor she was looking off to one side there were no shoulders to her dress lets check the foyer rebus said twenty seconds there showed a steady stream entering the club but no one leaving exterior front showed a queue awaiting admittance by the brace of bouncers and a few passersby in the toilet maybe the technician suggested but rebus had studied the tape a dozen times already and though he watched just once more he knew he wouldnt see the young man again not at the bar not on the dance floor and not back around the table where his mates were waiting with increasing disbelief and impatience for him to get his round in the young mans name was damon mee and according to the timer running at the bottom righthand corner of the screen he had vanished from the world sometime between and pm on friday april where is this place anyway i dont recognise it kirkcaldy rebus said the technician looked at him how come it ended up here good question rebus thought but not one he was about to answer go back to that bar shot he said take it nice and slow again the technician aimed his righthand remote yes sir mr demille he said april meant still not quite spring in edinburgh a few sunny days to be sure buds getting twitchy wondering if winter had been paid the ransom but there was snow still hanging in a sky the colour of chicken bones office talk how rangers were going to retain the championship why hearts and hibs would never win it was it finally time for the two local sides to become friends form one team which might might stand half a chance as someone said their rivalry was part and parcel of the citys makeup hard to imagine rangers and celtic thinking of marriage in the same way or even of a quick poke on the back stairs after years of following football only on pub televisions and in the back of the daily tabloid rebus was starting to go to matches again dc siobhan clarke was to blame coaxing him to a hibs game one dreary afternoon the men on the green sward werent half as interesting as the spectators who proved by turns sharpwitted vulgar perceptive and incorrigible siobhan had taken him to her usual spot those in the vicinity seemed to know her pretty well it was a goodhumoured afternoon even if rebus couldnt have said who scored the eventual three goals but hibs had won the finalwhistle hug from siobhan was proof of that it was interesting to rebus that for all the barriers around the ground this was a place where shields were dropped after a while it felt like one of the safest places hed ever been he recalled fixtures his father had taken him to in the fifties and early sixties cowdenbeath home games and a crowd numbered in the hundreds getting there necessitated a change of buses rebus and his younger brother fighting over who could hold the roll of tickets their mother was dead by then and their father was trying to carry on much as before like they might not notice she was missing those saturday trips to the football were supposed to fill a gap you saw a lot of fathers and sons on the terraces but not many mothers and that in itself was reminder enough there was a boy of rebuss age who stood near them rebus had walked over to him one day and blurted out the truth i dont have a mum at home the boy had stared at him saying nothing ever since football had reminded him of those days and of his mother he stood on the terraces alone these days and followed the game mostly movements which could be graceful as ballet or as jagged as free association but sometimes found that hed drifted elsewhere to a place not at all unpleasant and all the time surrounded by a community of bodies and wills ill tell you how to beat rangers he said now addressing the whole office how siobhan clarke offered clone stevie scoular half a dozen times there were murmurs of agreement and then the farmer put his head around the door john my office the farmer chief superintendent watson to his face was pouring a mug of coffee from his machine when rebus knocked at the open door sit down john rebus sat the farmer motioned with an empty mug but he turned down the offer and waited for his boss to get to his chair and the point both my birthdays coming up the farmer said this was a new one on rebus who kept quiet id like a present not just a card this year then what i want john is topper hamilton rebus let that sink in i thought topper was mr clean these days not in my books the farmer cupped his hands around his coffee mug he got a fright last time and granted hes been keeping a low profile but we both know the best villains have got little or no profile at all so whats he been up to i heard a story hes the sleeping partner in a couple of clubs and casinos i also hear he bought a taxi firm from big ger cafferty when big ger went into barlinnie rebus was thinking back three years to their big push against topper hamilton theyd set up surveillance used a bit of pressure here and there got a few people to talk in the end it hadnt so much amounted to a hill of beans as to a fart in an empty can the procurator fiscal had decided not to proceed to trial but then god or fate call it what you like had provided a spin to the story not a plague of boils or anything for topper hamilton but a nasty little cancer which had given him more grief than the whole of the lothian and borders police hed been in and out of hospital endured chemo and the whole works and had emerged a more slender figure in every sense the farmer whod once settled an office argument by reeling off the books in both old and new testaments wasnt yet content that god and life had done their worst to topper or that retribution had been meted out in some mysterious divine way he wanted topper in court even if they had to wheel him there on a trolley it was a personal thing last time i looked rebus said now it wasnt illegal to invest in a casino it is if your name hasnt come up during the vetting procedure think topper could get a gaming licence fair point but i still dont see something else i heard youve got a snitch works as a croupier so same casino topper has a finger in rebus saw it all and started shaking his head i made him a promise hell tell me about punters but nothing on the management and youd rather keep that promise than give me a birthday present a relationship like that its eggshells the farmers eyes narrowed you think ours isnt talk to him john get him to do some ferreting i could lose a good snitch plenty more bigmouths out there the farmer watched rebus get to his feet i was looking for you earlier you were in the video room a missing person suspicious rebus shrugged could be he went up to the bar for a round of drinks never came back weve all done that in our time his parents are worried how old is he twentythree the farmer thought about it then whats the problem two the problem was the past a week before hed received a phone call from a ghost inspector john rebus please speaking oh hello there you probably wont remember me a short laugh that used to be a bit of a joke at school rebus immune to every kind of phone call had this pegged a crank whys that he asked wondering which punchline he was walking into because its my name mee the caller spelt it for him brian mee inside rebuss head a fuzzy photograph took sudden shape a mouth full of prominent teeth freckled nose and cheeks a kitchenstool haircut barney mee he said more laughter on the line aye they used to call me barney im not sure i ever knew why rebus could have told him after barney rubble in the flintstones he could have added because you were a dense wee bastard but instead he asked how this ghost from his past was doing no bad no bad the laugh again rebus recognised it now as a sign of nerves so what can i do for you brian well me and janis we thought well it was my mums idea actually she knew your dad both my mum and dad knew him only my dad passed away like they all used to drink at the goth are you still in bowhill never quite escaped ach its all right really i work in glenrothes though lucky to have a job these days eh mind youve done well for yourself johnny do you still get called that i prefer john i remember you hated it when anyone called you jock another wheezing laugh the photo was even sharper now bordered with a white edge the way photos always were in the past a decent footballer a bit of a terrier the hair reddishbrown dragging his satchel along the ground until the stitching rubbed away always with some huge hard sweet in his mouth crunching down on it his nose running and one incident hed lifted some nude mags from under his dads side of the bed and brought them to the toilets next to the miners institute there to be pored over like textbooks afterwards half a dozen twelveyearold boys had looked at each other minds fizzing with questions so what can i do for you brian like i say it was my mums idea only she remembered you were in the police in edinburgh saw your name in the paper a while back and she thought you could maybe help with what our son i mean mine and janiss hes called damon whats he done rebus thought something minor and way outside his territory anyway hes vanished run away more like in a puff of smoke he was in this club with his pals see and he went have you tried calling the police rebus caught himself i mean fife constabulary oh aye mee sounded dismissive they asked a few questions like sniffed around a bit then said there was nothing they could do damons twentythree they say hes got a right to bugger off if he wants theyve got a point people run away all the time brian girl trouble maybe he was engaged maybe he got scared helens a lovely girl never a raised voice between them did he leave a note nothing i went through this with the police he didnt take any clothes or anything he didnt have any reason to go so you think somethings happened to him i know what those buggers are thinking they say we should give him another week or so to come back or at least get in touch but i know theyll only start doing something about it when the body turns up again rebus could have confirmed that this was only sensible again he knew mee wouldnt want to hear it the thing is brian he said i work in edinburgh fifes not my patch i mean i can make a couple of phone calls but its hard to know what else to do the voice was close to despair well if you could just do some thing like anything wed be very grateful it would put our minds at rest a pause my mum always speaks well of your dad hes remembered in this town and buried there too rebus thought he picked up a pen give me your phone number brian and almost an afterthought better give me the address too that evening he drove north out of edinburgh paid his toll at the forth bridge and crossed into fife it wasnt as if he never went there he had a brother in kirkcaldy but though they spoke on the phone every month or so there were seldom visits he couldnt think of any other family he still had in fife the place liked to call itself the kingdom and there were those who would agree that it was another country a place with its own linguistic and cultural currency for such a small place it seemed almost endlessly complex had seemed that way to rebus even when he was growing up to outsiders the place meant coastal scenery and st andrews or a stretch of motorway between edinburgh and dundee but the westcentral fife of rebuss childhood had been very different ruled by coal mines and linoleum dockyards and chemical plants an industrial landscape shaped by basic needs and producing people who were wary and inwardlooking with the blackest humour youd ever find theyd built new roads since rebuss last visit and knocked down a few more landmarks but the place didnt feel so very different from thirtyodd years before it wasnt such a great span of time after all except in human terms maybe not even then entering cardenden bowhill had disappeared from road signs in the s even if locals still knew it as a village distinct from its neighbour rebus slowed to see if the memories would turn out sweet or sour then he caught sight of a chinese takeaway and thought both of course brian and janis mees house was easy enough to find they were standing by the gate waiting for him rebus had been born in a prefab but brought up in a house just like the one he now parked in front of brian mee practically opened the car door for him and was trying to shake his hand while rebus was still emerging from his seat let the man catch his breath janis mee snapped she was still standing by the gate arms folded how have you been johnny and rebus realised that brian mee had married janis playfair the only girl in his long and troublestrewn life whod ever managed to knock him unconscious the narrow lowceilinged livingroom was full to bursting not just rebus and janis and brian but brians mother and mr and mrs playfair introductions had to be made and rebus guided to the seat by the fire the room was overheated a pot of tea was produced and on the table by rebuss armchair sat enough slices of cake to feed a football crowd hes a brainy one janiss mother said handing rebus a framed photo of damon mee plenty of certificates from school works hard saving up to get married the dates set for next august the photo showed a smiling imp not long out of school have you got anything more recent janis handed him a packet of snapshots from last summer rebus went through them slowly it saved having to look at the faces around him he felt like a doctor expected to produce an immediate diagnosis and remedy the photos showed a man in his early twenties still retaining the impish smile but recognisably older not careworn exactly but with something behind the eyes some disenchantment with adulthood a few of the photos showed damons parents we all went together brian explained janiss mum and dad my mum helen and her parents beaches a big white hotel poolside games where is it lanzarote janis said handing him his tea in a few of the pictures she was wearing a bikini good body for her age or any age come to that he tried not to linger can i keep a couple of the closeups he asked janis looked at him of damon she nodded and he put the other photos back in their packet were really grateful someone said janiss mum brians rebus couldnt tell does helen live locally practically round the corner id like to talk to her ill give her a bell brian mee said leaping to his feet damon had been drinking in some club guisers janis said handing round cigarettes its in kirkcaldy on the prom she shook her head looking just the same as she had that night of the school dance shaking her head telling him so far and no further in the town it used to be a department store its really called gaitanos mr playfair said rebus remembered him too he was an old man now where does damon work careful to stick to the present tense brian mee came back into the room same place i do i managed to get him a job in packaging hes been learning the ropes itll be management soon workingclass nepotism jobs handed down from father to son rebus was surprised it still existed helenll be here in a minute brian added are you not eating any cake inspector said mrs playfair helen cousins hadnt been able to add much to rebuss picture of damon and hadnt been there the night hed vanished but shed introduced him to someone who had andy peters andy had been part of the group at gaitanos thered been four of them theyd been in the same year at school and still met up once or twice a week sometimes to watch raith rovers if the weather was decent and the mood took them other times for an evening session in a pub or club it was only their third or fourth visit to guisers rebus thought of paying the club a visit but knew he should talk to the local cops first and decided that it could all wait until morning he knew he was jumping through hoops he didnt expect to find anything the locals had missed at best he could reassure the family that everything possible had been done next morning he made a few phone calls from his office trying to find someone who could be bothered to answer some casual questions from an edinburgh colleague he had one ally detective sergeant hendry at dunfermline cid but only reached him at the third attempt he asked hendry for a favour then put the phone down and got back to his own work but it was hard to concentrate he kept thinking about bowhill and about janis mee née playfair which led him eventually guiltily to thoughts of damon younger runaways tended to take the same route by bus or train or hitching and to london newcastle edinburgh or glasgow there were organisations who would keep an eye open for runaways and even if they wouldnt always reveal their whereabouts to the anxious families at least they could confirm that someone was alive and unharmed but a twentythreeyearold someone a bit cannier and with money to hand could be anywhere no destination was too distant he owned a passport and it hadnt turned up rebus knew too that damon had a current account at the local bank complete with cashcard and an interestbearing account with a building society in kirkcaldy the bank might be worth trying rebus picked up the telephone again the manager at first insisted that hed need something in writing but relented when rebus promised to fax him later rebus held while the manager went off to check and had doodled half a village complete with stream parkland and school by the time the man came back the most recent withdrawal was from a cash machine in kirkcaldy one hundred pounds on the twentysecond what time ive no way of knowing no other withdrawals since then no how uptodate is that information very of course a cheque especially if postdated would take longer to show up could you keep tabs on that account let me know if anyone starts using it again i could but id need it in writing and i might also need head office approval well see what you can do mr brayne its bain the bank manager said coldly putting down the phone ds hendry didnt get back to him until late afternoon gaitanos hendry said i dont know the place personally locals call it guisers its a pretty choice establishment two stabbings last year one inside the club itself the other in the back alley where the owner parks his merc local residents are always girning about the noise when the place lets out whats the owners name charles mackenzie nicknamed charmer he seems to be clean a couple of uniforms talked to him about damon mee but there was nothing to tell know how many missing persons there are every year theyre not exactly a whitehot priority god knows there are times ive felt like doing a runner myself havent we all did the woolly suits talk to anyone else at the club such as bar staff punters no someone did take a look at the security video for the night damon was there but they didnt see anything wheres the video now back with its rightful owner am i going to be stepping on toes if i ask to see it i think i can cover you i know you said this was personal john but why the interest im not sure i can explain there were words community history memory but rebus didnt think theyd be enough they mustnt be working you hard enough over there just the twentyfour hours every day three matty paine could tell a few stories hed worked his way round the world as a croupier cruise liners hed worked on and in nevada hed spent a couple of years in london dealing out cards and spinning the wheel for some of the wealthiest in the land faces youd recognise from the tv and the papers moguls royalty stars matty had seen them all but his best story the one people sometimes disbelieved was about the time hed been recruited to work in a casino in beirut this was at the height of the civil war bomb sites and rubble smoke and charred buildings refugees and regular bursts of smallarms fire and amazingly in the midst of it all or to be fair on the edge of it all a casino not exactly legal run from a hotel basement with torchlight when the generator failed and not much in the way of refreshments but with no shortage of punters cash bets dollars only and a management team of three who prowled the place like dobermanns since there was no surveillance and no other way to check that the games were being played honestly one of them had stood next to matty for a full forty minutes one session making him sweat despite the airconditioning hed reminded matty of the gaffers casinos employed to check on apprentices he knew the gaffers were there to protect him as much as the punters there were professional gamblers out there whod psych out a trainee watch them for hours whole nights and weeks looking for the flaw that would give them an edge over the house like when you were starting out you didnt always vary the force with which you span the wheel or sent the ball rolling and if they could suss it theyd get a pretty good idea which quadrant the ball was going to stop in good croupiers were immune to this a really good croupier one of a very select very highly thought of group could master the wheel and get the ball to land pretty well where they wanted of course this might be against the interests of the house too and in the end thats why the checkers were out there patrolling the tables they were looking out for the house in the end it all came down to the house and when things had got a wee bit too hot in london matty had come home meaning edinburgh though really he was from gullane perhaps the only boy ever to be raised there and not show the slightest interest in golf his father had played his mother too come to that maybe she still did he didnt keep in touch there had been an awkward moment at the casino when a neighbour from gullane days an old business friend of his fathers had turned up a bit the worse for wear and in tow with three other middleaged punters the neighbour had glanced towards matty from time to time but had eventually shaken his head unable to place the face does he know you one of the allseeing gaffers had asked quietly seeking out some scam against the house matty had shaken his head a neighbour from when i was growing up that was all just a ghost from the past he supposed his mother was still alive he could probably find out by opening the phone book but he wasnt that interested place your bets please ladies and gentlemen different houses had different styles you either did your spiel in english or french house rules changed too mattys strengths were roulette and blackjack but really he was happy in charge of any sort of game most houses liked that he was flexible it meant there was less chance of him trying some scam it was the onenote wonders who tried small stupid diddles his latest employers seemed fairly laid back they ran a clean casino which boasted only the very occasional high roller most of the punters were business people well enough heeled but canny with it you got husbands and wives coming in proof of a relaxed atmosphere there were younger punters too a lot of those were asians mainly chinese the money they changed according to the cashier had a funny feel and smell to it thats because they keep it in their underwear the day boss had told her the asians whatever they were sometimes worked in local restaurants you could smell the kitchen on their crumpled jackets and shirts fierce gamblers no game was ever played quickly enough for their liking theyd slap their chips down like they were in a playground betting game and they talked a lot almost never in english the gaffers didnt like that never could tell what they might be scheming but their money was good they seldom caused trouble and they lost a percentage same as everyone else daft bastards the night manager said know what they do with a big win go bung it on the geegees wheres the sense in that where indeed no point giving your money to a bookmaker when the casino would happily take it instead it wasnt really on for croupiers to be friends with the clients but sometimes it happened and it couldnt very well not happen with matty and stevie scoular since theyd been in the same year at school not that theyd known one another well stevie had been the football genius also more than fair at the hundred and two hundred metres swimming and basketball matty on the other hand had skived off games whenever possible forgetting to bring his kit or getting his mum to write him notes he was good at a couple of subjects maths and woodwork but never sat beside stevie in class they even lived at opposite ends of the town at playtime and lunchtime matty ran a card game threecard brag mostly sometimes pontoon playing for dinner money pocket money sweets and comics a few of the cards were nicked at the corners but the other players didnt seem to notice and matty got a reputation as lucky hed take bets on horse races too sometimes passing the bets on to an older boy who wouldnt be turned away by the local bookmaker often though matty would simply pocket the money and if someones horse happened to win hed say he couldnt get the bets on in time and hand back the stake he couldnt tell you exactly when it was that stevie had started spending less breaktime dribbling past half a dozen despairing pairs of legs and more hanging around the edges of the card school thing about threecard brag it doesnt take long to pick it up and even a moron can have a stab at playing soon enough stevie was losing his dinner money with the rest of them and mattys pockets were about bursting with loose change eventually stevie had seemed to see sense drifted away from the game and back to keepieup and dribbling but hed been hooked no doubt about it maybe only for a few weeks but a lot of those lunchtimes had been spent cadging sweets and apple cores the better to stave off hunger even then matty had thought hed be seeing stevie again it had just taken the best part of a decade that was all when stevie scoular walked into the casino people looked his way it was the done thing he was a sharp dresser young usually accompanied by women who looked like models when stevie had first walked into the morvena mattys heart had sunk they hadnt seen one another since school and here stevie was local boy made good a hero picture in the papers and plenty of money in the bank here was a schoolboy dream made flesh and what was matty he had stories he could tell but that was about it so hed been hoping stevie wouldnt grace his table or if he did that he wouldnt recognise him but stevie had seen him seemed to know him straight off and come bouncing up matty hello there stevie it was flattering really stevie hadnt become bigheaded or anything he took the whole thing the way his life had gone as a bit of a joke really hed made matty promise to meet him for a drink when his shift was over all through their conversation matty had been aware of gaffers hovering and when stevie wandered off to another table one of them muttered in mattys ear and another croupier took over from him he hadnt been in the plush back office that often just for the initial interview and to discuss a couple of big losses on his table the casinos owner mr mandelson was watching a football match on sky sports he was wellbuilt midforties his face pockmarked from childhood acne his hair was black slicked back from the forehead long at the collar he always seemed to know what he was about hows the table tonight he asked look mr mandelson i know were not supposed to be too friendly with the punters but stevie and me were at school together havent clapped eyes on one another since not till tonight easy matty easy mandelson motioned for him to sit down something to drink a smile no alcohol on shift mind ehh a coke maybe help yourself there was a fridge in the far corner stocked with white wine champagne and soft drinks a couple of the female croupiers said mandelson had tried it on with them plying them with booze but he didnt seem upset by a refusal they still had their jobs there were seven female croupiers all told and only two had spoken to matty about it it made him wonder about the other five he took a coke and sat down again so you and stevie scoular eh i havent seen him in here before i think he only recently found out about the place hes been in a few times dropped some hefty bets mandelson was staring at him you and stevie eh look if youre worried just take me off whatever table hes playing nothing like that matty mandelsons face broke into a grin its nice to have a friend eh nice to meet up again after all these years dont you worry about anything stevies the king of edinburgh as long as he keeps scoring goals were all his subjects he paused nice to know someone who knows the king almost makes me feel like royalty myself on you go now matty matty got up leaving the coke unopened and dont you go upsetting that young man we dont want to put him off his game do we four it had taken a couple of days to get the tape from gaitanos at first they thought theyd wiped it and then theyd sent the wrong days recording but at last rebus had the right tape and had watched it at home half a dozen times before deciding he could use someone who knew what he was doing and a video machine that would freezeframe without the screen looking like a technical problem now hed seen all there was to see hed watched a young man cease to exist of course hendry was right a lot of people disappeared every year sometimes they turned up again dead or alive and sometimes they didnt what did it have to do with rebus beyond the promise to a family that hed make sure the fife police hadnt missed something maybe the pull wasnt damon mee but bowhill itself and maybe even then the bowhill of his past rather than the town as it stood today he was working the damon mee case in his free time which since he was on day shift at st leonards meant the evenings hed checked again with the bank no money had been withdrawn from any machines since the twentysecond and with damons building society no money had been withdrawn from that account either even this wasnt unknown in the case of a runaway sometimes they wanted to shed their whole history which meant ditching their identity and everything that went with it rebus had passed a description of matty to hostels and dropin centres in edinburgh and faxed the same description to similar centres in glasgow newcastle aberdeen and london hed also faxed details to the national missing persons bureau in london he checked with a colleague who knew about mispers that hed done about all he could not far off it she confirmed its like looking for a needle in a haystack without knowing which field to start with how big a problem is it she puffed out her cheeks last figures i saw were for the whole of britain i think there are around a year those are the reported mispers you can add a few thousand for the ones nobody notices theres a nice distinction actually if nobody knows youre missing are you really missing afterwards rebus telephoned janis mee and told her she might think about running up some flyers and putting them up in positions of prominence in nearby towns maybe even handing them out to saturday shoppers or evening drinkers in kirkcaldy a photo of damon a brief physical description and what he was wearing the night he left she said shed already thought of doing so but that it made his disappearance seem so final then she broke down and cried and john rebus thirtyodd miles away asked if she wanted him to drop by ill be all right she said sure well rebus reasoned that he was going to go to fife anyway he had to drop the tape back to gaitanos and wanted to see the club when it was lively hed take the photos of damon with him and show them around hed ask about the candyfloss blonde the technician who had worked with the videotape had transferred a still to his computer and managed to boost the quality rebus had some hard copies in his pocket maybe other people whod been queuing at the bar would remember something maybe his first stop however was the cemetery he didnt have any flowers to put on his parents grave but he crouched beside it fingers touching the grass the inscription was simple just names and dates really and underneath not dead but at rest in the arms of the lord he wasnt sure whose idea that had been not his certainly the headstones carved lettering was inlaid with gold but it had already faded from his mothers name he touched the surface of the marble expecting it to be cold but finding a residual warmth there a blackbird nearby was trying to worry food from the ground rebus wished it luck by the time he reached janiss brian was home from work rebus told them what hed done so far after which brian nodded apologised and said he had a burns club meeting the two men shook hands when the door closed janis and rebus exchanged a look and then a smile i see that bruise finally faded she said rebus rubbed his right cheek it was a hell of a punch funny how strong you can get when youre angry sorry she laughed bit late to apologise it was just it was everything she said summer holidays coming up all of us leaving school you going off to join the army the last school dance before all of that thats what it was she paused do you know what happened to mitch she watched rebus shake his head last i heard she said he was living somewhere down south the two of you used to be so close yes she laughed again johnny it was a long time ago dont look so solemn she paused ive sometimes wondered ach not for years but just now and then i used to wonder what would have happened if you hadnt punched me she nodded if wed stayed together well you cant turn the clock back eh would the world be any better if we could she stared at the window not really seeing it damon would still be here she said quietly a tear escaped her eye and she fussed for a handkerchief in her pocket rebus got up and made towards her then the front door opened and he retreated my mum janis smiled she usually pops in around this time its like a railway station around here hard to find any privacy then mrs playfair walked into the livingroom hello inspector thought that was your car is there any news im afraid not rebus said janis got to her feet and hugged her mother the crying starting afresh there there pet mrs playfair said quietly there there rebus walked past the two of them without saying a word it was still early when he reached gaitanos he had a word with one of the bouncers who was keeping warm in the lobby until things started getting busy and the man lumbered off to fetch charles mackenzie aka charmer it seemed strange to rebus here he was standing in the very foyer hed stared at for so long on the video monitor the camera was high up in one corner with nothing to show whether it was working rebus gave it a wave anyway if he disappeared tonight it could be his farewell to the world inspector rebus theyd spoken on the phone the man who came forward to shake rebuss hand stood about five feet four and was as thin as a cocktail glass rebus placed him in his midfifties he wore a powderblue suit and an opennecked white shirt with suntan and gold jewellery beneath his hair was silver and thinning but as wellcut as the suit come through to the office rebus followed mackenzie down a carpeted corridor to a glossblack door with a sign on it saying private there was no door handle mackenzie unlocked the door and motioned for rebus to go in after you sir rebus said you never knew what could be waiting behind a locked door what greeted rebus this time was an office which seemed to double as a broomcupboard mops and a vacuum cleaner rested against one wall a bank of screens spread across three filing cabinets showed what was happening inside and outside the club unlike the video rebus had watched these screens each showed a certain location are these recording rebus asked mackenzie shook his head weve got a roaming monitor and thats the only recording we get but this way if we spot trouble anywhere we can watch it unfold like that knifing in the alley messed up my mercedes so i heard is that when you called the police when your car stopped being a bystander mackenzie laughed and wagged a finger but didnt answer rebus couldnt see where hed earned his nickname the guy had all the charm of sandpaper i brought back your video rebus placed it on the desk all right to record over it now i suppose so rebus handed over the computerenhanced photograph the missing person is slightly right of centre second row is that his doll do you know her wish i did you havent seen her before she doesnt look the sort id forget rebus took back the picture mind if i show this around the place is practically empty i thought i might stick around mackenzie frowned and studied the backs of his hands well you know its not that i dont want to help or anything but well its hardly conducive to a party atmosphere is it thats our slogan the best party of your life every night and i dont think a police officer mooching around asking questions is going to add to the ambience i quite understand mr mackenzie i was being thoughtless mackenzie lifted his hands palms towards rebus no problem the hands were saying and youre quite right rebus continued in fact id be a lot quicker if i had some assistance say a dozen uniforms that way i wouldnt be mooching around for nearly so long in fact lets make it a couple of dozen well be in and out quick as a virgins first poke mind if i use your phone whoah wait a minute look all i was saying was look how much do you want sorry sir mackenzie reached into a desk drawer lifted out a brick of twenties pulled about five notes free will this do it rebus sat back am i to understand youre trying to offer me a cash incentive to leave the premises whatever just slope off eh rebus stood up to me mr mackenzie thats an open invitation to stay so he stayed the looks he got from staff made him feel like a football fan trapped on the oppositions turf the way they all shook their heads as soon as he held up the photo he knew word had gone around he had a little more luck with the punters a couple of lads had seen the woman before last week was it one asked the other maybe the week before not long ago anyway the other agreed cracker isnt she has she been in since havent seen her just that one night didnt quite get the nerve up to ask for a dance was she with anyone no idea they didnt recognise damon mee though they said they never paid much attention to blokes were not that way inclined sweetie the place was still only half full but the bass was loud enough to make rebus feel queasy he managed to order an orange juice at the bar and just sat there looking at the photo the woman interested him the way her head was angled the way her mouth was open she could have been saying something to damon a minute later he was gone had she said shed meet him somewhere had something happened at that meeting hed shown the photo to damons mates from that night they remembered seeing her but swore damon hadnt introduced himself she seemed sort of cold one of them had said you know like she wanted to be left alone rebus had studied the video again watched her progress towards the bar showing no apparent interest in damons leaving but then shed turned and started pushing her way back through the throng no drink to show for her long wait at midnight exactly shed left the nightclub the final shot was of her turning left along the pavement watched by a few people who were waiting to get in and now charles mackenzie wanted to give rebus money at three quid for an orange juice maybe he should have taken it if the place had been heaving maybe he wouldnt have noticed them he was finishing his second drink and trying not to feel like a leper in a childrens ward when he recognised one of the doormen there was another man with him tall and fat and pale his idea of clubbing was probably the connection of baseball bat to skull the bouncer was pointing rebus out to him here we go rebus thought theyve brought in the professionals the fat man said something to the bouncer and they both retreated to the foyer leaving rebus with an empty glass and only one good reason to order another drink get it over with he thought sliding from his bar stool and walking around the dance floor there was always the fire exit but it led on to the alley and if they were waiting for him there the only witness would be mackenzies mercedes he wanted things kept as public as possible the street outside would be busy no shortage of onlookers and possible good samaritans or at the very least someone to call for an ambulance he paused in the foyer and saw that the bouncer was back at his post on the front door no sign of the fat man then he glanced along the corridor towards mackenzies office and saw the fat man planted outside the door he had his arms folded in front of him and wasnt going anywhere rebus walked outside the air had seldom tasted so good he tried to calm himself with a few deep breaths there was a car parked at the kerbside a goldcoloured rollsroyce with nobody in the drivers seat rebus wasnt the only one admiring the car but he was probably alone in memorising its number plate he moved his own car to where he could see the roller then sat tight half an hour later the fat man emerged looking to left and right he walked to the car unlocked it and held open the back door only now did another figure emerge from the club rebus caught a swishing fulllength black coat sleek hair and chiselled face the man slipped into the car and the fat man closed the door and squeezed in behind the steering wheel like them or not you had to admire rollers they carried tonnage five back in edinburgh he parked his car and sat in it smoking his eleventh cigarette of the day he sometimes played this game with himself ill have one more tonight and deduct one from tomorrows allowance or he would argue that any cigarette after midnight came from the next days stash hed lost count along the way but reckoned by now he should be going whole days without a ciggie to balance the books well when it came down to it ten cigarettes a day or twelve thirteen fourteen what difference did it make the street he was parked on was quiet residential for the most part with big houses there was a basement bar on the corner but it did mostly lunchtime business from the offices on neighbouring streets by ten the place was usually locked up taxis rippled past him and the occasional drunk hands in pockets would weave slowly homewards a few of the taxis stopped just in front of him and disgorged their fares who would then climb half a dozen steps and push open the door to the morvena casino rebus had never been inside the place he placed the occasional bet on the horses but that was about it gave up doing the football pools he bought a national lottery ticket when opportunity arose but often didnt get round to checking the numbers he had half a dozen tickets lying around any one of which could be his fortune he quite liked the notion that he might have won a million and not know it preferred it in fact to the idea of actually having the million in his bank account what would he do with a million pounds same as hed do with fifty thou selfdestruct only faster janis had asked him about mitch roy mitchell rebuss best friend at school the more time rebus had spent with her the less hed seen of mitch theyd been going to join the army together hoping they might get the same regiment until mitch lost his eye that had been the end of that the army hadnt wanted him any more rebus had headed off sent mitch a couple of letters but by the time his first leave came mitch had already left bowhill rebus had stopped writing after that when the morvenas door opened next it was so eight or nine young people could leave the shift changeover three of them turned one way the rest another rebus watched the group of three at the first set of lights two kept going and one crossed the road and took a left rebus started his engine and followed when the lights turned green he signalled left and sounded his horn then pulled the car over and wound down his window mr rebus the young man said hello matty lets go for a drive officers from other cities people rebus met from time to time would remark on how cushy he had it in edinburgh such a beautiful place and prosperous so little crime they thought to be dangerous a city had to look dangerous london manchester liverpool these places were dangerous in their eyes not edinburgh not this sleepy walkingtour with its monuments and museums tourism aside the lifeblood of the city was its commerce and edinburghs commerce banking insurance and the like was discreet the city hid its secrets well and its vices too potentially troublesome elements had been moved to the sprawling council estates which ringed the capital and any crimes committed behind the thick stone walls of the city centres tenements and houses were often muffled by those same walls which was why every good detective needed his contacts rebus took them on a circuit canonmills to ferry road back up to comely bank and through stockbridge into the new town again and they talked i know we had a sort of gentlemans agreement matty rebus said but im about to find out youre no gentleman rebus smiled youre ahead of me i wondered how long it would take matty paused stared through the windscreen you know ill say no will you i said at the start no ratting on anyone i work with or work for just the punters not even many of them its not like ive been milking you matty ill bet youve dozens of stories you havent told me i work tables mr rebus people dont place a bet and then start yacking about some job theyve pulled or some scam theyre running no but they meet friends they have a drink get mellow its a relaxing place so ive heard and maybe then they talk ive not held anything back matty matty rebus shook his head its funny i was just thinking tonight about that night we met do you remember how could he forget a couple of drinks after work a car borrowed from a friend who was away on holiday matty hadnt been back long driving through the town was great especially with a buzz on streets glistening after the rain late night mostly taxis for company he just drove and drove and as the streets grew quieter he pushed the accelerator a bit further caught a string of green lights then saw one turning red he didnt know how good the tyres were imagined braking hard and skidding in the wet fuck it he put his foot down just missed the cyclist the guy was coming through on green and had to twist his front wheel hard to avoid contact then teetered and fell on to the road mattys foot eased off the accelerator thought about the brake then went back on the accelerator again thats when he saw the cop car and thought i cant afford this theyd breathalysed him and taken him to st leonards where hed sat around and let the machinery chew him up would it come to a trial would there be a report in the papers how could he keep his name from getting around hed worked himself up into a right state by the time detective inspector john rebus had sat down across from him i cant afford this matty had blurted out sorry hed swallowed and tried to find a story i work in a casino any black mark against me theyll boot me out look if its a question of compensation or anything like ill buy him a new bike rebus had picked up a sheet of paper drunk driving in a borrowed car you werent insured to drive running a red light leaving the scene of an accident rebus had shaken his head read the sheet through one more time and then put it down and looked up at matty what casino did you say you work for later hed given matty two business cards both with his phone number the first ones for you to tear up in disgust hed said the other ones to keep have we got a deal look mr rebus matty said now as the car stopped for lights on raeburn place im doing the best i can i want to know whats happening behind the scenes at the morvena i wouldnt know anything at all it doesnt matter how small it seems any stories gossip anything overheard ever seen the owner entertain people in his office maybe open the place for a private party names faces anything at all put your mind to it matty just put your mind to it theyd skin me alive whos they matty swallowed mr mandelson hes the owner right right on paper at least what i need to know is who might be pulling his strings i cant see anyone pulling his strings youd be surprised hard bastard is he id say so given you grief matty shook his head do you see much of him not much matty said not he might have added until recently at any rate rebus dropped him at the foot of broughton street headed back up to leith walk and along york place on to queen street he passed the casino again and slowed a frown on his face at the next set of lights he did a uturn so he could be sure yes it was the roller from gaitanos no doubt about it parked outside the morvena six mind if i join you rebus was eating breakfast in the canteen and wishing there was more caffeine in the coffee or more coffee in the coffee come to that he nodded to the empty chair and siobhan sat down heavy night she said believe it or not i was on orange juice she bit into her muffin washing it down with milk harry tells me you had him working a tape harry our video wizard he said it was a missing person news to me its not official the son of an old schoolfriend of mine standing at a bar one minute and gone the next rebus looked at her and she smiled harrys a great one for gossip im working on it in my own time need any help handy with a crystal ball are you but rebus dug into his pocket and brought out the still from the video thats damon there he said pointing whos that with him i wish i knew shes not with him i dont know who she is youve asked around i was at the club last night a few punters remembered her male punters she waited till rebus nodded you were asking the wrong sex any man would have given her the onceover but only superficially a woman on the other hand would have seen her as competition have you never noticed women in nightclubs theyve got eyes like lasers plus what if she visited the loo rebus was interested now what if she did thats where women talk maybe someone spoke to her maybe she said something back ears would have been listening siobhan stared at the photo funny its almost like shes got an aura how do you mean like shes shining interior light exactly no thats what your friend harry said its the interior lighting that gives that effect maybe he didnt know what he was saying im not sure i know what youre saying some religions believe in spirit guides theyre supposed to lead you to the next world you mean this ones not the end she smiled depends on your religion well its plenty enough for me he looked at the photo again i was sort of joking you know about her being a spirit guide i know he met with helen cousins that night they spoke over a drink in the auld hoose rebus hadnt been in the place in quarter of a century and thered been changes theyd installed a pool table you werent invited along that night rebus asked her she shook her head she was twenty three years younger than damon the fingers of her right hand played with her engagement ring rolling it sliding it off over the knuckle and then back down again she had short lifeless brown hair dark tired eyes and acne around her mouth i was out with the girls see that was how we played it one night a week the boys would go off on their own and wed go somewhere else then another night wed all get together do you know anyone who was at gaitanos that night apart from damon and his pals she chewed her bottom lip while considering the ring came off her finger and bounced once before hitting the floor she stooped to pick it up its always doing that you better watch it youre going to lose it she pushed the ring back on yes she said corinne and jacky were there corinne and jacky she nodded where can i find them a phone call brought them to the auld hoose rebus got in the round bacardi and coke for corinne bacardi and blackcurrant for jacky a second vodka and orange for helen and another bottle of noalcohol lager for himself he eyed the optics behind the bar his mean little drink was costing more than a whisky something was telling him to indulge in a teachers maybe its my spirit guide he thought dismissing the idea corinne had long black hair crimped with curling tongs her pal jacky was tiny with dyed platinum hair when he got back to the table they were in a huddle exchanging gossip rebus took out the photograph again look corinne said theres damon so they all had a good look then rebus touched his finger to the strapless aura remember her helen prickled visibly who is she yeah she was there jacky said was she with anyone didnt see her up dancing isnt that why people go to clubs well its one reason all three broke into a giggle you didnt speak to her no not even in the toilets i saw her in there corinne said she was doing her eyes did she say anything she seemed sort of stuckup snobby jacky agreed rebus tried to think of another question and couldnt they ignored him for a while as they exchanged news it was like they hadnt seen each other in a year at one point helen got up to use the toilet rebus expected the other two to accompany her but only corinne did so he sat with jacky for a moment then for want of anything else to say asked her what she thought of damon he meant about damon disappearing but she didnt take it that way ach hes all right just all right well you know damons hearts in the right place but hes a bit thick a bit slow i mean really the impression rebus had received from damons family had been of a geniusinwaiting he suddenly realised just how superficial his own portrait of damon was siobhans words should have been warning so far hed heard only one side of damon helen likes him though i suppose so theyre engaged it happens doesnt it ive got friends who got engaged just so they could throw a party she looked around the bar then leaned towards him they used to have some mega arguments what about jealousy i suppose shed see him notice someone or hed say shed been letting some guy chat her up just the usual she turned the photo around so it faced her she looks like a dream doesnt she i remember she was dressed to kill made the rest of us spit but youd never seen her before jacky shook her head no no one seemed to have seen her before nobody knew who she was unlikely then that she was local were there any buses in that night that doesnt happen at gaitanos she told him its not in enough any more theres a new place in dunfermline that gets the busloads jacky tapped the photo you think shes gone off with damon rebus looked at her and saw behind the eyeliner to a sharp intelligence its possible he said quietly i dont think so she said she wouldnt be interested and he wouldnt have had the guts on his way home rebus dropped into st leonards the amount he was paying in bridge tolls he was thinking about a season ticket there was a fax on his desk hed been promised it in the afternoon but thered been a delay it identified the owner of the rollsroyce as a mr richard mandelson with an address in juniper green mr mandelson had no criminal record outstanding whether for motoring offences or anything else rebus tried to imagine some poor parking warden trying to give the roller a ticket with the fat man behind the wheel there were a few more facts about mr mandelson including last known occupation casino manager seven matty and stevie scoular saw one another socially now stevie would sometimes phone and invite matty to some party or dinner or just for a drink at the same time as matty was flattered he did wonder what stevies angle was had even come out and asked him i mean hed said im just a toerag from the school playground and you well youre superstevie youre the king aye if you believe the papers stevie had finished his drink perrier he had a game the next day i dont know matty maybe its that i miss all that all what schooldays it was a laugh back then wasnt it matty had frowned not really remembering but the life youve got now stevie man people would kill for it and stevie had nodded looking suddenly sad another time a couple of kids had asked stevie for his autograph then had turned and asked matty for his thinking that whoever he was he had to be somebody stevie had laughed at that said something about it being a lesson in humility again matty didnt get it there were times when stevie seemed to be on a different planet maybe it was understandable the pressure he was under stevie seemed to remember a lot more about school than matty did teachers names the lot they talked about gullane too what a boring place to grow up sometimes they didnt talk much at all just took out a couple of dolls stevie would always bring one along for matty she wouldnt be quite as gorgeous as stevies but that was all right matty could understand that he was soaking it all up enjoying it while it lasted he had half an idea that stevie and him would be best friends for life and another that stevie would dump him soon and find some other distraction he thought stevie needed him right now much more than he needed stevie so he soaked up what he could started filing the stories away for future use tweaking them here and there tonight they took in a couple of bars a bit of a drive in stevies beamer he preferred bmws to porsches more space for passengers they ended up at a club but didnt stay long stevie had a game the next day he was always very conscientious that way perrier and early nights stevie dropped matty off outside his flat sounding the horn as he roared away matty hadnt spotted the other car but he heard a door opening looked across the road and recognised malibu straight off malibu was mr mandelsons driver hed eased himself out of the roller and was holding open the back door while looking over to matty so matty crossed the street as he did so he walked into malibus shadow cast by the sodium street lamp at that moment though he didnt know what was about to happen he realised he was lost get in matty the voice of course was mandelsons matty got into the car and malibu closed the door after him then kept guard outside they werent going anywhere ever been in a roller before matty i dont think so youd remember if you had i could have had one years back but only by buying secondhand i wanted to wait until i had the cash for a nice new one that leather smell you dont get it with any other car mandelson lit a cigar the windows were closed and the car started filling with sour smoke know how i came to afford a brand new roller matty hard work mattys mouth was dry cars he thought rebuss stevies and now this one plus of course the one hed borrowed that night the one that had brought him to this dont be stupid my dad worked thirty years in a shop six days a week and he still couldnt have made the downpayment faith matty thats the key you have to believe in yourself and sometimes you have to trust other people strangers some of them or people you dont like people its hard to trust thats the gamble lifes making with you and if you place your bet sometimes you get lucky except its not luck not entirely see there are odds like in every game and thats where judgment comes in i like to think im a good judge of character only now did mandelson turn to look at him there seemed to matty to be nothing behind the eyes nothing at all yes sir he said for want of anything better that was stevie dropped you off eh matty nodded now your man stevie hes got something else something we havent discussed yet hes got a gift hes had to work of course but the thing was there to begin with dont ask me where it came from or why it should have been given to him in particular thats one for the philosophers and i dont claim to be a philosopher what i am is a businessman and a gambler only i dont bet on nags or dogs or a turn of the cards i bet on people im betting on you matty me mandelson nodded barely visible inside the cloud of smoke i want you to talk to stevie on my behalf i want you to get him to do me a favour matty rubbed his forehead with his fingers he knew what was coming but didnt want to hear it i saw a recent interview mandelson went on where he told the reporter he always gave a hundred and ten per cent all i want is to knock maybe twenty per cent off for next saturdays game you know what im saying next saturday an away tie at kirkcaldy stevie expected to run rings around the raith rovers defence he wont do it matty said come to that neither will i no mandelson laughed a hand landed on mattys thigh you fucked up in london son they knew youd end up taking a croupiers job somewhere else its the only thing you know how to do so they phoned around and eventually they phoned me i told them id never heard of you that can change matty want me to talk to them again id tell them you lied to them the first time mandelson shrugged i can live with that but what do you think theyll do to you matty they were pretty angry about whatever scheme it was you pulled id say they were furious matty felt like he was going to heave he was sweating his lungs toxic he wont do it he said again be persuasive matty youre his friend remind him that his tabs up to three and a half all he has to do is ease off for one game and the tabs history and matty ill know if youve talked to him or not so no games eh or you might find yourself with no place left to hide eight rebus searched his flat but came up with only half a dozen snapshots two of his exwife rhona posing with samantha their daughter back when sammy was seven or eight two further shots of sammy in her teens one showing his father as a young man kissing the woman who would become rebuss mother and a final photograph a family grouping showing uncles aunts and cousins whose names rebus didnt know there were other photographs of course at least there had been but not here not in the flat he guessed rhona still kept some maybe his brother michael had the others but they could be anywhere rebus hadnt thought of himself as the kind to spend long nights with the family album using it as a crutch to memory always with the fear that remembrance would yield to sentiment if i died tonight he thought what would i bequeath to the world looking around the answer was nothing the thought scared him and worst of all it made him want a drink and not just one drink but a dozen instead of which he drove north back into fife it had been overcast all day and the evening was warm he didnt know what he was doing knew he had precious little to say to either of damons parents and yet thats where he ended up hed had the destination in mind all along brian mee answered the door wearing a smart suit and just finishing knotting his tie sorry brian rebus said are you off out in ten minutes come in anyway is it damon rebus shook his head and saw the tension in brians face turn to relief yes a visit in person wouldnt be good news would it good news had to be given immediately by telephone not by a knock at the door rebus should have realised hed been the bearer of bad news often enough in his time sorry brian he repeated they were in the hallway janiss voice came from above asking who it was its johnny her husband called back then to rebus its all right to call you that of course its my name isnt it he could have added again after all this time he looked at brian remembering the way theyd sometimes mistreated him at school not that barney had seemed to mind but who could tell for sure and then that night of the last school dance brian had been there for mitch brian had been there rebus had not hed been too busy losing janis and losing consciousness she was coming downstairs now ill be back in a sec brian said heading up past her you look terrific rebus told her the blue dress was wellchosen her makeup highlighting all the right features of her busy face she managed a smile no news sorry he said again just thought id see how you are oh were pining away another smile tinged by shame this time its a dinnerdance we bought the tickets months back its for the jolly beggars nobody expects you to sit at home every night janis but all the same her cheeks grew flushed and her eyes sought his were not going to find him are we not easily our best bets that hell get in touch if he can she said quietly come on janis he put his hands on her shoulders like they were strangers and about to dance you might hear from him tomorrow or it might take months and meantime life goes on eh something like that she smiled again blinking back tears why dont you come with us john rebus dropped his hands from her shoulders i havent danced in years so youd be rusty thanks janis but not tonight know something i bet they play the same records we used to dance to at school it was his turn to smile brian was coming back downstairs patting his hair into place youd be welcome to join us johnny he said ive another appointment brian maybe next time eh lets make that a promise they went out to their cars together janis pecked him on the cheek brian shook his hand he watched them drive off then headed to the cemetery it was dark and the gates were locked so rebus sat in his car and smoked a cigarette he thought about his parents and the rest of his family and remembered stories about bowhill stories which seemed inextricable from family history mining tragedies a girl found drowned in the river ore a holiday car crash which had erased an entire family then there was johnny thomson celtic goalkeeper injured during an old firm match he was in his early twenties when he died and was buried behind those gates not far from rebuss parents not dead but at rest in the arms of the lord the lord had to be a bodybuilder from family he turned to friends and tried recalling a dozen names to put to faces he remembered from schooldays other friends people hed known in the army the sas all the people hed dealt with during his career in the police villains hed put away some whod slipped through his fingers people hed interviewed suspected questioned broken the worst kind of news to acquaintances from the oxford bar and all the other pubs where hed ever been a regular local shopkeepers jesus the list was endless all these people whod played a part in his life in shaping who he was and how he acted how he felt about things all of them out there somewhere and nowhere gathered together only inside his head and chief among them tonight brian and janis that night of the school dance it was true hed been drunk elated hed felt he could do anything be anything because hed come to a decision that day he wouldnt join the army hed stay in bowhill with janis apply for a job at the dockyard his dad had told him not to be so stupid shortsighted was the word hed used but what did parents know about their childrens desires so hed drunk some beer and headed off to the dance his thoughts only of janis tonight hed tell her and mitch of course hed have to tell mitch tell him hed be heading into the army alone but mitch wouldnt mind hed understand as best friends had to but while rebus had been outside with janis his friend mitch was being cornered by four teenagers who considered themselves his enemies this was their last chance for revenge and theyd gone in hard kicking and punching four against one until barney had waded in shrugging off blows and dragged mitch to safety but one kick had done the damage dislodging a retina mitchs vision stayed fuzzy in that eye for a few days then disappeared and where had rebus been out cold on the concrete by the bike sheds and why had he never thanked barney mee he blinked now and sniffed wondering if he was coming down with a cold hed had this idea when he came back to bowhill that the place would seem beyond redemption that hed be able to tell himself it had lost its sense of community become just another town for him to pass through maybe hed wanted to put it behind him well it hadnt worked he got out of the car and looked around the street was dead he reached up and hauled himself over the iron railings and walked a circuit of the cemetery for an hour or so and felt strangely at peace nine so whats the panic matty after a home draw with rangers stevie was ready for a night on the town oneone and of course hed scored his teams only goal the reporters would be busy filing their copy saying for the umpteenth time that he was his sides hero that without him they were a very ordinary team indeed rangers had known that stevies marker had been out for blood sliding studsfirst into tackles which stevie had done his damnedest to avoid hed come out of the game with a couple of fresh bruises and grazes a nick on one knee but to his managers all too palpable relief fit to play again midweek i said whats the panic matty had worried himself sleepless he knew he had several options speak to stevie that was one of them another was not to speak to him but tell mandelson he had then it would be down to whether or not mandelson believed him option three do a runner only mandelson was right about that he was running out of places to hide with two casino bosses out for his blood how could he ever pick up another croupiers job if he spoke with stevie hed lose a newfound friend but to stay silent well there was very little percentage in it so here he was in stevies flat having demanded to see him in the corner a tv was replaying a tape of the afternoons match there was no commentary just the sounds of the terraces and the dugouts no panic he said now playing for time stevie stared at him you all right want a drink or something maybe a vodka anything in it ill take it as it comes stevie poured him a drink matty had been here half an hour now and they still hadnt talked the telephone had hardly stopped reporters questions family and friends offering congratulations stevie had shrugged off the superlatives matty took the drink swallowed it wondering if he could still walk away then he remembered malibu and saw shadows falling thing is stevie he said you know my boss at the morvena mr mandelson i owe him money of course i know him he says we could do something about that what my tab stevie was checking himself in the mirror having changed into his onthetown clothes i dont get it he said well stevie matty thought it was nice knowing you pal all you have to do is ease off next saturday stevie frowned and turned from the mirror away to raith he came and sat down opposite matty he told you to tell me he waited till matty nodded that bastard whats in it for him matty wriggled on the leather sofa ive been thinking about it raith are going through a bad patch but you know yourself that if youre taken out of the equation then theyd be up against not very much my boss has told everybody to get the ball to me if they spend the whole game doing that and i dont do anything with it matty nodded what i think is the odds will be on you scoring nobodyll be expecting raith to put one in the net so mandelsons cash will be on a goalless draw and hell get odds spread a lot of small bets around bastard stevie said again how did he get you into this matty matty shifted again something i did in london secrets eh hard things to keep stevie got up went to the mirror again and just stood there hands by his sides staring into it there was no emotion in his voice when he spoke tell him he can fuck himself matty had to choke out the words you sure thats the message cheerio matty matty rose shakily to his feet what am i going to do cheerio matty stevie was as still as a statue as matty walked to the door and let himself out mandelson sat at his desk playing with a cartier pen hed taken from a punter that day the man was overdue on a payment the pen was by way of a gift so he asked matty matty sat on the chair and licked his lips there was no offer of a drink today this was just business malibu stood by the door matty took a deep breath the last act of a drowning man its on he said mandelson looked up at him stevie went for it eventually matty said youre sure as sure as i can be well that better be watertight or you might find yourself going for a swim with heavy legs know what i mean matty held the dark gaze and nodded mandelson glanced towards malibu both of them were smiling then he picked up the telephone you know matty he said pushing numbers im doing you a favour youre doing yourself a favour he listened to the receiver mr hamilton please then to matty see what youre doing here is saving your job i overstretched myself matty i wouldnt like that to get around but im trusting you if this comes off and it better then youve earned that trust he tapped the receiver it wasnt all my own money either but this will keep the morvena alive and kicking he motioned for matty to leave malibu tapped his shoulder as an incentive topper mandelson was saying as matty left the room its locked up how much are you in for matty bided his time and waited till his shift was over he walked out of the smart new town building like a latterday lazarus and found the nearest payphone then had to fumble through all the rubbish in his pockets stuff that must have meant something once upon a time until he found the card the card with a phone number on it the following saturday stevie scoular scored his teams only goal in their win over raith rovers and mandelson sat alone in his office his eyes on the teletext results his hand rested on the telephone receiver he was expecting a call from topper hamilton he couldnt seem to stop blinking like there was a grain of sand in either eye he buzzed the reception desk told them to tell malibu he was wanted mandelson didnt know how much time he had but he knew he would make it count a word with stevie scoular see if matty really had put the proposition to him then matty himself matty was a definite no matter what matty was about to be put out of the game the knock at the door had to be malibu mandelson barked for him to come in but when the door opened two strangers sauntered in like they owned the place mandelson sat back in his chair hands on the desk he was almost relieved when they introduced themselves as police officers im detective inspector rebus the younger one said this is chief superintendent watson and youve come about the benevolent fund right rebus sat down unasked his eyes drifting to the tv screen and the results posted there looks like you just lost a packet im sorry to hear it did topper take a beating too mandelson made fists of his hands that wee bastard rebus was shaking his head matty did his best only there was something he didnt know seems you didnt know either topper will be doubly disappointed what farmer watson still standing provided the answer ever heard of big ger cafferty mandelson nodded hes been in barlinnie a while used to be the biggest gangster on the east coast probably still is and hes a fan of stevies gets videotapes of all his games he almost sends him love letters mandelson frowned so so stevies covered rebus said try fucking with him youre asking big ger to bend over your little proposal has probably already made it back to cafferty mandelson swallowed and felt suddenly drymouthed there was no way stevie was going to throw that game rebus said quietly matty mandelson choked the sentence off told you it was fixed he was scared turdless what else was he going to say but mattys mine you dont touch him not that youd get the chance the farmer added not with topper and cafferty after your blood malibu will be a big help the way he took off five minutes ago in the roller watson walked up to the desk looming over mandelson like a mountain youve got two choices son you can talk or you can run youve got nothing i saw you that night at gaitanos rebus said if youre going to lay out big bets where better than fife optimistic raith fans might have bet on a goalless draw you got charmer mackenzie to place the bets locally spreading them around that way it looked less suspicious which was why mackenzie had wanted rebus out of there whatever the price hed been about to do some business besides rebus continued when it comes down to it what choice do you have you either talk to us the farmer said or you disappear people do it all the time and it never stops rebus could have added because its part of the dance shifting partners people you shared the floor with it all changed and it only ended when you disappeared from the hall and sometimes sometimes it didnt even end there all right mandelson said at last the way theyd known he would all colour gone from his face his voice hollow what do you want to know lets start with topper hamilton the farmer said sounding like a kid unwrapping his birthday present it was wednesday morning when rebus got the phone call from a mr bain it took him a moment to place the name damons bank manager yes mr bain what can i do for you damon mee inspector you wanted us to keep an eye on any transactions rebus leaned forward in his chair thats right thereve been two withdrawals from cash machines both in central london rebus grabbed a pen where exactly tottenham court road was three days ago fifty pounds next day it was finsbury park same amount fifty pounds a day enough to live on enough to pay for a cheap bed and breakfast and two extra meals how much is left in the account mr bain a little under six hundred pounds enough for twelve days there were several ways it could go damon could get himself a job or when the money ran out he could try begging or he could return home rebus thanked bain and telephoned janis john she said we got a postcard this morning a postcard saying damon was in london and doing fine a postcard of apology for any fright hed given them a postcard saying he needed some time to get my head straight a postcard which ended see you soon the picture on the front was of a pair of breasts painted with union jacks brian thinks we should go down there janis said try to find him rebus thought of how many b bs thered be in finsbury park you might just chase him away he warned hes doing ok janis but why did he do it john i mean is it something we did new questions and fears had replaced the old ones rebus didnt know what to tell her he wasnt family and couldnt begin to answer her question didnt want to begin to answer it hes doing ok he repeated just give him some time she was crying now softly he imagined her with head bowed hair falling over the telephone receiver we did everything john you cant know how much weve given him we always put ourselves second never a minutes thought for anything but him janis he began she took a deep breath will you come and see me john rebus looked around the office eyes resting eventually on his own desk and the paperwork stacked there i cant janis id like to but i just cant see its not as if i he didnt know how he was going to finish the sentence but it didnt matter shed put her phone down he sat back in his chair and remembered dancing with her how brittle her body had seemed but that had been half a lifetime ago theyd made so many choices since it was time to let the past go siobhan clarke was at her desk she was looking at him then she mimed the drinking of a cup of coffee and he nodded and got to his feet did a little dance as he shuffled towards her trip trap copyright ian rankin first published in st culprit by chatto windus
