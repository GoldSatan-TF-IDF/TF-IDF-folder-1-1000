james rollins sandstorm to katherine adrienne and rj the next generation dept of defense code alphapcr sigma force part one thunderstorm fire and rain november am the british museum london england harry masterson would be dead in thirteen minutes if he had known this he wouldve smoked his last cigarette down to the filter instead he stamped out the fag after only three drags and waved the cloud from around his face if he was caught smoking outside the guards break room he would be shitcanned by that bastard fleming head of museum security harry was already on probation for coming in two hours late for his shift last week harry swore under his breath and pocketed the stubbed cigarette hed finish it at his next breakthat is if they got a break this night thunder echoed through the masonry walls the winter storm had struck just after midnight opening with a riotous volley of hail followed by a deluge that threatened to wash london into the thames lightning danced across the skies in forked displays from one horizon to another according to the weatherman on the beeb it was one of the fiercest electrical storms in over a decade half the city had been blacked out overwhelmed by a spectacular lightning barrage and as fortune would have it for harry it was his half of the city that went dark including the british museum on great russell street though they had backup generators the entire security team had been summoned for additional protection of the museums property they would be arriving in the next half hour but harry assigned to the night shift was already on duty when the regular lights went out and though the video surveillance cameras were still operational on the emergency grid he and the shift were ordered by fleming to proceed with an immediate security sweep of the museums two and a half miles of halls that meant splitting up harry picked up his electric torch and aimed it down the hall he hated doing rounds at night when the museum was lost in gloom the only illumination came from the streetlamps outside the windows but now with the blackout even those lamps had been extinguished the museum had darkened to macabre shadows broken by pools of crimson from the lowvoltage security lamps harry had needed a few hits of nicotine to steel his nerve but he could put off his duty no longer being the low man on the night shifts pecking order he had been assigned to run the halls of the north wing the farthest point from their underground security nest but that didnt mean he couldnt take a shortcut turning his back on the long hall ahead he crossed to the door leading into the queen elizabeth ii great court this central twoacre court was surrounded by the four wings of the british museum at its heart rose the great copperdomed round reading room one of the worlds finest libraries overhead the entire twoacre courtyard had been enclosed by a gigantic foster and partnersdesigned geodesic roof creating europes largest covered square using his passkey harry ducked into the cavernous space like the museum proper the court was lost to darkness rain pattered against the glass roof far overhead still harrys footsteps echoed across the open space another lance of lightning shattered across the sky the roof divided into a thousand triangular panes lit up for a blinding moment then darkness drowned back over the museum drumming down with the rain thunder followed felt deep in the chest the roof rattled too harry ducked a bit fearing the entire structure would come crashing down with his electric torch pointed forward he crossed the court heading for the north wing he rounded past the central reading room lightning flashed again brightening the place for a handful of heartbeats giant statues lost to the darkness appeared as if from nowhere the lion of cnidos reared beside the massive head of an easter island statue then darkness swallowed the guardians away as the lightning died out harry felt a chill and pebbling of gooseflesh his pace hurried he swore under his breath with each step bleeding buggered pieces of crap his litany helped calm him he reached the doors to the north wing and ducked inside greeted by the familiar mix of mustiness and ammonia he was grateful to have solid walls around him again he played his torch down the long hall nothing seemed amiss but he was required to check each of the wings galleries he did a fast calculation if he hurried he could complete his circuit with enough time for another fast smoke with the promise of a nicotine fix luring him he set off down the hall the beam of his torch preceding him the north wing had become host to the museums anniversary showcase an ethnographical collection portraying a complete picture of human achievement down the ages spanning all cultures like the egyptian gallery with its mummies and sarcophagi he continued hurriedly ticking off the various cultural galleries celtic byzantine russian chinese each suite of rooms was locked down by a security gate with the loss of power the gates had dropped automatically at last the halls end came into sight most of the galleries collections were only temporarily housed here transferred from the museum of mankind for the anniversary celebration but the end gallery had always been here for as far back as harry could recall it housed the museums arabian display a priceless collection of antiquity from across the arabian peninsula the gallery had been commissioned and paid for by one family a family grown rich by its oil ventures in that region the donations to keep such a gallery in permanent residence at the british museum was said to top five million pounds per annum one had to respect that sort of dedication or not with a snort at such a foolish waste of good money harry splayed his torchs spot across the engraved brass plate above the doorwaythe kensington gallery also known as the bitchs attic while harry had never encountered lady kensington from the talk among the employees it was clear that any slight to her gallerydust on a cabinet a display card with a smudge on it a piece of antiquity not properly positionedwas met with the severest reprimand the gallery was her personal pet project and none withstood her wrath jobs were lost in her wake claiming even a former director it was this concern that kept harry a few moments longer at his post outside the gallerys security gate he swept his torch around the entrance room with more than casual thoroughness yet again all was in order as he turned away withdrawing his torch movement drew his eye he froze torch pointing at the floor deep within the kensington gallery in one of the farther rooms a bluish glow wandered slowly shifting shadows with its passage another torchsomeone was in the gallery harry felt his heart pounding in his throat a breakin he fell against the neighboring wall his fingers scrambled for his radio through the walls thunder reverberated sonorous and deep he thumbed his radio i have a possible intruder here in the north wing please advise he waited for his shift leader to respond gene johnson might be a wanker but he was also a former raf officer he knew his shit the mans voice answered his call but dropouts ate most of his words interference from the electrical storm possibleare you surehold untilare the gates secure harry stared back at the lowered security gates of course he should have checked to see if they had been breeched each gallery had only one entrance into the hall the only other way into the sealed rooms was through one of the high windows but they were wired against breakage or intrusion and though the storm had knocked out main power the backup generators kept the security grid online no alarms had been raised at central command harry imagined johnson was already switching cameras running through this wing bearing down on the kensington gallery he risked a glance into the fiveroom suite the glow persisted deep in the gallery its passage seemed aimless casual not the determined sweep of a thief he did a quick check on the security gate its electronic lock glowed green it had not been breached he stared back at the glow maybe it was just the passing of some cars headlights through the gallerys windows johnsons voice over his radio cutting in and out startled him not picking up anything on the vidcamera five is out stay putothers on the way any remaining words disappeared into the ether fritzed by the electrical storm harry stood by the gate other guards were coming as backup what if it wasnt an intruder what if it was just the sweep of headlights he was already on thin ice with fleming all he needed was to be made a fool of he took a chance and raised his torch you there he yelled he thought to sound commanding but it came out more of a shrill whine still there was no change in the wandering pattern of the light it seemed to be heading even deeper into the gallerynot in panicked retreat just a meandering slow pace no thief could have that much ice in his veins harry crossed to the gates electronic lock and used his passkey to open it the magnetic seals released he pulled the gate high enough to crawl under and entered the first room straightening he lifted his torch again he refused to be embarrassed by his momentary panic he shouldve investigated further before raising the alarm but the damage was done the best he could do was save a bit of face by clearing up the mystery himself he called out again just in case security dont move his shout had no effect the glow continued its steady but meandering pace into the gallery he glanced back out the gate to the hall the others would be here in under a minute bugger it he mumbled under his breath he hurried into the gallery pursuing the light determined to root out its cause before the others arrived with hardly a glance he passed treasures of timeless significance and priceless value glass cabinets displaying clay tablets from assyrian king ashurbanipal hulking statues of sandstone dating back to prepersian times swords and weapons from every age phoenician ivories depicting ancient kings and queens even a first printing of the arabian nights under its original title the oriental moralist harry swept forward through the rooms slipping from one dynasty to anotherfrom the times of the crusades to the birth of christ from the glories of alexander the great to the ages of king solomon and queen sheba at last he reached the farthest room one of the largest it contained objects more of interest to a naturalist all from the region rare stones and jewels fossilized remains neolithic tools the source of the glow became clear near the center of the domed chamber a halfmeter globe of blue light floated lazily across the room it shimmered and its surface seemed to run with a flame of prismatic blue oil as harry watched the globe sailed through a glass cabinet as if it were made of air he stood stunned a sulfurous smell reached his nostrils issuing forth from the ball of cerulean light the globe rolled over one of the crimsonglowing security lamps shorting it out with a sizzling pop the noise startled harry back a step the same fate must have been dealt to camera five in the room behind him he glanced to the camera in this room a red light glowed above it still working as if noting his attention johnson came back on his radio for some reason there was no static harry maybe youd better get out of there he remained transfixed half out of fear half out of wonder besides the phenomenon was floating away from him toward the darkened corner of the room the globes glow illuminated a lump of metal within a glass cube it was a chunk of red iron as large as a calf a kneeling calf the display card described it as a camel such a resemblance was dodgy at best but harry understood the supposed depiction the item had been discovered in the desert the glow hovered over the iron camel harry backed a cautious step and raised his radio christ the shimmering ball of light fell through the glass and landed upon the camel its glow winked out as quickly as a snuffed candle the sudden darkness blinded harry for a breath he lifted his torch the iron camel still rested within its glass cube undisturbed its gone are you safe yeah what the hell was that johnson answered awe in his voice a sodding lightning ball i think i heard stories from mates aboard warplanes as they flew through thunderclaps storm must have spit it out but bloody hell if that wasnt brilliant its not brilliant anymore harry thought with a sigh and shook his head whatever the hell it was it at least saved him from an embarrassing ribbing from his fellow guards he lowered his torch but as the light fell away the iron camel continued to glow in the darkness a deep ruddy color what the hell now harry mumbled and grabbed his radio a severe static shock bit his fingers swearing he shook it off he raised his radio somethings odd i dont think the glow in the iron flared brighter harry fell back the iron flowed across the camels surface melting as if exposed to a wash of acid rain he was not the only one to note the change the radio barked in his hand harry get out of there he didnt argue he swung around but was too late the glass enclosure exploded outward stabbing spears pierced his left side a jagged shard sliced clear through his cheek but he barely felt the cuts as a wave of blastfurnace heat struck him searing burning away all the oxygen a scream lay upon his lips never to be aired the next explosion ripped harry from his feet and threw his body clear across the gallery but only flaming bones hit the security gate melting themselves into the steel grating am safia almaaz awoke in a dead panic sirens rang from all directions flashes of red emergency lights strobed the bedroom walls terror gripped her in a vise she could not breathe cold sweat pebbled her brow squeezed from her tightening skin clawed fingers clutched the bedsheets to her throat unable to blink she was trapped for a moment between the past and the present sirens blaring blasts echoing in the distanceand closer still screams of the wounded the dying her own voice adding to the chorus of pain and shock bullhorns boomed from the streets below her flat clear out for the engines everyone pull back englishnot arabic not hebrew a low rumble rolled past her apartment building and off into the distance the voices of the emergency crews drew her back to her bed back to the present she was in london not tel aviv a long strangled breath escaped her tears rose to her eyes she wiped them with shaky fingers panic attack she sat wrapped in her comforter for several more breaths she still felt like crying it was always this way she told herself but the words didnt help she gathered the woolen comforter around her shoulders eyes closed heart hammering in her ears she practiced the breathing and calming exercises taught to her by her therapist inhale for two counts out for four she let the tension flow away with each breath her cold skin slowly warmed something heavy landed on her bed a small sound accompanied it like a squeaky hinge she reached out a hand met by a purring welcome come here billie she whispered to the overweight black persian billie leaned into her palm and rubbed the underside of his chin across safias fingers then simply collapsed across her thighs as if the invisible strings supporting the cat had been sliced the sirens must have disturbed him from his usual nighttime haunting of her flat the low purr continued on safias lap a contented sound this more than her breathing exercises relaxed the taut muscles of her shoulders only then did she notice the wary hunch in her back as if fearing a blow that never came she forced her posture straight stretching her neck the sirens and commotion continued half a block from her building she needed to stand find out what was happening anything simply to be moving panic had transmuted into nervous energy she shifted her legs careful to slide billie onto the comforter the purring halted for a moment then resumed when it was clear he was not being evicted billie had been born in the streets of london alley feral a wild fluff of matted fur and spit safia had found the kitten sprawled and bloodied on the flats stoop with a broken leg covered in oil hit by a car despite her help he had bitten her in the fleshy meat of her thumb friends had told her to take the kitten to the animal shelter but safia knew such a place was no better than an orphanage so instead she had scooped him up in a pillow linen and transported him to the local veterinary clinic it would have been easy to step over him that evening but she had once been as abandoned and alone as the kitten someone had taken her in at the time too and like billie she had been domesticatedbut neither ended up completely tamed preferring the wild places and rooting through lost corners of the world but all that had ended with one explosion on a bright spring day all my fault crying and screams again filled her head merging with the sirens of the moment breathing too hard safia reached to the bedside lamp a small tiffany replica depicting stainedglass dragonflies she flicked the lamps switch a few more times but the lamp remained dark electricity was out the storm must have knocked down a power line maybe that was all the commotion let it be something that simple she swung out of bed barefoot but in a warm flannel nightshirt that reached her knees she crossed to the window and twisted the blinds to peer through to the street below her flat was on the fourth floor below the usually quiet and dignified street of iron lamps and wide sidewalks had become a surreal battlefield fire engines and police cars jammed the avenue smoke billowed despite the rain but at least the fierce storm had faded to the usual london weep with the streetlamps darkened the only illumination came from the flashers atop the emergency vehicles yet down the block a deeper crimson glow flickered through the smoke and dark fire safias heart thudded harder her breath chokednot from old terrors but from newborn fears for the present the museum she yanked the blinds cords ripping them up and fumbled with the lock to the window she pushed the sash open and bent out into the rain she barely noted the icy drops the british museum was only a short walk from her flat she gaped at the sight the northeast corner of the museum had crumbled to a fiery ruin flames flickered from shattered upper windows while smoke belched out in thick gouts men cowled in rebreathing masks dragged hoses jets of water sailed high ladders rose into the air from the back of engines still worst of all a gaping hole smoked on the second floor of the northeast corner rubble and blackened blocks of cement lay strewn out into the street she must not have heard the explosion or just attributed it to the storms thunder but this was no lightning strike more likely a bomb blasta terrorist attack not again she felt her knees grow weak the north wingher wing she knew the smoking hole led into the gallery at the end all her work a lifetime of research the collection a thousand antiquities from her homeland it was too much to fathom disbelief made the sight even more unreal a bad dream from which she would awake at any moment she fell back into the security and sanity of her room she turned her back on the shouts and flashing lights in the darkness stainedglass dragonflies bloomed to life she stared unable to comprehend the sight for a moment then it dawned the power was back on at that moment the phone on her nightstand rang startling her billie raised his head from the comforter ears pricked at the jangling safia hurried to the phone and picked up the receiver hello the voice was stern professional dr almaaz yyes this is captain hogan theres been an accident at the museum accident whatever had happened was more than just an accident yes the museums director has requested i call you into the briefing can you join us in the next hour yes captain ill be there immediately fine your name will be left at the security blockade the phone clicked as the captain hung up safia stared around her bedroom billie thumped his tail in clear feline irritation at the nights constant interruptions i wont be gone long she mumbled unsure if she spoke the truth sirens continued to wail outside her window the panic that had woken her refused to fade away completely her worldview the security of her position in the staid halls of a museum had been shaken four years ago she had fled a world where women strapped pipe bombs to their chests she had fled to the safety and orderliness of academic life abandoning fieldwork for paperwork dropping picks and shovels for computers and spreadsheets she had dug herself a little niche in the museum one where she felt safe she had made a home here but still disaster had found her her hands trembled she had to grip one in the other to fight another attack she fancied nothing more than to crawl back into bed and pull the comforter over her head billie stared at her eyes reflecting the lamplight ill be fine everythings okay safia said quietly more to herself than to the cat neither was convinced am gmt pm est fort meade maryland thomas hardey hated to be disturbed while he worked on the new york times crossword puzzle it was his sundaynight ritual which also included a neat snifter of fortyyearold scotch and a fine cigar a fire crackled in the fireplace he leaned back in his leather wingback chair and stared at the halffilled puzzle punching the nub on his montblanc ballpoint pen he crinkled a brow at down a fiveletter word the sum of all men as he pondered the answer the phone rang on his desk he sighed and pushed his reading glasses from the tip of his nose up to the line of his receding hairline it was probably just one of his daughters friends calling to discuss how her weekend date had fared as he leaned over he saw the fifth line was blinking his personal line only three people had that number the president the chairman of the joint chiefs and his secondincommand at the national security agency he placed the folded newspaper on his lap and tapped the lines red button with that single touch a shifting algorithmic code would scramble any communication he lifted the receiver hardey here director he sat straighter wary he did not recognize the others voice and he knew the voices of the three people who had his private number as well as he knew his own familys who is this tony rector im sorry for disturbing you at this late hour thomas shuffled his mental rolodex vice admiral anthony rector he connected the name to five letters darpa the defense advanced research projects agency the department oversaw the researchanddevelopment arm of the department of defense they had a motto be there first when it came to technological advances the united states could not come in second place ever a tingling sense of dread grew how may i help you admiral theres been an explosion at the british museum in london he went on to explain the situation in great detail thomas checked his watch less than fortyfive minutes had passed since the blast he was impressed by the ability of rectors organization to gather so much intelligence in such a short time once the admiral finished thomas asked the most obvious question and darpas interest in this blast rector answered him thomas felt the room go ten degrees cooler are you sure i already have a team in place to pursue that very question but im going to need the cooperation of british mior better yet the alternative hung in the air unspoken even over a scrambled line thomas now understood the clandestine call mi was britains equivalent of his own organization rector wanted him to throw up a smoke screen so a darpa team could whisk in and out before anyone else suspected the discovery and that included the british intelligence agency i understand thomas finally answered be there first he prayed they could live up to this mission do you have a team ready theyll be ready by morning from the lack of further elaboration thomas knew who would be handling this he drew a greek symbol on the margin of his newspaper ill clear the way for them he said to the phone very good the line went dead thomas settled the phone to the cradle already planning what must be done he would have to work quickly he stared down at the unfinished crossword puzzle down a fiveletter word for the sum of all men how appropriate he picked up a pen and filled in the answer in block letters sigma am gmt london england safia stood before the barricade a yellowandblack aframe she kept her arms folded anxious cold smoke filled the air what had happened behind the barricade a policeman held her wallet in his hand and compared her photo to the woman who stood before him she knew he was having a hard time matching the two in hand her museum identification card portrayed a studious thirtyyearold woman of coffeeandcream complexion ebony hair tied back in an efficient braid green eyes hidden behind black reading glasses in contrast before the young guard stood a soaking bedraggled woman hair loosely plastered in long swaths to her face her eyes felt lost and confused focused beyond the barriers beyond the frenzy of emergency personnel and equipment news crews dotted the landscape haloed by the spots from their cameras a few television trucks stood parked half up on the sidewalks she also spotted two british military vehicles among the emergency crews along with personnel bearing rifles the possibility of a terrorist attack could not be dismissed she had heard such rumblings among the crowd and from a reporter she had to sidestep to reach the barricade and not a few cast suspicious glances in her direction the lone arab on the street shed had firsthand experience with terrorism but not in the manner these folks suspected and maybe she was even misinterpreting the reactions around her a form of paranoia what was termed hyperanxiety was a common sequela to a panic attack safia continued through the crowd breathing deeply focusing on her purpose here she regretted forgetting her umbrella she had left her flat immediately after getting the call delaying only long enough to pull on a pair of khaki slacks and a white floral blouse she had donned a kneelength burberry coat but in her hurry the matching umbrella had been left in its stand by the door only when she reached the first floor of her building and rushed into the rain did she realize her mistake anxiety kept her from climbing back up to the fourth floor to retrieve it she had to know what had happened at the museum shed spent the past decade building the collection and the past four years running her research projects out of the museum how much had been ruined what could be salvaged outside the rain kicked up again to a steady downpour but at least the night skies were less angry by the time she reached the makeshift security checkpoint that cordoned off access she had been soaked to the bone she shivered as the guard satisfied himself with her identification youre clear to proceed inspector samuelson is awaiting you another policeman escorted her to the southern entrance of the museum she stared up at its pillared facade it had the solidness of a bank vault a permanence that could not be doubted until this night she was ushered through the entrance and down a series of stairs they passed through doors markedmuseum staff only she knew where she was being taken to the subterranean security suite an armed guard stood watch at the door he nodded at their approach clearly expecting them he pulled the door open her escort passed her on to a new fellow a black man dressed in civilian clothes an undistinguished blue suit he stood a few inches taller than safia hair gone completely gray his face looked like wellworn leather she noticed a gray shadow of stubble across his cheeks unshaven called from his bed most likely he held out a hard hand inspector geoffrey samuelson he said as firmly as his handshake thank you for coming so quickly she nodded too nervous to speak if youll follow me dr almaaz we need your assistance in investigating the cause of the explosion me she managed to force out she passed a break room crowded with security staff it appeared the entire staff all shifts had been summoned she recognized several of the men and women but they stared at her now as if she were a stranger the murmur of their chatter fell silent as she passed they must have known she had been called in but they didnt seem to know the reason any more than she did still suspicion was plain behind the silence she held her back straighter irritation sparking through her anxiety these were her coworkers colleagues then again they were all too aware of her past her shoulders slumped as the inspector led her down the hall to the farthest room she knew it housed the nest as it was nicknamed by the staff an ovalshaped room whose walls were completely covered with videosurveillance monitors inside she found the room almost deserted she spotted the head of security ryan fleming a short but stout man of middle years he was easily distinguished by his entirely hairless pate and beaked nose earning him the nickname the bald eagle he stood beside a lanky man wearing a crisp military uniform including a sidearm the pair leaned over the shoulders of a technician who was seated at a bank of monitors the group glanced over to her as she entered dr safia almaaz curator of the kensington gallery fleming said as introduction straightening he waved her over fleming had been on staff since before safia had assumed her position a guard at the time he had worked his way through the ranks to become chief of security four years ago he had foiled the theft of a preislamic sculpture from her gallery it was this diligence that had won him his current position the kensingtons knew how to reward those who had done right by them ever since then he had been particularly protective of safia and her gallery she joined the group by the video bank followed by inspector samuelson fleming touched her shoulder his eyes wounded im so sorry your gallery your work how much was lost fleming looked sick he simply pointed to one of the monitors she leaned toward it it was a live feed in black and white she saw a view down the main hall of the north wing smoke roiled men masked in protective suits worked throughout the wing a collection of them gathered before the security gate that led into the kensington gallery they appeared to be staring up at a figure tied to the grating a gaunt skeletal shape like some emaciated scarecrow fleming shook his head the coroner will be allowed in shortly to identify the remains but were sure its harry masterson one of my men the frame of bones continued to smoke that had once been a man safia felt the world tilt under her and she fell back a step fleming steadied her a conflagration of a magnitude powerful enough to burn the flesh off the bone was beyond her comprehension i dont understand she mumbled what happened here the man in military blue answered thats what were hoping you can shed some light on he turned to the video technician rewind back to zero one hundred the technician nodded the military man turned to safia as his order was carried out his face was hard unwelcoming im commander randolph representative of the ministry of defences antiterrorist division antiterrorist safia stared around at the others this was a bombing thats yet to be determined maam the commander said the technician stirred all ready sir randolph waved her to the monitor wed like you to watch this but what youre about to see is classified do you understand she didnt but she nodded anyway play it randolph commanded on the screen a camera showed the rear room of the kensington gallery all was in order though the space was dark lit only by security lights this was taken just after one oclock the commander narrated safia watched a new light float in from a neighboring room at first it appeared as if someone had entered bearing aloft a lantern but it soon became clear that the source of light moved on its own what is that she asked the technician answered weve studied the tape with various filters it appears to be a phenomenon called ball lightning a freefloating globule of plasma jettisoned from the storm this is the first time in history one of the bloody buggers has been caught on film safia had heard of such lightning displays balls of charged air luminescent that traveled horizontally over the ground they appeared on open plains inside houses aboard airplanes even within submarines but such phenomena rarely caused any harm she glanced back to the livefeed monitor with its smoking charnel house surely this wasnt the cause of the blast as she pondered this a new figure appeared on the monitor a guard harry masterson fleming said safia took a deep breath if fleming was right this was the same man whose bones smoked on the other monitor she wanted to close her eyes but couldnt the guard followed the glow of the lightning ball he seemed as mystified as those in the room with her he raised his radio to his lips reporting in but there was no audio with the footage then the ball lightning settled atop one of the display pedestals one holding up an iron figure it fell across it and winked out safia winced but nothing happened the guard continued to talk into his radiothen something seemed to alarm the man he turned just as the display cabinet shattered outward a moment later a second explosion appeared as a flash of white then the screen went black hold that and rewind four seconds back commander randolph ordered the footage froze and reversed frames clicking back the room reappeared out of the flash then the cabinet reformed around the iron figure freeze there the image stopped shuddering slightly on the monitor the iron artifact could be seen clearly within its glass display in fact too clearly it appeared to shine with a light of its own what the hell is that the commander asked safia stared at the ancient artifact she now understood why she had been called into this briefing no one here understood what had happened either none of it made any sense is that a sculpture the commander asked how long has it been there safia could read his mind the barely hidden accusation had someone slipped a bomb into the museum disguised as a sculpture and if this were true who would be the one most likely to cooperate with such a ruse who but somebody on the inside somebody tied to an explosion in the past she shook her head at the questions and the accusations itits not a sculpture then what is it the iron figure is a fragment of meteoritediscovered in the omani desert near the end of the nineteenth century safia knew that the artifacts history dated much further back for centuries arabian myths spoke of a lost city whose entrance was guarded by an iron camel the wealth of this lost city was supposedly beyond comprehension such were its riches that scores of black pearls were said to be scattered near its entrance like so much trash then in the nineteenth century a bedouin tracker led a british explorer to the place but he found no lost city what he discovered was merely a chunk of meteorite half buried in the sand that looked roughly like a kneeling camel even the black pearls were found to be just bits of blasted glass formed by the heated impact of the meteorite into the sands this camelshaped meteorite safia continued has been a part of the british museums collection since its foundingthough it had been relegated to the storage lockers until i found it in the catalog and added it to the collection inpector samuelson broke the silence when did this transfer happen two years ago so its been there quite some time the inspector said pointedly glancing toward the commander as if this satisfied some earlier quarrel a meteorite the commander mumbled with a shake of his head clearly disappointed that his conspiracy theory had not panned out that makes no sense a commotion drew everyones attention to the door safia saw the director of the museum edgar tyson force his way into the security room the usually dapper man wore a wrinkled suit that matched his worried expression he tugged at his small white goatee only now did safia wonder at his conspicuous absence the museum was the mans life and livelihood but the reason for his notable absence soon made itself clear in fact it followed at his heels the woman swept into the room her presence almost preceding her form like a surge before a storm tall a full hand span over six feet she wore a fulllength tartan overcoat dripping water yet her sandyblond hair cut to the shoulders was dry and coiffed to gentle curls that seemed to shift with their own breezes apparently she had not forgotten her umbrella commander randolph straightened stepping forward his voice suddenly respectful lady kensington ignoring him the woman continued her search of the room her eyes settling on safia a flash of relief saffiethank god she hurried forward and hugged her tightly mumbling breathlessly in her ear when i heardyou work late so many nights and i couldnt reach you on the phone safia hugged her back feeling the tremble in the others shoulders they had known each other since they were children been closer than sisters im all right kara she mumbled into her shoulder she was surprised by the depth of genuine fear in the otherwise strong woman she had not felt such affection from her in a long time not since they were young not since the death of karas father kara trembled i dont know what i wouldve done if id lost you her arms tightened around safia both comfort and need tears rose in safias eyes she remembered another hug similar words i wont lose you at the age of four safias mother had died in a bus accident with her father already gone safia was placed in an orphanage a horrible place for a child of mixed blood a year later the kensington estate took safia on as a playmate for kara put up in her own room she barely remembered that day a tall man had come and collected her it had been reginald kensington karas father because of their closeness in age and a shared wild nature kara and safia had become fast friendssharing secrets at night playing games among the date and palm trees sneaking out to the cinema whispering of their dreams under bedcovers it had been a wonderful time an endless sweet summer then at the age of ten devastating news lord kensington announced kara would be traveling to england to study abroad for two years distraught safia had not even excused herself from the table she had run to her room panicked and heartbroken that shed be returned to the orphanage a toy put back in a box but kara had found her i wont lose you she had promised amid tears and embraces ill make papa let you come with me and kara had kept her word safia went to england with kara for those two years they studied together as sisters as best friends when they returned to oman they were inseparable they finished their schooling in muscat together all seemed wonderful until the day kara returned from a birthday hunting trip sunburned and raving her father had not returned with her killed in a sinkhole was the official story but reginald kensingtons body had never been found since that day kara had never been the same she still kept safia close to her but it was more from a desire for the familiar than from true friendship kara became engrossed in finishing her own education in taking over the mantle of her fathers enterprises and ventures at nineteen she graduated from oxford the young woman proved a financial savant trebling her fathers net worth while still at the university kensington wells incorporated continued to grow branching into new fields computer technology platforms desalination patents television broadcasting still kara never neglected the fountainhead of all her familys wealth oil in just the last year kensington surpassed the halliburton corporation for the most profitable oil contracts and like kensingtons oil ventures safia was not left behind kara continued to pay for her education including six years at oxford where safia earned her doctorate in archaeology upon graduation she remained under the employ of kensington wells inc eventually she came to oversee karas pet project here at the museum a collection of antiquity from the arabian peninsula a collection first started by reginald kensington and like his former corporation this project also prospered under karas mantle growing into the single largest collection in the entire world two months ago the ruling family in saudi arabia had attempted to buy the collection to return it to arabian soil a deal rumored to be worth in the hundreds of millions kara had declined the collection meant more to her than money it was a memorial to her father though his body had never been found here was his tomb this lone wing in the british museum surrounded by all the wealth and history of arabia safia stared past her friends shoulder to the livefeed monitor to the smoky ruin of her hard work she could only imagine what the loss would mean to kara it would be like someone desecrating her fathers grave kara safia began attempting to soften the blow that would come to hear it from someone who shared her passion the galleryits gone i know edgar already told me karas voice lost its hesitancy she pulled out of the embrace as if suddenly feeling foolish she stared around at the others gathered here the familiar tone of command entered her demeanor what happened who did this to lose the collection so soon after rejecting the saudis offer had clearly piqued karas suspicion too without hesitation the tape was once again played for lady kensington safia remembered the earlier admonishment about the secrecy of what the footage revealed no such warning was given to kara wealth had its privileges safia ignored the replay on the monitor instead she studied kara fearing how this might devastate her from the corner of her eye she caught the final flash of the explosion and then the monitor went black all during the viewing karas expression remained unchanged a marble relief of concentration athena in deep thought but at the end karas eyes slowly closed not with shock and horrorsafia knew karas moods only too wellbut with profound relief her friends lips moved in a breathless whisper a single word caught only by her own ears finally foxhunt november am est ledyard connecticut patience wasthe key to any successful hunt painter crowe stood upon his native lands the land his fathers tribe named mashantucket the much wooded land but where painter waited there were no trees no birdsong no whisper of wind across the cheek here it was the chime of slot machines the chink of coins the reek of tobacco smoke and the continual recycling of lifeless air foxwoods resort and casino was the largest gambling complex in the entire world surpassing anything found in las vegas or even monte carlo located outside of the unassuming hamlet of ledyard connecticut the towering complex rose dramatically from the dense woods of the mashantucket reservation in addition to the gambling facility with its six thousand slot machines and hundreds of gaming tables the resort was home to three worldclass hotels the entire facility was owned by the pequot tribe the fox people who had hunted these same lands for the past ten thousand years but at the moment it was not a deer or a fox being hunted painters quarry was a chinese computer scientist xin zhang zhang better known by his alias kaos was a hacker and code breaker of prodigious talent one of chinas finest after reading his dossier painter had learned respect for the slim man in the ralph lauren suit during the past three years he had orchestrated a successful wave of computer espionage upon us soil his latest acquisition plasma weapons technology out of los alamos painters target finally shoved up from the pai gow table would you like to color out dr zhang the pit boss asked standing over the table like a captain at the prow of his boat at seven in the morning there was only the lone playerand his bodyguards the isolation required painter to spy upon his quarry from a safe distance suspicions could not be aroused especially not so late in the game zhang shifted the pile of black chips toward the dealer a woman with bored eyes as the dealer stacked the winnings painter studied his target zhang proved the stereotype of the chinese as inscrutable he had a poker face that gave no obvious tell no idiosyncratic tic that denoted a good or a bad hand he simply played his game like he did now none would guess from the mans appearance that he was a master criminal wanted in fifteen countries he dressed like a typical western businessman a sharply tailored suit in an understated pinstripe a silk tie a platinum rolex still there remained a certain austere aesthetic quality to him his black hair was shaved around the ears and back leaving only a crisp crown of hair on top of his head not unlike a monk he wore a pinched set of eyeglasses circular lenses faintly tinted blue a studious countenance at last the dealer waved her hands over the stack of chips showing her empty fingers and palms to the security cameras hidden in the black mirrored domes in the ceiling fifty thousand dollars even she finished the pit boss nodded the dealer counted out the amount in thousanddollar chips more good luck sir the boss acknowledged without even a nod zhang departed with his two bodyguards he had been gambling all night dawn already glimmered the cybercrime forum would resume in another three hours the conference covered the latest trends in identity theft infrastructure protection and myriad other security topics in two hours a breakfast symposium put on by hewlett packard would commence zhang would make the transfer during that meeting his american contact was still unknown it was one of the main objectives of the ops here besides securing the weapons data they sought to flush out zhangs stateside contact someone tied to a shady network that traded in military secrets and technologies it was a mission that must not fail painter followed the group his superiors at darpa had personally tapped him for this mission in part for his expertise in microsurveillance and computer engineering but more importantly for his ability to blend in at foxwoods though only halfblooded painter had inherited enough of his fathers features to pass as a pequot indian it did take a few trips to a tanning salon to enrich his complexion and brown contact lenses to hide his mothers blue eyes but afterward with his shoulderlength hair the color of a ravens wing presently tied back in a tail he did look like his father to finish his disguise he wore a casino suit with the symbol of the pequot tribe embroidered on the pocket a tree atop a knoll framed against a clear sky who looked beyond a suit anyway from his position painter remained wary as he followed zhang his eyes never focused directly upon the group he watched peripherally and used natural cover to the best advantage he stalked his quarry through the neon woodlands of blinking machines and wide glades of green felt tables he maintained his distance and varied his pace and direction his earpiece buzzed with mandarin zhangs voice picked up by the microtransceiver zhang was heading back to his suite painter touched his throat microphone and subvocalized into the radio sanchez how are you picking up on the feed loud and clear commander his coagent on this mission cassandra sanchez was holed up in the suite across the hall from zhangs manning the surveillance array how is the subdermal holding he asked her hed better access his computer soon the bug is running low on juice painter frowned the bug had been planted yesterday on zhang during a massage sanchezs latino features were dark enough to pass for indian she had implanted the subdermal transceiver during a deeptissue massage last night the prick of penetration unfelt as she dug her thumbs in deep she covered the tiny puncture wound with an anesthetic smear of surgical bond by the time the massage was over it had sealed and dried the digital microtransceiver had a life span of only twelve hours how much time left best estimate eighteen minutes damn painter focused his full attention back on his quarrys conversation the man kept his voice low meant for his bodyguards only painter fluent in mandarin listened he hoped zhang would give some indication when he would retrieve the plasma weapons file he was disappointed have the girl ready after ive showered zhang said painter tightened a fist the girl was thirteen an indentured slave from north korea his daughter he had explained to those who even thought to ask if this had been true incest could be added to the long list of charges to which zhang was guilty following them painter skirted around a change booth and set off down a long bank of machines paralleling his quarry a jackpot rang out from a dollar slot machine the winner a middleaged man in a jogging suit smiled and looked around for someone to share his good fortune there was only painter i won he cried jubilantly eyes redrimmed from playing all night painter nodded more good luck sir he answered repeating the pit bosss earlier words and strode past the man there were no real winners hereexcept the casino the slot machines alone netted eight hundred million dollars last year it seemed the pequot tribe had come a long way from its s sandandgravel business unfortunately painters father had missed out on the boom abandoning the reservation in the early eighties to pursue his fortune in new york city it was there he met painters mother a fiery italian woman who would eventually stab her husband to death after seven years of marriage and the birth of their son with his mother on death row painter had grown up in a series of foster homes where he quickly learned it was best to keep silent to be unseen it had been his first training in stealthbut not his last zhangs group entered the grand pequot towers elevator lobby showing their suite key to the security guard painter crossed past the opening he had a glock mm in a holster at the base of his back covered by his casino jacket he had to resist pulling it out and shooting zhang in the back of the head execution style but that would not achieve their objective to recover the schematics and research for the orbital plasma cannon zhang had managed to steal the data from a secure federal server leaving a worm behind the next morning a los alamos technician by the name of harry klein accessed the file inadvertently releasing the data worm that proceeded to eat all references of the weapon while defecating a false trail that implicated klein that bit of computerized sleight of hand cost investigators two weeks as they pursued the false trail it had taken a dozen darpa agents to filter through the worm shit and discover the true identity of the thief xin zhang a spy positioned as a technologist with changnet a telecom upstart out of shanghai according to the cias intelligence the stolen data was on the suitcase computer in zhangs suite the hard drive had been tripwired with an elaborate encryption defense a single mistake in attempting to access the computer would wipe everything that could not be risked nothing had survived the worm at los alamos estimates were that the loss would set the program back by a full ten months but the worst consequence was that the stolen research would advance chinas program by a full five years the files contained some phenomenal breakthroughs and cuttingedge innovations it was up to darpa to stop it their objective was to gain zhangs password and retrieve the computer time was running out painter watched from the reflection in a wheeloffortune slot machine as zhang and his bodyguards stepped into an express elevator that led to the private suites that topped the tower touching his throat mike painter whispered theyre heading up got it ready when you are commander as the doors squeezed closed painter rushed over to a neighboring elevator it had been crisscrossed with bright yellow tape lettered in blackout of order painter ripped through it while punching the button as the doors parted he ducked through he touched his throat mike all clear go sanchez answered brace yourself as the elevator doors shushed closed he leaned against the mahogany paneling legs wide the car shot upward driving him toward the floor his muscles tensed he watched the glowing numbers climb upward ever faster sanchez had rewired this car for maximum acceleration she had also slowed zhangs elevator by percent not enough to be noticed as painters car reached the thirtysecond floor it decelerated with a shudder he was lifted off his feet hung in the air for a long breath then fell back to the floor he ducked through the doors as they opened careful not to disturb the taped entry he checked the neighboring elevator zhangs car was three floors away and climbing he needed to hurry painter raced down the hall of suites he found zhangs room number how are we positioned he whispered the girl is handcuffed to the bed two guards are playing cards in the main room roger that sanchez had placed pencil cameras in the rooms heating vents painter crossed the hall and keyed his way into the opposite suite cassandra sanchez sat nestled among her electronic surveillance equipment and monitors like a spider in a web she was dressed in black from boots to blouse even her leather shoulder holster and belt matched her outfit carrying her sig automatic she had customized the pistol with a hogue rubberized grip and mounted the thumb catch for her magazine release on the right side to accommodate her left hand she was a deadlyaccurate marksman trained like painter in special forces before being recruited into sigma her eyes greeted him with the sparkle of the endgame his own breath quickened at the sight of her her breasts pushed against the thin material of her silk blouse snugged tight by the shoulder holster he had to force his eyes up to maintain proper contact they had been partners for the past five years and only recently had his feelings for her deepened business lunches turned into drinks after work and finally long dinners but still certain lines had yet to be crossed a distance tentatively maintained she seemed to sense his thoughts and glanced away never pressing about time the bastard got up here she said turning her attention back to her monitors hed better burn those files in the next quarter hour or shit what painter stepped to her side she pointed to one of the monitors it showed a threedimensional cross section of the upper levels of the grand pequot tower a small red x glowed within the structure hes heading back down the x marked the tracer built into the microtransceiver it was dropping through the levels of the tower painter clenched a fist somethings spooked him has there been any communication with his room since he entered the elevator not a whistle the computer is still there she pointed to another monitor a blackandwhite image of zhangs suite the suitcase computer still rested on the coffee table if not for the encryption it wouldve been so easy to break in and abscond with the computer but they needed zhangs codes the planted bug would record every keystroke he made capturing the code once that was obtained they could lock down zhang and his men ive got to get back down there painter said the tracking device was built on such a small scale that it had a range of only two hundred yards someone had to be close at all times we cant lose him if hes wise to us i know he headed for the door zhang would have to be eliminated theyd lose the files but at least the weapons data wouldnt make it back to china that had always been their fallback plan they had safeguards built upon safeguards there was even a small em grenade affixed inside one of the suites ventilation grates at a moments notice they could activate it triggering an electromagnetic pulse that would activate the computers selfdefenses to wipe the data china must never gain the research painter rushed down the hall and crossed back to the tapedoff elevator he ducked inside he spoke into his radios throat mike can you get me down there ahead of him better grab your balls she answered before he could take her advice the elevator dropped from under him he was weightless for a long stretch stomach riding up into his throat the elevator plummeted in a free fall painter fought down a surge of panic along with a rise of bile then the cars floor came crashing up there was no way to hold himself upright he fell to his knees then the slowing eased and the elevator came to a gliding stop the doors whisked open painter stumbled to his feet thirty floors in less than five seconds that had to be a record he pushed through the doorway and out into the elevator lobby he glanced to the numbers above the express elevator zhang had taken he was only a floor away painter took a few steps back near enough to cover the door but not close enough to arouse suspicion posing again as casino security the doors opened on the main floor painter spied indirectly using the reflection of the polished brass elevator doors across from the express oh no he swung around and crossed in front of the elevator no one was in the cage had zhang gotten off on another floor he stepped into the vacant elevator impossible this was the express there were no stops between here and the floor of suites above unless he had pulled the emergency stop then forced the doors open to make his escape then painter spotted it taped to the back wall a glinting bit of plastic and metal the microtransceiver the bug painter felt his heart pound against his rib cage as he stepped into the elevator his vision tunneled on the bit of electronics taped to the wall he ripped it free examining it closely zhang had lured him away oh god he touched his throat mike sanchez his heart continued its heavy thudding there was no answer he swung around and punched the elevator button marked simply suites the doors closed too slowly painter paced the tiny compartment a caged lion he tried his radio again still no response goddamnit the express began its climb painter pounded a fist against the wall mahogany paneling cracked under his knuckles move you fucker but he knew he was already too late pm gmt london england standing out in the hall steps from the kensington gallery safia could not breathe her difficulty was not from the stench of wood smoke burned insulation or the residual scorch of electrical fires it was the wait all morning long she had watched investigators and inspectors from every british bureau traipse in and out she had been barred official personnel only civilians were not allowed to cross the streamers of yellow tape the cordons of barricades the wary eyes of military guards half a day later she was finally being allowed inside to see firsthand the destruction in this final moment her chest felt as if it were clamped in a giant stone fist her heart was a panicked pigeon beating at her rib cage what would she find what was salvageable she felt stricken to the core devastated as ruined as the gallery the work here was more than just her academic life after tel aviv she had rebuilt her heart here and though she had left arabia she had not abandoned it she was still her mothers daughter so she had rebuilt arabia in london an arabia before terrorists a tangible account of her lands history its wonder its ancient times and mysteries surrounded by these antiquities walking the galleries she heard the crunch of sand underfoot felt the warmth of the sun on her face and tasted the sweetness of dates freshly picked it was home a safe place but it was more than all that her grief went deeper at her core she had built this home not just for herself but also for the mother she barely remembered at times when working late at night safia caught the faintest wisp of jasmine in the air a memory from childhood of her mother though they couldnt share their life they could share this place this bit of home now it was all gone theyre letting us in safia stirred she glanced to ryan fleming the head of security had kept vigil with her though it looked like hed had little sleep ill stick with you he said she forced air into her lungs and nodded it was the best she could manage as thanks for his kindness and company she followed the other museum staff forward they had all agreed to help with the cataloging and documenting of the gallerys contents it would take weeks safia marched forward both drawn to and fearful of what she would find she rounded past the last barricade the security gates had been removed by the coroners office she was thankful of that she had no desire to see the remains of harry masterson she stepped to the entrance and stared inside despite the preparation in her head and the brief glimpse from the video cameras she was not ready for what she found the bright gallery was now a blackened cavern system five chambers of charred stone breath caught in her chest gasps arose behind her the firestorm had laid waste to everything the wallboard had been incinerated down to the base blocks nothing remained standing except for a single babylonian vase in the center of the gallery it stood waisthigh and while scorched it had remained upright safia had read reports of tornadoes doing the same cutting a swath of total devastation while leaving a bicycle resting on its kickstand untouched in the middle of it all it made no sense none of it did the place still reeked of smoke and several inches of sooty water covered the floor left over from the deluge of the fire hoses youll need rubbers fleming said placing a hand on her arm guiding her over to a line of boots she pulled into a set numbly and a hard hat where do we even begin someone muttered properly outfitted now safia stepped into the gallery moving as if in a dream mechanical eyes unblinking she crossed through the rooms when she reached the far gallery something crunched under her boot heel she bent down fished through the water and retrieved a stone from the floor a few lines of cuneiform etched its surface it was a piece of an assyrian tablet dating back to ancient mesopotamia she straightened and stared across the ruin of the kensington gallery only now did she note the other people strangers in her home folks labored in pockets talking in hushed tones as if in a graveyard building inspectors examined the infrastructure while fire investigators took readings with handheld devices a pack of municipal engineers argued in a corner about budgets and bids and a few policemen stood guard by the collapsed section of the exterior wall workmen were already constructing a crude plank blockade to cover the opening through the gap she spotted gawkers across the street held back by cordons they were surprisingly persistent considering that the morning drizzle had turned into sleet by the afternoon flashes of camera bulbs flickered in the gloom tourists a surge of anger flamed through her numbness she wanted to throw the lot of them out of here this was her wing her home her anger helped focus her bring her back to the situation at hand she had a duty an obligation safia returned her attention to the other scholars and students from the museum they had begun to sift through the debris it was heartening to see their usual petty professional jealousies set aside for now safia crossed back toward the entrance ready to organize those who had volunteered but as she reached the first gallery a large group appeared at the entrance at the forefront strode kara dressed in work clothes a red hard hat emblazoned with the insignia for kensington wells she led a team of some twenty men and women into the gallery they were identically outfitted wearing the same red hard hats safia stepped in front of her kara she had not seen the woman all day she had vanished with the head of the museum supposedly to help coordinate the various investigative teams of the fire and police it seemed a few billion in sterling garnered some authority kara waved the men and women into the gallery get to work she turned to safia ive hired my own forensic team safia stared after the group as they tromped like a small army into the rooms instead of weapons they carried all manner of scientific tools whats going on why are you doing this to find out what happened kara watched her team set to work her eyes had a feverish shine a fiery determination safia had not seen such a look on her face in a long time something had sparked an intensity in kara that had been missing for years only one thing could bring about such fervor her father safia remembered the look in karas eyes as she had surveyed the videotape of the explosion the strange relief her one spoken word finally kara stepped out into the gallery already her team had commenced digging samples from various surfaces plastics glass wood stone kara crossed to a pair of men carrying metal detectors sweeping them along the floor one pulled a bit of a melted bronze from some debris he set it aside i want every fragment of that meteorite found kara ordered the men nodded continuing the search safia joined kara what are you really seeking here kara turned to her eyes ablaze with determination answers safia read the hope behind the set in her friends lips about your father about his death pm kara sat in the hall on a folding chair the work continued in the galleries fans whirred and rattled the mumble and chatter of workers in the wing barely reached her she had come out to smoke a cigarette she had long given up the habit but she needed something to do with her hands her fingers trembled did she have the strength for this the strength to hope safia appeared at the entryway spotted her and stepped in her direction kara waved her off pointed to the cigarette i just need a moment safia paused staring at her then nodded and headed back into the gallery kara took another drag filling her chest with cool smoke but it did little to settle her she was too unbalanced the adrenaline of the night wearing thin she stared at the plaque beside the gallery it bore a bronze likeness of her father the founder of the gallery kara sighed out a stream of smoke blurring the sight papa somewhere out in the gallery something fell with a loud bang sounding like a gunshot a reminder of a past of a hunt across the sands kara drifted into the past it had been her sixteenth birthday the hunt had been her fathers gift the arabian oryx fled up the slope of the dune the antelopes white coat stood out starkly against the red sands the only two blemishes to its snowy hide were a black swatch on the tip of its tail and a matching mask around its eyes and nose a wet crimson trail dripped down its wounded haunch as it fought to escape the hunters the oryxs hooves drove deep into the loose sand blood flowed more thickly as it kicked toward the ridgeline a pair of tapered horns sliced through the still air as the muscles of its neck wrenched with each painful yard gained a quarter mile back kara heard its echoing cry over the growl of her sand cycle a fourwheel allterrain vehicle with thick knobby tires in frustration she gripped the handles of her bike as it flew over the summit of a monstrous dune for a breathless moment she lifted out of her seat airborne as the cycle bucked over the ridge the angry set to her lips remained hidden behind a sand scarf a match to her khaki safari suit her blond hair braided to the middle of her back flagged behind her like a wild mares tail her father kept pace on another cycle rifle carried across his back he had his own scarf dropped around his neck his skin was tanned the color of saddle leather his hair gone a sandy gray he caught her glance were close he yelled above the whining growl of their engines he gunned his engine and sped down the windward side of the dune kara raced after him bent over her cycles handlebars followed closely by their bedouin guide it had been habib who had led them to their quarry it had also been the bedouins skilled shot that had first wounded the oryx though impressed with his marksmanship shooting the antelope on the fly kara had become furious upon learning the wounding had been deliberate meant not to kill to slowfor the girl habib had explained kara had rankled at the crueltyand the insult she had been hunting with her father from the age of six she was not without skill herself and preferred a clean kill purposely wounding the animal was needlessly savage she cranked the throttle kicking up sand some especially back in england raised their eyebrows at her upbringing considering her a tomboy especially with no mother kara knew better traveling half the world she had been raised with no pretensions about the line between men and women she knew how to defend herself how to fight with fist or knife reaching the bottom of the dune now kara and their guide caught up with her father as his cycle bogged down in a camel wallow a patch of loose sand that sucked like quicksand they passed him in a cloud of dust her father bulled the bike out of the wallow and gave chase up the next dune a massive sixhundredfoot mountain of red sand kara reached the crest first with habib slowing slightly until she could see what lay beyond and it was lucky she had the far side of the dune fell away as steeply as a cliff ending in a wide plain of flat sand she could have easily tumbled tail over head down the slope habib waved for her to stop she obeyed knowing better than to proceed she idled her bike stopped now she felt the heavy heat drop like a weight on her shoulders but she barely noticed her breath escaped her in a long awed sigh the view beyond the dune was spectacular the sun near to setting tempered the flat sand to sheer glass heat mirages shimmered in pools casting an illusion of vast lakes of water a false promise in an unforgiving landscape still another sight held kara transfixed in the center of the plain a lone funnel of sand spiraled up from below vanishing into a cloud of dust far overhead a sand devil kara had seen such sights before including the more violent sandstorms that could whip out of nowhere and vanish just as quickly still this sight somehow struck her deeply the solitary nature of this tempest its perfect stillness in the plain there was something mysterious and foreign about it she heard habib mumbling beside her head bent as if in prayer her father joined them then drawing back her attention there she is he said panting and pointing at the base of the steep slope the oryx struggled across the open plain of sand limping badly now habib held up his hand stirring out of his prayer no we go no further her father frowned what are you talking about their guide kept his gaze ahead his thoughts were hidden behind dark afrika corps goggles and a woolen omani headcloth called a shamag we go no further habib repeated thickly this is the land of the nisnases the forbidden sands we must turn back her father laughed nonsense habib papa kara asked he shook his head and explained the nisnases are the bogeymen of the deep desert black djinns ghosts that haunt the sands kara glanced back to the unreadable features of their guide the empty quarter of arabia the rub alkhali was the worlds largest sand mass dwarfing even the sahara and the fantastic tales flowing out of the region were as many as they were outlandish but some folk still held these stories to be true including apparently their guide her father throttled down his bikes engine i promised you a hunt kara and i wont disappoint you but if you want to turn back kara hesitated glancing between habib and her father balanced between fear and determination between mythology and reality here in the wilds of the deep desert all seemed possible she stared at the fleeing animal limping across the hot sands every stride a struggle its path etched in pain she knew what she had to do all this blood and agony had started for her benefit she would end it she pulled up her sand scarf and gunned her engine theres an easier way down off to the left she rode along the ridgeline heading toward a more gentle section of the dune face there was no need to glance over her shoulder to feel her fathers wide smile of satisfaction and pride it shone on her as bright as the sun still at the moment it offered no real warmth she stared out across the plain past the lone oryx to the solitary spiral of sand while such sand devils were commonplace the sight still struck her as strange it hadnt moved reaching the gentler slope kara tilted her bike down toward the flat plains it was steep she and her cycle skated and skidded down the face but she kept the bike stable on the loose sand as she struck the rough plain her wheels bit with the firmer traction and she sped away she heard her fathers bike at her heels the sound reached their quarry too the oryxs pace increased with an agonized toss of its head it was less than a quarter mile off it would not be long on level ground their atvs would ride the animal down and a quick clean shot would end its misery end the hunt shes going for cover her father called to her pointing an arm making for the sandstorm her father shot past her kara gave chase bent low they pursued the wounded creature but desperation gave it swift speed the oryx trotted into the storms edge heading toward its center her father cursed thickly but continued racing ahead kara followed dragged in her fathers wake nearing the dust storm they discovered a deep hollow in the sand both bikes braked at the lip the dust devil rose from the hollows center as if it were burrowing into the desert casting sand high into the air the dust column had to be fifty yards across the bowl a good quarter mile a smoking volcano in the sand traces of blue energy laced through the devil with unnervingly silent crackles she could smell the ozonelike odor it was a phenomenon unique to the sandstorms of the dry desert static electricity ignoring the sight her father pointed to the bottom of the bowl there she is kara looked down limping across the floor of the hollow the oryx made for the thicker dust the twisting cyclone near the center loosen your rifle her father called she remained frozen unable to move the oryx reached the edge of the devil legs shaking knees buckling but it fought for the denser cover of the swirling sand her father swore under his breath and dove his bike down the slope fearful kara bit her lower lip pushed her cycle over the edge and headed after him as soon as she dipped down she felt the static electricity trapped in the hollow the hairs on her skin crackled against her clothes adding fuel to her fear she slowed her rear tires sinking into the sandy slope her father reached the bottom and spun the bike to a stop almost toppling it over but he kept his seat twisting around with the rifle on his shoulder kara heard the loud crack of his marlin rifle she stared toward the oryx but it was already into the dust storm a mere shadow now still the shadow lurched falling a kill shot her father had done it kara suddenly felt a surge of foolishness she had let her fears control her and had lost her place in the hunt papa she called out ready to praise him proud of his dogged pragmatism in this hunt but a sudden scream strangled any further words it came from the sand devil issuing as if from some dark hell a horrible cry of agony the dark shadow of the oryx thrashed in the heart of the devil blurred by the whirling sand the agonized wail tore from its throat it was being slaughtered her father still straddling the cycle struggled to get his vehicle turned around he stared up at her eyes wide kara get out of here she couldnt move what was happening then the wailing cry cut off a horrible smell followed the stench of burning flesh and hair it rolled up and out of the hollow cresting over her gagging her she saw her father still fighting his bike but he had wallowed his wheels he was stuck his eyes found her still frozen in place kara go he waved an arm for emphasis his tanned face was deathly pale honey run then she felt it a stirring in the sand at first it was just a gentle tug as if gravity had suddenly increased sand particles began to dance and tumble down quickly becoming rivulets flowing down in a curving path heading toward the sand devil her father felt it too he gunned his engine wheels spinning in the sand casting up flumes of dust he screamed at her run goddamnit this shout jolted her her father seldom screamedand never in panic she kicked up her engine strangling the throttle she saw to her horror that the dusty column had grown wider fed by the inexplicable currents in the sand it stretched toward where her father remained bogged in the sand papa she cried to him in warning go child he finally freed his cycle by sheer force of will straddling the bike he chased the cycle around chewing up sand kara followed his example she swung around gunned her engine and fled back up the slope beneath her bike the sand sucked at her as if she were in a whirlpool being drawn backward she fought the sands with all her skill finally reaching the bowls rim she glanced over her shoulder her father was still near the bottom his face muddy with sand and sweat eyes squinted in concentration over his shoulder the swirling sand closed in towering sparking with traceries of static electricity it covered the entire floor kara found herself unable to look away at the heart of the dust devil a darkness grew spreading wider and growing blacker more massive the spats of static electricity did little to illuminate it the scent of burned flesh still tinged the air the prior warning of their guide filled her heart with terror black ghoststhe nisnases papa but her father was mired in the deeper stronger currents of the whirlpool unable to escape the columns edge brushed over him as it grew and spread his eyes met hers frantic not for himself but for her go he mouthedthen he was gone vanished into the darkness that filled the devil papa a horrible scream followed before she could react the column of sand exploded outward with blinding force she was ripped from her seat and tossed high in the air tumbling she toppled end over end time stretched until the ground rose up and struck her something snapped in her arm a flash of pain that was barely noted she rolled across the sand coming to a stop facedown she lay there for several breaths unable to move but fear for her father rolled her on her side she stared back toward the smoking volcano in the sand the devil was gone snuffed away all that was left was a smudgy dustiness hanging in the air she fought to sit up gasping and cradling her injured arm it made no sense she stared in all directions the sands lay flat all around her untouched by track or print everything was gone no sandy hollow no bloodied oryx no sandscarred cycle she stared out at the empty sands papa a cry from the gallery drew kara back to the present her cigarette forgotten in her fingers had burned to the filter she stood and stomped it out over here the call repeated it was one of her technicians i found something am est ledyard connecticut paintercrowecrouched low on the elevator floor as the doors rolled open upon the top floor of the grand pequot tower ready for an ambush he had his glock pointed forward a round chambered his finger resting on the trigger the elevator bay was empty he listened for a longheld breath no voices no footsteps distantly a television could be heard blaring the theme of good morning america it wasnt a particularly good morning for him easing up he risked a glance out the door covering with his weapon nothing he kicked out of his shoes and placed one so it would hold open the door in case he needed a fast retreat in his socks he took three fast steps to the opposite wall and checked the immediate area all clear he cursed the lack of manpower while he had the backing of hotel security and the local police who were already covering all the exits any additional federal agents had been limited out of respect for indian sovereignty besides the mission was supposed to be a simple nabandcollar the worstcase scenario was that they would have to destroy the research data rather than having it fall into chinese hands now it had all gone to hell he had been duped by his own equipment but he had a larger fear at the moment cassandra he prayed he was wrong about her but he held out no real hope he slid along the wall of the elevator lobby it opened into the middle of the hallway numbered suites marched off in both directions keeping low he swept both right and left empty no sign of zhang or his bodyguards he headed down the hall his senses sharpened to a razors edge at the click of a door lock behind him he swung around dropped to a knee pistol pointed it was only one of the hotel guests down the far hall an older woman appeared in a bathrobe she picked up her complimentary copy of usa today resting on the doorstep and retreated back inside not even noticing the armed gunman down the hall painter twisted back around he hurried the dozen steps to his suites door he tested the handle locked he reached with one hand for his key the other held his glock pointed at zhangs door across the hallway he swept his key across the electronic lock the green light flashed he shoved the door open while pressed against the wall outside no shots no cries he sprang through the door he stopped five feet inside legs splayed in a shooters stance he had a clear view into the main room and the bedroom empty he hurried forward and checked the bedroom and bathroom no hostilesand no sign of cassandra he returned to the bay of electronic equipment he checked the monitors they still showed various shots of zhangs suite across the hall they had cleared out the computer was gone there was only one occupant still in the suite godno he raced back out the door abandoning caution he crashed across the hall and fumbled out the security passkey that opened all the rooms in the tower he forced his way into zhangs suite and sprinted through the main room and into the bedroom she hung naked from a rope attached to a ceiling fan her face had purpled above the noose her feet which had still been kicking on the monitor now dangled slackly holstering his gun painter hurdled over a chair and leaped through the air he yanked a dagger from a wrist sheath and sliced the rope with a single swift cut he landed heavily tossed the knife and caught the body as it fell twisting at the hips he brought her down upon the bed then fell to his knees his fingers fought the nooses knot goddamnit the rope had snugged deep into her thin neck but the noose finally let go of its victim he pried the rope loose his fingers gingerly checked her neck not broken was she still alive as answer a shuddering gasp rattled up her frame and out her mouth painter bowed his head in relief her eyes rolled open panicked and lost more coughs rattled through her arms fought an invisible enemy he tried to reassure her speaking in mandarin youre safe lie still youre safe the girl looked even younger than thirteen her naked body was bruised in places where a child should not be bruised zhang had sorely used her and afterward left her behind dangling by a rope meant to delay him distract him from the pursuit he sat back on his heels the girl began to sob curling in on herself he didnt touch her knowing better than to try his lash communicator buzzed in his ears commander crowe it was the head of hotel security theres a firefight at the north tower exit zhang he gained his feet and rushed to the balcony window yes sir report is hes using your partner as a human shield she may have been shot i have more men on the way he shoved the window open it was safetysecured and only opened enough to shove his head through we need those roadblocks up hang on the sound of squealing tires reached him a lincoln town car careened from the valet parking lot and headed toward the tower it was zhangs personal car on its way to pick him up security came back on the radio hes broken out of the north exit he still has your partner the town car reached the corner of the tower painter swung back inside get those damn roadblocks up but there wouldnt be enough time he had put in the emergency call less than four minutes ago law enforcement here mostly dealt with drunken fights duis and petty thefts not matters of national security he had to stop them bending down he retrieved his knife from the floor stay here he said softly in mandarin he rushed to the main room and used the dagger to pry off the ventilation grille it snapped open with a pop of screws he reached within and grabbed the black device hidden inside the em grenade was roughly the size and shape of a football palming the device he fled to the suites door and out into the hall still without his shoes he sprinted down the carpeted hall he analyzed a quick schematic in his head coordinating where the north exit was in relation to his location on this floor he did a bestguess estimate eight doors down he stopped and pulled out his security key again he swiped it through the electronic lock and shoved the door open as soon as it flashed green security he hollered and raced into the room an older woman the same one he had spotted earlier sat in a chair reading usa today she tossed the paper in the air and clutched her robe to her throat was ist los she asked in german he hurried past her to the window reassuring her that nothing was wrong nichts sich ungefдhr zu sorgen fraulein he answered he slid the window open again it was only enough to stick his head through he glanced down the lincoln town car idled below the rear door to the sedan slammed shut shots rang out slugs pelted the side of the car as its tires squealed and smoked but the car had been bulletproofed an americanbuilt tank painter leaned back and shoved the footballshaped device out the window he depressed the activation button and threw the grenade straight down with all the force in his shoulder hoping for a hail mary pass he pulled his arm back inside the wheels of the town car stopped squealing as it gained traction he sent a prayer to the spirits of his ancestors the em pulse range was only twenty yards he held his breath what was that old saying close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades as he held his breath the muffled whump of the grenade finally sounded had he been close enough he leaned his head back outside the town car reached the near corner of the tower but rather than making the turn it swerved uncontrollably and struck a row of parked cars headon the front of the lincoln climbed up the hood of a volkswagen passat and came to a crooked rest he sighed that was the good thing about em pulses they didnt discriminate about what computer systems they fried even those that operated a lincoln town car below uniformed security personnel poured from the exit and quickly surrounded the disabled car was ist los the old german woman repeated behind him he turned and hurried across the room etwas abfall gerade entleeren just dumping some garbage he crossed quickly down the hall to the elevator lobby retrieving his shoes from the jammed elevator door he hit the button for the main floor his stunt had stopped zhangs escape but it had also surely wiped out the computer he carried destroying the research data but that was not painters main concern cassandra he had to get to her as soon as the doors opened he rushed across the gambling floor where pandemonium reigned the firefight had not gone unnoticed though a few people still sat calmly in front of their slot machines pushing their buttons with dogged determination he crossed to the north exit and had to run through a series of blockades flashing his identification frustrated at being held back finally he spotted john fenton head of security and called out to him he ushered painter through the shattered exit safety glass crunched underfoot and the telltale taint of gunpowder hung in the air i dont understand why the car crashed fenton said lucky for us though not just luck painter said and explained about the em pulse and its twentyyard range a few guests are going to have a hard time starting their cars this morning and therell probably be a few fried televisions on the first floors outside painter saw that the local security had things in hand additionally a row of charcoal gray police cars lights flashing wound through the parking lot circling down upon the site the mp tribal police painter searched the area zhangs bodyguards were down on their knees fingers laced behind their heads two bodies were sprawled on the ground security coats draped over their faces they were both men painter crossed to them and peeled one suit back another bodyguard half his face gone he didnt have to check the other he recognized zhangs polished leather shoes he shot himself a familiar voice said from amid a group of security men and a pair of emts rather than be captured painter turned and saw cassandra step forward her face was pale her smile shy she was only in her bra her left shoulder was lost in a bandage she nodded to a black suitcase a few feet away zhangs computer so we lost the data he said the em pulse wiped it maybe not she said with a grin the case is shielded with a copper faraday cage it shouldve been insulated from the pulse he sighed with relief so the data was safe all was not lostthat is if they could retrieve the pass code he stepped toward cassandra she grinned at him eyes still shining he pulled his glock and pressed it to her forehead painter what are you she stepped back he followed never letting his gun drop whats the code fenton moved to one side commander stay out of it he cut the security chief off and maintained his attention on sanchez four bodyguards and zhang everyone is accounted for here if zhang was onto our surveillance then there was a good chance he alerted his contact at the conference they would have fled together in order to complete the exchange she tried to glance to the bodies but he restrained her with his gun you cant think it was me she said with a half laugh he pointed his free hand never letting his weapon drop i recognize the handiwork of a fortyfive like the sig sauer you carry zhang took it from me painter youre being paranoid i he reached to a pocket and pulled out the bug he found taped to the elevator wall he held it toward her she stiffened but refused to look at it no blood cassandra not a trace which means you never implanted it like you were supposed to a hard edge sharpened her face the computer code she simply stared at him coldly dispassionate now you know i cant he searched this strangers face for the partner he knew but she was long gone there was no remorse no guilt only determination he didnt have the time or the stomach to break her he nodded to fenton have your men cuff her keep her under constant guard as she was being secured she called over to him her words were plainly spoken painter youd best watch your back you have no idea what a shitload of pain you just stepped into he picked up the computer suitcase and walked away youre swimmin in the deep end painter and there are goddamn sharks all around you circling and circling he ignored her and crossed toward the north entrance he had to admit something to himself he simply didnt understand women before he could escape back inside a tall figure in a sheriffs hat blocked his way it was one of the mp tribal police commander crowe yes we have an urgent call dispatched through our offices holding for you his brow crinkled who from from an admiral rector sir you can speak to him on one of our radios painter frowned admiral tony the tiger rector was the director of darpa his commander in chief painter had never spoken to him only seen his name on memos and letters had word already reached washington about the mess out here he allowed himself to be led to one of the parked gray cars lights still flashing atop it he accepted the radio commander crowe here how may i help you sir commander we need you back in arlington immediately theres a helicopter on its way to collect you as if on cue the bell beat of a helicopter sounded in the distance admiral rector continued youll be relieved by commander giles debrief him on the current state of your operation then report here as soon as you land at dulles therell be a car waiting for you yes sir he responded but the connection was already dead he stepped out of the car and stared at the graygreen helicopter sailing over the surrounding woodlands the lands of his ancestors a sense of misgiving rang through him what his father called distrust of the white eyes why had admiral rector called him so abruptly what was the urgency he couldnt help but hear an echo of cassandras words youre swimmin in the deep end painterand there are goddamn sharks all around you circling and circling matters of the heart november pm gmt london england over here i found something safia turned to see one of the men armed with a metal detector call to his partner what now the pair had been turning up bits of bronze statuary iron incense burners and copper coins safia splashed over to see what had been discovered it might be significant across the gallery kara appeared at the entrance to the wing having heard the shout too she joined them what have you found she asked with cold authority im not sure the man said with a nod to his detector but im getting a very strong reading a piece of the meteorite cant tell its under this block of stone safia saw that the block had once been the torso and lower limbs of a sandstone statue toppled onto its back despite the fact that the upper limbs and head had been blasted away she recognized the figure the lifesize statue had once stood guard by a tomb in salalah it dated to bc it depicted a man with an elongated object lifted to his shoulder some thought it looked like a rifle but actually it was a funerary incense lamp borne on the shoulder the destruction of the statue was a tragic loss all that remained now were the torso and two broken legs even these were so blasted by the heat that the sandstone had melted and hardened into a crust of glass over its surface by now others of karas redhatted forensic team gathered around them the man who made the discovery pointed his metal detector at the ruined statue well have to roll the block out of the way see whats under it do it kara said with a nod well need crowbars a pair of men slogged away toward the stash of work tools safia stepped protectively forward kara wait dont you recognize this statue what do you mean look closer this is the statue your father discovered the one found buried by that tomb in salalah we need to preserve what we can i dont care kara pulled her aside by the elbow whats important is that there could be a clue to what happened to my father under there safia tried to pull her aside keeping her voice low karayou cant really think anything of this has to do with your fathers death kara waved to the men with the crowbars give me one of those safia remained where she was her gaze swept around the other rooms of the gallery contemplating it all in a new light all her work the collection the years spent in studywas it more than just a memorial to reginald kensington for kara had it also been a quest to gather research material all in one place to determine what actually happened to her father out in the desert so long ago safia remembered the story from when they were both girls told amid much weeping kara had been convinced something supernatural had killed her father safia knew the details the nisnasesthe ghosts of the deep desert even as girls she and kara had investigated these tales learning all they could about the mythology of the nisnases legend said they were all that remained of a people that once inhabited a vast city in the desert it went by many names iram wabar ubar the city of a thousand pillars mentions of its downfall could be found in the koran in the tales of the arabian nights and among the alexander books founded by the greatgrandchildren of the biblical noah ubar was a rich and decadent city filled with wicked people who dabbled in dark practices its king defied the warnings of a prophet named hud and god smote the city driving it into the sands never to be seen again becoming a veritable atlantis of the deserts afterward tales persisted that the city still remained under the sands haunted by the dead its citizens frozen into stone its fringes plagued by evil djinns and the even nastier nisnases savage creatures of magical powers safia had thought kara had set aside such myths as mere fables especially when investigators had attributed her fathers death to the sudden opening of a sinkhole in the desert such death traps appeared not uncommonly in the region swallowing lone trucks or the unwary wanderer the bedrock below the desert was mostly limestone a porous rock pocked by caverns worn by the receding water table collapses of these caverns occurred regularly often accompanied by the exact phenomenon described by kara a thick roiling column of dust above a whirlpool of swirling sand a few steps away kara grabbed one of the crowbars meaning to add her own shoulder to the effort it seemed she had not been convinced by those earlier geologists explanation safia should have guessed as much especially with karas dogged persistence about ancient arabia using her billions to delve into the past to gather artifacts from all ages to hire the best people including safia she closed her eyes wondering now how much of her own life had been guided by this fruitless quest how influential had kara been in her choice of studies in her research projects here she shook her head it was too much to grasp at the moment she would sort the matter later she opened her eyes and stepped toward the statue blocking the others i cant let you do this kara motioned her aside her voice calm and logical if theres a piece of the meteorite here salvaging it is more important than a few scratches on a broken statue important for whom safia attempted to match karas stolid demeanor but her question came off more as an accusation this statue is one of only a handful from that age in arabia even broken its priceless the meteorite can wait safia said cutting off her benefactor at least until the sculpture can be moved safely kara fixed her with a steely gaze that broke most men safia withstood the challenge having known the girl behind the woman safia stepped toward her she took the crowbar surprised to feel the tremble in the others fingers i know what you were hoping she whispered both knew the history of the camelshaped meteorite of the british explorer who had discovered it how it was supposed to guard the entrance to a lost city buried under the sands a city named ubar and now it had exploded under most strange circumstances there must be some connection kara mumbled repeating her words from a moment ago safia knew one way to dispel such a hope you know that ubar has already been found she let these words sink in in the legendary city had been discovered by nicolas clapp an amateur archaeologist using satellite groundpenetrating radar founded around bc and located at one of the few watering holes the ancient city had been an important trading post on the incense road linking the frankincense groves of the coastal omani mountains to the markets of the rich cities of the north over the centuries ubar had prospered and grown larger until one day half the city collapsed into a giant sinkhole and was abandoned to the sands by the superstitious townfolk it was only an ordinary trading post she continued kara shook her head but safia was unsure if she was negating her last statement or resigning herself to the reality safia remembered karas excitement upon hearing of clapps discovery it had been heralded in newspapers around the globefabled lost arabian city found she had rushed out herself to see the site to help in the early excavation but as safia had stated after two years of digging up potsherds and a few utensils the site turned out to be nothing more exciting than an abandoned trading post no vast treasures no thousand pillars no black ghostsall that was left were those painful memories that haunted the living lady kensington the man with the metal detector called out again maybe dr almaaz was right about not moving this bloody thing both women turned their attention back to the toppled statue it was now flanked by both of the team members with detectors they held their devices to either side of the blocky torso both metal detectors were beeping in chorus i was wrong the first man continued whatever i detected is not under the stone then where is it kara asked irritably the other man answered its inside it a stunned moment of silence followed until kara broke it inside yes maam im sorry i shouldve thought to triangulate earlier but i never thought anything could be inside the stone safia stepped forward its probably just some random iron deposits not from the readings were getting here its a strong signal well have to break it open kara said safia frowned at her bloody hell she dropped to her knees beside the sculpture soaking her pants i need a flashlight she was handed one by another member of the team what are you going to do with that kara asked peek inside safia ran her hand over the heatblasted surface of the statue the sandy surface was now fused glass she planted the flashlight facedown on the statues bulky torso and flicked it on the entire glassy surface of the statue lit up details were murky through the dark crystalline crust safia didnt see anything unusual but the glass was only two inches thick whatever they were looking for might be deeper in the stone kara gasped behind her she was staring over safias shoulder what she began to pull away the flashlight no kara warned move it toward the center safia did so bringing the wash of light over the middle of the torso a shadow appeared a lump in the center of the statue lodged deep at the point where glass became stone it shone a deep crimson under the light the shape was unmistakableespecially given its position inside the torso its a heart kara whispered safia sat back stunned a human heart pm hours later kara kensington stood in the private lavatory outside the department of the ancient near east just one more she shook a single orange pill into her palm adderall a prescription amphetamine twenty milligrams she weighed the pill in her hand so much kick in such a small package but maybe not enough she added a second tablet after all shed had no sleep last night and still had much to do tossing back the pills she dryswallowed them then stared at her reflection in the mirror her skin looked flushed her eyes a bit too wide she ran a hand through her hair trying to fluff some body back into it she failed bending down to the tap she turned the cold spigot soaked both hands and pressed them to her cheeks she took deep breaths it seemed like days rather than hours since she had been woken from her bed back at her family estate in the village of blackheath news of the explosion had her chauffeured limo racing through the stormy streets to reach the museum and now what throughout the long day various forensic teams had gathered all the necessary samples from the gallery charred wood plastics metals even bone finally a few slag fragments of the meteorite had been picked out of the rubble all initial evidence suggested that an electrical discharge had ignited some volatile components deep in the chunk of meteoric iron no one was willing to say what those components were from here the investigation would be carried out in labs both in england and abroad kara could not hide her disappointment witnessing the glowing ball of lightning on the video footage had drawn her back to the day her father had vanished into the dust cloud a spiral of sand sparking with similar crackles of bluish electricity then the explosionanother death there had to be a connection between the past and present but what was it just another dead end like so many times in the past a knock on the door drew her attention from her reflection kara were ready for the examination it was safia in her friends voice she heard concern only safia understood the weight around karas heart ill be right out she dropped the plastic pill vial back into her purse and snapped the satchel closed already the initial surge of druginduced energy took the edge off her despair with one last futile sweep of her hair she crossed to the door unlocked it and pushed out into one of the more handsome research quartersthe famous arched room of the british museum built in the twostory vaulted chamber located in the west section of the museum was of early victorian design double galleries of library shelves pierced iron walkways and stairs arched piers leading into recessed alcoves the very bones of the place harkened back to the times of charles darwin of stanley and livingston of the royal society of scientists where researchers wore jackets with tails and gathered studiously among the stacks of books and ancient tablets never open to the public the department of the ancient near east now utilized the room as a student center and reserve archive but today deserted of all but a select few it served as a makeshift morgue kara stared across the room to the stone cadaver headless and armless resting atop a wheeled stretcher it was all that was left of the ancient sculpture found in the north wing safia had insisted that it be rescued from the rubble and brought up here out of harms way two halogen lamps lit the body and an array of tools rested atop a neighboring library bench set up like a surgeons table with scalpels clamps and thumb forceps there were also varioussize hammers and brushes only the surgeon was missing safia snapped on a pair of latex gloves she wore safety glasses and a tightly cinched apron ready kara nodded lets crack this old mans chest a young man called with the usual crass enthusiasm of an american kara well familiar with all who worked in her gallery knew clay bishop a grad student out of northwestern university he fiddled with a digital camcorder resting on a tripod standing in as the groups videographer a little respect mr bishop safia warned sorry he said with a crooked grin that belied any true remorse he was not unhandsome for a gaunt bit of generation x he wore jeans a vintage concert tshirt depicting the clash and reeboks that might have once been white but this last was only a rumor he straightened stretching showing a strip of his bare belly and ran a hand over the stubble of his red hair the only modicum of studiousness to the grad student was the pair of thick blackrimmed glasses uncool enough to be fashionable nowadays were all set here dr almaaz very good safia stepped under the halogen lights positioning herself beside the spread of tools kara circled to view from the far side joining the only other person observing the autopsy ryan fleming head of security he must have arrived when she had gone to the loo he nodded to her but his stance stiffened at her approach nervous at her proximity like most of the museum staff he cleared his throat as safia took measurements i came down here when i heard about the discovery he mumbled to kara why might that be she asked is there a security concern no it was simple curiosity he nodded to the sculpture not every day we find a statue with a heart hidden inside it that was indeed true though kara suspected it was a different matter of the heart that had drawn fleming down here his eyes spent more time examining safia than the strange statue kara allowed him his puppydog crush and turned her attention to the prone sculpture beneath the shell of blasted glass a deeper glow of crimson took up the lamplight a heart a human heart she leaned closer while the heart appeared lifesize and anatomically correct it had to have been sculpted from some type of ore since the forensic teams detectors had picked up its presence still kara almost expected to see it beat if she waited long enough safia leaned over the statue with a diamondtipped tool she carefully scored the glass forming a perfect square around the buried heart i want to preserve as much as possible next she placed a suctioncup device atop the glass square and gripped the handle i expect the interface between the glass and the sandstone beneath to be weak safia grabbed a rubber mallet and tapped firmly along the inside edge of the glass square small cracks appeared following the prescored lines each pop drew a wince from everyone even kara found her fingers balling up only safia remained calm kara knew her friends propensity for panic attacks during stressful situations but whenever safia labored in her own element she was as hard as the diamonds on her glass cutterand as sharp she worked with a zenlike calmness and focused concentration but kara also noted the glint in her friends eyes excitement it had been a long time since kara had seen such a glimpse in safia a reminder of the woman she used to be maybe there was hope for her yet that should do it safia said she returned the mallet and used a tiny brush to sweep stray chips away keeping her work surface pristine once satisfied she gripped the suction handle and applied a bit of pressure first pushing in one direction then the other gently rocking the square finally she simply pulled straight up lifting the block of glass cleanly away kara stepped closer staring into the statues opened chest the heart was even more detailed than she had first imagined each chamber was distinct including tiny surface arteries and veins it rested perfectly in its sandstone bed as if the sculpture had formed naturally around it a pearl inside an oyster safia carefully freed the glass from the suction device and flipped it over there was an imprint of the hearts upper surface in the glass she turned to the camera clay are you getting a good shot of all this crouched by his camera he bounced up and down on his heels oh man this is fantastic i take that as a yes safia placed the glass on the library table what about the heart fleming asked safia turned and peered into the open chest she tapped the handle of a tiny brush against the heart the ring was heard by all metal for certain bronze id guess from the ruddy color that almost sounded hollow clay commented shifting the camera tripod to get a better view in the chest cavity do it again safia shook her head id best not see how the sandstone lips over the heart in places its locked in there fairly well i think we should leave it untouched other researchers should see this in situ before we disturb it kara hadnt dared breathe for the past minute her heart hammered in her ears and not from the amphetamines had no one else noticed it before she could ask a door slammed farther back in the arched room everyone jumped slightly footsteps approached two men safia tilted the halogen light to shine down the hall director tyson edgar kara stepped forward what are you doing here the head of the museum stepped aside to reveal his companion it was the inspector from central london homicide inspector samuelson was with me when i heard the news of your brilliant discovery we were just finishing up and he asked if he might see the astounding find for himself how could i refuse considering how much help hes been certainly kara said in her best diplomatic tone hiding a flash of irritation youre just in time she waved them over to the makeshift morgue giving up her space her own discovery would have to wait a little longer fleming nodded his greeting to his boss i guess ive seen enough myself i should go check on the night shift he stepped away but not before turning to safia thank you for allowing me to observe anytime she said distantly distracted by the exposed heart kara noted how the head of securitys eyes lingered on safia then turned away wounded as he left safia was forever blind to all but her work she had let greater men than fleming slip from her life inspector samuelson stepped up to fill the security chiefs spot he had his suit jacket over one arm sleeves rolled up i hope im not intruding not at all safia said its a fortunate discovery indeed the inspector leaned over the statue kara was certain more than plain curiosity had drawn him here coincidences were causes for investigation edgar stood at the inspectors shoulder simply brilliant isnt it this discovery will draw attention from all around the world samuelson straightened where did this statue come from it was discovered by my father kara said samuelson glanced to her one eyebrow cocked kara noted how edgar stepped back eyes on his toes it was a tender subject to broach safia pushed up her safety goggles and continued the explanation relieving kara of the need reginald kensington had financed an archaeological team to oversee the excavation for the construction of a new mausoleum at a tomb in the town of salalah on the omani coast he discovered the statue buried beside the older tomb it was a rare discovery to find a preislamic statue one dating to bc in such pristine shape but the tomb had been revered for two millennia thus the site was not overly trampled or desecrated its a true tragedy to have such a perfectly preserved artifact destroyed samuelson was not stirred but its destruction also allowed this new discovery theres a balance in that the same cant be said for poor harry masterson of course safia said quickly i didnt mean to imply thathis death was not the true tragedy youre most correct samuelson glanced around at those gathered his eyes lingered a bit longer on the grad student clay bishop whatever he saw there he found wanting his eyes drifted back to the statue you mentioned a tomb near where this statue was found yes the tomb of nabi imran a pharaoh or something safia smiled this wasnt an egyptian tomb like kara she knew the inspector was playing dumb in arabia the most famous tombs are those that mark the graves of people from the bible or the koran in this case a figure from both nabi imran i dont recall that name from any bible class actually he was quite significant you have heard of the virgin mary vaguely he said this so sincerely he drew another smile from safia she had been teasing out the revelation but she finally relented nabi imran was marys father pm est arlington virginia painter crowe sat in the backseat of the silver mercedes s sedan it glided smoothly down interstate from dulles international heading east toward washington but they werent going that far the driver a taciturn fellow built like a linebacker signaled and took the glebe exit in arlington they were almost to darpa headquarters less than half a mile away he checked his watch only a couple hours ago he had been in connecticut confronting a partner he had trusted for the past five years his thoughts shied away from cassandra but still circled around the sore subject they had been recruited out of special forces at the same time he from the navy seals she from the army rangers darpa had chosen them for a new highly secretive team within the organization codenamed sigma force most in darpa were unaware of its existence sigmas objective was search and seizure a covert militarized team of technically trained agents who were sent into highrisk situations to obtain or protect new research and technologies where the delta force had been established as an antiterrorist squad sigma was started to protect and maintain the technological superiority of the united states no matter the cost and now this call back to headquarters it had to be a new mission but why the urgency the sedan traveled down north fairfax drive and pulled into the parking lot they ran a gauntlet of security measures and were soon sliding into an empty spot another man barrelchested and expressionless stepped forward and opened the door if youll follow me commander crowe painter was led into the main building escorted to the office suite of the director and asked to wait while his attendant proceeded forward to announce his arrival painter stared at the closed door vice admiral tony rector had been the head of darpa for as long as painter had been in service there prior to that he had been the head of the office of information awareness the intelligencegathering wing of darpa critical after september in monitoring data flowing across computer networks in search of terrorist plots activities and financial transactions the admirals intelligence expertise and evenhanded management had eventually won him the directorship of darpa the door opened his escort waved him forward stepping aside and allowing painter to pass once he was through the door closed behind him the room was paneled in dark mahogany and smelled vaguely of pipe tobacco a matching mahogany desk stood in the center behind it tony the tiger rector rose to shake his hand he was a large man not fat but someone who had once been well muscled now gone a little soft as he crossed his sixtieth year but flesh was all that was soft about the man his eyes were blue diamonds his hair slicked and silver his grip was iron as he shook painters hand and nodded him to one of the two leather chairs have a seat ive called up dr mcknight hell be joining us dr sean mcknight was sigmas founder and director painters immediate superior an exnavy seal who had gone on to earn a phd in both physics and information technology if dr mcknight was being called in then all the big boys were coming to play whatever was going down was significant may i ask what this is in regard to sir the admiral settled into his own chair i heard about the bit of unpleasantness up in connecticut he said sidestepping the question the boys down in the advanced technology office are waiting for that spys suitcase computer to be delivered hopefully well be able to retrieve the plasma weapons data from it im sorry wei failed to obtain the password admiral rector shrugged at least the chinese wont be getting their hands on it and considering all you faced you did a fine job up there painter held back asking about his former partner cassandra was most likely heading to a secure site to be interrogated from there who knew guantбnamo bay fort leavenworth or some other military prison it was no longer his concern still an ache throbbed in his chest he hoped it was only indigestion he certainly had no reason to feel any pangs over cassandras fate as to your question the admiral continued drawing him back to the moment something was brought to our attention by the defense sciences office there was an explosion over at the british museum last night painter nodded having listened to the news on cnn on the way here lightning strike so its been reported painter heard the denial and sat straighter before he could inquire the door opened dr sean mcknight strode into the room a gale barely suppressed his face was red his brow damp like hed run all the way here its been confirmed he said quickly to the admiral admiral rector nodded take a seat then we dont have much time as his boss sat in the remaining leather chair painter glanced over mcknight had worked with darpa for twentytwo years including a stint as the director of its special projects office one of his first special projects had been the formation of sigma force he had envisioned a team of operatives who were both technologically savvy and militarily trainedbrains and brawn as he liked to saywho could operate with surgical precision to secure and protect classified technologies sigma force was the result painter had been one of the first recruits handpicked by mcknight after painter had sustained a broken leg during a mission in iraq while he had been recuperating mcknight had taught him the value of honing his mind as well as his body putting him through an academic boot camp that was tougher than his buds training to become a navy seal there was no person on the planet whom painter held in higher esteem and now to see him so shaken mcknight sat near the edge of his seat back straight it looked like he had slept in the charcoal suit he wore appearing all his fiftyfive years at the moment his eyes crinkled with worry lips tight sandy gray hair uncombed something was clearly wrong admiral rector swiveled a plasma monitor on his desk toward painter commander crowe you should view this footage first painter shifted closer ready for some answers the screens desktop filled with a blackandwhite video this is the security surveillance for the british museum he sat silently as the video rolled a guard appeared on the screen entering a museum gallery it didnt take long as the explosion ended the tape whiting out the screen painter sat back his two superiors studied him that luminous sphere he said slowly that was ball lightning if im not mistaken indeed admiral rector confirmed it was the same assessment that drew the attention of a pair of researchers with the defense sciences office who were in london ball lightning has never been caught on film or been that destructive dr mcknight added painter recalled a lecture hed heard during his sigma force training in electrical engineering ball lightning had been reported from the times of the early greeks seen by groups of people and reported in many places its rarity had kept it a mystery theories for its formation varied from freefloating plasma caused by the ionization of air during thunderstorms to the vaporization of silicon dioxide from the soil after lightning struck the ground so what happened at the british museum he asked this admiral rector had removed an object from a desk drawer and placed it on his blotter it looked like a blackened piece of rock about the size of a softball we had it shipped on a military jet this morning what is it the admiral nodded for him to pick it up he did and found the object unusually heavy not rock it felt dense enough to be lead meteoric iron dr mcknight explained a sample from the artifact that you saw explode a moment ago painter placed the chunk back on the desk i dont understand are you saying the meteor caused the explosion not the ball lightning yes and no mcknight answered cryptically what do you know of the tunguska explosion in russia rector asked the sudden shift in subject caught painter off guard his brow furrowed as he dredged up old history not much something about a meteor strike back in somewhere up in siberia caused a big blast rector leaned back big is a bit of an understatement the explosion uprooted a forest for forty miles around over an area about half the size of rhode island the blast liberated the energy equivalent of two thousand atomic bombs horses were knocked over four hundred miles away big just doesnt quite cover the extent of the explosion there were other effects too mcknight said a magnetic storm created a vortex for six hundred miles all around for days afterward the night skies were luminescent from the amount of dust bright enough to read a newspaper by an em pulse wrapped itself halfway around the world christ painter mumbled those who witnessed the blast from hundreds of miles away reported seeing a streaking bright light in the sky as brilliant as the sun trailing a tail of iridescent colors the meteor painter said admiral rector shook his head that was one theory a stony asteroid or comet but there are several problems with that theory first no meteor fragments have ever been found not even any telltale iridium dust carbonaceous meteors usually leave an iridium fingerprint mcknight said but such a finding was never unearthed in tunguska and there was no crater the admiral added mcknight nodded the force of the blast was forty megatons prior to that the last meteor to even come close to such force struck arizona some fifty thousand years ago and it was only three megatons a mere fraction of tunguska and it left a massive crater a mile wide and five hundred feet deep so why no crater especially when we so clearly know the epicenter of the blast due to the radial felling of the trees outward from ground zero painter had no answer to thisor to the more immediate question in his mind what did any of this have to do with the british museum mcknight continued since the time of the explosion there have also been interesting biological consequences noted in the region an accelerated growth of certain ferns an increase in the rate of mutations including genetic abnormalities in the seeds and needles of pine trees and even ant populations and humans have not escaped the effect the local evenk tribes in the area demonstrate abnormalities in their rh blood factors all clear indications of some radiological exposure most likely gamma in origin painter tried to wrap his mind around a craterless explosion unusual atmospheric effects and residual gamma radiation so what caused all this admiral rector answered something quite small about seven pounds thats impossible he blurted the admiral shrugged if it was ordinary matter the mystery hung in the air for a long moment dr mcknight finally spoke newest research as of suggests that what struck tunguska was indeed a meteorbut one composed of antimatter painters eyes widened antimatter he now understood why he had been called into this briefing while most folks considered antimatter to be the realm of science fiction it had become reality in the past decade with the production of antimatter particles in laboratories leading the forefront in this research was cern laboratories in geneva switzerland the lab had been producing antimatter for close to two decades using a subterranean low energy antiproton ring but to date an entire years production of antiprotons by cern would produce only enough energy to flicker a lightbulb for a few moments still antimatter was intriguing a single gram of antimatter would produce the energy equivalent of an atomic bomb of course someone would first have to discover a cheap readily available source of antimatter and that was impossible painter found his eyes on the lump of meteoric iron resting atop admiral rectors desk he knew that the upper atmosphere of the earth was under constant bombardment by antimatter particles in cosmic rays but they were immediately annihilated when they came in contact with atmospheric matter it had been postulated that there might be asteroids or comets in the vacuum of space composed of antimatter left over from the big bang he began to connect some of the dots in his head the explosion at the british museum weve tested some of the debris from the blasted gallery mcknight said metal and wood painter remembered his bosss statement upon arriving here its been confirmed a cold lump formed in the pit of his belly mcknight continued the blast debris bears a lowlevel radiation signature that matches tunguska are you saying that the explosion at the british museum was caused by antimatter annihilation that that meteor is actually antimatter admiral rector rolled the blasted fragment back and forth with a finger of course not this is ordinary meteoric iron nothing more then i dont understand mcknight spoke up the radiation signature cant be ignored its too exact to be random something happened the only explanation is that somehow the meteor had antimatter stored within it in some unknown stabilized form the electrical discharge by the ball lightning destabilized it and created a cascade effect with the resulting explosion whatever antimatter had been present was consumed during the blast leaving only this shell behind the admiral said nudging the stone silence settled over the room the implications were enormous admiral rector picked up the chunk of iron can you imagine the significance if were right a source of almost unlimited power if there is some clue as to how this is possibleor better yet a sample it must not fall into other hands painter found himself nodding so what is the next step admiral rector stared hard at him we cant let word of this connection leak out not even to our own allies too many ears are connected to too many mouths he nodded for dr mcknight to continue his boss took a deep breath commander we want you to lead a small team over to the museum your cover has already been established as american scientists specializing in lightning research youre to make contacts when and where you can while there your objective is simply to keep your ears to the ground and to note any new discoveries that might be made out there well continue research here with all departments mobilized if any further investigation on site is needed in london your team will be our goto people yes sir there was a flicker of eye contact between admiral rector and dr mcknight an unspoken question painter felt an icy finger trace his spine the admiral nodded again mcknight turned to face painter there is one more factor here we may not be the only ones working this angle what do you mean if you remember the director mentioned a pair of researchers from the defense sciences office over in london the ones who investigated the balllightning sighting correct again a flicker of contact between painters two superiors then his boss fixed him with a hard stare four hours ago they were found shot execution style in their room the place was ransacked several items were stolen the metropolitan police are considering it a robbery homicide admiral rector stirred behind his desk but i never could stomach coincidences they give me heartburn mcknight nodded we dont know if the murders are connected to our line of investigation but we want you and your team to proceed as if they were watch each others backs and keep alert he nodded in the meantime the admiral said lets just hope they dont discover anything significant out there until you get across the pond pm gmt london england you haveto remove the heart safia glanced up from her measurements with a tiny silver caliper the arched room of the museum lay dark all around there were only the three of them left kara clay and herself edgar and the inspector had left twenty minutes ago it seemed the exacting measurements and notations of minutiae had not held their interest diminishing the momentary wonder of the statues origin as a funerary sculpture for the tomb of the virgin marys father safia returned to her measurements ill remove the heart eventually no tonight safia studied her friend closer karas face was limned in the halogen spots the stark light bled all the color from her face but safia noted the silvery sheen to her skin the wide cast to her pupils she was high amphetamines again three years ago safia had been one of the few who had known lady kensingtons monthlong vacation abroad had actually been a trip through rehab in an exclusive private clinic down in kent how long had she been using again she glanced to clay now was not the time to confront her whats the hurry she asked instead karas eyes darted around the room her voice lowered before the inspector arrived i noted something im surprised you havent seen it yet what kara leaned over and pointed to one of the exposed sections of the heart specifically the right ventricle look at this raised line here she traced it with the tip of the caliper one of the coronary arteries or veins safia said amazed at the artistry is it kara pointed see how perfectly horizontal the top section is then it drops down vertically at both ends at ninety degrees she followed the vessels course her fingers shook with a characteristic amphetamine tremor kara continued everything on this heart is so naturally rendered da vinci would have a hard time being so anatomically precise she stared over to safia nature doesnt like ninetydegree angles safia leaned closer she traced the lines with her fingers as if she were reading braille doubt slowly faded to shock the endsthey simply stop abruptly they dont blend back down its a letter kara said epigraphic south arabian safia agreed naming the ancient script from the region a script that predated hebrew and aramaic its the letter b and look at what we can see of the upper heart chamber the right atrium clay said behind them they both glanced at him i was premed before i realized the sight of blood had such awell negative effect on what i had for lunch kara returned to the sculpture and pointed her caliper again a good portion of the upper atrium is still obscured by the sandstone encasement but i think thats another letter hidden under there safia leaned closer she felt with her fingers the tail end of exposed vessels ended abruptly as they did on the first one ill have to work carefully she reached for the array of picks chisels and tiny hammers with the proper tools in hand she set about with the precision of a surgeon hammer and chisel to break away the larger chunks of brittle sandstone then pick and brush to clear away in a matter of minutes the right atrium was cleared safia stared down at the crisscrossing of what appeared to be coronary vessels but they mapped out a perfect letter it was too complex for mere chance what letter is that clay asked theres not a direct corresponding letter in english safia answered the letter is pronounced somewhat like the sound wa so in translations its often listed wa or even u as thats what it sounds like orally though in truth there are no vowels in epigraphic south arabian script kara met her eyes we have to remove the heart she repeated if there are more letters theyd be on the opposite side safia nodded the left side still remained locked in the stone chest she hated to disturb the statue any further but curiosity drove her to pick up her tools without argument she set to work it took her a full half hour to remove the sandstone clamped around the heart finally she attached the suction clamp and gripped the handle with both hands with a prayer to the old gods of arabia she pulled evenly up using all the muscles in her shoulders at first it appeared to be stuck but it was merely heavier than she had anticipated with a determined grimace of effort she lifted the heart free of the chest bits of sandstone and loose grains showered down at arms length she swung the prize around to the library table kara hurried over to join them safia placed the heart on a square of soft leather chamois to protect it then unfastened the suction clamp the heart rolled slightly once released a small sloshing sound accompanied it safia glanced at the others had they heard it too i told you i thought the thing was hollow clay whispered safia reached and rocked the heart on the chamois the center of gravity rolled with the rocking it reminded her oddly of one of those old magic balls theres some type of fluid in the center clay backed up a step great it had better not be blood i prefer my cadavers desiccated and wrapped like mummies its sealed tight safia assured him examining the heart i cant even spot a way to open it its almost like the bronze heart was forged around it riddles wrapped inside riddles kara said and took her turn rolling and checking the heart what about more lettering safia joined her it took them half a moment to orient themselves and find the two remaining chambers she ran her finger over the largest the left ventricle it was smooth and bare nothing kara said surprised and baffled maybe it wore away safia checked more thoroughly painting it with a bit of isopropyl alcohol to clean its surface i see no scoring or trace its too smooth what about the left atrium clay asked she nodded turning the heart she quickly spotted a line arcing cleanly over the face of the atrium its the letter r kara whispered sounding slightly frightened she collapsed down on a chair it cant be clay frowned i dont understand the letters b wa or u and r what does it spell those three esa letters should be known to you mr bishop safia said maybe not in that order she picked up a pencil and drew them out as they should be spelled clay scrunched his face esa is read like hebrew and arabic from right to left opposite of english wabr ubr but the vowels are excluded between consonants the young mans eyes widened ubar the goddamn lost city of arabia the atlantis of the sands kara shook her head first a meteorite fragment that was supposed to guard ubar explodesand now we find the name written on a bronze heart if it is bronze safia said still bent over the heart kara was shaken out of her shock what do you mean safia lifted the heart in her hands when i pulled the heart out of the statue it seemed way too heavy especially if its hollowed out and full of liquid see where i cleaned the left ventricle with the alcohol the base metal is much too red kara stood understanding dawning in her eyes you think its iron like the meteorite fragment safia nodded possibly even the same meteoric iron ill have to test it but either way it makes no sense at the time of the sculptures carving the peoples of arabia didnt know how to smelt and work iron of this quality especially a masterful piece of art like this there are so many mysteries here i dont even know where to begin if youre right kara said fiercely then that drab trading post unearthed in the desert back in is a far cry from the whole story something is yet undiscovered she pointed to the artifact like the true heart of ubar but what do we do now whats the next step were no closer to knowing anything about ubar clay was examining the heart its sort of strange that the left ventricle has no letters ubar is only spelled with three letters safia explained then why use a fourchambered heart and spell the letters in the direction of blood flow safia swung around explain yourself blood enters the heart from the body through the vena cava into the right atrium the letter u he poked a finger at the stumped large vessel that led to the right upper chamber and continued his anatomy lesson tracing his way it then passes through the atrioventricular valve to the right ventricle the letter b from there the blood leaves for the lungs via the pulmonary artery then returns oxygenrich through the pulmonary vein to the left atrium the lette r r spelling out ubar so why does it stop there why indeed safia mumbled brow furrowed she pondered the mystery the name ubar was spelled in the path that blood traveled it seemed to imply a direction a flow toward something a glimmer of an idea formed where does the blood go after it leaves the heart clay pointed to a thick arched vessel at the very top through the aorta to the brain and the rest of the body safia rolled the heavy heart followed the aorta to where it ended and stared inside the stump a plug of sandstone was jammed in there she had not bothered to clean it out too busy concentrating on the surface of the chambers what are you thinking kara asked its like the writing is pointing somewhere she returned the heart to the table and began to clean away the sandstone from the end of the aorta it crumbled away easily she sat back at what she found beyond the sand what is that clay asked staring over her shoulder something prized more than blood itself by the ancient peoples of arabia she used a pick to pry a few crystalline chunks of the dried resin onto the table she could smell the sweet aroma given off by the crystals preserved throughout the long centuries it was a scent from a time before christ frankincense kara said awe in her voice what does it mean its a signpost safia answered as the blood flows so do the riches of ubar she turned to her friend the clue must point toward ubar to the next step on the road to its doorway but where does it point kara asked safia shook her head im not sure but the town of salalah is the beginning of the famous incense road she nudged the bits of crystalline frankincense and the tomb of nabi imran lies within that city kara straightened then thats where we must begin the search search we must put an expedition together immediately kara spoke rapidly eyes wide but it was not the amphetamines fueling her excitement it was hope in a weeks time no later my contacts in oman will make all the necessary arrangements and well need the best people you of course and whomever you see fit me safia asked her heart skipping a beat iim noti havent done fieldwork in years youre going kara said firmly its time for you to quit hiding in these dusty halls get back out in the world i can coordinate data from here im not needed in the field kara stared at her looking as if she was going to relent as she had in the past then her voice dropped to a husky whisper saff i need you if somethings truly out therean answer she shook her head close to tears i need you with me i cant do it by myself safia swallowed struggling with herself how could she refuse her friend she stared at the fear and hope in karas eyes but in her head old screams still echoed she could not silence them blood of children still stained her hands ii cant something must have broken in her face because kara finally shook her head i understand but from her clipped tone she didnt no one did kara continued but you were right about one thing well need an experienced field archaeologist on board and if youre not going i know the perfect person safia realized whom she meant oh no kara seemed to sense her distress you know hes had the most field experience in the region she rummaged in her purse and pulled out her cellular phone if were going to succeed were going to need indiana jones white water november am yangtze river china im not indiana jones he yelled into the satellite phones headset to be heard over the jet boats motor names omahadr omaha dunn kara you know that an exasperated sigh answered him omaha indiana what bloody difference does it make all your american names sound the same he crouched over the wheel racing down the crooked river gorge cliffs flanked both sides of the muddy yangtze as it twisted and turned through a section aptly named the narrows in a few years three gorges dam would flood this entire region to the tranquil depth of two hundred feet but for now submerged rocks and wicked rapids remained a constant danger as the fierce river choked through the squeeze but rocks and rapids werent the only danger a bullet pinged off the boats hull a warning shot the pursuers rapidly closed the distance in a pair of black scimitar bow riders damn fast boats listen kara what do you want his jet boat hit a swell and bumped airborne for a breath he lifted from his seat gripping tighter on the boats steering wheel with his one hand a yelp of surprise sounded behind him omaha yelled over a shoulder hang on the boat struck the water with a jolt a moan followed now you tell me a glance behind confirmed that his younger brother danny was all right he was sprawled in the stern his head buried in a supply cabinet under the rear seat beyond the stern the twin black speedboats continued their pursuit omaha muffled the phones receiver with his hand get the shotgun his brother fell out of the supply chest dragging the weapon clear he pushed up his glasses with the back of his wrist got it and the shells oh yeah danny dove back in omaha shook his head his brother was a renowned paleontologist having earned his phd at twentyfour but oftentimes he put the scatter in scatterbrained omaha lifted the phone kara whats this all about whats going on she asked instead nothing but were sort of in the middle of something here why did you call there was a long pause he didnt know if it was due to the time lag in the satellite communication between london and china or merely thoughtful silence on karas part either way it gave him too much time to think he hadnt seen kara kensington in four years not since he had broken off his engagement with safia almaaz he knew this wasnt a casual call kara sounded serious and clipped flaring worry for safia in him he couldnt end the call until he knew she was okay kara spoke im putting together an expedition into oman id like you to lead the field team are you interested he almost hung up again it was a stupid business call no thanks this is important he heard the strain in her voice he groaned whats the time frame we gather in muscat in one week i cant give you the details over the phone but its a major discovery it may rewrite the history of the entire arabian peninsula before he could answer danny pushed up next to him i loaded both barrels he held the gun out to omaha but i dont know how youre going to hold them off with nothing more than salt shot im not you are he pointed the phone behind him aim for their hull just rattle em enough to buy me some time ive got my hands full here danny nodded swinging around he pulled the phone back to his face and heard kara in midrant wrong what is all this about shooting calm down just chasing off some big river rats the shotgun blast cut him off missed danny swore behind him kara spoke what about the expedition danny cranked the next shell should i shoot again yes goddamnit brilliant kara said misinterpreting his outburst well see you in muscat in a week you know the place wait i didnt but the connection was severed he threw the phone headset down kara damn well knew he hadnt been agreeing to the expedition as usual she had taken advantage of the situation i hit one of the boats drivers in the face danny yelled his voice surprised its heading for shore but watch out the others flanking starboard omaha glanced to the right the sleek black scimitar raced up alongside them four men in worn gray uniforms former soldiers crouched low a bullhorn lifted mandarin spilled out in commanding tones that basically meant throttle downor die to punctuate this demand a rocket launcher appeared and was pointed at their boat i dont think throwing salt at them is going to help this time danny said sinking into the other seat with no choice omaha pulled back on the throttle and slowed the boat he waved an arm in admitted defeat danny opened the glove compartment inside was a perfectly preserved trio of fossilized tyrannosaurus eggs worth their weight in gold discovered in the gobi desert they had been destined for a museum in beijing unfortunately such a treasure was not without its admirers many collectors bought and sold such items on the black marketfor princely sums hang on omaha whispered to his brother danny closed the glove compartment please dont do what i think youre going to do no one steals from me im the only grave robber around these parts he flipped open the thumb switch that protected the nitrous feed to the pulse jets incorporated into the hamilton turbo impeller he had salvaged the boat from an outfitter out of new zealand it had raced tourists through black rock river outside of auckland he eyed the next twist of the crooked river thirty yards with a little luck he punched the button nitrous gas poured into the impeller igniting the pulse jets licks of flame spat from the twin exhausts accompanied by a throaty scream of the jets the boats bow shot up the stern dug deep shouts erupted from the other boat caught off guard they were too slow bringing the rocket launcher to bear omaha shoved the throttle wide open the boat rocketed across the water a torpedo of aluminum and chrome danny scrambled to belt himself in his seat ohmygod omaha simply kept his stance in front of the wheel knees half bent he needed to feel the balance of the boat under him they reached the jag in the river he risked a glance over his shoulder the other boat sped toward them struggling to keep up but their pursuers had one distinct advantage a flash of fire marked the launch of a rocketpropelled grenade a blackmarket chinese rpg type with a lethal radius of twenty meters they didnt have to be close omaha tore the wheel to the right canting the boat high up on the port side they skimmed the water plowing around the corner the grenade rocketed past just missing the stern clearing the bend omaha straightened the boat and shot it down the center of the river the explosion ripped into the opposite cliff face boulders and rocks rained down amid a cloud of smoke and dust he eked more speed out of the jets barely touching the water now the boat handled as if it were on ice behind him the other boat appeared around the smoky bend racing after them they were loading another grenade into the launcher he couldnt give them another chance to get a clear shot at him luckily the narrows were in a cooperative mood the twists and crooked bends kept them out of sight for a fair stretch but it also forced omaha to cut the nitrous feed and slow their own boat can we outrun them danny asked i dont think we have a choice why not turn over the eggs its not worth our lives omaha shook his head at his brothers naпvetй it was hard to believe they were brothers they were both the same sixfoottwo the same sandy blond hair but danny looked as if he had been put together with wire and bone omaha was built broader and rougher around the edges hardened by the world his skin burned by suns from six out of the seven continents and the ten years that separated younger brother from older had marked his face with lines like the rings of a tree sun crinkles at the corners of his eyes deep furrows across his brow from too much frowning and not enough smiling his brother remained unmarked smooth a blank slate waiting to be written upon he had finished his doctoral program only last year speeding through columbia as if it were a footrace he suspected that a part of dannys rush through school had been the desire to join his older brother in the wider world well this was it long days few showers stinking tents dirt and sweat in every crack and for what to have some thieves pilfer their find if we gave them the eggs theyd kill us anyway omaha finished tweaking the boat around another sharp turn in the river these folks dont leave trails behind them danny searched behind the stern so we run as fast as we can the whine of the scimitars motor ratcheted up as the other boat cleared the bend behind them they were closing the distance he needed more speed hoping for a short stretch of open water one long enough that he could open the nitrous wide and put some distance between them again but not too long a stretch that their pursuers could take another potshot he wrangled the boat back and forth through a narrow switchback worry made him miss spotting a hidden rock the boat jarred into it hung up for a breath then with a screech of aluminum dragged free again that couldnt have been good danny commented no it wasnt his brows furrowed deeper through his feet he felt a persistent tremble in the boat even on flat water something had torn again the sound of the scimitars engine whined louder as omaha rounded another bend he caught a glimpse of their pursuers seventy yards behind he faced around and heard danny groan the river ahead boiled and frothed with white water this section of the river pinched between high walls a long straight stretch of river too long too straight if there had been a place to run the boat aground and take their chances overland he wouldve done it but they had no choice he continued down the gorge studying the flows and alert for rocks he mapped the plan in his head danny youre not going to like this what a quarter of the way down the rapids he spun the boat into an eddy and skipped it around in a tight circle pointing the bow back upriver what are you doing the boats corked he said theres no way we can outrun them were going to have to take the fight to them danny nudged the shotgun salt shot against a rocket launcher all it takes is the element of surprise that and perfect timing pushing the throttle forward he edged back into the current this time working upriver he followed the map in his head skirt around that drop around that deep boil edge clear of the rock splitting the current take the calmer side he aimed for a standing refractory wave as it humped over a boulder worn smooth by the constant churn of water the whine of the other boat grew as it approached here they come danny pushed up his glasses over the lip of the wave omaha spotted the bow end of the scimitar clear the corner he shifted his thumb and flipped the cover over the nitrous feed he twisted the nozzle to full feed it was all or nothing the scimitar rounded the bend and spotted them it must appear that they were floundering turned ass backward by some mean boil or whirlpool the other boat slowed but momentum and the current brought the scimitar into the rapids their pursuers were only ten yards away now too close to use the grenade launcher shrapnel from the explosion would risk their own boat and lives it was a momentary standoff or so it seemed grab tight omaha warned as he punched the nitrous injector it was like someone had ignited a case of tnt under their stern the boat bolted forward slamming into the standing wave striking the boulder hidden beneath the bow climbed the flat rock driving the stern down the twin pulse jets shot the aluminum frame straight up they went airborne over the wave flying high trailing fire danny holleredthen again so did omaha their boat sailed over the scimitar but it was not meant for true flight the nitrous cut out the flames died and their boat came crashing down atop the fiberglass scimitar the jolt knocked omaha on his ass water flooded over the gunwales swamping him then the boat bobbed back up danny im fine he was still strapped to his seat looking dazed crawling forward omaha searched beyond the rail the scimitar lay shattered in pieces floating in different directions a body facedown bobbled among the debris blood trailed through the muddy waters forming its own river the smell of fuel fogged the air but at least the current was dragging them safely away from the wreckage in case it exploded omaha spotted two men clinging to flotsam heading down into the raging rapids with their makeshift floaters they seemed to have lost interest in dinosaur eggs climbing back into the seat he checked the engine it coughed and died no hope there the aluminum frame was bent the keel pocked but at least they were seaworthy he broke out the paddles danny unbuckled and accepted one of the paddles what now call for help before that other boat comes to investigate whore you going to call am gmt safia wascarefully wrapping up the iron heart in acidfree specimen paper when the phone on the bench rang it was karas mobile phone she had left it behind as she retreated to the lavatory again to freshen up she had told safia and clay but safia knew better more pills the phone continued to ring you want me to get that clay asked folding up the camera tripod safia sighed and picked it up it might be important hello she said as she flipped it open there was a long pause hello she offered again can i help you a throat cleared sounding far away safia it was said in a soft stunned voice one she knew all too well blood drained to her feet omaha ii was trying to reach kara i didnt realize you were there too she fought her tongue free from the shock her words came out stiff karasindisposed at the moment if youll hold ill get wait safia she froze from lowering the phone holding it as if she had forgotten how to use it with the phone pulled away from her ear omahas voice sounded tinny imaybe he struggled for words finally settling on a neutral question if youre over there with her then you must know what this is all about what sort of expedition am i being shanghaied into safia put the phone back to her ear she could handle shoptalk its a long story but we found something here something extraordinary it points to a possible new history about ubar ubar exactly there was another longish pause so this is about karas father yes and for once kara may be onto something significant will you be joining the expedition this question was asked woodenly no i can be more help here nonsense the next words gushed out loudly she had to hold the phone away again you know more about ubar and its history than anyone on the face of the earth you must come if not for kara then for yourself a voice suddenly spoke at her shoulder having eavesdropped on omahas tinny words hes right kara said stepping around if were going to solve this riddle and any more we come across we need you onsite safia stared between the phone and her friend feeling trapped kara reached over and took the cell omaha shes coming safia opened her mouth to protest this is too important kara said cutting her off speaking both to omaha and safia her eyes shone glassily with the surge of druginduced adrenaline i wont accept nofrom either of you im in said omaha his words an electronic whisper matter of fact i could use a little help getting out kara lifted the phone turning the conversation private she listened for a while then nodded as she spoke are you ever not in trouble indiana i have your gps coordinates a helicopter will be out to retrieve you within the hour she snapped the phone closed youre truly better off without him kara youre going in a weeks time you owe me that she stormed off after an awkward moment clay spoke up i wouldnt mind going she frowned the grad student knew nothing about the real world and maybe that was a good thing she sensed she had started something that was best left forever buried high wire act november am gmt london england hours after kara had stormed off safia sat in her dark office the only light came from a limeshaded bankers lamp atop her walnut desk illuminating a sea of paper and thumbed journals how could kara expect her to be ready to leave for oman in a weeks time especially after the explosion here there was still so much to attend to she couldnt go that was that kara would simply have to understand and if she didnt that wasnt safias concern she had to do what was right for herself she had heard that often enough from her therapist it had taken her four years to gather some semblance of normalcy in her life to find security in her days to sleep without nightmares here was home and she wasnt going to forsake it for a wildgoose chase into the hinterlands of oman and then there was the prickly matter of the omaha dunn safia chewed the eraser end of her pencil it was her only meal in the past twelve hours she knew she should leave nip out for a late dinner at the pub on the corner then try to catch a few hours of sleep besides billie had been sorely neglected over the past day and would need attention and a spot of tuna to assuage his hurt feelings still safia could not move she kept running over her conversation with omaha an old ache throbbed in the pit of her belly if only she hadnt picked up the phone she had met omaha ten years ago in sojar when she was twentytwo fresh from oxford researching a dissertation on parthian influences in southern arabia he had been stranded in the same seaside city awaiting approval from the omani government to proceed into a remote section of disputed territory do you speak english were his first words to safia she was working behind a small table on the dining terrace of a small hostelry overlooking the arabian sea it was the haunt of many students doing research in the region being cheap as chips and serving the only decent coffee around irritated at the interruption she had been curt as a british citizen i should hope i speak better english than you sir glancing up she discovered a young man sandy blond hair cornflower blue eyes a dusky trace of beard wearing scuffed khakis a traditional omani headcloth and an embarrassed smile excuse me he said but i noticed you had a copy of arabian archaeology and epigraphy i was wondering if i could glance at a section she picked up the book which section oman and the emirates in ptolemys map im heading into the borderlands truly i thought that region had been closed to foreigners again that smile only it had grown a mischievous edge so you caught me i shouldve said i hope to be traveling to the borderlands im still awaiting word from the consulate she had leaned back and eyed him up and down she switched to arabic what do you plan to do up there he didnt miss a beat responding in arabic himself to help settle the border dispute by proving the ancient tribal routes of the local duru tribes confirming an historical precedent she continued in arabic checking his knowledge of the regions geography youll have to be careful in umm alsamim yes the quicksands he said with a nod ive read about that treacherous stretch his eyes flashed with eagerness safia relented and passed him her copy of the periodical its the only copy from the institute of arabian studies ill have to ask you to read it here from the ias he had taken a step forward thats the kensington nonprofit isnt it yes why ive been trying to reach someone in authority over there to grease some wheels with the omani government but no one would return my calls or letters that place is a tough nut to crack like its sponsor lady kara kensington now theres a cold fish if there ever was one hmm she said noncommittally after making their introductions he asked if he could share her table while he read the article she had nudged the chair in his direction i heard the coffees quite good here he said as he sat the teas even better she countered but then again im british they had continued in silence for a long while reading their respective journals each occasionally eyeing the other sipping their drinks finally safia noticed the terrace door swing open behind her guest she waved he turned at the arrival of the newcomer to their table his eyes widened dr dunn safia said may i introduce you to lady kara kensington youll be happy to know she speaks english too she had enjoyed watching color blush to his cheeks caught off guard blindsided she suspected such didnt happen often to the young man the three of them spent the rest of the afternoon talking debating current events in arabia and back home discussing arabian history kara left before the sun set heading off to an early business dinner with the local chamber of commerce but not before promising to help dr dunn with his expedition i guess i owe you at least dinner he had stated afterward and i suppose i must accept that night they shared a leisurely dinner of woodfired kingfish accompanied with spiced rukhal bread they talked until the sun sank into the sea and the skies filled with stars that was their first date their second date wouldnt be for another six months after omaha was finally freed from a yemeni prison for entering a holy muslim site without permission despite the penal setback they continued to see each other off and on across four out of the seven continents one christmas eve back at his familys home in lincoln nebraska he had dropped to a knee by the couch and asked her to marry him she had never been happier then a month later everything changed in one blinding flash she shied away from that last memory standing up finally from her desk to clear her head it was too stuffy in her office she needed to walk to keep moving it would be good to feel the breeze on her face even the damp chill of londons winter she retrieved her coat and locked up her office safias office was located on the second floor the stairs down to the first floor were at the other end of the wing near the kensington gallery which meant she would have to pass the explosion site again not something she wanted to do but she had no choice she set off down the long dark hall illuminated by the occasional red security lamp usually she enjoyed the empty museum it was a peaceful time after the daily bustle she would often wander the gated galleries staring at cabinets and displays comforted by the weight of history no longer not this night circulating fans had been set up like guard towers on long poles the entire length of the north wing whirring and rattling noisily trying and failing to disperse the reek of charred wood and burned plastics space heaters dotted the floor snaking orange cords set up to dry out the halls and galleries after the pumps had drained the worst of the sooty water it made the hall swelter like the damp warmth of the tropics the line of fans stirred the air only sluggishly her heels tapped the marble floor as she passed the galleries displaying the museums ethnographical collection celtic russian chinese the damage from the explosion grew worse the nearer she approached her own gallery smokestained walls ribbons of police tape piles of swept plaster broken glass as she passed the opening to the egyptian exhibit she heard a muffled tinkle behind her like breaking glass she stopped and glanced over a shoulder for a moment she thought she spotted a flicker of light from the byzantine gallery she stared for a long breath the opening remained dark she fought down a growing panic since the attacks had begun she had difficulty distinguishing real danger from false her heart thudded in her throat and the hairs on her arms tingled as a nearby fan rotated its pass over her whirring asthmatically just the headlamps of a passing car she assured herself swallowing her anxiety she turned back around to discover a dark figure looming in the hall outside the kensington gallery she stumbled back safia the figure lifted a hand torch and flicked it on blinding her with its brightness dr almaaz she sighed with relief and hurried forward shielding her eyes ryan it was the head of security ryan fleming i thought you had gone home he smiled and flicked off the torch i was on my way when i was paged by director tyson it seems a pair of american scientists insisted that they review the explosion site he walked her toward the opening to the gallery inside two figures dressed in identical blue jumpsuits moved through the dark gallery the only illumination came from a pair of lamp poles in each room that cast weak pools of light in the dimness the investigators instruments glowed brightly they appeared to be geiger counters in one hand each of them held a compact base unit with a lighted computer screen in the other they carried meterlong black wands attached to the base unit by a coiled cord they slowly worked one of the gallery rooms in tandem sweeping their instruments over singed walls and piles of debris physicists out of mit fleming said they flew in this evening and came directly here from the airport they must have some pull tyson insisted i accommodate them post haste to quote our esteemed director i should introduce you still edgy safia tried to bow out i really must be getting home fleming had already stepped into the gallery one of the investigators a tall man with ruddy features noted him then her he lowered his wand and strode rapidly forward dr almaaz what good fortune he held out a hand i had hoped to speak to you she accepted his hand im dr crowe he said painter crowe his eyes piercing and attentive were the color of lapis his hair long to the shoulder ebony black she noted his tanned complexion native american she guessed but the blue eyes were throwing her off maybe it was just the name crowe he could easily be spanish too he had a generous smile that was also reserved this is my colleague dr coral novak the woman shook safias hand perfunctorily with only the tiniest nod she seemed anxious to return to her survey the two scientists could not be more different compared to her darkly handsome companion the woman seemed devoid of pigment a pale shadow her skin glowed like freshly scrubbed snow her lips thin her eyes icy gray her naturally whiteblond hair was cropped short she stood as tall as safia lithe of limb but still carried a certain sturdiness to her frame it could be felt in her firm handshake what are you searching for safia asked taking a step back painter lifted his wand were checking for radiation signatures radiation she could not hide her shock he laughednot condescendingly only warmly dont worry its a specific signature were looking for something following lightning strikes she nodded i didnt mean to disturb you it was nice meeting you both and if theres anything i can do to facilitate your investigation please let me know she began to turn away painter stepped after her dr almaaz i had meant to hunt you down i have a few questions that i would like to discuss with you maybe over lunch im afraid im very busy those eyes caught hers she was trapped unable to look away she read the disappointment in his pinched brow maymaybe something could be arranged try me in my office in the morning dr crowe he nodded very good she tore her gaze away and was saved further humiliation by ryan fleming ill escort you out he said she followed him into the hall refusing to glance back it had been a long time since she had felt so foolish so flusteredby a man it must be an aftershock of her unexpected conversation with omaha well have to take the stairs the lifts are still out she kept in step with fleming odd bunch them americans he continued as they descended the flights to the first floor always in such a hurry had to come this very night insisted that the readings they sought would deteriorate it had to be now safia shrugged as they reached the bottom and passed the short way to the employeeside exit i dont think thats so much an idiosyncrasy of americans as it is of scientists in general were a surly and determined lot he nodded with a smile ive noticed he used his passkey to unlock the door to keep the alarm from sounding he pushed the door wide with his shoulder stepping out to hold it open for her his eyes were on her oddly shy i was wondering safia if you had the timemaybe the gunshot sounded like no more than a cracking walnut the right side of ryans head exploded against the door splattering blood and brain matter bits of skull ricocheted off the metal door and into the hallway three masked gunmen crowded through the open door before ryans body hit the ground they rammed safia into the far wall pinning her choking her one hand over her mouth a gun appeared pressed against the center of her forehead wheres the heart painter studied the red needle on his scanner it jittered up into the scales orange range as he passed the detection rod over a blasted display cabinet a significant reading the device had been designed by the nuclear labs at white sands radx scanners were capable of detecting lowlevel radiation their particular devices had been specially calibrated to detect the unique decay signature of antimatter annihilation when an atom of matter and antimatter collided and obliterated the reaction liberated pure energy that was what their detectors had been calibrated to sniff out im picking up a particularly strong reading over here his partner called to him her voice was matteroffact all business painter crossed to her coral novak was new to sigma recruited from the cia only three years ago still in the short time since her hiring she had earned a phd in nuclear physics and was already a black belt in six disciplines of martial arts her iq was off the charts and she had almost an encyclopedic knowledge on a wide range of subjects he had heard of novak of course even met her once at a district meeting but they had only the short hop from washington to london to better acquaint themselves not nearly enough time for two reserved people to form any relationship beyond a stiffly professional one he couldnt help comparing her to cassandra which only exacerbated his reticence similar traits between the women tweaked his suspicion while discordantly the few differences made him wonder about his new partners competence it made no sense he knew this only time would sort it out as he stepped beside her she pointed her detection rod at the melted ruin of a bronze urn commander youd better doublecheck my findings im reading a signature all the way into the red range painter confirmed it with his own scanner definitely hot coral dropped to a knee wearing thin lead gloves she examined the urn rolling it carefully a rattle sounded inside she glanced up at him he nodded for her to investigate she reached through the mouth of the urn searched a moment then pulled free a thimblesize chunk of rock she rolled it in her gloved palm one side was blastblackened the other was red metallic not rock iron a piece of the meteor coral said she held it out for painter to scan the readings indicated the item was the source of the strong reading and look at my ancillary readings besides zbosons and gluons against the background gamma as expected with antimatter annihilation this sample is emitting very low levels of alpha and beta radiation painter frowned he had little background in physics coral shifted the sample into a lead specimen jar the same radiation pattern found from decaying uranium uranium like used in nuclear facilities she nodded nonpurified perhaps a few atoms trapped in the meteoric iron she continued to study her readings her brow creased with a single line a dramatic response in the stoic woman what is it he asked she continued to fiddle with her scanner on the flight over here i reviewed the results from darpas researchers something troubled me about their theories of a stabilized form of antimatter trapped in the meteor you dont think such a thing is possible it was certainly a stretch of plausibility antimatter always and instantly annihilated itself when in contact with any form of matter even oxygen in the air how could it exist here in some natural state she shrugged without looking up even if i accepted such a theory the question arises of why the antimatter happened to ignite at this time why did this particular electrical storm trigger it to explode pure chance or was there something more what do you think she pointed to her scanner uranium decay its like a clock it releases its energy in set predictable ways spanning millennia perhaps some critical threshold of radiation from the uranium caused the antimatter to begin to destabilize it was this instability that allowed the shock of the electrical discharge to ignite it sort of like a timer on a bomb a nuclear timer one set millennia ago it was a disturbing thought still corals brow remained creased she had another concern what else he asked she sat back on her heels and faced him for the first him if there is some other source of this antimattersome mother lodeit may be destabilizing too if we ever hope to find it wed best not drag our feet the same nuclear time clock could be ticking down painter stared at the lead sample jar and if we dont find this lode well lose all chance of discovering this new source of power or worse yet coral glanced around the burnedout shell of the gallery this could occur on a much more massive scale painter let this sobering thought sink into him in the heavy silence a scuffle of steps echoed up from the nearby stairwell he turned a voice carried to them the words muffled but he recognized dr almaazs voice a prickle of warning raced through painter why was the curator returning stronger words reached him a tone of command the speaker unknown your office take us there something was wrong he remembered the fate of the two defense sciences officers shot execution style in their hotel room he swung to coral her eyes had narrowed weapons he whispered they hadnt had time to arrange for sidearms always a difficulty in gunshy britain coral bent and tucked up the cuff of her pant leg to reveal a sheathed knife he hadnt known she had it they had flown commercial to substantiate their covers she must have stashed the weapon in her checked luggage then donned it when she used the restroom at heathrow she slid free the seveninchlong dagger titanium and steel german from the look of it she held it out to him keep it he grabbed instead a longhandled spade from a nearby pile of tools one of the salvage teams had left footsteps approached the stairwell opening he didnt know if it was merely museum security but he wasnt taking any chances painter signaled coral his plan then flicked off the nearby lamp pole plunging the entrance into gloom the pair took positions on either side of the opening to the blasted wing painter took the post closest to the stairwell behind a stack of wooden pallets he could peer between the slats yet still remain in shadow on the opposite side of the entrance coral crouched behind a trio of marble plinths painter kept a hand raised on my mark from his hiding place he kept an unblinking watch on the doorway he didnt have long to wait a dark figure slid quickly through and took a position flanking the stairwell opening he was masked an assault rifle on his shoulder certainly not museum security but how many others were there a second figure appeared similarly attired and armed they searched the hall the rattle of the fans remained the only sound between them a third masked figure stepped into view he clutched safia almaaz by the elbow a pistol shoved into her ribs tears ran down safias pale face she trembled with each step as she was dragged forward she struggled to breathe gasping itsits in my office safe she pointed her free arm down the hall her captor nodded for his companions to continue painter slid back slowly made eye contact with his partner and signaled their marks she nodded shifting position with smooth ease out in the hall the curators eyes searched the entrance to the kensington gallery of course she must know the americans were still here would she inadvertently do or say something to give them away her feet slowed and her voice rose sharply pleasedont shoot me her captor shoved her forward then do as we say he snarled she tripped and stumbled but kept her feet her eyes again searched the gallerys entrance as the pair drew nearer painter realized her terrified outburst had been an attempt to pass on a warning to the american scientists to send them into hiding his respect for the curator grew the pair of masked riflemen on point glided forward passing painters hiding spot their weapons swept over the blasted gallery discovering nothing they continued down the hall a couple of yards behind the guards the third man dragged safia almaaz she searched the gallery glancingly painter noted the flash of relief as she found the nearest rooms deserted as the pair passed his position painter signaled his partner go coral sprang past the cluster of plinthsshoulderrolled into the halland landed in a crouch between the guards and safias captor her sudden appearance startled the man holding safia his weapon shifted from his captives ribs that was all painter required he hadnt wanted the curator shot by reflex that sometimes happened following a head blow painter slipped from the shadows and swung the spade with deft skill the gunmans head cracked to the side bone giving way his form crumpled dragging safia to the floor with him stay down painter barked stepping past to corals aid it wasnt necessary his partner was already in motion pivoting on her free arm coral kicked out with her legs and struck the closest guard in the knees his legs went out from under him at the same time her other hand threw the dagger with stunning accuracy striking the second guard at the base of the skull severing the brain stem he fell forward with a strangled gasp coral continued her spin with fluid grace a gymnast performing a deadly floor routine her boot heels slammed into the first mans face as he attempted to pick himself up his head flew back then rebounded forward striking the marble floor she rolled over to him ready to deliver more damage but he was out unconscious still coral kept a wary stance the other gunman lay sprawled facedown the only movement from him was the spreading pool of blood on the marble dead closer safia struggled from beneath the arms of her dead captor painter went to her aid dropping to one knee are you hurt she sat up scooting free from the limp body from painter too nnoi dont think so her gaze flickered around the carnage settling nowhere a keening note entered her voice oh god ryan he was shotby the door downstairs painter glanced back to the stairwell are there any more gunmen she shook her head eyes wide ii dont know painter moved closer dr almaaz he said sternly drawing her scattered attention she was close to shock listen was there anyone else she took several deep breaths her face shone with fear with a final shudder she spoke more firmly not downstairs but ryan ill go check on him painter turned to coral stay with dr almaaz ill recon downstairs and see about rousing security he bent down and recovered the gunmans abandoned pistol a walther p not a weapon he wouldve chosen he preferred his glock but right now its weight felt perfect in his hand coral stepped closer freeing a coil of rope from a debris pile to secure their remaining prisoner what about our cover she whispered to him casting a glance toward the curator were both just very resourceful scientists he answered so in other words were sticking to the truth the barest glint of amusement showed in her eyes as she turned away painter headed to the stairs he could get used to a partner like her safia watched the man vanish down the stairs he moved so silently as if gliding on ice who was he a grunt drew her attention back to the woman she had a knee planted in the lower back of the last attacker she had wrenched his arms back earning a protest from the groggy gunman she swiftly bound his limbs with rope moving with deft skill either she had a background that included calfroping or there was more to this woman than mere physics beyond this one observation safias curiosity could not be further piqued she concentrated on her own breathing there still seemed to be a deficient amount of oxygen in the air even with the blowing fans sweat slicked her face and body she kept her position by the wall knees raised tight arms hugging her chest she had to restrain herself from rocking she did not want to appear that crazy the thought helped calm her she also kept her eyes away from the two bodies the alarm would be raised security would come with batons lights and the comforting presence of others in the meantime the hallway remained too empty too dark too humid she found her gaze lingering on the stairwell opening ryan the attack again played out in her head reeling like bloody film stock only silent they have been after the iron heart her own discovery the one she had been so proud to uncover ryan had died because of it because of her not again a sob shook through her she tried to hold it back with her hands and found herself choking are you all right the woman asked from a step away safia curled into herself shaking youre safe dr crowe will get security up here any moment she kept herself balled up seeking a place of safety maybe id better get some the physicists voice cut off with a choke safia lifted her face the woman stood a step away stiffly straight arms out at her sides head thrown back she seemed to be trembling from crown to toe seizure the choking sound continued safia crabbed away unsure on her hands and knees heading toward the stairwell what was happening the womans form suddenly slumped and she toppled forward to the floor in the gloom of the hallway a small blue flame crackled at the base of her spine smoke rose from her clothing she lay unmoving it made no sense but as the blue flame died safia spotted a thin wire it trailed from the prone woman to a figure standing three meters down the hall another masked gunman he held a strange pistol in his fist safia had seen such a device beforein movies not in real life a tazer a silent means of dispatch safia continued scrambling backward her heels slipping on the slick marble she remembered her initial fright when leaving her office she had thought she had heard someone saw a flicker of light in the byzantine gallery it hadnt been her anxious imagination the figure dropped the discharged tazer and strode after her safia gained her feet with a speed borne of adrenaline and panic the stairwell lay ahead if she could reach it get down to the security area something struck the marble floor to the right of her toes it hissed and spat blue sparks a second tazer safia bolted away from it and charged toward the opening it would take a few moments to reset the tazerunless the gunman had a third weapon as she reached the stairwell she expected to be struck by lightning from behind or simply shot neither happened she fell into the stairwell voices greeted her from below yelling a gunshot sounded deafening in the small space more gunmen were downstairs moving on pure instinct safia fled upward there was no thought besides escape to keep running she pounded up two steps at a time there was no third level to this section of the museum these stairs led to the roof she rounded the first flight grabbing the handrail to sweep herself around a door appeared at the top of the next flight an emergency exit locked from the outside it would automatically open from the inside an alarm would sound but that was a good thing at the moment she prayed it wasnt secured after regular public hours footsteps sounded behind her at the stairwell entrance she lunged at the door arms out shoving the emergency latch it stuck locked she slammed into the steel door with a sob no painter held up his hands the walther p on the floor at his feet he had come close to being shot in the head the bullet had whizzed past his cheek near enough for him to feel the burn of its passage only a quick dodge and roll had saved him but then again he could imagine how it looked him kneeling beside ryan flemings body at the exit door gun in hand a trio of security men had come upon the scene and all chaos had broken out it had taken him a moment of frantic negotiating to reach this standoffdropping his gun hands in the air dr almaaz was attacked he called over to the guard with the gun another checked the body while the third was on a radio mr fleming was shot when she was kidnapped my partner and i were able to subdue the attackers upstairs there was no note of reaction from the armed guard he could just as well have been deaf he simply pointed his pistol sweat beaded the mans forehead the guard by the radio turned and spoke to his mates were to secure him in the nest until the police arrive theyre on their way painter glanced to the stairwell concern jangled through him the shot must have been heard upstairs had it sent coral and the curator into hiding oi you the guard with the pistol said hands on your head move along this way the guard waved the gun down the hall away from the stairwell it was the only firearm among the three and its bearer seemed poorly acquainted with the weapon he held it too loosely too low probably the only gun here one rarely pulled out of mothball storage but the recent explosion had made everyone jumpy overly alert painter laced his fingers atop his head and turned where indicated he had to reestablish control here with his hands in plain view he swung around stepping closer to the inexperienced guard as he turned he shifted his weight on his right leg the guards eyes flicked away for a half second plenty of time painter snapkicked out with his left foot striking the guards wrist the gun went skittering down the hall sweeping down painter snatched the abandoned walther from the floor and leveled it at the stunned trio now were doing things my way desperate safia shoved the emergency latch to the roof door again it refused to budge she pounded a fist weakly against the jamb then she spotted a security keypad in the wall beside it an old one not an electronic card scanner it needed a code panic whined like a mosquito in her ear each employee was assigned a default code they could change it at their leisure the default code was each employees birth date she had never bothered to change hers a scuff of heel drew her attention around her pursuer came around the lower flight standing on the landing the two eyed each other the gunman now had a pistol in his grip not a tazer with her back to the door safia fingered the keypads buttons and punched in her birth date blindly after years at the museum she was accustomed to touchtyping entries into an accounting calculator once done she pushed the emergency latch it clicked but failed to budge still locked dead end the gunman said his voice muffled come down or die pinned against the door safia realized her mistake the security grid had been upgraded after the millennium a year was no longer defined by two digits but four unclenching her fingers she rapidly typed in the eight numbers two for day two for month and four for her birth year the gunman took a step toward her pistol stretching closer safia rammed her back into the emergency latch the door flung open cold air whipped over her as she tumbled out and darted to the side a shot ricocheted off the steel door driven by desperation she swung the door shut slamming it into the masked face of the gunman as he lunged she didnt wait unsure if the door would relock and fled around the corner of the rooftop exit hut the night was too bright where was londons fog when you needed it she searched for a place to hide small metal outcroppings offered some shelter hooded vents exhaust flumes electrical conduits but they were isolated and offered scant protection the remainder of the roof of the british museum looked like the parapet of a castle surrounding a glassroofed central courtyard a muffled shot blasted behind her a door slammed open with a crash her pursuer had broken through safia sprinted for the closest cover a low wall lipped the central courtyard outlining the edges of the grand courts glassandsteel roof she climbed over the parapet and ducked down her feet rested on the metal rim of the twoacre geodesic roof it spread out from her position in a vast plain of glass broken into individual triangular panes a few were missing knocked loose by the blast last night and patched with plastic sheeting the remaining panes shone like mirrors in the starlight all pointing toward the middle to where the bright copper dome of the central reading room rose from the middle of the courtyard like an island in a sea of safety glass safia remained crouched realizing how exposed she was if the gunman searched over the wall there was nowhere to run footsteps sounded crunching on the graveled roof they circled around for a few moments stopped for a long breath then continued eventually they would head here safia had no choice she crawled out onto the roof scuttling like a crab across the panes of glass praying they would hold her weight the fortyfoot fall to the hard marble below would prove just as deadly as a slug in the head if she could only make it to the domed island of the reading room get behind it one of the panes splintered under her knee like brittle ice it must have been stressed by the blast she rolled to the side as it gave way beneath her cracking and falling through its steel frame a moment later a loud ringing crash echoed up as the pane struck marble safia crouched only halfway across the vast roof a fly stuck on a mirrored web and the spider was surely coming drawn by the crash she needed to hide a hole to crawl into safia glanced to the right there was only one hole she rolled back to the empty steel frame and without much more thought than hide she swung her legs down through the frame then wiggled on her belly as her fingers grabbed the steel edge she let herself drop hanging now by her hands over the fortyfoot fall she swung in place facing back toward her initial hiding place by the wall through the glass the starlit night was clear and bright she watched a masked head peer over the low wall searching the geodesic roof safia held her breath viewed from outside the roof was mirrored by the silvery starlight she should be invisible but already her arm muscles cramped and the sharp steel cut into her fingers and she would still need some strength to pull herself back up she searched down to the dark courtyard a mistake she was so high the only light came from a handful of redglowing security lamps near the wall still she spotted the shattered pane of glass under her feet the same would happen to her bones if she fell her fingers gripped tighter her heart pounded harder she tore her gaze from the drop glancing back up in time to see the gunman climbing over the wall what was he doing once over the wall he started across the roof keeping his weight mostly on the steelframed structure he was coming straight at her how did he know then it dawned on her she had noted the plasticsheeted gaps in the roof they were like missing teeth in a bright smile there was only one such gap that was still uncapped the gunman must have guessed that his target had fallen through and come to make certain he moved swiftly so unlike her own panicked crawl he swept down on her hiding spot pistol in hand what could she do there was nowhere else to run she considered simply letting go at least shed have control over her death tears rose in her eyes her fingers ached all she had to do was let go but her fingers refused to unlatch panic held her clenched she hung there as the man crossed the final pane finally spotting her he started back a step then stared down at her laughter flowed low and dark in that moment safia realized her mistake a gun pointed at safias forehead tell me the combination the crack of a pistol erupted glass shattered safia screamed losing the grip on one hand hanging by the other her shoulder and fingers wrenched only then did she spot the shooter on the floor below a familiar figure the american he stood with his feet planted wide on the marble aiming up at her she turned her face upward the pane of glass her attacker had been standing on had crackled into a thousand pieces held together only by the safety coating the thief stumbled backward fumbling and losing the pistol it flew high then landed hard upon the shattered pane the weapon fell through the broken glass and tumbled all the way to the floor below the thief sprinted across the roof fleeing aiming back toward the wall below the american fired and fired blasting out panes of glass following from below but the thief was always a step ahead finally reaching the wall the figure vanished over it gone the american swore loudly he hurried back to where safia hung by one arm like a bat in the rafters but she had no wings safia struggled to get her other hand up on the support she had to swing slightly but finally her fingers gripped steel can you hold on he asked below her concerned i dont seem to have much choice she called down hotly now do i if you swing your legs he offered you might be able to hook them over the next frame she saw what he meant he had shot out the neighboring pane leaving an open support bar between them she took a deep breaththen with a small cry of effort she swung her legs tucked her knees and hooked them over the bar immediately the ache in her hands lessened as the weight eased she had to force herself not to cry with relief securitys already heading up there safia craned down to the american she found herself speaking to keep herself from wailing your partneris she fine took a jolt ruined a nice blouse but shell be up and around she closed her eyes with relief thank god she couldnt have handled another death not after ryan she took several more breaths are you all right the american asked staring up at her yes but dr crowe call me painteri think weve passed formalities here it seems i owe you my life for the second time this night thats what you get for hanging around with me though she couldnt see it she could imagine his wry smile thats not very funny it will be later he crossed and recovered the thiefs gun from the floor that reminded safia the one you were shooting at it was a woman he continued his study of the weapon i know painter inspected the weapon in his hand it was a sig sauer mm with a hogue rubberized grip it couldnt be he held his breath as he turned the weapon on its side the thumb catch for the magazine release was on the right side a custom feature for that rare lefthanded shooter he knew this gun he knew the shooter he stared up at the path of shattered glass cassandra part two sand and sea homecoming december am heathrow international airport kara methim at the foot of the steps leading up to the open door of the learjet she stood blocking the way and pointing a stiff finger at the focus of her anger her voice sharpened i want it stated clearly dr crowe that you have no authority once you board this jet you may have wrangled your way into this expedition but it certainly wasnt by my invitation i got that from the warm reception your pack of corporate lawyers gave me the american answered hitching his duffel higher on his shoulder who wouldve guessed so many suits could put up such a determined fight little good it did youre still here he offered a crooked smile as response then shrugged as before he offered no explanation as to why the us government wanted him and his partner to accompany the expedition into oman but insurmountable blocks had appeared financial legal even diplomatic all this was further complicated by the media circus surrounding the attempted theft kara had always considered her influence to be significantbut it paled beside the pressure placed upon the expedition by washington the united states had significant interests in oman shed spent three weeks trying to find a way around their roadblocks but the trip was hung up unless she cooperated still that didnt mean she hadnt won concessions from here on out she said firmly you will be under our leadership understood the single word irritated kara further with no choice she stepped aside he stood his ground on the tarmac it doesnt have to be this way we arent at crosspurposes here lady kensington we both seek the same thing she pinched her brows and what might that be answersanswers to mysteries he stared at her with those piercing blue eyes unreadable yet not cold for the first time she noted how handsome he was not model handsome more a weary masculinity that he carried easily he wore his hair lanky a fiveoclock shadow at six in the morning she could smell his aftershave musky with a trace of balsam or was that just him kara kept her face fixed her voice flatlined and what mystery are you seeking to answer dr crowe he did not blink i might ask the same of you lady kensington what mystery do you seek its surely something more than academic interest in old tombs karas frown deepened eyes flashing presidents of multinational corporations withered under such inspection painter crowe remained unfazed he finally stepped forward and mounted the lears stairsbut not before adding one last cryptic comment it seems we both have secrets we wish to keepat least for now she watched him climb painter crowe was followed by his companion dr coral novak she was tall firmly toned wearing a snug gray suit she carried a matching duffel of personal items the scientists trunks and equipment had already been loaded the womans eyes searched down the length of the jet studious karas frown tracked them as they disappeared inside though they claimed to be merely physicists contracted by the us government she recognized the stamp of the military all over them the wiry athleticism the hard eyes the sharp creases in their suits they moved together in unison casually one on point the other watching their backs they probably werent even aware of it and then there was the battle in the museum to consider kara had heard the detailed report the murder of ryan fleming the attempted theft of the iron heart if not for this pairs intervention all would have been lost despite dr crowes clear dissembling kara owed himand for more than just the security of the artifact she stared across the tarmac as the terminal door swung open safia hurried toward the lear dragging a piece of luggage behind her if the two americans hadnt been present in the museum safia surely would not have survived still her friend had not passed the night unscathed the terror the bloodshed the death had broken something in safia her protests against joining the expedition had ended safia seemed reticent to talk about her change of mind her only explanation was a terse response it no longer matters safia crossed to the jet am i the last one here everyones aboard kara reached toward her luggage safia snapped down the totes handle and lifted it herself i have it kara didnt argue she knew what the luggage contained the iron heart nestled in a molded rubberized cocoon safia refused to let anyone near itnot to protect it but as if it was a burden she must bear its blood debt was hers alone her discovery her responsibility guilt shadowed her friend like a mourning shroud ryan fleming had been her friend murdered before her eyes all for a chunk of iron something safia had unearthed kara sighed as she followed safia up the stairs it was tel aviv all over again no one could console safia thenand now was no different kara stopped at the top of the stairs and glanced one last time over toward the misty heights of london in the distance as the sun crested the thames she searched her heart for some sense of loss but all she found was sand this was not her true home it never had been she turned her back on london and climbed inside the jet a man in uniform leaned out the cockpit door maam we have clearance from the tower ready when you are she nodded very good benjamin she stepped into the main cabin as the door was secured behind her the lear had been customized to suit her needs the cabins interior was furnished in leather and burled walnut describing four intimate seating groups fresh flowers sprouted from waterford crystal vases secured to seatside tables a long mahogany bar an antique out of liverpool stood stocked near the rear of the cabin beyond the bar a set of folding doors marked the entry to karas private study and bedroom she allowed herself a selfsatisfied smile upon seeing painter crowes cocked eyebrow as he surveyed the space clearly he was not accustomed to such luxuries on a physicists salary even one supplemented by government work the planes butler handed him a drink soda water and ice it appeared his glass clinked as he turned whatno honeyroasted peanuts he mumbled as he passed i thought we were traveling first class her smile grew stale as he crossed and took a seat beside dr novak flippant bastard everyone else began to find their seats as the pilot announced their departure safia settled off by herself her graduate student clay bishop was already buckled across the cabin face pressed to a window he wore earphones attached to an ipod resting on his lap lost to everyone else with all in readiness kara crossed to the bar her usual was waiting for her a chilled glass of chardonnay it came from st sebastian a french winery kara had been allowed her first sip on her sixteenth birthday on the morning of the hunt since then she lifted one glass each morning in honor of her father she swirled the wineglass and inhaled its crisp bouquet a hint of peach and oak even after so many years the smell drew her immediately back to that morning so full of promise she could hear her fathers laughter the baying of camels in the distance the whisper of wind with the dawning sun so close nowafter so very long she sipped slowly drowning the nagging dryness in her mouth her head buzzed with the sharpness of the two pills she had taken upon waking two hours earlier through her lips she felt the minor tremor in her fingertips as they held up the glass one wasnt supposed to mix alcohol with prescription drugs but it was only the one glass of chardonnay and she owed it to her father she lowered the glass and found safia studying her her face was unreadable but her eyes glowed with concern kara met her gaze unflinching holding it steady safia finally broke away to stare out the window neither had the words to comfort the other not any longer the desert had stolen a part of their lives a part of their hearts and only out in the sands could it be recovered am muscat oman omaha slammedthrough the door to the ministry of national heritage the door swinging back almost struck his brother danny in the face as he followed omaha calm down damn bureaucrats he continued his tirade out in the street you need a friggin permit to wipe your ass here you got what you wanted danny said in a conciliatory tone it took all goddamn morning and the only reason we finally got the permit to carry gasoline aboard the roversto carry friggin gasolinewas because adolf bin asshole wanted his damn lunch calm down danny grabbed his elbow and dragged him to the curb faces turned in their direction and safiakaras plane is landing inomaha checked his watch in just over an hour danny waved for a cab a white mercedes sedan pulled away from a nearby taxi stand and slid up to the curb danny opened the door and shoved omaha inside it was gloriously airconditioned noon in muscat and it was already over a hundred degrees the cool interior washed the edge from his irritation he leaned and tapped at the plexiglas between the backseat and the front seeb airport the driver nodded and cut into traffic without signaling simply barging his way into the lunchtime flow omaha fell back into his seat beside his brother ive never seen you this nervous danny said what are you talking about nervous im pissed danny stared out the window rightlike meeting your exfiancйe facetoface hasnt trimmed your fuse a tad short this morning safia has nothing to do with this uhhuh i have no reason to be nervous keep tellin yourself that omaha shut up you shut up omaha shook his head both of them had had too little sleep since arriving two weeks ago there were a thousand and one details to attend to when putting together an expedition in such a short time permits paperwork hiring guards manual labor and trucks clearing access from thumrait air base buying potable water petrol guns salt dry chemical toilets organizing personnel and all of it fell squarely upon the dunn brothers shoulders the trouble back in london had delayed karas arrival if kara had been here as planned preparations for the expedition wouldve gone much more smoothly lady kensington was revered in oman the mother teresa of philanthropy throughout the country museums hospitals schools and orphanages all bore plaques with her name on them her corporation helped win many lucrative contractsoil mineral and fresh waterfor the country and its people but after the museum incident kara had asked the brothers to maintain a low profile keep her involvement on a needtoknow basis only so omaha chewed a lot of aspirin the taxi crossed out of the business district of muscat and wended through the narrow streets that bordered the stone walls of the old city they followed a truck loaded with pines weeping a path of dry needles behind it christmas trees in oman such was the countrys openness to the west a muslim country that celebrated christs birth omans attitude could be attributed to the monarchys head of the state sultan qaboos bin said educated in england the sultan had opened his country to the wider world brought extensive civil rights to his people and modernized his countrys infrastructure the taxi driver turned on the radio strains of bach floated through the bose speakers the sultans favorite by royal decree only classical music could be played at noon omaha checked his watch high noon he stared out the window it must be good to be king danny spoke up i think were being followed omaha glanced at his brother to see if he was joking danny was craning over a shoulder the gray bmw four cars back are you sure its a bmw danny said more firmly his brothera yuppie wannabe fascinated by all things germanengineeredknew cars i spotted the same car parked down the street from our hotel then again at the entrance to the parking lot for the natural history museum omaha squinted could be coincidencesame make different car fivefortyi custom chrome wheels tinted privacy glass even omaha cut him off enough of the sales pitch i believe you but if they were truly being followed only one question stood out why he flashed back to the bloodshed and violence at the british museum even the newspapers here reported on it kara had warned him to be as cautious as possible to maintain a low profile he leaned forward take the next right he said in arabic hoping either to lose or confirm their tail the driver ignored him and continued straight omaha felt a sudden twinge of panic he tried the door locked they passed the turnoff for the airport bach continued to stream from the speakers he yanked at the door handle again crap pm airborne over the mediterranean safia staredat the book in her lap blind to the words she had not turned a page in the last half hour tension stripped her nerves raw her shoulder muscles knotted and a dull headache made her teeth hurt she glanced out at the sunlit blue skies cloudless a vast blank canvas it was as if she were leaving one life and sweeping toward another which in many ways she was she was abandoning london her flat the stone walls of the british museum all that she once thought safe these past ten years but that safety had proved to be an illusion so fragile it shattered in a single night blood once again stained her hands because of her work ryan safia could not erase the momentary glint of surprise in his eyes as the bullet sliced him from this world even weeks later she felt the need to wash her face repeatedly sometimes even in the middle of the night brown soap and cold water nothing washed away the memory of the blood and even though safia recognized the illusory nature of londons security the city had become her home she had friends colleagues a favorite bookstore a theater that played old movies a coffeehouse that served the perfect caramel cappuccino her life had become defined by the streets and trains of london and then there was billie safia had been forced to foster her cat with julia a pakistani botanist who rented the flat under hers before leaving safia had whispered promises in the tomcats ears promises she hoped to keep still safia worried deeply down to the marrow of her bones some of the anxiety was inexplicable just an overwhelming sense of doom but most was not she stared around the cabin what if they all ended up like ryan laid out in the city morgue then buried in a cold cemetery as the first winter snow fell she simply could not handle that even the possibility turned her intestines to ice her breathing grew pained at the thought her hands trembled safia fought the wave of panic sensing its familiar roll she concentrated on her breathing focusing outward away from her own frightened center across the breadth of the cabin the drone of the engines had driven everyone else to recline their seat backs to catch what little sleep they could as they winged south even kara had retreated to her private quartersbut not to nap muffled whispers reached to her through the door kara was preparing for their arrival handling the niggling details did she ever even sleep anymore a noise drew safias attention back around painter crowe stood beside her chair appearing as if by magic he bore a tall tumbler of ice water in one hand and held out a tiny crystal snifter brimming with auburn liquid bourbon from the smell of it drink this i dont just drink it dont sip down it all her hand rose and she accepted the glass more afraid it was going to spill than from any desire to accept his offering they hadnt spoken since that bloody night except for a brief thankyou after her rescue he lowered into the seat next to her and motioned to the drink go on rather than arguing she lifted the glass and poured the contents down her throat it burned all the way down filling her nostrils then settled with a fiery glow in her belly she passed the glass back to him he traded it for the glass of water soda water and lemon sip it she did holding the cup with both hands better she nodded im fine he stared at her half leaning on one shoulder to face her she kept her gaze averted focusing on the length of his outstretched legs he crossed his ankles exposing his socks black argyles its not your fault he said she stiffened was her guilt so plain she felt a flush of embarrassment its not he repeated his tone of voice lacked the reassurance of the others who had sought to comfort her with platitudes colleagues friends even the police psychologist instead painters voice was simply matteroffact ryan fleming he was at the wrong place wrong time nothing more her eyes flicked to him then away again she felt the heat of him like the bourbon whiskeywarm and masculine she found the strength to speak to argue ryan wouldnt have been thereifif i hadnt been working so late bullshit the profanity from him startled her painter continued mr fleming was at the museum to supervise us coral and me his presence that night had nothing to do with you or your discovery of the artifact do you blame us a small part of her did still safia shook her head knowing who was ultimately to blame the thieves were after the heart my discovery and im sure it wasnt the first attempted theft from the museum i seem to recall a midnight burglary of an etruscan bust just four months ago the thieves cut through the roof safia kept her head bowed ryan was head of security doing his job he knew the risks though she was not entirely convinced the tight knot in safias gut loosened a bit then again maybe it was just the alcohol his hand touched hers she flinched but the american did not retreat he cupped her hand between his palms his touch warm after the cold glass of soda water lady kensington may not welcome our presence on this expedition but i just wanted you to know that you arent alone were in this together safia slowly nodded then slid her hand from between his uncomfortable by the intimacy by the attentions of a man she hardly knew still she slipped her hand into her other preserving the warmth he leaned back perhaps sensing her discomfort his eyes glinted with easy amusement you just hang in therei know from experience youre darned good at that safia pictured herself dangling from the museums rooftop how she must have looked and unbidden a smile traced the edges of her lips the first since the horrible night painter studied her his expression seeming to say there you go he stood up i should try to get some sleepso should you thinking such a thing might be possible now she watched him stride silently across the carpeted cabin returning to his seat she lifted a finger and touched her cheek as her smile faded away the warmth of the bourbon still glowed deep within her helping her find her center how could something so simple have brought her so much relief but safia sensed it wasnt truly the alcohol so much as the kindness she had forgotten what that was like it had been too long not sincenot since pm omaha hunchedlow in his seat and kicked again at the divider that separated him from the taxi driver his heels struck with no effect it was like kicking steel bulletproof glass he slammed an elbow against the side window in frustration trapped kidnapped theyre still following us danny said nodding behind them to the trailing bwm sedan fifty yards back shadowy figures could be seen filling the front and rear seats the taxi rode through a residential area of stuccoandstone homes all painted in various shades of white the suns reflection was blinding the other car kept pace behind them omaha faced forward again leyh he spat out in arabic why the driver continued to ignore them stoic and silent wending his way through the narrow streets with deft skill we need to get out of here omaha said take our chances in the streets danny had turned his attention to his door staring at the side panel ton coupongles omaha his brother was speaking frenchclearly attempting to keep the driver from eavesdropping danny held out his hand low away from the direct view of the driver omaha fished in a pocket what did danny think to accomplish with his coupeongles fingernail clippers he asked in french you planning on clipping your way out of here danny did not look back only cocked his head forward that bastard up there has us locked in by using the child protection feature of the car meant to keep kids from opening the back door so so were going to use the same safety features to get us out omaha pulled out the fingernail clipper from his pocket it hung from his keys he passed it to danny who palmed it what are you danny shushed him flipped open the clippers and extracted the tiny nail file magazines reported on the sensitivity of the mercedess safety systems had to be careful even when removing the access panel access panel before he could ask aloud danny turned to him how soon do you want to make a break for it right now would be good omaha thought but then up ahead a large openair souk or market appeared he motioned low up there would be perfect we could get lost in the shops shake loose the others following in the bmw danny nodded be ready he leaned back straightening the nail file poised under three imprinted letters on the sill of the passenger windowsrs safety restraint system air bags omaha asked forgetting to speak in french this time side air bags danny concurred when any of the bags deploy as a safety feature all the locks disengage to allow outside emergency rescuers access to the vehicle so youre going to were almost at the souk danny hissed the driver slowed the mercedes as it passed the entrance to the market cautious of the bustle of midday shoppers now omaha murmured danny jabbed the nail file under the srs panel and savagely dug around like a dentist struggling with a stubborn molar nothing happened the sedan slid past the souk picking up speed danny leaned in closer swearing under his breath a mistake with a pop of a firecracker the side air bag ejected smacking danny in the face and knocking his head back with its sucker punch an alarm sounded in the car the driver braked danny blinked holding his nose blood dripped from under his fingers omaha did not have time to check further he reached past his brother and yanked the door handle it fell open the lock releasing thank god for fine german engineering omaha shoved out he yelled dazed danny half rolled and half fell out of the backseat omaha pushing from behind they landed on the pavement and tumbled a few feet the slowing car slipped on ahead then slammed to a stop omaha scrambled to his feet hauling danny up with one arm his strength fueled by fear they were only steps from the markets entrance but the bmw sped forwardthen fishtailed as it braked at the market omaha sprinted danny in tow three doors popped open dark figures masks pulled over their heads jammed out pistols appeared in flashes of polished platinum one rifle swung through the air omaha reached the edge of the souk and bounced aside a woman bearing a basket full of bread and fruit loaves and dates flew high sorry he mumbled and danced into the market danny kept to his heels his face bloody from the nose down broken they fled down the center aisle the souk spread out in a labyrinthine maze reed roofs sheltered carts and booths laden with bolts of silk and kashmiri cotton bushels of pomegranates and pistachio nuts iced bins of crab and whitefish barrels of pickles and coffee beans swaths of freshcut flowers flats of breads slabs of dried meats the air steamed from grease stoves sizzling with spices that burned the eyes alleyways reeked of goat and sweat others were redolent with a cloying sweetness incense and honey and crowded within this maze pressed throngs of folk from throughout arabia and beyond faces of every shade flashed past eyes wide some behind veils most not voices chased them in dialects of arabic hindu and english omaha fled with danny through the rainbow and the noise darting right and left serpentine then straight were the pursuers behind them in front he had no way of knowing all he could do was keep moving in the distance the ahwoo ahwoo of the omani police force crested over the cacophony of the crowd help was comingbut could they last long enough to take advantage omaha glanced behind him as they danced down a long straight narrow bazaar at the other end a masked gunman appeared head radardishing around he was easy to spot as folk fled in all directions opening space around him he seemed to hear the police time was running out for him too omaha was not going to make it easy he dragged danny flowing with the rush of the crowd they rounded a corner and ducked into a booth selling reed baskets and clay pots the robed proprietor took one look at dannys bloody face and waved them out barking in arabic it would take some skill in communication to gain sanctuary here omaha yanked out his wallet and laid out a row of fiftyrial bills ten in all the salesman glanced down the line one eye squinted to barter or not to barter omaha reached to gather the bills back up but a hand stopped him khalas the old man declared waving them down deal done omaha crouched behind a stack of baskets danny took a position in the shadow of a large red earthenware pot it was large enough for his brother to hide inside of danny pinched his nose trying to stop the bleeding omaha peered out into the alleyway the patter of sandals and swish of robes ebbed after a few breaths a man stepped to the corner his masked face hurriedly searching all four points of the compass the police sirens closed toward the souk the gunmans head cocked tracking them he would have to abandon the search or risk being caught omaha felt a surge of confidence until his brother sneezed pm final approach thelearcircled over the water preparing for its descent into seeb international airport safia stared out the small window the city of muscat spread out below her it was really three cities separated by hills into distinct districts the oldest section called cleverly enough old town appeared as the jet banked to the right stone walls and ancient buildings lay nestled up against a sweeping crescent bay of blue water its white sand shoreline dotted by date palms surrounded by the old gated city walls the town housed the alam palace and the dramatic towering stone forts of mirani and jalai memories overlay all she saw as tenuous as the reflections in the smooth waters of the bay events long forgotten came alive running the narrows with kara her first kiss in the shadow of the city walls the taste of cardamon candy visiting the sultans palace all atremble and in a new thob dress safia felt a chill that had nothing to do with the cabins airconditioning home and homeland blurred in her mind tragedy and joy then as the plane angled toward the airport old town vanished replaced by the matrah section of muscatand the citys port one side of the docks moored modern hulking ships the other the slender singlemasted dhows the ancient sailing ships of arabia safia stared at the proud line of wooden masts and folded sails in stark contrast to the behemoths of steel and diesel more than anything else this typified her homeland the ancient and the modern mixed together but forever separate the third section of muscat was the least interesting inland from the old town and port stacked against the hills rose ruwi the modern business center the commercial headquarters of oman karas corporate offices were there the planes course had mapped out safia and karas life from old town to ruwi from riotous children playing in the streets to lives confined by corporate offices and dusty museums now the present the jet dropped toward the airport aiming for the stretch of tarmac safia leaned back into her seat the other passengers gaped out the windows clay bishop sat across the cabin the grad student bobbed his head in sync with the current digitalized tract on his ipod his black glasses kept slipping down his nose requiring him to push them back up repeatedly he wore his typical uniform jeans and a tshirt ahead of clay painter and coral leaned together staring out a single window they spoke in hushed tones she pointed and he nodded fiddling with a tiny cowlick atop his head that had formed while he napped kara folded back the door to her private suite and stood in the threshold were landing safia said you should sit down fingers flicked away her concern but kara crossed to the empty seat beside her and dropped heavily into it she didnt buckle her seat belt i cant ring up omaha she said as introduction what hes not answering his mobile probably doing it on purpose that wasnt like omaha safia thought he could be dodgy sometimes but he was all business when it came to the job hes surely just busy you left him hanging out to dry you know how touchy and territorial the cultural attachйs can be in muscat kara huffed out her irritation hed better be waiting at the airport safia noted how large her pupils were in the bright light she looked both exhausted and wired at the same time if he said hed be there he will be kara cocked a questioning eyebrow at her mr reliable safia felt a pang her gut wrung in two different directions reflex made her want to defend him as she had done in the past but memory of the ring she had placed back in his palm constricted her throat he had not understood the depth of her pain then again who could she had to force her eyes not to glance at painter youd better buckle up she warned kara pm dannys sneezewas as loud as a gunshot startling a pair of caged doves in a neighboring shop wings fluttered against bamboo bars omaha watched the masked gunman turn toward their booth stepping toward them a yard away danny covered his nose and mouth and sank lower behind the tall earthenware urn blood ran freely down his chin omaha pushed to the balls of his feet tensing ready to leap their only hope lay in surprise the police sirens wailed piercing now from their proximity to the market if only danny could have held back for another minute the gunman held his rifle shouldered pointed forward moving in a crouched stance experienced omaha clenched his fists hed have to knock the rifle up then dive low before he could move the robed proprietor of the shop shambled forward into plain view he waved a fan in one hand and wiped his nose with the other hasaseeya he mumbled as he straightened some baskets over omahas head cursing his hay fever he feigned surprise at seeing the gunman threw up his hands fan flying and fell back the gunman gave a muffled curse waving the old man back with his rifle he obeyed retreating to a low counter covering his head with his hands off in the direction of the souks entrance the squeal of brakes announced the arrival of the omani police sirens whined the gunman glanced in their direction then did the only thing he could he stepped to the large urn sheltering danny and shoved his rifle inside and after a check around he ripped off the mask and tossed it in too then with a swirl of a sandcolored cloak the figure disappeared into the depths of the market clearly planning on simply joining the mass of humanity anonymous except omaha had stared hard he saw her face mocha skin deep brown eyes a tattoo of a tear under the left eye bedouin after a safe stretch omaha stepped out of hiding danny crawled to join him omaha helped his brother up the proprietor appeared straightening his robe with pats of his hands shuk ran danny mumbled around his bloodied nose thanking the man with the typical selfeffacing custom of the omani people the man shrugged omaha stripped off another fiftyrial bill and held it out the shopkeeper crossed his arms palms facedown khalas the deal had already been struck it would be an insult to renegotiate instead the old man crossed to the stack of baskets and picked one up for you he said gift for pretty woman bi kam omaha asked how much the man smiled for you fifty rial omaha returned his smile knowing he was being swindled but he handed over the bill khalas as they left the market and headed toward the entrance danny asked nasally why the hell were those guys trying to kidnap us omaha shrugged he had no idea apparently danny hadnt gotten a look at their assailant like he had not guys gals now that he thought back on itthe way the others had movedthey might all have been women omaha pictured the riflewomans face again skin aglow in the sunshine the resemblance was unmistakable she couldve been safias sister old town december pm seeb international airport painter keptpace behind the trundling cart of gear and equipment the heat off the tarmac seemed to boil the oxygen right out of the air leaving only a heavy dampness to sear the lungs painter fanned a hand in front of his face not to cool himself an impossibility here but simply to stir the air enough to catch his breath at least they were finally moving again they had been delayed three hours confined to the jet due as a result of the heightened security measures after the attempted abduction of one of kara kensingtons associates apparently the matter had been resolved enough to allow them to disembark coral marched beside him eyes scanning everywhere wary the only sign that the lateafternoon heat had any effect on his partner were the tiny beads of sweat on her smooth brow she had covered her whiteblond hair with a fold of beige cloth supplied by safia an omani headdress called a lihaf painter squinted ahead the low sun cast shimmering mirages across the airfield and reflected off every surface even the drab gray building toward which their group paraded omani customs officials in blue uniforms escorted the party while a small delegation sent by the sultan flanked their sides these last were resplendent in the national dress of omani men a white collarless robe with long sleeves called a dishdasha covered by a black cloak trimmed in gold and silver embroidery they also wore cotton turbans of varied patterns and hues and leather belts adorned in silver on these belts each man wore a sheathed khanjar the traditional dagger in this case they were saidi daggers pure silver or gold a mark of rank the rolexes of omani cutlery kara trailed by safia and her graduate student remained in a heated discussion with these men it seemed the expeditions advance men here dr omaha dunn and his brother were being held by the police details on the thwarted kidnapping were still sketchy and is danny all right safia asked in arabic fine fine my lady one of the escorts assured bloodied nose nothing more he has already been attended to let me assure you kara spoke to the head official and how soon can we be under way his majesty sultan qaboos has personally arranged for your transportation to salalah there will be no further mishaps if we had only known soonerthat you personally would be accompanying kara waved his statement aside kif kif she dismissed in arabic it is of no matter as long as we wont be delayed a half bow answered her the officials lack of offense at her tart response spoke volumes concerning lady kensingtons influence in oman so much for the low profile painter thought he turned his attention to karas companion concern crinkled the corners of safias eyes her momentary peace at the end of the flight had vanished when she heard of the trouble here she clutched her carryon luggage in both hands refusing to load it and its ancient cargo onto the luggage cart still a determined glint shone in her emerald eyes or maybe it was just the reflection of gold flecks in them painter remembered her hanging from the museums glass roof he sensed a well of strength in her hidden deep but still present even the land seemed to recognize this the sun glaring harshly off everything else in oman glowed upon her skin as if welcoming her casting her features in bronze her beauty muted before shone brighter like a jewel enhanced by a perfect setting at last the party reached the private terminal building and doors opened into a cool oasis of airconditioned comfort it was the vip lounge their stay at this oasis however proved brief customs routines were hastily dispatched upon the authority of the sultans retinue passports were glanced at visas stampedthen the five of them were split between two black limousines safia her grad student and kara in one coral and painter in the other it seems our company is not appreciated painter commented as he boarded the stretch limo with his partner he settled into a seat coral joined him up front beside the limos driver a beefy irishman ran shotgun he carried a prominent sidearm in a shoulder holster painter also noted a pair of escort vehiclesone in front of karas limousine the other trailing clearly after the kidnapping security was not to be neglected painter slipped a cell phone from a pocket the phone contained a scrambled satellite chip with access to the dod computer net and housed a sixteenmegapixel digital camera with flash uploading and downloading never leave home without it he drew out the small earpiece and fixed it in place a small microphone dangled from the line at his lips he waited as the sat phone transmitted a coded handshake signal that crossed the globe and zeroed in on one person commander crowe a voice finally answered it was dr sean mcknight his immediate superior the head of sigma sir weve landed in muscat and are headed to the kensington compound i was reporting in to see if youve received any intel on the attack on the advance team we have the preliminary police report already they were snatched off the street fake taxi sounds like a typical attempted kidnapping for ransom common form of raising capital out there still painter heard the suspicion in mcknights voice first the trouble at the museumnow this do you think this could be related to london too early to say painter pictured the lithe figure vanishing over the museum wall he could still feel the weight of cassandras sig sauer in his hand two days after her arrest in connecticut she had vanished from custody the police van transferring her to the airport had been ambushed two men died and cassandra sanchez had disappeared painter had never thought to see her again how was she connected to all this and why mcknight continued admiral rector has coordinated with the nsa in gathering intel well have more in a couple hours very good sir commander is dr novak with you painter stared over at coral who watched the scenery flash past her eyes were unreadable but he was sure she was memorizing her surroundings just in case yes sir shes here let her know that the researchers over at los alamos were able to discover decaying uranium particles in that meteoric iron sample you found at the museum painter recalled her concern over the scanners readings on the sample they also support her hypothesis that the radiation from the uraniums decay may indeed be acting like some sort of nuclear timer slowly destabilizing the antimatter until it is susceptible to electrical shock painter sat straighter and spoke into the phone receiver dr novak also proposed that the same destabilization could be happening at the antimatters primary source if it exists exactly the los alamos researchers have independently expressed the same concern as such your mission has become time critical additional resources have been allocated if there is a primary source it must be discovered quickly or all may be lost understood sir painter pictured the blasted ruins of the museum gallery the bones of the guard melted into the steel grate if there was a mother lode of this antimatter the loss could be more than such scientific which brings me to my last item commander we do have pressing information that concerns your operation from noaa they report a major storm system developing in southern iraq blowing south thunderstorm sand winds clocked at sixty miles per hour a real barn buster its been shutting down city after city shifting dunes across roads nasa confirms its path toward oman painter blinked nasa confirms how big is big enough to be seen from space ill forward satellite feed painter glanced at the digital screen on the phone the screen filled in line by line from the top it was a realtime weather map of the middle east and the arabian peninsula the detail was amazing the coastline blue seas scudded with clouds tiny cities except where a large hazy blotch skirted the persian gulf it looked like a hurricane but one on land a vast reddish brown wave even extended out over the gulf meteorological predictions expect the storm to amplify in severity and size as it travels south mcknight narrated as the image refreshed the screen the blotch of sandstorm swept over a coastal city obliterating it theres chatter of a storm of the century brewing out there a highpressure system in the arabian sea is producing vicious monsoon winds drawn into a low trough over the empty quarter the sandstorm will hit the southern deserts like a freight train then be whipped up and fed by the monsoon tidals creating a mega storm system jesus itll be hell out there for a while whats the timetable the storm should reach the omani border by the day after tomorrow and current estimates expect the storm system to last two or three days delaying the expedition for as short as possible painter heard the command behind the directors words he raised his head and glanced toward the other limo a delay kara kensington was not going to be pleased pm calm downsafia urged they had all gathered in the garden courtyard of the kensington estate high limestone walls of crumbling plaster dated to the sixteenth century as did the idyllic frescoes of climbing vines that framed off arched landscapes and seascapes three years ago restoration work had returned the frescoes to their full glory this was the first time safia had seen the finished product with her own eyes artisans from the british museum had overseen the details here while safia had supervised from london via digital cameras and the internet the pixilated photos failed to do justice to the richness of the colors the blue pigments came from crushed mollusk shells the reds from pressed rose madder as had been originally done in the sixteenth century safia took in the rest of the gardens a place she had once played in as a child baked red tiles lined the grounds amid raised beds of roses trimmed hedges and artfully arranged perennials an english garden a bit of britain in the center of muscat in contrast though four large date palms dotted each corner arched and shading a good portion of the garden memories overlapped reality triggered by the perfume of climbing jasmine and a deeper sandy scent of the old town ghosts shifted amid the dappled tiles shadow plays of the past in the center of the courtyard a traditional omani tiled fountain with an octagonal reflecting basin tinkled brightly safia and kara used to swim and float in the fountains pool on especially hot and dusty days a practice frowned upon by karas father safia could still hear his amused bluster echoing off the garden walls as he returned from a board meeting to find them lounging in the fountain you two look like a pair of beached seals still sometimes he would take off his shoes and wade in with them kara stalked past the fountain with hardly a glance the bitterness in her words brought the present back in focus first omahas adventurenow the bloody weather by the time were under way half of arabia will know of our excursion and well not have a moments peace safia followed leaving the unloading of the limos to the others painter crowe had announced the dire meteorological news upon his arrival hed kept his face neutral its a shame you cant buy good weather he had finished glibly he seemed to so enjoy goading kara still after all the roadblocks kara had erected to keep the two americans from this expedition safia could hardly blame him safia caught up with kara at the arched entry to the old palace a threestory structure of carved and tiled limestone the upper levels were adorned by shaded balconies supported on ornate columns sea blue tiles lined all inner surfaces of the balconies calmingly cool to the eye after the blinding glare kara seemed to find no comfort in coming home her face tight the muscles of her jaw tense safia touched her arm wondering how much of her shortness of temper was true frustration and how much was chemically induced the storms not a problem she assured her friend we were planning to travel to salalah to examine nabi imrans tomb first its on the coast away from any sandstorms im sure well be there at least a week anyway kara took a deep breath still this mess with omaha id hoped to avoid too much notice a commotion at the gate interrupted both women turned an omani police car lights silently flashing pulled to a stop alongside the pair of limousines the rear doors opened and two men climbed out speak of the devil kara mumbled safia found it suddenly difficult to breathe the air gone heavy omaha time slipped slower paced by the dull beat of her heart in her ears she had thought shed have more time to prepare to settle in to steel herself for the meeting she felt an urge to flee and took a step back kara placed a hand on the small of her back supporting her youll be fine she whispered omaha waited for his brotherthen the two of them crossed between the black limos dannys face bore two black eyes his nose bridged by a bandaged splint omaha had an arm on his brothers elbow he wore a blue suit jacket tucked in the crook of his free arm white shirt rolled up at the elbows stained with dirt and dried blood his gaze lingered a moment on painter crowe eyes traveling up and down his form omaha nodded in wary greeting then he turned in safias direction his eyes widened and his feet slowed his face froze for a breath then a slow smile faltered then firmed he wiped a few lanky locks of sandy hair from his eyes as if disbelieving the sight his lips mouthed her name and on the second attempt he spoke aloud safiamy god he cleared his throat and hurried forward abandoning his brother for the moment before she could stop him he reached out and embraced her falling into her he smelled of salt and sweat familiar as the desert he squeezed her hard its good to see you he whispered in her ear her arms hesitated in returning his hug he straightened and stepped back before she could decide a bit of color had risen to his cheeks safia found language beyond her at the moment her eyes flicked to movement over omahas shoulder stepping around danny offered a wincing smile he looked like hed been mugged safias hand waved at her own nose glad for the distraction ii thought it wasnt broken greenstick fracture only he assured her a hint of nebraskan accent in his voice fresh from the family farm splints only for support his gaze wavered between omaha and safia stalling his own smile a stretch of awkwardness grew wild and weedy painter appeared arm out he introduced himself shaking hands with the two brothers only for a moment did his eyes flick toward safia making sure she was okay she realized he was buying her time to collect herself this is my partner dr coral novak physicist out of columbia danny straightened visibly swallowing as he surreptitiously took in her figure he spoke too quickly thats where i graduated columbia that is coral glanced at painter as if seeking permission to speak there was no outward confirmation but she spoke anyway small world danny opened his mouth thought better of it and closed it again his eyes followed the physicist as she stepped to the side clay bishop joined them safia made the introductions finding solace in the routines of etiquette and this is my graduate student clay bishop he grasped omahas hand in both of his shaking rapidly sir ive read your treatise on persian trade routes during the time of alexander the great i hope to have a chance to discuss some of your explorations along the iranafghani border omaha turned to safia and kara did he just call me sir kara broke up the introductions waving everyone to the arched entrance of the palace there are rooms assigned to each of you so you can freshen up before supper and relax afterward she led the way into the palace her fashionable fendi heels tapping on the ancient tiles but dont get too comfortable here well be leaving in four hours another plane trip clay bishop asked hiding a groan omaha clapped him on the shoulder not exactly at least one good thing came from the mess this afternoon he nodded to kara its nice to have friends in high places especially friends with nice toys kara frowned back at him have all the arrangements been made supplies and equipment have already been rerouted safia stared between them on the way here kara had made furious calls to omaha the british consulate and sultan qabooss staff whatever the result it did not seem to please kara as much as it did omaha what about the phantoms kara asked they know to meet us there omaha said with a nod phantoms clay asked before anyone could answer they reached a hall leading into the south wing the guest wing kara nodded to a waiting butler oiled gray hair hands behind his back dressed in black and white pure british henry could you please show our guests to their rooms a stiff nod yes madam his eyes twinkled a bit as they swept over to safia but he kept his face passive henry had been head butler here at the estate since safia was a child this way please the group followed kara called after them supper will be served on the upper terrace in thirty minutes it sounded more like a command than an invitation safia stepped to follow the others what are you doing kara asked taking her by the arm your old rooms have been aired and readied for you she turned her toward the main house safia stared around her as they walked little had changed in many ways the estate was as much a museum as a residence oil paintings hung on the walls kensington ancestry dating back to the fourteenth century in the rooms center stood a massive antique mahogany dining table imported from france as was the sixtiered baccarat chandelier that hung above it safia had her twelfth birthday party here she remembered candles music a blur of festivity and laughter there had always been laughter her footsteps echoed hollowly as she circled the long room kara led her to the private family wing when she was five safia had moved from the orphanage to the estate to act as playmate for young kara it was the first room she had ever had to herselfand a private bath still most of her nights were spent nestled with kara in her room the two of them whispering of futures that never came they stopped outside the door suddenly kara hugged her tight its so good to have you home again returning the genuinely warm embrace safia felt the girl behind the woman her dearest and oldest friend home and at this very moment she almost believed it kara shifted her eyes were bright in the reflected glow of the wall sconces omaha safia took a deep breath im fine i thought i was ready but to see him he hasnt changed thats so true kara said with a scowl safia smiled and returned a quick hug im finehonestly kara opened the door ive had a bath drawn and there are fresh clothes in the wardrobe ill see you at dinner she stepped away and continued down the hall she passed her old room and continued toward the double set of carved walnut doors at the end of the hall the suite belonging to the master of the estate her fathers old rooms safia turned away and pushed through the door to her own chamber beyond lay a small but highceilinged entry hall a greeting chamber once used as a playroom but now a private study she had studied for her phd oral exams in this room it smelled freshly of jasmine her favorite flower and scent she crossed through the room to the bedchamber beyond the silk canopied bed looked as if it had not been disturbed since she had left here to go to tel aviv so long ago that painful memory smoothed as her fingers trailed down a fold of kashmiri silk a wardrobe stood on the far side near the windows that opened upon a shadowed side garden gloomy with the setting sun the planted beds had grown a bit hedgy since last she had stared out from here there were even a few weeds which touched a well of loss she hadnt known was so deep why had she come back why had she left she could not seem to connect the past to the present a tinkling drip of water drew her attention away to the neighboring bathing chamber there was not much time until dinner she shed her clothes letting them drop to the floor behind her the bath was a sunken tile tub deep but narrow water steamed into the air with a whisper that could almost be heard or maybe it was the shifting layer of white jasmine petals floating on the surface the source of the rooms perfume the sight drew a tired smile she crossed to the tub and though she couldnt see the step hidden beneath the waters she entered without hesitation instincts from a past perhaps not entirely misplaced she settled into the steamy warmth sinking to her chin leaning back against the tile hair spreading over the water and petals something deeper than sore muscles loosened and relaxed she closed her eyes home pm the guardpatrolled the alleyway flashlight in hand the beam pointed at the cobbled path his other hand scraped a match against the limestone outer wall of the kensington estate the tiny flame flared with a hiss he failed to notice the blackcloaked figure hanging in the deeper shadows cast by the wide leaves of the date palm that hung over the top of the wall the light ate away the shadows threatening to expose the climber cassandra pressed the trigger on her grappling guns winch the slight noise of its oiled mechanism was covered by the bark of a stray dog one of many that ran the streets of muscat her feet muffled in slippers fled up the wall as her body was hauled upward drawn by the thin steelalloy grappling cable as it rewound back into the handheld pistol reaching the top she used her momentum to fling her body atop the wall then lay flat razorsharp glass shards were embedded along the top of the wall planted to deter interlopers but they failed to penetrate her lightweight black kevlar bodysuit and gloves still she felt one shard pressing near her right temple her mask hid and protected the rest of her face except for a strip open across her eyes nonreflective nightvision goggles rested atop her forehead ready for use the lenses were capable of taking an hour of digital footage and were hooked up to a microparabolic receiver for eavesdropping painter crowes own design this thought drew a thin smile she loved the irony to use the bastards own tools against him cassandra watched the guard vanish around the corner of the estate she freed her grappling hook and resecured it to the muzzle of her compact gun she rolled onto her back ejected the spent compressedair cartridge from the pistols grip grabbed a fresh cylinder from her belt and slapped it in place ready she swung around and crawled along the jagged parapet of the palace wall aiming for the main building the outer wall did not merge with the palace but surrounded the structure from a distance of ten meters smaller gardens filled the narrow space some separated into private hedgelined shade gardens dotted with fountains the tinkling of dancing water echoed up to her as she continued along the parapet earlier she had scoped the estate ensuring the security schematics supplied to her by the guild were accurate she knew better than to trust ink and paper she had personally checked each cameras position the schedule of the guards the layout of the palace ducking beneath the overhanging leaves of another palm she crept more slowly toward a section of the palace ablaze with light a tiny columned court framed arched windows that looked in upon a long dining hall candles carved into delicate flowers and afloat in silver basins flickered atop the table while others tapered out of elaborate candelabras crystal and fine porcelain reflected the firelight figures mingled before the silkdraped table servants bustled among them filling water goblets and offering wine lying flat to hide her silhouette cassandra lowered her digital goggles over her eyes she did not activate the nightvision mode only toggled the magnification telescoping closer to the action her earpiece buzzed with the amplified conversation sounding tinny from its digitalization she had to keep her head very still to fix the parabolic receiver on the conversation she knew all the players present the lanky graduate student clay bishop stood by one of the windows ill at ease a young serving girl offered to fill his wineglass he shook his head la shukran he mumbled no thank you behind him two men sampled a tray of varied hors doeuvres traditional dishes of oman bits of braised meat goat cheese olives and slivered dates dr omaha dunn and his brother daniel cassandra knew all about their narrow escape earlier sloppy work on the part of the kidnappers still she eyed the pair she knew better than to underestimate an opponent defeat lay along that path there could be strengths to this pair that bore watching omaha chewed around an olive pit while you were in the shower he said sucking on the pit i checked the weather report on the local news the sandstorm shut down kuwait city shoved a dune right down main street the younger brother made a noncommittal noise he did not seem to be paying attention his gaze followed a tall blonde as she entered on the far side of the room coral novak sigma operative her replacement cassandra turned her attention to her adversary the womans coolness seemed too practiced especially considering how easily she had been taken down at the museum caught off guard cassandras eyes narrowed with distaste this is who they thought to take my place at painters side someone green to sigma no wonder things had to change on the heels of the woman painter appeared tall dressed in black slacks and black shirt formal yet casual even from her perch on the wall cassandra recognized his study of the room circumspect out of the corner of his eye he was taking in all sights analyzing calculating her fingers tightened on the walls shards of glass he had exposed her threatened her position with the guild brought her low she had been perfectly poised spent years cultivating her role as a lead operative earning her partners trustand at the end maybe even something beyond simple loyalty anger built in her chest stirring bile he had cost her everything driven her out of the limelight limiting her role to ops that required total anonymity she rose from her spot and continued along the wall she had a mission one thwarted before by painter at the museum she knew the stakes involved she would not fail this night nothing would stop her cassandra worked around to the far wing of the palace toward a lone light in the darkness at the rear of the building she rose up on her toes and ran the last distance she could not risk missing her target at last she settled before a window that looked down upon an unkempt garden through the steamy window a lone woman reclined in a sunken bath cassandra scanned the remaining rooms empty she listened not a sound satisfied cassandra aimed her grappling gun toward an upper balcony in her left ear she heard the woman mumble it sounded groggy a dream a choked cry nonot again cassandra pulled the guns release trigger the hooks snapped wide and sailed through the air spiraling a thin cable of steel behind a tight zipping noise accompanied it the grappling hooks sailed over the balustrade of the thirdstory balcony securing the hooks with a snug pull cassandra swung from the wall toward the garden below wind whistled dogs barked in a neighboring alley she landed without breaking a twig and leaned against the wall beside the window one ear cocked for the sound of alarm silence she checked the window it had been left cracked open a fingers breadth beyond the woman mumbled in her dreams perfect pm safia standsin the waiting room of a large hospital she knows what is going to happen across the way she spots the bent woman walking with the limp entering the ward face and form covered in aberka the bulge under the womans cloak evident now not like before safia lunges to cross the waiting room frantic to stop what is going to happen next but children crowd around her feet clambering at her legs snatching at her arms she struggles to push them away but they cry out she slows unsure whether to console or push forward ahead the woman disappears into the mass of people by the desk safia can no longer see her but the station nurse raises her arm points in safias direction her name is called like before the crowd parts the woman is spotlit in her own light angelic cloak swelling out like wings no safia mouths she has no air to speak to warn then a blinding explosion all light no noise sight returns in an instantbut not hearing she is on her back staring as silent flames race along the ceiling she hides her face from the heat but its everywhere with her head turned she sees children sprawled some aflame others crushed under stone one sits with her back to an overturned table the childs face is missing another reaches toward her but there is no hand only blood safia now realizes why she cant hear the world has become one scream stretched to infinity the scream comes not from the children but from her own mouth then something touched her safia startled awake in the tub choking on the same scream it was always inside her trying to get out she covered her mouth shaking out a sob holding everything else inside she trembled in the cooling water arms hugged around her breasts tight waiting for the echo of the panic attack to subside only a dream she wished she could believe it it had been too forceful too vivid she still tasted the blood in her mouth she wiped her brow but continued to tremble she wanted to blame her reaction the dream on her exhaustionbut that was a lie it was this place this land home again and omaha she closed her eyes but the dream waited only a breath way it was no mere nightmare all of it had happened all of it was her fault the local imam a holy muslim leader had tried to deter her from excavating the tombs in the hills outside of qumran she had not listened too confident in the shield of pure research the year before safia had spent six months deciphering a single clay tablet it suggested a cache of scrolls might be buried at the location possibly another sepulcher of the famous dead sea scrolls two months of digging proved her right she uncovered forty urns containing a vast library of aramaic writings the discovery of the year but it came with a high price a fanatical fundamentalist group took offense at the defilement of a muslim holy place especially by a woman one of mixed blood one with close ties to the west unknown to her at the time safia was targeted only it was the blood and lives of innocent children that paid the price for her hubris and gall she was one of only three survivors a miracle it was described in newspapers a miracle she had survived safia prayed for no other such miracles in her life they came at too high a price safia opened her eyes fingers clenched anger warmed past grief and guilt her therapist had told her this was a perfectly natural response she should allow herself to feel this fury still she felt ashamed of her anger undeserving she sat straighter water splashed over the tubs edge and washed across the tiles leaving a trail of jasmine petals on the floor the remaining petals sloshed around her bare midsection under the water something brushed against her knee something as soft as a flower but with more weight safia tensed a rabbit in headlights the waters settled the slick of jasmine petals hid the depths of the tub then slowly a lazy scurve disturbed the layer from beneath safia froze the snakes head surfaced through the petals a few clinging to its mud brown head gray eyes turned black as the protective inner eyelid pulled down it seemed to be staring right at her safia knew the snake on sight spotting the telltale white cross atop its crown echis pyramidum carpet viper all omani children knew to watch for its mark the sign of the cross meant death here not christian salvation the snake was ubiquitous in the region frequenting shady spots found hanging from limbs of trees its venom was both hemotoxic and neurotoxic a fatal combination from bite to death in less than ten minutes its ability to strike was so broad and swift that it was once thought to be capable of flight the meterlong viper swam through the tub aiming for safia she dared not move or risk provoking it it must have slipped into the water after she fell asleep seeking moisture to aid in the shedding of its skin the snake reached her belly rising a bit from the water tongue flicking the air safia felt the tickle on her skin as it sidled even closer goose bumps traced down her arms she fought not to shiver sensing no danger the viper beached onto her belly slithered upward and slowly crested her left breast it paused to flick its tongue again scaled skin was warm on her own not cold its movements were muscular hard safia kept her own muscles tight rigid she dared not breathe but how long could she hold her breath the snake seemed to enjoy its perch unmoving settling atop her breast its behavior was so odd why didnt it sense her hear her heartbeat move she willed it with all her might if only it would retreat across the room find some corner to hide give her a chance to climb from the bath she found the need for air growing into a sharp pain in her chest a pressure behind her eyes please go the viper sampled the air again with its red tongue whatever it sensed seemed to content it it settled in for a rest tiny stars danced across safias vision birthed by the lack of oxygen and the tension if she moved she died if she even breathed then a shift of shadows drew her eye to the window condensation steamed the glass making the view murky but there was no doubt someone was out there snakes and ladders december pm old town muscat where thehells safia omaha asked checking his watch it was ten minutes past the time they were all supposed to gather for dinner the woman he had known in the past was painfully punctual something drilled into her at oxford it was her attention to detail that made her such an accomplished curator shouldnt she be here by now he said i had a bath drawn for her kara announced as she stepped into the room a maid just went up with fresh clothes kara entered resplendent in a traditional omani thob gown of flowing red silk with gold filigree embroidered along the hems she abandoned any headdress leaving her auburn hair free and wore prada sandals as always to kara a line had to be drawn between the traditional and the fashionable a bath omaha groaned then well never see her this evening safia loved water in all its forms showers fountains flowing taps dips in streams and lakes but especially baths he used to tease her attributing her fixation to her desert past you can take the girl out of the desert but never the desert out of the girl with this thought other uninvited memories intruded of long baths shared limbs entwined laughter soft moans steam off water and skin shell be along when shes ready kara warned protective drawing him back to the room she nodded to the household butler well be serving a light omani dinner before we head out in a couple of hours please sit everyone found seats dividing into party lines painter and coral sat on one side along with safias graduate student clay danny and omaha took seats on the other lastly kara settled on the lone chair at the head of the table upon some unseen signal servants paraded through a set of swinging doors from the kitchen hallway they bore aloft covered trays some held above their heads on a single palm others carried wider trays in both arms as each platter was lowered to the table the servant stepped deftly back lifting the lids to expose what lay beneath it was all clearly choreographed kara named each dish as it was revealed maqbous saffron rice over lamb shuwa pork cooked in clay ovens mashuai spitfired kingfish served with lemon rice she named a handful of other curried dishes amid the feast were plates of thin oval breads they were familiar to omaha the ubiquitous rukhal bread of oman baked over burning palm leaves kara finally finished her introductions and lastly honeycakes one of my favorites flavored with the syrup from the native elb tree whatno sheeps eyes omaha mumbled kara heard him that delicacy can be arranged he held up a conciliatory palm ill pass this time kara waved a hand over the spread tradition among the omani is to serve oneself please enjoy the group took her at her word and proceeded to spoon spear ladle and grab omaha filled a cup from the tall pot kahwa omani coffee deadly strong arabs might shun alcohol but they had no qualms about caffeine addiction he took a deep sip and sighed the bitter tang of the thick coffee was softened by cardamom a distinct and welcome aftertaste conversation centered initially on the quality of the fare mostly murmurs of surprise at the tenderness of the meat or the fire of the spices clay seemed content to fill his plate with honeycakes kara merely picked at her food keeping a watch on the servants guiding with a nod or turn of her head omaha studied her while sipping his kahwa she was thinner more wasted than when last he saw her karas eyes still shone but now appeared more fevered omaha knew how much effort she had invested in this trip and he knew why safia and he had kept few secretsat least back then he knew all about reginald kensington his portrait stared down at kara from the wall behind her did she still feel those eyes omaha imagined hed be no better if his own father had vanished into the desert sucked out of this world but thank god it required his imagination to fathom such a loss his father at eightytwo still worked the family farm back in nebraska he ate four eggs a rasher of bacon and a pile of buttered toast each breakfast and smoked a cigar each night his mother was even more fit solid stock his father used to brag just like my boys as omaha thought of his family his brothers sharp voice drew his attention from kara danny was elaborating on the escapade of the midday abduction using his fork as much as his voice to tell the story omaha recognized the flush of excitement as he relived the days events he shook his head hearing the bluster and swagger in his younger brother omaha had once been the same immortal armored in youth no longer he stared down at his own hands they were lined and scarred his fathers hands he listened to dannys story it had not been the grand adventure his brother related it had been deadlyserious business a new voice interrupted a woman painter crowe asked with a frown one of your kidnappers was a woman danny nodded i didnt see her but my brother did omaha found the other mans eyes turning to him a piercing blue his brow furrowed his gaze concentrating attention like a wellfocused laser is this true crowe asked omaha shrugged taken aback by his intensity what did she look like this last was spoken too quickly omaha answered slowly watching the pair she was tall my height from the way she handled herself id say she had military training painter glanced at his partner a silent message seemed to pass between them they knew something they werent telling the scientist faced omaha again and her appearance black hair and green eyes bedouin descent and oh a small red teardrop tattoo by one eyeher left bedouin painter repeated are you sure ive worked this region for the past fifteen years i can tell individual tribe members and clans apart which tribe was the woman from hard to say i didnt get a long enough look at her painter leaned back clearly the thread of tension in him broken his partner reached for one of the honeycakes placed it on her plate and ignored it neither exchanged a glance this time but something had been resolved why the interest kara asked voicing omahas own thought painter shrugged if it was a random abduction for profit then it probably doesnt matter but if notif it was connected to the museum heist in some manner i think we should all know who to keep an eye out for his words sounded reasonable enough practical and scientific but omaha sensed something deeper lay behind his expressed interest kara let it drop she glanced to her diamond rolex where is safia surely shes not still in the bath pm safia kepther breathing shallow she had no phobia of snakes but she had learned to respect them while exploring dusty ruins they were as much a part of the desert as the sand and wind she sat perfectly still in the bath the waters cooled as she waitedor maybe it was the fear chilling her the carpet viper draped over her left breast seemed to have settled in for a good long soak safia recognized the roughness of its outer skin it was an old specimen making the shedding of its skin especially difficult again movement caught her eye beyond the window but as she searched the darkness lay still and quiet paranoia that often preceded a panic attack an allconsuming anxiety that saw threat and danger where none existed her attacks were more commonly triggered by emotional stress or tension not physical threats in fact the surge of adrenaline from immediate danger was a good buffer against the electric cascade of a panic episode still the strain of outwaiting the viper had begun to wear thin the veneer of safias buffer the symptoms of a carpetviper bite were immediate and severe blackened skin fire in the blood convulsions that broke bones there was no known antidote a small tremor began in her hands no known antidote she forced herself to calm safia slowly exhaled again watching the snake she inhaled even more slowly savoring the sweetness of fresh air the scent of jasmine a pleasure earlier was now cloying a knock at her door startled her she jumped slightly water rippled around her the viper lifted its head she felt the rest of the snakes body harden against her bare belly tensing wary mistress almaaz a voice called from the hall she did not answer the snake sampled the air with its tongue its body slid higher up pushing its triangular head toward her throat mistress it was henry the household butler he must have come to see if she had fallen asleep the others would be in the dining hall there was no clock in the room but it felt like the entire night had passed in the deadly silence the sound of a key scraping in the old lock reached her the creak of the outer door followed mistress almaaz less muffled now im sending liza in for henry ever the efficient english butler it would be unseemly to enter a ladys apartment especially when the lady was in her bath tiny hurried footsteps crossed the rooms aiming for the back bathroom all the commotion agitated the snake it rose up between her breasts like her venomous champion carpet vipers were notoriously aggressive known to chase a man a full kilometer if threatened but this viper lethargic from its soaking made no move to strike hello a timid voice called just outside the door safia had no way to warn the maid off a young girl kept her head bowed shyly as she crept into the doorway her dark hair braided under a lace cap from two steps away she mumbled im sorry to disturb your bath mistress she finally glanced up met safias eyesthen the snakes as it rose higher hissing in threat coiling in anticipation wet scales sawed together with a sound like sandpaper the maids hand flew to her mouth but it failed to stifle her scream drawn by the noise and movement the snake surged from the water flying bodily over the wide tiled lip of the tub aiming for the girl the maid was too frightened to move safia was not she instinctively grabbed for the vipers tail as it leaped catching it up in midstrike she yanked it back from the maid and swung its length wide but it was no limp piece of rope muscles writhed in her hand hard under her fingers she felt more than saw the snake coil around upon itself ready to strike at what had snatched it safia kicked her feet trying to gain purchase to stand to get some advantage the slippery tiles kept betraying her water slopped across the floor the viper struck at her wrist only a quick twist and whip of her arm kept fangs from flesh but like a skilled combatant the old snake contorted for another attempt safia finally gained her legs she spun around in the tub swinging her arm wide using centrifugal force to keep the snakes head from reaching her instinct made her want to fling it away but that didnt ensure the end of the battle the bathroom was small the aggression of the viper notorious instead she cracked out her arm she had used a bullwhip before having given one to omaha as a silly christmas gift playing off karas persistence in referring to him as indiana she used the same technique now snapping her wrist with a wellpracticed twist the viper dazed from the spin failed to react in time its length responded to ageold physics and whipped outward its head struck the tiled wall with enough impact to chip ceramic blood spurted in a spray of crimson the body convulsed a beat in her hand then dropped limply splashing back into the bathwater around her thighs mistress almaaz safia turned her head and found the butler henry in the doorway drawn by the maids scream he had a hand on the terrified girls shoulder safia stared down at the limp snake at her own nakedness she should have felt shame and tried to cover herself but instead she let the scaled body slip from her fingers and stepped from the bath only the trembling of her fingers betrayed her henry collected a large cotton towel from a warming rack he held it open safia stepped forward and henry folded her into its embrace tears began to flow her breath shortened painfully through the window the moon had risen peeking over the palace wall for half a breath something darker fluttered over its surface safia startled but then it was gone just a bat the nocturnal predator of the desert still her trembling grew worse while henrys arms grew stronger holding her up carrying her to the bed in the next room youre safe he whispered in a fatherly fashion she knew his words could not be further from the truth pm outside thewindow cassandra crouched in the bushes she had watched the museum curator deal with the snake moving lithely dispatching it with alacrity she had hoped to wait until the woman was gone then quickly abscond with the luggage that housed the iron heart the viper had turned out to be an unwelcome visitor for the both of them but unlike the curator cassandra knew the presence of the snake was deliberate planted planned she had caught the barest reflection in the window mirrored silver in the moonlight another presence climbing the wall cassandra had dropped down and away her back to the palace a pistol in each hand twin black matte glocks pulled from shoulder holsters she caught the sight of the cloaked figure sailing over the outer wall gone an assassin someone had shared the garden with herand shed been unaware damn foolish anger quickened her thoughts as she recalculated the nights plan with the commotion in the curators room the likelihood of absconding with the artifact dimmed but the cloaked thiefthat was another matter entirely she had already obtained the intelligence on the attempted abduction of omaha and daniel dunn it was unclear if the attack was mere unlucky chance wrong time wrong place or if it was something more meaningful a calculated attack an attempt at collecting ransom from the kensington estate and now this threat to the curators life it could not be pure chance there must be a connection something unknown to the guild a third party involved in all this but how and why all this ran through her head in a heartbeat cassandra tightened her grip on her pistols answers could come from only one place crossing her arms cassandra holstered both pistols and unhooked the grappling gun from her belt she aimed pulled the trigger and heard the zip of the steel cord sailing upward she was on the move when the grappling hook clunked against the walls lip she squeezed the retracting winch in the time it took to reach the wall the steel cable had drawn taut and hauled her weight upward her softheeled shoes scaled the wall as the grappling motor whined reaching the top she straddled the parapet and resecured the grappling gun searching below she snapped down her nightvision goggles the dark alleyway bloomed into crisp greens and whites across the way a cloaked figure slunk along the far wall aiming for the neighboring street the assassin cassandra gained her feet atop the glassstrewn parapet and ran in the direction of the cloaked thief her footfalls must have been heard her target sped faster with a swirl of shadow damn it cassandra reached a spot along the wall where another date palm rose from within the walled compound its fronded leaves fanned wide shading both sides of the wall blocking her run without slowing cassandra kept one eye on her quarry as she reached the tree she lunged out grabbed a handful of leaves and leaped off the twentyfoot wall her purchase gave way under her weight leaves ripped from between her gloved fingers but the temporary support helped break her fall she landed in the alley her knees absorbing the impact she shot after her quarry who vanished down a cross street cassandra subvocalized into her controls an overlay map of the immediate cityscape appeared within her goggles it took a practiced eye to interpret the mishmash of imagery here in old town there was no rhyme or reason to the layout the surrounding environment was a labyrinth of alleys and cobbled streets if the thief escaped into that twisted maze cassandra sped faster the other had to be slowed her digital overlay showed the side street to be less than thirty yards long before it crisscrossed more alleys cassandra had only one chance she dove for the corner yanking her grappling gun free as she slid into the street she quickly tracked and locked her quarry thirty yards away she pulled the trigger the zip of cable hissed the grappling hook shot in a low arc down the alley passing over the shoulder of her mark cassandra squeezed the retractor reversing the winch while yanking back with her own arm like flyfishing the hooks dug into the others shoulder spinning the figure legs flailing cassandra allowed herself a grim smile of satisfaction she savored her victory too soon her adversary continued the spin unwinding a fan of cloak pulling free of the garment with a skill that would have astounded houdini moonlight cast the figure as bright as midday through the nightvision goggles a woman she landed with feline grace upon one hand springing back to her toes with a sweep of dark hair she sped down the street cassandra swore and gave pursuit a part of her appreciated her targets skill and the challenge another wanted to shoot the woman in the back for making her night that much longer but she needed answers she dogged the woman whose movement was lithe and surefooted cassandra had been a champion sprinter in high school and only got faster during her rigorous special forces training being one of the first women in the army rangers she needed to be fast her target fled around another corner by this time at night the streets were empty except for a few crouched dogs and scurrying cats after sundown old town locked itself up and shuttered its windows leaving the streets dark occasional bits of music or laughter echoed from inner courtyards a few lights shone from upper balconies but even these were barred against intrusion cassandra checked her digital overlay a smile stretched her lips thin the warren of alleys into which her quarry had fled was circuitous but ultimately a dead end terminating against the towering flank of the ancient fort of jalai the walled fortress had no entrance on this side cassandra kept pace in her head she planned her assault she freed one of her glocks with her other hand she tapped her radio ill need evac in ten she subvocalized fix on my gps the response was terse we copy evac in ten as planned the team subcommander would send out a trio of modified dirt bikes with silenced mufflers solid rubber tires and jacked engines automobiles had limited mobility in old towns narrow passages the bikes suited the region better cassandras expertise fitting the right tool to the right job by the time she had her target cornered backup would be riding at her heels she would only have to hold the woman at bay if there was any resistance a bullet to a knee should dampen the others spirit ahead a flash of white limb on her nightvision scope alerted cassandra that her target was slowing the distances closing she must be realizing the trap she had run into cassandra paced the other keeping her in sight finally a last twist of narrow alley revealed the towering jalai fort the storefronts to either side ran up against the structure creating a box canyon the woman stripped of her cloak wore only a loose white shift she stood at the base of the forts sheer sandstone wall staring upward the closest purchase or opening was thirty feet up if the woman attempted to scale the neighboring storefront rooftops cassandra would discourage her with a few wellplaced shots from her glock cassandra stepped into the alley blocking any escape the woman sensed her and turned from the fort wall to face her cassandra flipped up her nightvision scope the moon illuminated the alley well enough she preferred her natural vision in close quarters with her glock conspicuously pointed forward cassandra closed the distance dont move she said in arabic ignoring her the woman shrugged a shoulder her shift dropped from her form and pooled around her ankles leaving her naked in the street long of limb bearing applesize breasts and bending a shapely long neck she seemed unabashed by her nakedness a rarity in arabia there was a measure of nobility to her pose a greek statue of an arab princess her only jewelry was a small ruby tattoo by her left eye a teardrop the woman spoke for the first time slowly warning in her voice her words though were not arabic with a background in linguistics cassandra was fluent in a dozen languages efficient in a score of others she bent an ear to the words sensing a familiarity but unable to pin it down before cassandra could discern anything else the naked woman stepped barefoot from her clothes and backed into the shadow of the towering wall moving from moonlight into darkness her form vanished for a breath cassandra stepped forward maintaining the distance between them she stared harder no she flipped down her nightvision goggles shadows dissolved the sandstone cliff of the fort sharpened into focus she searched right and left the woman was nowhere in sight cassandra rushed forward pistol raised she reached the wall in seven steps one hand went out touching the stone to ensure it was real solid with her back to the wall she scanned the alley with her nightvision goggles no movement no sign of the woman impossible it was as if she had turned to shadow and vanished a veritable djinn a ghost of the desert cassandra only had to stare at the pile of discarded clothes to know better since when did ghosts wear cloaks a crunch of gravel and a low growl drew her attention to the entrance to the alley a small motorbike rounded the bend flanked by two others her backup with a final check around cassandra crossed to them she spun in circles twice more when she reached the lead bike she asked did you see a naked woman in the alley on your way here the riders face was masked but confusion shone in his eyes naked cassandra heard the negation in his voice never mind she climbed onto the bike behind the rider the night had been a bust something strange was afoot out here she needed time to sort it out she tapped the mans shoulder he swung the bike around and the trio fled back the way they had come aiming for the empty warehouse they had rented at the docks for their base of operations in muscat it was time to finish the mission assigned her it would have been easier with the iron heart in her hands but contingencies were already in place by midnight they would move forward with the plans to eliminate crowes expeditionary force her mind ran over the final details that needed to be arranged but she had a hard time concentrating what had happened to the woman had there been a secret door into the fort one unknown to her intel it was the only explanation as she pondered the strangeness the womans words echoed in her head the muffled rev of the bikes helped her focus where had she heard that language she glanced back at the ancient fort of jalai its towers thrust up into moonlight above the lower buildings an ancient structure from a lost era then it struck her the familiarity of the language not modern ancient in her head the words played out again thick with warning though she still didnt understand she knew what she was hearing a dead language aramaic the language of jesus christ pm how didit get in there painter asked he stood by the entrance to the bath staring at the floating length of dead snake among the jasmine petals the entire dining party had heard the maids scream and come running they had been held at bay by the butler until kara could help safia into a robe kara answered his question from her seat beside her friend on the bed bloody buggers are always turning up even in the plumbing safias rooms had been closed off for years it couldve been nesting anywhere in here when we aired out her rooms and cleaned the place it must have been disturbed then was drawn out by the water in the tub shedding safia whispered hoarsely kara had given her a pill its effect had lazed the womans tongue but she seemed calmer than when the group first arrived her wet hair hung damply to her skin color slowly returned shedding snakes seek water then more likely it came from outside omaha added the archaeologist stood by the arch into the study the others waited out in the hall kara patted safias knee and stood up either way the matters over its best that we get ready for our departure surely it can be put off a day omaha said glancing at safia no safia pushed past the sedative haze i can manage kara nodded were due to rendezvous at the port at midnight painter held up a hand you never did tell us how wed be traveling kara waved away his words like a foul smell youll all see when we get there i have a thousand last minute details to attend to she strode past omaha and out of the rooms her words carried back as she addressed the others in the hall gather in the courtyard in an hour omaha and painter stood across the room from each other on either side of safia neither man moved both equally unsure if it was appropriate to comfort safia the matter was settled by henry stepping through the archway the butlers arms full of folded clothing henry nodded to the two men sirs ive rung for a maid to help mistress almaaz dress and gather her things if you would be so kind he nodded toward the door dismissing them painter stepped closer to safia are you sure youre okay to travel she nodded an effort thank you ill be fine just the same ill wait outside in the hall for you this earned him the smallest smile he found himself matching it that wont be necessary she said he turned i know but ill be there anyway painter found omaha studying him his eyes slightly more narrowed than a moment before the mans expression was tight he was clearly suspicious but also a trace of anger lay under the surface as painter crossed toward the door omaha made no room to allow him to pass he had to turn sideways to get by as he did so omaha addressed safia you did good in there babe it was just a snake she answered standing to accept the clothes from the butler and i have a lot to do before we leave omaha sighed all right i hear you he followed painter out the door the others had all cleared leaving the hallway empty painter moved to take a post beside the door omaha started to march past him but painter cleared his throat dr dunn the archaeologist stopped glancing sidelong at him that snake painter said following a thread left untied earlier you said you thought it came from outside why omaha shrugged stepping back a bit cant say for sure but carpet vipers like the afternoon sun especially when shedding so i cant imagine it was holed up in there all day painter stared over at the closed door safias room had an eastern exposure morning sunlight only if the archaeologist was correct the snake wouldve had to travel a long way from a sunny roost to the tub omaha read his thoughts you dont think someone put it there maybe im just being too paranoid but didnt some militant group once try to kill safia the man scowled an expression worn into the lines of his face that was five years ago way up in tel aviv besides if someone planted that snake it couldnt have been those bastards whys that omaha shook his head the extremist group was rooted out by israeli commandos a year later wiped out actually painter knew the details it was dr dunn who had helped the israelis hunt the extremists down using his contacts in the area omaha mumbled more to himself than painter a bitter tone afterward i thought safia would be relievedwould return here its not that easy guy painter already had a good fix on omaha the man tackled problems headon bulled through them without looking back it wasnt what safia needed he doubted omaha would ever understand still painter sensed a well of loss in the man one that had been filled by the sand of passing years so he tried to help trauma like that is not overcome by omaha cut him off sharply yeah ive heard it all before thanks but youre not my goddamn therapist or hers he stalked off down the hall calling back derisively and sometimes doc a snake is just a snake painter sighed a figure moved from the shadows of a neighboring archway it was coral novak that man has issues dont we all i overheard your conversation she said were you just chatting with him or do you really think another party is involved theres definitely someone stirring the pot cassandra he slowly shook his head no some unknown variable coral scowled which consisted of the barest downturn of the corner of her lips thats not good nono its not and this curator coral persisted nodding to the door youve really got the role of the attentive civilian scientist down pat painter sensed a subtle warning in her voice a cloaked concern that he might be crossing the line between professionalism and something more personal coral continued if theres another party sniffing around shouldnt we be searching the grounds for evidence definitely thats why youre going out there now coral raised an eyebrow i have a door to guard he said answering her unspoken question i understand coral began to turn away but are you staying here to safeguard the woman or the mission painter let command harden his voice in this particular case theyre one and the same pm safia staredout at the passing scenery the two tablets of diazepam kept her head muzzy lights from passing streetlamps were phosphorous blurs smudges of light across the midnight landscape the buildings were all dark but ahead a blaze of light marked the port of muscat the commercial harbor was active twentyfour hours a day kept bright with floodlights and sodiumlit warehouses as they rounded a tight turn the harbor came into view the bay was mostly empty most of the oil barges and container ships having docked before sunset during the night their cargo would be offloaded and reloaded even now hcranes and trundling traincarsize containers swung through the air like giant toy blocks farther out near the horizon a behemoth of a cruise liner floated on the dark waters like some candlelit birthday cake backdropped against a spray of stars the limo aimed away from the commotion toward the far side of the harbor where the more traditional dhow sailing vessels of arabia stood docked for thousands of years omanis had plied the seas from africa to india the dhows were simple woodenplanked shells with a distinctive triangular sail they varied in size from the shallow draft of the badan form to the deepsea baghlah the proud array of old ships lined the far harbor stacked close together sails furled masts poking high amid tangles of ropes were almost there kara mumbled to safia from the other side of the limo the only other occupant besides the driver and a bodyguard was safias student clay bishop he snorted a bit when kara spoke half drowsing behind them trailed the other limo with all the americans painter and his partner omaha and his brother safia sat straighter now kara had yet to tell her how they were getting to salalah only that they were heading to the harbor so she guessed they would be traveling by boat salalah was a coastal city like muscat and travel between the two cities was almost easier by sea than by air transports both cargo and passenger left throughout the day and night they varied from dieselengine ferries to a pair of lightningfast hydrofoils considering karas urgency to be under way safia guessed theyd be taking the fastest vessel possible the limo turned through the gated entry followed by its twin both continued down the pier passing rows and rows of docked dhows safia was familiar with the regular passenger terminal this wasnt it they were heading down the wrong pier kara she began the limo cleared the last harbor office at the end of the pier parked beyond lit by lights and crowded with clusters of linehaulers and dockworkers stood a magnificent sight from the commotion and the unfurled sails there could be no doubt this was their transportation no safia mumbled yes kara answered sounding none too pleased holy christ clay said leaning forward the better to see kara checked her watch i couldnt refuse the sultan when he offered us its use the limo pulled athwart the piers end doors opened safia climbed to her feet swaying a bit as she stared at the top of the hundredfoot masts the ships length was almost twice that the shabab oman she whispered in awe the highmasted clipper ship was the sultans pride the countrys maritime ambassador to the world a reminder of its nautical history it had the traditional english design of a squarerigged foremast the main and aft masts bearing both square and sloop sails built in from scottish oak and uruguayan pine it was the largest vessel of its era in the world that was still seaworthy and in active service for the past thirty years it had traveled throughout the world participating in races and regattas presidents and premiers kings and queens had strode its deck and now it was being lent to kara for her personal transportation to salalah this more than anything demonstrated the sultans esteem for the kensington family safia now understood why kara could not refuse safia had to suppress a small bit of glee surprised by the burbling feeling worries of snakes and nagging doubts dimmed maybe it was just the drugs but she preferred to believe it was the fresh salt of the sea breeze clearing her head and her heart how long had it been since shed felt this way by now the other limo had drawn up and parked the americans climbed out all eyes wide on the ship only omaha seemed unimpressed having already been informed of the change in transportation still to see the ship in person clearly affected him though of course he tried to hide it great this whole expedition is turning into a great big sinbad movie when in rome kara mumbled pm cassandra watchedthe ship from across the harbor the guild had secured this warehouse through contacts with a trafficker in blackmarket pirated videos the back half of the rusted structure was stacked with crates of bootlegged dvds and vhs videos the remainder of the warehouse though met her requirements formerly a mechanics shop it had its own enclosed dry dock and berth water slapped in a continual rhythm against the nearby pilings disturbed by the wake of a passing trawler heading out to sea the motion jostled the group of attack vessels brought in last week some had arrived disassembled in crates then reassembled onsite others were brought in by sea in the dead of night rocking in the berth were three boston whalers each tethering a rack of sleek black jet skis modified by the guild with swivelmounted assault rifles in addition the dock housed cassandras command boat a hydrofoil capable of rocketing to speeds in excess of a hundred knots her twelveman team bustled about with final preparations they were all exspecial forces like herself but these hard men had never been recruited by sigma not that they werent intelligent enough drummed out of the forces most had gone into various mercenary and paramilitary groups around the world learning new skills growing harder and more cunning from these men the guild had handpicked those with the best adaptability the keenest intelligence those who demonstrated the fiercest loyalty to their team traits even sigma would have appreciated only in the guilds case one criterion was paramount these men had no qualms about killing no matter the target her secondincommand approached captain sanchez sir she kept her attention on the video feed from the exterior cameras she counted as painters party climbed aboard the ship and were greeted by omani officials everyone was aboard she finally straightened yes kane john kane was the only nonamerican in the group he had served in the elite australian sas special air services the guild did not limit its talent search to us borders especially as it operated internationally standing over six and a half feet kane was solidly muscled he kept his head shaved smooth except for a patch of black hair under his chin the team here was actually kanes own men positioned in the gulf until called to duty by the guild the organization had teams planted throughout the world independent cells who knew nothing about the others each ready at a moments notice to do the guilds bidding cassandra had been sent to activate this particular cell and lead the mission gaining the assignment because of her knowledge of sigma force the guilds adversary on this op she knew how sigma operated their strategies and procedures she also had intimate knowledge of their op leaderpainter crowe were locked and loaded kane said cassandra nodded checked her watch the shabab oman was due to disembark at the stroke of midnight they would wait a full hour then set off in pursuit she stared again at the video monitor and calculated in her head the argus she asked radioed in a few minutes ago shes already in position patrolling our attack zone to ensure no trespassers the argus was a fourman submersible capable of offloading divers without surfacing its peroxidepropellant engines and ordnance of minitorpedoes made it as fast as it was deadly cassandra nodded again all was in place none aboard the shabab would live to see the dawn midnight henry stoodin the center of the bathroom as the draining tub gurgled his butlers jacket lay on the bed outside he rolled up his sleeves and pulled on a pair of yellow rubber gloves he sighed a maid could have easily handled this chore but the girls were already put off by the commotion and he felt it his duty to rid the house of the vipers remains ultimately the wellbeing of the palaces guests fell upon his shoulders a duty he felt he had failed in this evening and though lady kensingtons group had departed he still felt it a personal responsibility to cast the snake out to correct his mistake stepping forward he leaned down and gingerly reached for the body it floated in a lazy sshape upon the water even seeming to writhe slightly bobbled by the tidal pull of the drain henrys finger hesitated the bloody thing looked alive he squeezed his gloved hand get a grip on yourself old man taking a deep breath he grabbed the snake by the middle his face clenched in distaste teeth grinding bloody piece of shite he muttered reverting to the language of his dublin youth he cast a silent prayer of thanks to saint patrick for driving these buggers out of ireland he dragged the limp form out of the tub a plasticlined pail awaited his catch turning holding the snake at arms length he positioned the snakes tail over the bucket and wound its body down into it coiling it into place as he settled its head atop the pile he was again amazed at the lifelike appearance of the creature only its slack mouth ruined the image henry began to straighten then cocked his head seeing something that made no sense whats this then he turned and collected a plastic comb from the vanity gingerly grabbing the snake behind its skull he used the comb to pry the mouth open farther confirming what he had noticed how odd he mumbled he probed with the comb to make sure the snake had no fangs blood on the water december am arabian sea safia stoodat the rail staring at the dark coastline as it floated past the ship creaked and groaned around her sails snapped as the winds twisted over the midnight seas it was as if they had been transported to another time when the world was just wind sand and water the smell of the salt and the whisper of waves sliding along the boats sides erased the bustle of muscat stars shone above but clouds were blowing in they would have rain before they reached salalah the ships captain had already relayed the weather reports a squall was raising swells to ten feet nothing the shabab cant handle he had said with a grin but itll make for a bit of a roll and yaw best stick to your cabins when the rains hit so safia had decided to take advantage of the clear skies while they lasted after the excitement of the day she found it too confining in the cabin especially now that the sedatives were wearing thin she watched the dark coastline glide past so quiet so smooth the last oasis of light an industrial complex on the very outskirts of muscat began to disappear around a spur of land a voice spoke behind her sounding intentionally indifferent there goes the last vestige of civilization as we know it clay bishop stepped to the rail gripped it with one hand and raised a cigarette to his lips he still wore his levis and a black tshirt emblazoned with the wordsgot milk for the two years he had served as her grad student he never wore anything but tshirts usually advertising rock bands in garish colors the blackandwhite one he wore now was clearly his formal wear slightly irritated at the intrusion she kept her voice stiff and scholarly those lights she said nodding to the fading complex mark the citys most important industrial site can you tell me what it is mr bishop he shrugged and after a moments hesitation guessed an oil refinery it was an answer she expected but it was also wrong no its the desalination facility that produces the citys freshwater supply water oil may be the wealth of arabia but water is its lifeblood she allowed her student to dwell on this fact few in the west knew of the importance of such desalination projects here in arabia water rights and freshwater resources were already replacing oil as the hotbed of contention in the middle east and north africa some of the fiercest conflicts between israel and its neighborslebanon jordan and syriawere not over ideology or religion but over control of the jordan valleys water supply clay finally spoke up whiskey is for drinkin water is for fightin she frowned mark twain he said once again she was surprised by his astute intuitiveness and nodded to him very good despite his slacker appearance there was a sharp intelligence behind those thick black glasses it was one of the reasons she had allowed the young man to join this expedition he would make a fine researcher one day clay raised his cigarette again studying him she noted the slight waver in its lit end and for the first time his whiteknuckled grip on the ships rail are you all right she asked not a big fan of the open sea if god had meant for man to sail he wouldnt have ground the dinosaurs into jet fuel she reached over and patted his hand go to bed mr bishop the desalination plant finally vanished around the spit of land all went dark except for the ships lights reflected in the waters behind safia solitary lanterns and strings of electric lights lit the decks aiding the crew in working lines and rigging preparing for the rougher seas of the approaching storm the crew was mostly trainees young men from the royal navy of oman practicing while the ship was home running short trips up and down the coastline the shabab was due in another two months to compete in the presidents cup regatta the murmur of the young men was interrupted by a sudden shout from the middle of the deck a flurry of arabic cursing a crash erupted safia turned to see a middeck cargo hatch thrown wide knocking a sailor back another man came flying out the open doorway flinging himself to the side the reason for the sailors mad flight appeared at his heels hooves smashing down onto the planks a white stallion galloped up the holds ramp and out onto the deck tossing his mane he stood silvery in the moonlight his eyes two pieces of smoldering coal shouts now echoed all around jesus clay blurted beside her the horse reared up neighing threateningly then crashed back hooves dancing on the planking it was haltered but the rope end was frayed men ran in circles waving arms trying to corral the stallion back down the hatch it refused to budge kicking out with a hoof butting with its head or snapping with its teeth safia knew the horse was one of four stalled belowtwo stallions two maresall headed to the royal stud farm outside salalah someone must have been careless in securing the animal fixed at the rail safia watched the crew battle the stallion someone had freed a length of rope and attempted to lasso the horse the roper earned himself a broken foot hopping backward with a sharp cry the stallion crashed through a tangle of rigging ripping bodily through a line of electric lights struck the deck glass bulbs popped and shattered new shouts arose finally a rifle appeared in one of the sailors hands the stallions rampage risked life and damage to the ship la no a flash of bare skin drew safias eye in the other direction amid the clothed sailors a halfnaked figure ran from a foredeck door wearing only a pair of boxers painter stood out like some wild savage his hair was a mess as though he had just woken the cries and crashing of the horse had plainly roused him from his cabin he snatched a tarp from atop a coil of rope and sprinted barefoot through the others wara he shouted in arabic get back clearing the ring of sailors painter fluttered the tarp the motion caught the attention of the stallion it reared up and pounded back down a threatening warning stance but its coal black eyes remained fixed on the tarp and man a matador and a bull yeahh painter yelled waving an arm the stallion backed a step lowering its head the american swept forwardnot straight at the horse but to its side he tossed the tarp over the horses head covering it completely the stallion bucked once thrashed its head but the drape of tarp was too large for the beast to shake free the horse settled back to the planks and stood still blinded by the tarp unsure it shivered sweat gleaming in the moonlight painter kept a step away he spoke too softly for safia to hear but she recognized the tone shed heard it on the airplane simple reassurance finally he walked cautiously forward and placed a palm on the stallions heaving side the horse nickered and tossed its head but more gently this time moving closer painter patted the stallions neck continuing to murmur with his other hand he reached to the frayed rope attached to the halter slowly he guided the stallion around unable to see the horse responded to the familiar signals having to trust the man at the end of the rope safia watched him painters skin gleamed as much as the horses flank he combed a hand through his hair was there a tremble in the gesture he spoke to one of the sailors who nodded the sailor led him down into the hold horse in tow very cool clay said approvingly stamping out his cigarette with the excitement over the crew slowly returned to their duties safia stared around her she noted that most of karas party had gathered on the deck by now painters partner in a belted robe danny in a tshirt and shorts kara and omaha hadnt changed their clothes they must have still been going over lastminute arrangements at their shoulders stood four tall hardlooking men dressed in military fatigues safia did not recognize them from the hatch painter returned rolling the tarp in his hands a small cheer rose from the crew a few palms slapped his back he winced from the attention and ran a hand again through his hair a gesture of modesty safia found herself crossing to him well done she said as she reached painter if theyd had to shoot the horse i couldnt let that happen it was just spooked kara appeared arms crossed over her chest her face was unreadable but missing its usual scowl that was the sultans champion stud what happened here will reach his ears youve just made yourself a good friend painter shrugged i did it for the welfare of the horse omaha stood at karas shoulder his face reddened plainly irritated where did you learn that horsemanship tonto omaha safia warned painter ignored the insult claremont stables in new york city i cleaned stalls when i was a kid the man finally seemed to note his undressed state staring down at himself i should be getting back to my cabin kara spoke up stiffly dr crowe before you retire id appreciate your stopping by my cabin id like to go over the itinerary once we reach port his eyes widened in surprise at the offer certainly it was karas first sign of cooperation safia was not surprised she knew of karas deep affection for horses a tenderness that she felt for no man kara had been a champion rider in dressage painters timely intervention to protect the stallion had won him more than just the sultans appreciation painter nodded to safia his eyes glinting in the lantern light she found her breath catching before she could choke out a goodnight he departed passing through the four men standing behind kara others slowly followed dispersing to their respective cabins omaha remained at safias side kara turned and spoke in arabic to one of the men a tall blackhaired fellow wearing an omani shamag headcloth and military khakis bedouin all were outfitted similarly safia noted the sidearms holstered at their belts the man bending an ear to kara also bore a curved dagger tucked into his belt it was not a ceremonial knife but a wicked weapon that looked like it had been well used clearly he was the leader distinguished from his men by a pale ropy scar across this throat he nodded at whatever kara said then spoke to his men the group marched off who was that safia asked captain alhaffi kara said from the omani military border patrol desert phantoms omaha mumbled using the border patrols nickname the phantoms were the special forces of oman they waged an ongoing war with smugglers and drug runners in the deep desert spending years out in the sands there were no harder men in all the world british and american special forces teams were taught desert warfare and survival by exphantoms kara spoke he and his squad have volunteered as bodyguards for the expedition with the permission of sultan qaboos safia watched the men head below omaha stretched and yawned im off to crash for a few hours before sunrise he glanced back at safia his eyes were hooded under his brows you should try to get some sleep we have a long day ahead of us safia shrugged noncommittal she hated to agree with him on even such a simple suggestion his gaze fell from her for the first time she noted the passing of years on his face deeper and longer sun crinkles at the corners of his eyes a bruising under them he bore a few more threadlike scars she could not deny his rugged handsomeness sandy blond hair hard planes to his face dusky blue eyes but the boyish charm had faded he looked tired now sunbleached stillsomething stirred inside her as his eyes fell away an old ache that was as familiar as it was warm as he turned away she caught a hint of his musky scent a reminder of the man who once lay beside her snoring in a tent she had to force herself not to reach out to him to hold him back a moment longer but what was the use they had no words left between them just uncomfortable silences he left she turned to find kara staring at her kara shook her head let the dead rest in peace am the videomonitor displayed the dive team cassandra hunched at the screen as if trying to hear over the whine of the hydrofoils engines the feed came from the teams submersible the argus five miles away and sunk to twenty fathoms the argus was designed with two chambers aft housed the vessels pilot and copilot the stern chamber filling now with seawater held the two assault divers as the water swamped over the two men equalizing pressure inside and out the stern canopy opened like a clamshell the two divers pushed out into the waters illuminated by the subs lights strapped to each of their waists hung maneuvering pulse jets the darpaengineered devices were capable of propelling the divers to astounding speeds slung below them in pocket nets the pair dragged an arsenal of demolition gear tinny words whispered in her ear sonar contact established on target the pilot of the argus reported deploying force team estimate contact in seven minutes very good she answered under her breath then sensing someone at her shoulder she glanced back it was john kane she held up a hand mine deployment at zero two hundred the pilot finished roger that cassandra said repeating the time and signing off she straightened and turned kane lifted a satellite phone scrambled line your ears only cassandra accepted the phone your ears only that could mean one of her superiors by now they would have received the report on her failure in muscat she had left out the details of the strange bedouin woman who had vanished her report had been damning enough for a second time she had failed to secure the artifact a mechanical voice answered synthesized for anonymity though its inflection and tone were masked she knew who spoke the head of the guild simply codenamed the minister as in prime minister it seemed a foolish precaution cartoonish but the guild patterned its organization on terrorist cells information passed among teams on a needtoknow basis each under independent authority accountable only to the upper echelon she had never met the minister only three people ever had the three lieutenants who ran the overseers board she hoped to gain such a position someday gray leader the eerily synthesized voice said using her op designation mission parameters have been changed cassandra stiffened she had the time schedule tattooed in her head nothing would go wrong the shabab s diesel engines would be blown signaling a strafing run by the jet ski gunboats an assault team would follow mopping up cutting off communication once the iron heart was in hand the ship would be blasted apart and sunk sir deployments under way everythings in motion improvise the mechanical voice intoned secure the museum curator along with the artifact is that understood cassandra bit back her surprise it was not a simple request the original objectiveacquiring the iron artifactrequired no parameters for preserving the lives of those on board the shabab oman as planned it was a brutal grab and run blunt bloody and swift she already began revising in her head may i ask why we need the curator she may prove useful to stage two our original expert in arabian antiquity has provenuncooperative and expediency is paramount to success if we hope to discover and secure the source of this power delay equals defeat we must not waste the talent conveniently at hand yes sir report when youre successful a hint of threat lingered in these last words as the line went dead she lowered the phone john kane waited a few steps away cassandra turned to him change of plans alert your men were going in first ourselves she stared beyond the window of the hydrofoils bridge off in the distance the lanternrigged sailing ship shone like a scatter of fiery jewels on the dark seas when do we deploy now am painter knockedon the cabin door he knew the layout of the rooms beyond the ornately carved scottish oak door it was the presidential suite reserved for potentates and magnates of industry and now the domicile of lady kara kensington upon boarding the ship earlier painter had downloaded information and schematics on the shabab oman best to know the lay of the landeven if it was at sea a cabin steward opened the door the older man standing just shy of five feet carried himself with the dignity of a much taller man he was dressed all in white from small brimless cap to sandals dr crowe he greeted with a small bow of his head lady kensington has been expecting you the man turned from the door motioning him to follow past the antechamber painter was led to the main living space the wide room was decorated simply but elegantly a large antique moroccan desk marked off a study lined with barrister bookshelves the center of the room contained a pair of overstuffed sofas upholstered in british royal navy blue flanked by a pair of highbacked chairs pillowed in omani fashion striped in red green and white the colors of the omani flag in all the room held a mix of british and omani appointments acknowledgment of their shared histories still the most dramatic feature of the room was the wide row of windows that overlooked the dark ocean kara stood framed against the backdrop of the starry sky and moonlit waters she had changed out of her clothes into a thick cotton robe her feet were bare she turned as he entered catching his reflection in the window that will be all yanni she said dismissing the steward once hed vacated the suite she raised a hand vaguely pointing at the sofa id offer you a nightcap but this bloody boats as dry as all arabia painter crossed and settled in the seat as kara shifted to one of the chairs and sat down not a problem i dont drink myself aa she asked personal preference he said with a deep frown it seemed the stereotype of the drunken indian persisted even in britainnot that it didnt have some truth his own father had found more solace within a bottle of jack daniels than in family and friends she shrugged painter cleared his throat you mentioned updating me on the itinerary itll be printed up and under your door before sunrise one eye narrowed then why the latenight meeting he found himself staring at her bare ankles as she crossed her legs had she asked him up here for more personal reasons he knew from his briefing that kara kensington went through men as often as she changed hairstyles safia she said simply surprising him painter blinked back up at her i can tell by the way she looks at you there was a long pause shes more fragile than she appears and tougher than you all think she is he added to himself if youre using her then youd best find some forgotten corner of the world to hide in afterward if its just sex youd best keep your pants zipped or youll be missing a significant part of your anatomy so which is it painter shook his head for the second time in a matter of hours he was being questioned about his affection for safia first by his partner now by this woman its neither he said more harshly than he intended then explain it painter kept his face unreadable he could not dismiss kara as easily as he had coral earlier in fact his mission would fare better with her cooperation than with her present hostility but he remained silent he couldnt even come up with a good lie the best lies were those closest to the truthbut what was the truth how did he feel about safia for the first time he considered it more fully without a doubt he found safia attractive her emerald eyes her coffeesmooth skin the way even a shy smile lit up her face but he had encountered many beautiful women over the course of his life so what was it about this particular woman safia was smart accomplished and there was certainly a strength in her to which the others seemed blind a core of granite that could not be broken yet as he looked back cassandra had been just as strong resourceful and beautiful and it had taken him years to respond to her so what was it about safia that should stir him so quickly he had a suspicion but one he was reluctant to admiteven to himself staring toward the ships windows painter pictured safias eyes the soft wound behind the emerald shine he remembered her arms around his shoulders as she was lowered down from the museum roof squeezing tight to him the whisper of relief the tears even then there had been something about her that begged the hand to touch something that called to the man in him unlike cassandra safia was not just granite she was a well of strength and vulnerability the hard and the soft deep in his heart he knew it was this contradiction that fascinated him more than anything else something he wanted to explore in more depth well kara pressed after his long silence he was saved from answering by the first explosion am omaha awokewith thunder in his ears he sat up startled feeling the vibration in his gut hearing the rattle of the tiny porthole window he had known they were headed into a squall he checked his watch less than ten minutes had passed too soon for the storm danny slipped from the upper bunk landing in a tumble catching himself with one hand hiking up his boxers with the other damn what was that the chatter of gunfire erupted over their heads shouts followed omaha threw back his covers they had sailed into a storm all rightjust not the one predicted by any weatherman were under attack danny grabbed his eyeglasses from the top drawer of a small desk whos attacking why how the hell should i know omaha leaped to his feet and pulled a shirt over his head feeling less exposed he cursed himself for leaving his shotgun and pistols crated in the hold he knew how treacherous the arabian seas could be plied by modernday pirates and paramilitary factions tied to terrorist organizations it seemed the high seas were still ripe with bounty to plunder but he had never suspected anyone would attack the flagship of the omani navy omaha creaked the door open an inch and peered out into the dark passageway a single wall sconce cast a pool of light near the stairwell that led to the upper two levels and the open deck as usual kara had assigned omaha and his brother the worst berths one floor above the bilge a crew cabin versus the more luxurious passenger accommodations across the passage another door peeked open omaha and his brother were not the only ones granted the lowliest cabins crowe he called out the far door pushed wider to reveal crowes partner instead coral novak crept out barefoot in sweatpants and a sports bra her white blond hair loose past her shoulders she waved him silent she carried a dagger in her right hand a wicked length of polished stainless steel with a black carbonized handle military design she held it low deadly steady even with the barrage of gunfire breaking out in spats above their heads she was alone wheres crowe he hissed she cocked a thumb up gone to meet kara twenty minutes ago where the gunfire seemed to concentrate omaha added fear narrowed his vision as he stared toward the stairs safia and her student had private cabins below karas suite both close to the fighting his heart clutched with every burst of rifle fire he had to get to her he stepped toward the stairway a new spate of gunplay erupted sounding from the top of the stairs booted footsteps pounded coming their way weapons coral whispered omaha turned and showed his empty palms they had been forced to abandon all personal arms before boarding the ship she scowled and hurried to the foot of the narrow stairs she used the hilt of her knife to shatter the single bulb that lit the corridor darkness fell the footsteps rushed toward them a shadow appeared first coral seemed to read something in the shadow subtly changing her position widening her stance lowering her arm a dark figure stumbled down the last of the stairs coral kicked out a leg cracking the man in the knee he fell headlong into the corridor with a cry it was only one of the crew the ships galley cook his face struck the planks with a crack snapping his head back he groaned but lay still stunned dazed coral crouched over him with her knife unsure spatters of gunfire continued above but only sporadically now sounding more deadly purposeful omaha pushed forward eyeing the stairs we have to get to the others to safia coral stood up and blocked him with an arm we need weapons a rifle blast sounded above loud in the tight space everyone took a step back coral met omahas eye he stared up caught between rushing to safias rooms and proceeding cautiously caution was not at the top of his core values still the woman was right fists against bullets was not a good rescue plan he swung around there are rifles and ammo stored in the hold he said and pointed to the floor hatch that led down into the bilge compartment we should be able to crawl through there and get to the main hold coral tightened her grip on her knife and nodded they crossed to the hatch threw it open and climbed down the short ladder to the lowceilinged bilge it smelled of algae salt and oak resins omaha was the last through a fresh barrage of gunfire erupted punctuated by a sharp scream a man not a woman still omaha cringed and prayed for safia to keep her head low hating himself he closed the hatch darkness fell over them blind he dropped down the short ladder landing with a tiny splash in the bilge anyone bring a flashlight he asked no one answered great omaha muttered just great something scurried over his foot and disappeared with the sound of tiny splashes rats am painter leanedout one of the ships windows a twoman jet ski buzzed below sweeping under the overhang of the protruding forecastle it fled past with barely a whine exhaust muffled leaving a vshaped wake across the waves even in the darkness he recognized the design darpaengineered experimental prototype for covert ops the pilot crouched low behind the windshield his passenger sat higher manning a swivelmounted assault rifle in the rear gyroscopically stabilized both men wore nightvision goggles the patrol whined past so far he counted four probably more circling outward across the dark sea he saw no evidence of the main attack ship the one that had surely offloaded the assault team most likely it had moored to one of the ships flanks then raced away afterward maintaining a safe distance until it was time to recollect the team he ducked back inside kara crouched behind a sofa looking more angry than scared as soon as the first explosion rocked the ship painter had checked outside the cabin through the deck hatch hed spotted a curl of smoke and an ominous crimson glow from the back of the ship an incendiary grenade even that brief glimpse almost got him killed a man in black camouflage gear suddenly appeared in the doorway steps away painter ducked back inside as the man strafed the opening if it hadnt been for the metal reinforcement of the presidential suite door painter wouldve been chopped in half after bolting the door he gave kara his assessment they took out the radio room who dont knowparamilitary group from the looks of them painter abandoned his post by the window and crouched beside kara he knew with certainty who led the team there was no doubt cassandra the jet skis were stolen darpa prototypes she had to be out there somewhere possibly even on board leading the assault team he pictured the determined glint in cassandras eyes the double furrow between her brows as she concentrated he shoved this thought away surprised by the sudden pang something between fury and loss what are we going to do kara asked stay putfor now barricaded in the presidential suite the two of them were safe from immediate harm but the others were at risk the omani sailors had been trained well responding quickly to the threat putting up a fierce firefight but the sailors aboard the ship were mostly young only moderately armed and cassandra would know all their weaknesses the ship would soon be hers but was that her goal painter crouched beside kara he closed his eyes and took a deep breath he needed a moment to stop reacting and to think to concentrate his father had taught him a few pequot chants his weak attempt to imbue his one son with tribal tradition usually done while his breath reeked of tequila and beer still painter had learned the chants whispering them in the dark when his parents fought yelling cursing in the neighboring room he found comfort and focus in the repetition not knowing the meaningthen or now his lips moved silently meditatively he shut out the spates of gunfire again he pictured cassandra he could guess the purpose of her attack to obtain what she had been after from the start the iron heart the only solid clue to the mystery of the antimatter explosion it still lay in the curators cabin his mind ran along various attack scenarios mission parameters in midchant it struck him he bolted back to his feet from the start he had been nagged by the sloppiness of the assault why blow up the radio room and alert the crew prematurely if it was an ordinary mercenary group he could blame the lack of planning and precision on inexperience but if cassandra was behind it a sinking feeling hollowed out his gut what kara asked pushing up with him the gunfire beyond the cabin had gone deathly quiet in the silence he heard a telltale whine he crossed to the window and ducked his head out four jet skis came sweeping in out of the darknessbut each was manned only by the pilot no passengers the rear assault seats were empty damn it what kara asked again fear entering her voice were too late he knew with certainty that the grenade explosion hadnt marked the start of the mission but its end he silently cursed his stupidity this was all the endgame and he hadnt even been playing he had been caught totally off guard he allowed himself this moment of anger then focused on the situation an endgame was not necessarily the end itself he stared as the four jet skis swooped toward the boat come to collect the last members of the assault team the rear guard the demolition team assigned to blow the radio shack one of the omani sailors must have stumbled upon these men leading to the firefight on the deck more gunfire erupted sounding farther away more determined near the stern of the boat they were attempting to retreat out the window painter watched the last of the jet skis circle wide wary of the gunfire the other jet skis those with men manning the mounted assault rifles were nowhere in sight he also heard no sign of their engagement they were gone along with the point team painter imagined along with the prize but to where again he searched the water for the main assault ship it was out there somewhere but only dark waters lay beyond storm clouds now obliterated both moon and stars turning the world black his fingers clenched on the sill of the wide window as he searched a flicker of light drew his eyenot out across the waters but down below it he leaned farther and stared into the depths deep in the midnight waters a glow glided out from under the ship it slowly slipped off to starboard and floated determinedly away painters brow crinkled he recognized what he saw a submersible why the answer came immediately with the question with the mission over the sub and the main assault team were bugging out all that was left was the cleanup to leave no witnesses he knew the purpose of the subs presence to come in baffled and silent too small to detect theyve mined the ship he said aloud he calculated in his head how long it would take for a sub to clear the blast zone kara said something but he had gone deaf to her painter swung from the window and hurried to the door the firefight seemed to have settled to a stalemate of sporadic shots he listened at the door nothing sounded close he slid back the bolt what are you doing kara asked at his shoulder sticking close but clearly irritated by her own need to do so we must get off this boat he cracked the door open a few steps away lay the opening to the middeck the winds had kicked up as the edge of the coming storm brushed over the shabab oman sails snapped like whips ropes rattled in stanchions he studied the deck reading it like a chessboard the crew had no opportunity to reef and secure the mainsails the omani sailors were pinned down by a pairno three gunmenhidden behind a pile of barrels stacked at the far end of the middeck the masked men had the perfect vantage point to guard the forward sections of the ship one of the pair kept his rifle pointed toward the raised stern deck protecting their rear closer a fourth masked gunman lay sprawled on the deck facedown blood pooled around his head the body only a few steps from painter he took in the situation with a glance similarly ensconced behind crates on this side of the middeck were the four omani borderpatrol agents the desert phantoms they lay on their bellies rifles pointed toward the gunmen it was a standoff it must have been the phantoms who had waylaid the assault teams rear guard pinned them down kept them from escaping over rails cmon painter said and took kara by the elbow he dragged her out the suites door and toward the lower stairs wherere we going she asked what about getting off the boat he didnt answer he was too late but he had to be sure he clambered down the stairs to the next landing a short passage led to the guest quarters in the middle of the hall bathed in the light from the single overhead lamp a body draped across the floor facedown like the masked man above but this was not one of the attackers he wore only boxers and a white tshirt a tiny dark stain marred the center of his back shot from behind as he attempted to flee its clay kara mumbled in shock hurrying forward with painter she knelt near the boys body but painter stepped over him he had no time for mourning he hurried to the door toward which the graduate student had been heading seeking a place to hide or to warn others too late theyd all been too late painter stopped outside the door it was cracked half open lamplight flowed into the hall painter listened intently silence he steeled himself against what he would find kara called to him knowing what he feared safia am omaha shovedout an arm as the ship rolled beneath him the darkness of the bilge threw off his sense of balance water sloshed over his shoes chilling his ankles a crash sounded behind himand a curse danny was faring no better do you know where youre going coral asked omaha her voice frosty echoing a bit in the dank bilge yes he snapped back it was a lie he kept trailing one hand along the sloped wall to the left praying hed find a ladder leading back up the next one should lead to the main storage hold under the middeck or so he hoped they continued in silence rats squeaked in sharp protest sounding larger in the darkness as big as wet bulldogs their numbers multiplied in the imagination omaha heard their bodies splashing through the bilge waters running ahead of them likely piling into an angry mass at the stern of the ship in an alley in calcutta he had seen a ratgnawed corpse the eyes gone the genitals eaten away all soft places gnashed he did not like rats but fear for safia drove him onward his anxiety heightened by the darkness the spates of gunfire bloody images flashed across his minds eye too terrible to dwell upon why had he put off telling her how he still felt about her he would gladly drop on his knees now to have her safe and sound his outstretched hand struck something solid he reached out and discovered rungs and nail heads a ladder here it is he said with more confidence than he felt he didnt care if he was right or wrong or where the hell the ladder led he was climbing out as danny and coral moved closer he mounted the rungs be careful coral warned the gunfire continued above close that was warning enough reaching the topmost rung he searched until he found the inner handle to the hatch praying it wasnt locked or weighted down with cargo he shoved up the hatch flew open with ease swinging back and crashing against a wooden support pillar coral hissed at him no words just protest blessed light flowed over him blindingly bright after the gloom below the smell was also refreshing after the salt and mold of the ships bilge freshcut hay a large shadow shifted to his right he turned and found himself facing a huge horse looming over him the same arabian stallion that had broken free earlier it threw its head and huffed at him eyes white with terror it raised a hoof in threat ready to stamp out the sudden intruder into its shipboard stables omaha ducked back cursing their luck the bilge hatch had opened into the stallions stall he spotted other horses in neighboring stanchions he turned his attention to the stallion the horse tugged at the lead tethering him in place the spooked arabian was better than any armed guard but they had to get out and reach the crated weapons in the neighboring hold fear for safia fired his blood he had come this far trusting the ropes held the horse he dove out of the hatch rolled flat across the planks and passed under the fence that closed off the stall gaining his feet he dusted off his bare knees move quick he found a horse blanket brightly colored in reds and yellows he waved it at the stallion keeping it distracted so the others could climb to safety the horse whinnied at his motions but rather than growing more perturbed at the additional intruders the stallion pulled at the ropes that secured it drawn to the saddle blanket omaha realized it must recognize its own blanket a promising sign that someone was about to take it for a ride to let it out of the stalls alarm heightened the stallions desire to break free with regret he lowered the blanket back over the fence once danny and coral reached his side the stallions large eyes met his scared full of the need for reassurance where are the guns coral asked omaha turned from the stall should be over there he pointed past the ramp that led to the upper deck a stack of crates three high stood along the back wall a kensington crest marked each one as omaha led them across the hold he kept his head low with each new burst of gunfire a repeated exchange of gunfire a volley back and forth the deadly match sounded like it was coming from outside the double doors at the top of the ramp he remembered dannys earlier question who was attacking this was no mere band of pirates this was too sustained too organized too damn bold reaching the crates he searched the stapled manifests having organized the supplies himself he knew there should be a crate of rifles and handguns he found the right box using a crowbar he broke it open danny took out one of the rifles what are we going to do youre going to stay low omaha said grabbing a desert eagle pistol what about you danny asked omaha cocked an ear to the fighting as he loaded the pistol on the floor i have to get to the others make sure theyre safe but in truth he pictured only safia smiling younger he had failed her beforenot again coral finally rose from her own search of the crates contents with a single pistol she quickly and efficiently loaded its magazine with rounds then slammed it home armed now she seemed more relaxed a lioness loosened up and ready for the hunt she met his eyes we should return forward through the bilge join the others from there more gunfire spat just outside the double doors wed lose too much time omaha glanced to the ramp that led directly to the heart of the gunfire there may be another way coral frowned at him as he outlined his plan youve got to be kidding danny muttered but coral nodded as omaha finished its worth a shot then lets go he said before were too late storm surge december am arabian sea they weretoo late painter approached the open door to safias cabin a lamp glowed from within despite the urgency the certain knowledge that the ship had been mined he hesitated a breath behind him kara remained with clay bishops body painter feared finding safia in the same condition dead on the floor but knew he had to face the truth she had trusted him the deaths were all his fault hed not been vigilant enough the mission had taken place under his nose on his watch standing to the side he pushed the door wider unblinking he searched the cabin empty disbelieving he stepped cautiously over the threshold a scent of jasmine lingered in the room but that was all that was left of the woman who had once occupied it there was no sign of violence yet the metal suitcase that housed the museum artifact was nowhere in sight he stood momentarily paralyzed between concern and confusion a moan sounded behind him he turned clays still alive kara called from the passageway painter stumbled back into the hall kara knelt over the young mans body she held something pinched between her fingers i found this in his back as he crossed to her painter noted the boys chest moving shallowly up and down how had he missed that but he knew the answer he had been too rushed too certain of their doom kara offered what she held a small bloody dart tranquilizer he confirmed he glanced back toward the open doorway tranquilizers so they had wanted safia alive this was all a kidnapping he shook his head biting back a laughhalf in appreciation for cassandras cleverness half in relief safia was still alive for now we cant leave him kara said he nodded picturing the glow of the submersible in the dark waters waking again to the urgency how much time did they have stay with him where are he didnt explain he rushed down to the lower deck and searched the rooms for the other members of the party the dunn brothers and his partner like safias room their cabins were empty were they all taken below he discovered a cowering crewman one of the galley workers with a bloody nose he tried to encourage the man to follow him back up but fright kept the fellow paralyzed painter did not have time to persuade him and pounded back up the stairs kara had managed to get the student to sit up he was groggy head lolling unintelligible words mumbled from his mouth cmon painter scooped clay under one arm drawing him to his feet it was like maneuvering a wet sack of cement kara collected his eyeglasses from the floor where are we going we have to get off this ship what about the others theyre all gone safia and the others painter led the way up the stairs as they reached the last landing a figure swept down toward them he spoke rapidly in arabic too fast for painter to follow captain alhaffi kara said quickly in introduction painter had intel on the man he was the leader of the desert phantoms we need more ammunition from the stockpiles in the hold the captain said rapidly you must all go into hiding painter blocked him how long can you last with what you have a shrug minutes only you must keep them pinned down they mustnt leave the ship painter thought quickly he imagined the only reason the shabab oman hadnt been blasted apart already was that the demolition team was still on board once they were gone nothing would stop cassandra from detonating the mines painter spotted a slumped form by the doorway it was one of the masked gunmen the one he had seen sprawled on the deck he lowered clay to the floor and crept next to the man perhaps he could find something on the gunman that would help a radio or something captain alhaffi joined him i dragged him back here hoping he had extra ammunition on him or a grenade he said this last with thick bitterness a single grenade would have ended the stalemate on the deck painter patted the body down ripping away the mask the man wore a subvocalizing radio he tugged it free and pushed the earpiece in place nothing not even static the team had gone silent as he searched further he pocketed the mans nightvision gear and discovered a thick strap around the mans chest an ekg monitor damn it what kara asked lucky you never discovered that grenade he said the men are rigged with status monitors killing them would be as good as letting them escape once theyre goneoverboard or deadthe others will blow the ship blow the ship alhaffi repeated eyes narrowing speaking english painter quickly explained what he had spied and the implication we must get off this ship before the rear guard does i saw a motorized skiff stowed behind the stern its the ships gig the captain confirmed painter nodded an aluminum runabout but the infidels stand between us and the launch alhaffi argued we could perhaps try to go under them through the ships bowels but once my men stop shooting the others will escape painter abandoned his search of the gunman and peered outside the doorway to the open deck the firefight had slowed both sides running low on ammunition needing to make each round count the phantoms were at a disadvantage they couldnt let the gunmen escapebut neither could they kill them another form of stalemate or was it he swung around having a sudden idea before he could speak a thunderous crash erupted from the aft deck he glanced back outside the lower holds hatch had been thrown violently open shoved under the weight of a trio of horses the arabians galloped and bucked out onto the windy deck smashing into crates and tangling through rigging chaos ensued lights shattered night fell darker across the ship one of the horses a mare trampled directly through the gunmens barricade shots were fired a horse screamed amid the confusion a fourth horse appeared from the hold galloping under a head of steam the white arabian stallion it flew up the lower ramp and onto the deck hooves pounding the planks but this time it was not wild and unguided astride the stallions back omaha rose from the saddle pistols in both hands he aimed toward the nearest masked men and fired both guns emptying them without mercy at almost pointblank range two men fell as he rode past no painter called out pushing out the door the barrage deafened his words movement by the aft hatch revealed coral sneaking into a snipers post she had a rifle on her shoulder she took aim at the only standing gunman the man dove for the starboard rail intending to leap overboard a single rifle blast exploded with a muzzle flash the gunman jolted in midair as if kicked by a phantom horse the left side of his head exploded away his body slid across the deck coming to rest against the rails painter bit back a groan the stalemate had finally ended with the rear guard dead nothing would stop cassandra from blowing the ship am cassandra checkedher watch as she climbed from the zodiac pontoon boat and back aboard the hovercraft the mission timetable was behind by ten minutes clambering onto the deck she was met by her second john kane crossed to her he barked for two men to help haul the prone form of the museum curator aboard the seas were getting choppy as the winds kicked up making climbing aboard an exercise in balance and timing cassandra dragged up the suitcase with the artifact despite the setback they had completed their mission kane stepped to her side he was more shadow than man dressed in black from boots to a knit black cap the argus radioed their all clear eight minutes ago they await your order to detonate the mines what about the demolition team cassandra had heard the firefight aboard the shabab while she was racing back sporadic gunfire had echoed over the waters but for the past minute there had been only silence he shook his head status monitors just went tits up dead cassandra pictured the mens faces skilled mercenaries footfalls pounded across the deck from the pilothouse captain sanchez it was the teams radioman he skidded to a stop on the slick surface were picking up the signals again all three from the demolition squad cassandra glanced across the sea as if noting her attention a new barrage of gunfire erupted from the shabab oman she glanced to kane who shrugged we lost contact a short time the radioman reported maybe interference from the storm but the signals back strong and solid cassandra continued to stare across the seas toward the lights of the other ship her eyes narrowed picturing the men again kane stood at her shoulder orders she glared across the seas as a stiff rain began to pelt the deck she barely felt its sting on her cheek detonate the mines the radioman startled but knew better than to question he glanced at kane who nodded the man clenched a fist and ran back toward the pilothouse cassandra rankled at the delay in snapping to her orders she had noted the radioman seeking confirmation from her second though cassandra had been assigned to lead this operation these were kanes men and she had just condemned three of them to death though kanes face remained stoic his eyes glass she elaborated theyre already dead she said the new signal is false kanes brows drew together how can you be so she cut him off because painter crowe is over there am crouched withthe others painter checked the straps snugged around the bare chests of omaha and danny the dead mens heart monitors seemed to be functioning fine the device on his own chest blinked regularly transmitting his pulse to the hidden assault ship out there danny wiped the rain from his glasses these things wont electrocute us if they get wet no painter assured him everyone gathered on the stern deck kara the dunn brothers coral clay had been revived enough to stand but the steep rolling of the ship in the higher seas kept him weaving and needing support steps away the four omani border patrol fired off rifles periodically mimicking a continued standoff he didnt know how long the ruse would hold hopefully long enough for them to abandon ship captain alhaffi had rallied the crew the ships motorized launch had been untied and was ready for boarding the other lifeboat was being swung out ready to drop the fifteenman crew was now ten with no time to spare the dead would have to be left behind painter watched the evergrowing seas from a shadowy vantage not wanting to be spotted by the patrolling jet skis waves had climbed to twelve feet winds snapped sails while rain swept in bursts over the deck the aluminum launch knocked against the stern as it hung free now and the full brunt of squall had yet to strike painter spotted one of the black jet skis fly over a tall wave hang in the air then race down the far face he instinctively ducked lower but there was no need the pilot of the jet ski was angling away painter stood the jet ski was heading away she knows painter spun around to the boats he screamed now am safia wokeout of blackness to the crack of thunder cold rain spattered her face she was on her back soaked to the skin she sat up the world spun voices legs another burst of thunder she cringed at the noise sinking back she felt rocking heaving im on a boat tranqs wearing off someone said behind her get her below safias head rolled to stare at the speaker a woman she stood a yard away staring across the seas some strange scope fixed to her face she was dressed in black wore her long ebony hair braided away from her face she knew the woman memory came flooding back a shout from clay followed by a knock at her door clay she had refused to answer sensing something wrong she had spent too many years at the edge of panic not to have built up a thick layer of paranoia but it made no difference the lock was picked as easily as if they had a key the woman standing before her now had been the first through the door something had stung safias neck she reached fingers now and felt a tender spot below the angle of her chin she had scrambled to the far side of the cabin choking panic narrowing her vision to a laser point then even this sight vanished she had felt herself slumping but never felt herself hit the floor the world had slipped away get her some dry clothes the woman said again with shock safia recognized the voice the disdain the sharp consonant strikes the rooftop of the british museum tell me the combination it was the thief from london safia shook her head she was in a waking nightmare before she could respond two men hauled her to her feet she tried to find her legs but her toes slipped on the wet deck her knees were warm butter even holding her chin up took all her will safia stared beyond the metal rail of the boat the storm had struck seas rose and fell in dark hummocks like the backs of whales slick and smooth a few whitecaps flashed silver in the meager light but what drew her eye kept her head strained up was the fiery ruin a short distance away all strength left her a ship burned atop the rough seas masts now torches sailcloth fanned out in swirls of fiery ash carried by the gusting winds the hull lay gutted all around bits of flaming flotsam decorated the seas like so many campfires she knew the ship the shabab oman all air squeezed from her lungs she strangled between a scream and despair the roll of the seas suddenly sickened her she vomited across the deck splattering the shoes of her guards fucking christ man one of them cursed yanking her cruelly still safias eyes remained fixed across the sea her throat burned not againnot everyone i love but a part of her knew she deserved this pain this loss since tel aviv she had expected everything would be taken from her life was cruelty and sudden tragedy there was no permanence no safety tears ran hotly down her cheeks safia stared at the fiery ruin of the shabab oman she held little hope of survivorsand even this hope was dashed with her captors next words send back the patrol the woman said kill anything that moves am painter wipedthe blood from the cut above his left eye he kicked his feet to keep himself above water as the seas heaved up and down rain fell heavily out of low skies flashing with lightning thunder grumbled he glanced back to the overturned launch as it rose and fell in sync with him around his waist a length of towline secured him to the skiffs bow immediately around him the seas remained dark as if he were floating in oil but farther out fires sputtered in the rolling seas appearing and disappearing and in the center the fiery bulk of the shabab oman loomed half sunk burning down to the waterline swiping blood and rain from his eyes painter searched the waters for any threat a vague worry about sharks fluttered across his mind especially with the blood he hoped the squall would keep such predators deep but painter watched for other predators he didnt have long to wait lit by the many fires a jet ski hoved into view circling wide painter reached up and slipped the nightvision goggles over his eyes he sank lower minimizing his silhouette the world dissolved to greens and whites fires appeared as blindingly bright glows while the seas took on a silvery aquamarine sheen he focused on the jet ski through the scope the ski now shone starkly its shaded headlamp as bright as the fires he toggled the magnification feature a pilot hunched in front behind him his passenger manned the mounted assault rifle capable of firing a hundred rounds a minute with the goggles in place painter easily spotted two other jet skis circling the debris field they were starting wide and circling inward somewhere beyond the bulk of the fiery ship the rattle of gunfire erupted a scream accompanied it but it ended immediately the gunfire did not the purpose of these scavengers was plain no survivors no witnesses painter swam back to his overturned launch a cork in the rough seas once near the skiff he dove down and under it the nightvision goggles were watertight it was strange how bright the seas were through the scope he spotted the many legs dangling from beneath the capsized skiff maneuvering up through them he surfaced under the runabout even with the nightvision scope details were blurry figures clung to gunwales and bolted aluminum seats eight in all hidden beneath the launch the air had already staled with their fear kara and the dunn brothers helped keep clay bishop in place the grad student seemed mostly recovered captain alhaffi took a position near the launchs windshield like his two men he had stripped out of his desert cloak and wore only a loincloth the fate of the fourth phantom remained unknown the explosion had occurred just as the launch had hit the water the concussive force had tossed them away toppling the small runabout all bore minor injuries afterward amid the confusion painter and coral had herded the others under the launch as debris rained down it also offered good cover from searching eyes coral whispered at his ear did she send a cleanup crew painter nodded well have to hope the storm shortens their search a whine drew nearer waning and ebbing as the launch and its hidden passengers rose and fell with the waves finally the noise sharpened the ski must have angled into the trough with them painter had a bad feeling everyone underwater he warned for a count of thirty he waited to make sure everyone obeyed coral was the last to vanish painter took a deep breath then gunfire rattled against the launchs aluminum side deafening golfballsize hail on a tin roof but it wasnt hail at such close range a few rounds perforated the double hull of the runabout painter dove down a pair of stray bullets sizzled through the water he watched the others holding themselves beneath the skiff arms extended upward hands clutching painter hoped the speed of the bullets would be dulled by the launchs double hull and impact with the water painter watched one of the trajectories slam past his shoulder he held his breath clenched until the barrage stopped then rose up the whine of the jet ski still sounded near thunder caused the aluminum hull to reverberate like a struck bell omaha popped up beside him followed by the others as their need for air overwhelmed them no one spoke they all listened to the nearby puttering engine everyone prepared themselves to dive again if necessary the jet ski whined closer bumping against the side of the skiff if they tried to turn it overused a grenade a large swell lifted the boat and its hidden passengers the jet ski bumped harder jostled by the storm surge a loud curse erupted from outside the engine whined louder and began to pull away we could commandeer that jet ski omaha whispered at him nose to nose the two of us weve still got a couple pistols between us painter frowned at him and then what you dont think theyd miss one of their skis theres a main boat out there something fast theyd be upon us in a heartbeat youre not getting it omaha pressed i wasnt talkin about leaving im talking about taking the damn thing back to where it came from going in undercover to rescue safia painter had to grant the man had balls too bad he didnt have the brains to go with them these arent amateurs he snapped youre going in blind all the advantage is theirs who gives a damn about the odds its safias life were talking about painter shook his head you wouldnt get within a hundred yards of the main boat before you were discovered and blown away omaha refused to back down if you wont go ill take my brother painter made to grab for him but omaha shoved his hand away im not leaving her omaha turned his back and swam to danny painter recognized the pain in the others voice the fury he felt the same safias kidnapping was his fault his responsibility a part of him wanted to lash out to charge in to risk all but it was also a futile course he knew this omaha had his pistol out painter could not stop himbut he knew who could he turned and grabbed another persons arm i care for her he said sharply kara tried to free her arm but painter held tight what are you talking about she asked your question earlierin your cabin i care about safia it was hard to admit aloud but he had no choice but to recognize the truth he did indeed care while maybe it was not lovenot yethe was willing to see where it would lead this surprised him as much as it seemed to surprise kara i do painter pressed and ill get her backbut not this way he nodded toward omaha not his way hes more likely to get her killed shes safe right now safer than we are we need to survive for her sake all of us if theres to be any hope of a real rescue for her kara listened ever the consummate corporate leader she did not delay her decision she swung to omaha put the bloody gun away indiana beyond the aluminum hull the predatory jet ski suddenly screamed its engine dopplering up it was heading off omaha glanced in its directionthen swore and shoved the pistol away well find her painter said but he doubted the other man heard and perhaps it was just as well as much as he had blustered he didnt know if it was a promise he could keep he was still shaken from the assault the defeat from the outset cassandra had been a step ahead of him he needed to clear his head im going to keep watch make sure they leave he dove back down and kicked free of the launch his thoughts remained on cassandras skill at anticipating their moves how had she managed that a worry had seeded in his chest was there a traitor among them am omaha clungto the launchs gunwale rising and falling with the waves he hated waiting in the dark he heard the others breathing no one spoke all remained lost in their own worries his grip tightened on the aluminum frame as the launch climbed another wave taking them all up with it all but one safia why had he listened to painter he should have tried to commandeer the jet ski to hell with what anyone thought pressure built in his throat tightening his breath he clamped it down unsure if he let it loose whether it would come out as a sob or a scream in the dark the past came rolling up out of the depths of the sea he had walked away from her after tel aviv something had died in safia taking all love with it she had retreated to london he had tried to stay with her but his career his passion lay elsewhere each time he returned more and more of her was gone she was wasting away inside he found himself dreading the return to london from the lost corners of the world he felt trapped soon his visits grew fewer and fewer she didnt notice or complain that hurt the most when did it end when did love become dust and sand he couldnt say it was well before he finally admitted defeat and asked for his grandmothers ring back it had been over a long cold dinner neither had spoken both knew their silence said more than his faltering attempt to explain ultimately she had only nodded and removed the ring it came off easily she placed it in his palm then looked into his eyes there was no sorrow only relief thats when he walked away the others stirred as painter splashed up to them he rose among them with a sigh of breath i think were clear theres been no sign of the jet skis for the past ten minutes relief murmured among the others we should strike for shore were too exposed out here in the dark omaha noted the mans slight brooklyn accent he hadnt noticed it before it grated with each word now painters instructions sounded too much like commands military background officer training there are two oars secured in oarlocks on either side of the boat well need them to overturn the launch he sidled among them and showed them how to free the oars omaha found one oar shoved into his hand well need to split into two groups one group to heave weight down on the port side the others to use the oars to prop up the starboard we should be able to flip it but first im going to detach the outboard it was strafed shot and nows leaking oil after a final few coordinations everyone ducked down and out rain spattered out of the dark skies the winds had died to faltering gusts after the time hed spent hiding under the launch the night seemed brighter to omaha lightning flickered among the clouds illuminating patches of ocean a few fires still floated atop the water there was no sign of the shabab oman omaha spun around a bit searching painter swam to the stern of the launch and fought to free the engine omaha considered going to help but instead simply watched the mans struggle with the locking pin after a few tugs painter finally freed the engine it dropped into the sea his eyes found omaha lets get this baby flipped it wasnt as easy as painter had described it took four attempts until they put everyone on one side leaning their weight down painter and omaha each armed with an oar levered the starboard side up they also timed the maneuver with the roll of a wave but finally the launch flipped back upright half filled with water they climbed aboard and bailed the craft omaha fit the oars into place its still filling with water kara said as the water level inside the launch began to rise again under all their weight bullet holes danny said feeling through the water keep bailing painter said again with that bite of command well alternate between rowing and bailing its a long haul to shore be warned captain alhaffi said barechested but unabashed the currents here are treacherous we must watch for reefs and rocks painter nodded and waved coral toward the prow omaha stared at the few burning bits of flotsam then back the other way the coast was barely discernible a slightly darker bank of cloud flashes of lightning revealed how far they had drifted painter also stared around the boat but it wasnt sharks or coastline that concerned the worry was plain in the set of his lips somewhere out there lurked the murderous men who had kidnapped safia but did he fear for her safety or his own skin painters earlier words repeated in omahas head i care for herfor safia omaha felt a burst of anger warm the chill from his wet clothes was he lying omaha clenched both fists on the two oars and set his back he began to row painter at the stern glanced over to him cold eyes the glass of the nightvision goggles studied him what did they know about the man he had much to account for much to explain the muscles of omahas jaw ached from clenching too long i care for her as he rowed omaha wasnt sure what made him more angry if the man was lyingor telling the truth am an hourlater painter waded through the waisthigh water dragging the towline over his shoulder the beach stretched silvery before him framed in tumbled rocky cliffs the rest of the coastline was dark except for a few meager lights to the far north a small village the immediate vicinity seemed deserted still he kept a wary eye he had given coral the nightvision goggles to keep a watch from the launch as he continued forward his shoes dug deep into the rocky sand his thighs burned from the effort his shoulders ached from his shift at the oars waves helped push him toward the waiting shore only a little further at least the rain had stopped he leaned his shoulder into the line and hauled the trailing boat toward solid ground behind him danny worked the oars while painter guided the boat around the rocks at last the beach opened up ahead a clear shot pull hard painter called back to danny slack grew in the line as danny obeyed the launch leaped forward with a sweep of oars painter fought the water climbing out of the waves kneedeep he slogged forward and to the side the launch surfed a final wave and passed to painters right he ducked to avoid being hit sorry danny called to him dragging in the oars the boats prow ground into the sand with a screech of aluminum the wave receded leaving the boat beached painter crawled and kicked out of the water gaining his feet the eight men and women clambered from the launch coral helped kara while danny omaha and clay half fell out of the boat only the three desert phantomscaptain alhaffi and his two menremained on their feet scanning the beach painter lumbered farther out of the lapping water sodden limbs heavy he crossed beyond the tide line in the sand winded he turned to see how the others were faring with the launch theyd have to hide the boat drag it somewhere or sink it a shadow loomed behind him he failed to see the raised fist he was struck in the face too weak he simply fell backward onto his rear omaha kara called out painter now recognized his attacker omaha stood over him what are you before painter could finish the man was on him shoving him back into the sand one hand on his throat the other going for another punch you goddamn son of a bitch before the fist could land hands grabbed omahas shoulder shirt he was tugged backward he fought twisting but coral had a fistful of the mans collar she was strong cotton ripped along the neckline painter took the opportunity to scramble backward his left eye wept from the first punch let me go omaha bellowed coral threw him bodily into the sand kara circled to his other side omaha what the hell are you doing he sat up redfaced that bastard knows more than hes been telling us he jerked a thumb at coral him and his amazon sidekick even his brother tried to calm him omaha this isnt the time to be omaha shoved up to his knees panting spittle flying goddamn right its time we followed the bastard this far i want answers before we move one step further he heaved to his feet swaying a bit painter gained his feet with an arm from coral the others all faced them a line drawn in the sand between them kara stood in the center glancing at each group she held up a hand seeming to settle on a side she faced painter you said you had a plan lets start there painter took a deep breath and nodded salalah thats where theyll be taking safia where we have to go next omaha called out how do you know that why are you so sure they could be taking her anywherefor ransom to sell the artifact who the hell knows where i know painter said coolly he let silence stretch before speaking again this was no random raiding party that attacked us they were focused purposeful in their assault they whisked in and grabbed safia and the iron heart they knew what they were going after and who knew the most about it why asked kara clipping some outburst from omaha with a thrust of an arm what do they want painter stepped forward what we wanted some clue to the true location of the lost city of ubar omaha swore under his breath the others simply stared kara shook her head you havent answered my question her tone darkened what do they want what do they seek to gain by finding ubar painter licked his lips this is bullshit omaha growled he shoved past kara fast painter stood his ground holding coral back with a hand signal he would not be punched again omaha lifted his arm metal glinted in the meager light a pistol pointed at painters head youve been yanking our chains long enough answer the womans question what the hells going on omaha kara warned but there was not much energy in her voice coral sidled to the side positioning to go for omahas flank painter again signaled her to hold omaha punched the gun at him harder answer me what goddamn game is going on here who do you really work for painter had no choice but to come clean he needed the groups cooperation if there was to be any hope of stopping cassandra of rescuing safia he would need their help he couldnt do it with coral alone i work for the us department of defense he finally admitted specifically darpa the researchanddevelopment arm of the dod omaha shook his head fucking great the military what does any of this have to do with them were an archaeological expedition kara answered before painter could the explosion at the museum omaha glanced at her then back at painter he nodded shes right it was no ordinary blast residual radiation pointed to an extraordinary possibility all eyes were on him except coral who still had her full attention on omaha and the gun there is a high probability that the exploded meteorite contained some form of antimatter omaha let out an explosive sound of derision as if he had been holding it all along antimatter what a load of bullshit who do you take us for coral spoke at his side matteroffact professional dr dunn he is telling you the truth we tested the blast zone ourselves detecting zbozons and gluons decay particles from an antimattermatter interaction omaha frowned less sure i know it sounds preposterous painter said but if youll lower your gun ill explain omaha steadied the pistol instead so far this is all thats kept you talking painter sighed it was worth the try have it your way then with the gun pointed at his face he gave a brief overview of the tunguska explosion in russia in of the unique gamma radiation found both there and at the british museum of the plasma characteristics of the explosion and how evidence hinted that somewhere out in the deserts of oman lay a possible source of antimatter preserved in some unknown fashion to make it stable and unreactive while in the presence of matter though now it may be destabilizing painter finished that may be why the meteor exploded at the museum and it may happen here too time is critical now may be the only time we can discover and preserve this source of unlimited power kara frowned and what does the united states government plan on doing with such a limitless source of power painter read the suspicion in her eyes safeguard it for now thats the immediate and primary goal to protect it from those who would abuse it if this power should fall into the wrong hands silence lingered as his words died away they all knew borders no longer divided the world so much as ideologies though it was undeclared there was a new world war being waged where fundamental decency and respect for human rights were under assault by forces of intolerance despotism and blind fervor and while its battles were sometimes waged in plain sightin new york city in iraqits greater struggle was carried on invisibly fought in secret its heroes unknown its villains hidden willing or not the group assembled here on the beach had been drafted into this war kara finally spoke and this other group safias kidnappers theyre the same ones who broke into the british museum painter nodded i believe so who are they omaha still held the pistol at him i dont knownot for sure bullshit painter held up a hand all i know for certain is who leads the team a partner i once worked with a mole planted in darpa he was too exhausted to hide his anger her name is cassandra sanchez i never discovered who she worked for a foreign power terrorists a blackmarket group all i know is that they are well funded organized and coldblooded in their methods omaha scoffed and you and your partner are the warm fuzzy types we dont kill innocent people no youre fucking worse he spat you let others do your dirty work you knew we were walking into a possible shitstorm but kept your mouths closed if we had known before now we mightve been better prepared we might have stopped safias abduction painter had no comeback the man was right hed been caught off guard jeopardizing the mission and their lives distracted by his own guilt he failed to respond in time omaha lunged and pressed the pistols barrel against his forehead knocking him back a step you bastardthis is all your fault he heard the pain and anguish in omahas voice the man was beyond reason anger built in painters chest he was cold sore and tired of having a gun waved in his face he didnt know if hed have to take omaha out coral waited tense support came from an unlikely source a thunder of hooves suddenly broke across the beach all eyes turned even omaha he stepped back and finally lowered the gun goddamn he muttered across the sand an amazing sight galloped a white stallion mane flying hooves casting up gouts of sand it was the horse from the shabab oman the stallion raced toward them perhaps drawn by their raised voices it must have swum to shore after the explosion it slammed to a stop a few yards from them huffing white into the cool night air heated it tossed its head i cant believe it got away omaha said horses are excellent swimmers kara scolded but she couldnt keep the awe from her voice one of the desert phantoms slowly approached the horse palm out whispering in arabic it shivered but allowed the approach exhausted frightened needing reassurance the sudden arrival of the horse cut the tension omaha stared down at his gun as if unsure how it had gotten into his fist kara stepped forward and faced painter i think its time we stopped arguing casting blame we all had our reasons for coming out here hidden agendas she glanced back to omaha who would not meet her eye painter could guess the mans agenda it was plain from the way hed been looking at safia his furious anger a moment ago he was still in love from here kara continued we must figure out what were going to do to save safia thats the priority she turned to painter what do we do painter nodded his left eye ached with the motion the others think were dead that gives us an advantage wed best keep we also know where theyre heading we have to reach salalah as quickly as possible that means crossing almost three hundred miles kara stared toward the lights of the distant village if i could reach a phone im sure i could get the sultan to no he cut her off no one must know were alive not even the omani government any word anywhere that were still alive jeopardizes our thin advantage cassandras group managed to abduct safia through their advantage of surprise we can win her back the same way but with the sultans help salalah could be locked down and searched cassandras group has already proven too damn resourceful theyve brought in significant manpower and weapons that couldnt have happened without resources in the government and if we come out of hiding word would reach the kidnappers omaha mumbled he had holstered the pistol in his waistband and rubbed his knuckles his angry outburst seemed to have steadied the man the kidnappers would be gone before any action could be taken wed lose safia exactly then what do we do kara asked we find transportation captain alhaffi stepped forward painter was unsure how the man would feel about deceiving his own government keeping them in the dark but then again when out in the field the desert phantoms acted with full independence he nodded to painter ill send one of my men over to the village they wont arouse suspicion the captain must have read something in painters face some question about why he was so readily helping the team they killed one of my men kalil he was my wifes cousin painter nodded with sympathy may allah carry him home he knew there was no stronger loyalty than that to the members of ones own tribe and family with a half bow of thanks captain alhaffi waved to the taller of his two men a true giant of a man named barak they spoke rapidly in arabic barak nodded and began to step away kara stopped him how are you going to get a truck with no money barak answered her in english allah helps those who help themselves youre going to steal one borrow it is tradition among our desert tribes a man may borrow what he needs stealing is a crime with this little bit of wisdom the man headed out toward the distant lights at a steady jog disappearing into the night like a true phantom barak will not fail us captain alhaffi assured them he will find a vehicle large enough to carry all of usand the horse painter glanced back along the rocky shore the remaining phantom a taciturn young man named sharif led the stallion with a length of towline why bring the horse painter asked concerned about the exposure of a large vehicle theres good grazing here and someone would find it captain alhaffi answered we have little money and the horse may be bartered sold used as transportation if needed it is also a cover for us to be traveling to salalah the horse farms there are well known it will lessen suspicion if we bring the stallion along on our journey and besides white is good luck this last was said with deadly seriousness luck among the folks of arabia was as important as a roof over ones head they made a brief camp while omaha and painter beached the launch behind some rocks to hide it the others built a fire out of driftwood sheltering it within the lee of a tumbled section of cliff hidden the tiny pyre would be hard to spot and they all needed its warmth and light forty minutes later the grinding of gears announced the arrival of their transportation headlights rounded a bend in the coastal road a flatbed truck rolled up it was an old international painted yellow scarred with rust its bed was framed in wooden fencing with a drop gate behind barak hopped out i see you found something to borrow kara said he shrugged they put out the fire barak had also managed to borrow some clothes robes and cloaks they quickly dressed concealing their western wear once ready captain alhaffi and his men took the trucks cab in case they were stopped the others clambered into the back it took blindfolding the horse to get it to walk up the drop gate into the flatbed they tied the arabian near the front cab then painter and the others huddled near the back as the truck bounced onto the coastal road painter studied the stallion white is good luck painter hoped sothey would need every bit of it part three tombs marooned december pm salalah safia wokein a cell disoriented and nauseated the dark room spun and jittered as she moved her head a groan bubbled up from her core a high barred window let in stabbing shafts of light too bright searing a wave of queasiness rolled over her she turned on her side and dragged her head too heavy for her shoulders over the edge of the cot her stomach clenched then clenched again nothing still she tasted bile as she collapsed back down she took deep breaths and slowly the walls stopped their spin she became aware of the sweat covering her body pasting the thin cotton shift to her legs and chest the heat stifled her lips felt cracked parched how long had she been drugged she remembered the man with the needle cold tall dressed in black he had forced her to change out of her wet clothes aboard the boat and into the khaki shift carefully safia stared around her the room was stone walls plank flooring it stank of fried onions and dirty feet the cot was the only furnishing a single door of stout oak stood closed no doubt locked she lay unmoving for several more minutes her mind floated half deadened by the aftereffects of the drug they had given her still deep inside her panic coiled around her heart she was alone captured the others dead she pictured flames in the night reflecting off stormswept water the memory had burned into her like a camera flash in the dark all red painful too bright to blink away her breathing tightened throat closed down she wanted to cry but couldnt if she started she would never stop finally she pushed up and rolled her feet to the floor it was not with any determination beyond the heavy pressure in her bladder biological need a reminder that she lived she stood unsteady a hand against the wall the stones were welcoming cool she stared up at the barred window from the heat the angle of the sun it had to be close to midday but which day where was she she smelled the sea and the sand still in arabia she was sure she crossed the room the burning in her bladder sharpened she hobbled to the door lifted an arm would they merely drug her again she fingered the purple bruise at the angle of her left arm where the needle had dug in she had no choice need outweighed caution she pounded on the door and called out hoarsely hello can anyone hear me she repeated her words in arabic no one answered she knocked harder stinging her knuckles an ache flaring between her shoulder blades she was weak dehydrated had they left her here to die finally footsteps responded a heavy bar scraped against wood the door swung open she found herself facing the same man as before he stood a half a foot taller than she looming in a black shirt and scuffed faded jeans she was surprised to find his head shaved she didnt remember that no he had been wearing a black cap then the only hair on his head were his dark eyebrows and a small tuft at his chin but she did not forget those eyes blue and cold unreadable passionless a sharks eyes she shivered as he stared at her the heat suddenly gone from the room youre up he said come with me she heard a trace of an aussie accent but one blunted by years away from home wherei have to use the lavatory he frowned at her and strode away follow me he led her to a small hall bath it had a squat toilet curtainless shower and a small stained washbasin with a leaking tap safia ducked inside she reached a hand to the door unsure if she would be allowed privacy dont be long he said pulling the door the rest of the way shut alone she searched the room for some weapon some means of escape again the lone window was barred but she could at least see out of this one she hurried forward and stared out at the small township below nestled against the sea palm trees and white buildings spread between her and the water off to the left a flutter of rainbowcolored tarps and awnings marked off a market souk and in the distance green patches beyond the city defined banana coconut sugarcane and papaya plantations she knew this place the garden city of oman salalah it was the capital city of the dhofar province the original destination of the shabab oman it was a lush region green with waterfalls and rivers feeding the pastures only in this section of oman did the monsoon winds bless the land with sweeps of rain a regular light drizzle and an almost continual mist over the nearby coastal mountains it was a weather system like no other in the gulf one that allowed for the growth of the rare frankincense tree a source of great wealth in ancient times the riches here had led to the founding of the legendary cities of sumharam albalid and lastly the lost city of ubar why had her kidnappers taken her here she crossed to the toilet and quickly relieved herself afterward she washed her hands and stared at her reflection in the mirror she appeared a shadow of herself gaunt tense holloweyed but she was alive a knock on the door bout done in there with no other recourse safia stepped back to the door and opened it the man nodded this way he strode off not even glancing back so sure of his control of the situation safia followed she had no other choice but her legs dragged leaden with despair she was marched down a short flight of stairs along another hall other men hardeyed rifles over shoulders lounged behind doorways or stood guard they finally reached a tall door the man knocked and pushed open the door safia found a room furnished spartanly a threadbare rug with the color long bleached out of it by the sun a single sofa two stiff wooden chairs a pair of fans buzzed stirring the air a table to the side was weighted down by an array of weapons electronic equipment and a laptop computer a cable trailed out the neighboring window to a palmsize satellite dish pointed at the sky thatll be all kane the woman said stepping away from the computer captain the man nodded and left closing the door safia considered lunging for one of the guns on the table but knew she would not get within a step of them she was too weak still wobbly the woman turned to her she wore black slacks a gray tshirt and over that a loose longsleeved shirt unbuttoned cuffs rolled to elbows safia noted the black butt of a holstered pistol at her side please sit she instructed and pointed to one of the wooden chairs safia moved slowly but obeyed the woman remained standing pacing behind the sofa dr almaaz it seems your reputation as an expert in the antiquities of the region has come to the attention of my superiors safia barely understood her words she found herself staring at the womans face her black hair her lips this was the woman who had tried to kill her in the british museum orchestrated the death of ryan fleming murdered all her friends last night faces images shuffled through her mind distracting her from the womans words are you listening dr almaaz she couldnt answer she searched for evil in the woman for the capability for such cruelty and savagery some mark some scar some understanding there was nothing how could that be a heavy sigh escaped the woman she crossed around the sofa and sat down leaning forward elbows on her knees painter crowe she said the unexpected name startled safia a flash of anger burning through her painterhe was my partner shock and disbelief rattled safia no i see i have your attention the smallest smile of satisfaction shadowed her lips you should know the truth painter crowe was using you all of you needlessly putting you in harms way keeping secrets youre lying she finally croaked out past her parched lips the woman lounged back into the sofa i have no need to lie unlike painter ill tell you the truth what you stumbled into discovered by misfortune and chance holds the possible key to untold power i dont know what youre talking about im talking about antimatter safia frowned at the impossibility of what she was hearing the woman continued explaining about the explosion at the museum radiation signatures the search for the primary source of some stable form of antimatter despite her wish to deny it all much of it began to make sense certain statements by painter some of his gear the pressure by the us government the meteor fragment that exploded at the museum the woman continued it was said to guard the true gates of the lost city of ubar it is there that you will lead us she shook her head more in denial this is all preposterous the woman stared a moment longer stood and walked across the room she dragged something from under the table and grabbed a device from among the stacked equipment as she returned safia recognized her own suitcase the woman flipped the trunks clasps and swung open the lid the iron heart lay nestled within molded black styrofoam it glowed ruddy in the bright sunlight this is the artifact you discovered inside a statue dating back to bc with the name of ubar written on its surface safia slowly nodded surprised at the womans intimate knowledge she seemed to know everything about her the woman leaned down and passed the handheld device over the artifact the device crackled and popped sounding not unlike a geiger counter it gives off an extremely lowlevel radiation signature barely detectable but its the same as the exploded meteor did painter ever tell you that safia remembered painter testing the artifact with a similar device could it be true again despair settled to the pit of her stomach a cold stone we need you to continue your work for us the woman said resealing the trunk to guide us to the lost gates of ubar safia stared at the closed trunk all the bloodshed all the deathsall tied to her discovery again i wont she mumbled you will or you will die safia shook her head and shrugged she didnt care all that she loved had been taken from her by this woman she would never help we will proceed with or without you there are other experts in your field and i can make your last hours very unpleasant if you refuse this actually drew a weak laugh from her unpleasant after all she had been throughsafia lifted her head and fully met the womans eyes for the first time a place she had feared staring into until now they werent cold like those of the man who had led her here they sparked with a deepseated angerbut also confusion a frown thinned the womans lips do what you have to safia said realizing the power in her own despair this woman could not touch her harm her they had taken too much last night left nothing that could threaten her both of them knew this truth at the same moment a flash of worry showed in the pinch of the others eyebrows she needs me safia knew with certainty the woman had lied about having access to some other expert she cant get someone else steel flowed through safia firming her resolve firing away the last of her druginduced lassitude once before a woman had walked out of nowhere and into her life a bomb strapped to her chest passionate with religious fervor ending lives without mercy all aimed at safia that woman had died in the explosion back in tel aviv afterward safia had never been able to confront her to hold her responsible instead she took the guilt upon herself but it was even more than that safia had never been able to exact revenge for the deaths laid at her feet to purge her guilt that was no longer true she faced her captor never breaking eye contact she remembered wishing she couldve stopped that woman in tel aviv met her earlier somehow prevented the explosion the deaths could it be true about a source of antimatter she pictured the explosion at the british museum the aftermath what would someone like this woman do with such power how many more would die safia could not let that happen what is your name the question startled her captor the reaction caused a flash of pleasure to erupt in safia as bright as the sun painful but satisfying you said youd tell me the truth the woman frowned but answered slowly cassandra sanchez what will you have me do cassandra safia enjoyed the look of irritation in the other at the informal use of her name if i cooperate the woman stood anger flashing in an hour we will leave for the tomb of imran where the hearts statue was found where you were planning to head with the others thats where well start safia stood one last question the woman stared at her quizzically who do you work for tell me that and ill cooperate before answering the woman crossed to the door opened it and waved for her man kane to collect the prisoner she spoke from the doorway i work for the us government pm cassandra waiteduntil the museum curator had left and the door had been closed she kicked a palmfrondwoven wastepaper basket across the room scattering its contents across the plank floor a pepsi can rattled and rolled to a stop by the sofa fucking bitch she had to restrain herself from further outbursts bottling back her anger the woman had seemed broken cassandra had never imagined her to be so cunning there at the end she had seen the shift in the others eyes a glacial slide of power from her over to her prisoner she had been unable to stop it how had that happened she clenched her hands into fists then forced her fingers to relax and shook her arms bitch she mumbled to the room but at least the prisoner was going to cooperate it was a victory with which she would have to be satisfied the minister would be pleased still bile churned in her stomach keeping her mood sour the curator had more strength in her than cassandra had imagined she began to understand painters interest in the woman painter cassandra heaved out a perturbed sigh his body had never been found it left her feeling unmoored if only a knock at the door interrupted her thoughts john kane pushed inside before she could even turn irritation flashed at his blatant invasion of her privacy his lack of respect lunch was brought up to the prisoner he said shell be ready at fourteen hundred cassandra crossed to the table of electronic gear how did the subdermal function registering perfectly a good strong tracking signal last night after the prisoner had been drugged they had implanted a subdermal microtransceiver between her shoulder blades the same device cassandra was supposed to have implanted on zhang back in the states cassandra found it especially gratifying to use painters own design in this matter the microtransceiver would act as an electronic leash on the prisoner when they were on the streets they would be able to track the curator for a tenmile radius any attempt at escape would be quashed very good she said see that your men are all ready they are kane bristled at her command but his neck was also on the line if this mission failed any word from local authorities about the ships explosion last night cnn is blaming it on unknown terrorists he snorted at this last what about survivors bodies definitely no survivors salvage is just beginning to determine cause and body count she nodded okay get your men ready youre dismissed rolling his eyes a bit he swung away and left the room pushing the door behind him but he didnt close it completely she had to cross over and shove it the rest of the way the latch clicked just keep needling kanepaybacks a bitch sighing her frustration she moved back to the sofa she sat down on the edge no survivors she pictured painter remembering the first time he had succumbed to her subtle advances her carefully orchestrated seduction their first kiss he had tasted sweet of the wine theyd had at dinner his arms around her his lipshis hands slowly sliding up the curve of her hip she touched herself where his palm had come to a rest and leaned back into the sofa less resolved than a moment ago she felt more anger than satisfaction after the nights mission more edgy and she knew why until she saw painters drowned corpse his name on the list of the dead dragged from the sea she would never know with certainty her hand moved down along her hip remembering could things have turned out differently between them she closed her eyes fingers clenching on her belly hating herself for even pondering the possibility damn you painter no matter what she might fantasize it wouldve ended badly thats what the past had taught her first her fathersneaking into her bed at night starting when she was eleven high on crack promising threatening cassandra had retreated to books erecting a wall between her and the world in books she learned how potassium stops the heart undetectable on her seventeenth birthday her father was found dead in his lazboy no one paid attention to one needle puncture among the others her mother suspected and feared her with no reason to stay at home she joined the army at eighteen finding pleasure in hardening herself testing herself then the offer to enter a special forces marksman program it was an honor but not everyone thought of it that way at fort bragg an enlisted man pushed her into an alley intending to correct her he held her down ripped open her shirt whos your daddy now bitch a mistake both the mans legs were broken they were never able to repair his genitalia she was allowed to leave the service as long as she kept her mouth shut she was good at secrets afterward sigma came calling and the guild it became all about power another way to harden herself she had accepted then painterhis smile his calm pain flowed into her dead or alive she had to know while she knew better than to make any assumptions she could make contingency arrangements she shoved off the sofa and stalked to the equipment table the laptop was open she checked the feed from the microtransceiver planted on the prisoner and clicked the gps mapping feature a threedimensional grid appeared the tracking device depicted by a rotating blue ring showed her in her cell if painter was out there hed come for her she stared at the screen her prisoner might think she had gained an upper hand earlier but cassandra took the longer view she had modified painters subdermal transceiver paired it with one designed by the guild it required amplifying the power cell but once this was done the modifications allowed cassandra at any time to ignite an embedded pellet of c to take out the womans spine killing her with a keystroke so if painter was still out there let him come she was ready to end all uncertainty pm everyone collapsedon the sand bonetired the stolen flatbed truck steamed on the narrow coastal road behind them its hood open the stretch of white sand spread in an arc bordered by rocky limestone cliffs that tumbled into the sea on either end it was deserted isolated from any village painter stared south trying to pierce the fifty or so miles that lay between him and salalah safia had to be there he prayed he wasnt already too late behind him omaha and the three desert phantoms argued in arabic over the engine compartment of the truck the others sought the shade of the cliffs collapsing and spent from the long night of rugged travel the steel bed of the truck offered no cushioning against the bumps and ruts in the coastal road painter had caught snippets of sleep but managed no real rest just restless dreams he touched his left eye half swollen shut now the pain focused him on their situation the journey while steady had been slow limited by the terrain and the condition of the old road and now a radiator hose had burst the delay risked all a crunch of sand drew his attention around to coral she wore a loose fitting robe a bit too short showing her bare ankles her hair and face were smudged with the oil from the bed of the truck were late she said he nodded but how late coral glanced at her watch a breitlinger divers chronograph she was rated one of the best logisticians and strategists in the organization i estimate cassandras assault team made landfall at salalah no later than midmorning theyll delay only long enough to make sure no one marked them for the shabab s bombing and to secure a fallback position in the city bestand worstcase scenarios worst they reached the tomb two hours ago best theyre heading there right now painter shook his head not much of a window no its not we shouldnt fool ourselves otherwise she eyed him the assault team demonstrated their drive and focus with their victory at sea theyll proceed with a renewed determination but there may be one hope whats that though determined theyll proceed with extra caution he frowned at this coral explained you mentioned earlier the element of surprise thats not truly where our best strength lies from the profile i received on captain sanchez shes not one to take risks shell proceed as if she expects pursuit and this is to our advantage how when someone is always looking over their shoulder theyre more likely to trip how very zen of you novak she shrugged my mother was a buddhist he glanced at her her statement was said so deadpan that he couldnt tell if she was joking or not okay omaha called as the engine choked caught and grumbled more roughly than before but it was running mount up everybody a few wordless protests erupted as the others pushed from the sand painter climbed in ahead of kara helping her up he noted a tremble in her hands are you all right she freed her hand clasping it in her other she would not meet his eyes fine just worried about safia she found a shady spot in the back corner the others did the same the sun had begun to heat up the flatbed omaha leaped into the back as the giant barak closed the drop gate he was covered with oil and grease from his elbows to fingertips you got it running danny said squinting at his brother not so much from the suns glare as nearsightedness hed lost his glasses during the explosion it had been a very tough introduction to arabia for the young man but he seemed to be holding up well will the engine last to salalah omaha shrugged collapsing on the bed next to his brother we jerryrigged something stoppered the bad hose to keep it from leaking the engine may overheat but we only have another fifty or so miles to go well make it painter wished he could share the mans enthusiasm he settled into a seat between coral and clay the truck jerked forward jostling them all earning a worried whinny from the stallion its hooves clattered on the knobby bed wafts of diesel exhaust smoked up as the truck lurched back onto the road and set off again toward salalah as the sun reflected off of every surface painter closed his eyes against the glare with no hope of sleep he found himself thinking about cassandra he rolled his past experience with his expartner through his head strategy sessions interoffice meetings various operations in the field in all such matters cassandra had proven his equal but hed been blind to her subterfuge her streak of coldbloodedness her calculated ruthlessness here she surpassed him making her a better field operative he pondered corals words from a moment ago when someone is always looking over their shoulder theyre more likely to trip had he done that himself since the museums foiled heist he had been too conscious of his past with cassandra his focus on her too muddled unable to balance past with present even in his heart was that what had allowed him to let his guard down aboard the shabab oman some belief in cassandras ultimate goodness if he had fallen for her there must have been something true between them now he knew better a grunt of protest drew his attention across the truck bed clay yanked his cloak to cover his knees he made for a poor arab what with his pale skin shaved red hair and studded ears he caught painters eye so what do you think will we get there in time painter knew honesty was best from here on out i dont know pm safia rodein the backseat of the fourwheeldrive mitsubishi three other identical vehicles trailed behind they composed a small funeral parade headed to the tomb of the virgin marys father nabi imran safia sat stiffly the suv smelled new the crispness of the interiorcharcoal leather titanium trim blue accent lightsall belied the ragged state of its passenger and she could not blame all the redrimmed fogginess on the aftereffects of the sedatives instead her mind spun on her earlier conversation with cassandra painter who was he how could he have once been partnered with cassandra what did that mean she felt bruised inside sore to the touch as she pictured his wry smile the way his hand touched so lightly on hers reassuring what else had he kept hidden safia pushed her confusion down deep unable to face it yet not sure even why it affected her so much they barely knew each other she turned her focus instead on the other disturbing comment by cassandra how she worked for the us government was that possible though safia was well aware of the occasionally ruthless nature of american foreign policy she could not fathom us policymakers advocating this attack even the men under cassandra had a raw mercenary flare about them their nearness prickled her skin these were no ordinary american soldiers and then there was the man named kane always dressed in black she recognized his queensland accent an aussie he drove their vehicle a little heavyfooted corners taken too sharply almost angrily what was his story the trucks remaining occupant sat beside safia cassandra watched the passing scenery her hands in her lap like any tourist except she carried three guns cassandra had showed them to safia a warning one in a shoulder holster another at the base of her back and the last strapped to her ankle safia suspected there was a hidden fourth weapon trapped she had no choice but to sit still as they traversed central salalah safia watched the builtin navigation track the vehicle they rounded past a beachside resort the hilton salalah then cut across traffic and aimed for the inner municipal district the alquaf area where the tomb of nabi imran awaited them it was not much farther salalah was a small town taking minutes to cross from one side to the other the citys chief attractions lay beyond the municipality in the natural wonders of the surrounding landscape the magnificent sandy beach of mughsal the ancient ruins of sumhurran the myriad plantations that prospered under the monsoon rains and a bit farther inland the green mountains of dhofar loomed as a backdrop one of the few places on earth where the rare frankincense trees grew safia gazed toward the misted mountains a place of eternal mystery and wealth though oil had replaced frankincense as omans main source of riches incense still drove the local economy of salalah the traditional openair markets scented the township with samplings of rosewater ambergris sandalwood and myrrh it was the perfume center of the world all the top designers flew here to sample wares still in the past frankincense was the true treasure of the country surpassing even gold trade in the precious incense fueled omani commerce drove its seafaring dhows to as far north as jordan and turkey and as far west as africa but it was the overland route the incense road that became the true stuff of legend ancient ruins dotted its course cryptic and mysterious their histories mingled with the religions of judaism christianity and islam the most famous was ubar the thousandpillared city founded by the descendants of noah a city that grew rich through the pivotal role it played as a major watering hole for caravans passing through the desert now millennia later ubar had become the focus of power again blood had been shed to discover its secret to expose its heart safia had to resist glancing over her shoulder to the silver case in back the iron heart had come from salalah a bread crumb left behind a trail marker to the true wealth of ubar antimatter could it be possible their mitsubishi slowed and turned down an unpaved side street they passed a line of roadside stands sheltered under palm trees selling dates coconuts and grapes their truck idled slowly past safia considered jumping for it fleeing away but shed been buckled in place any move toward the belts release and shed be stopped and then there were the trailing vehicles full of armed men one truck made the turn behind them the other continued perhaps circling around to cordon off the other end of the alley safia wondered at such extra measures kane and cassandra seemed more than enough to handle the prisoner safia knew there was no escape it would be her death to attempt it a surge of fiery heat a longsuppressed anger burned through her she would not sacrifice herself needlessly she would play their game but wait for her chance she glanced sidelong at cassandra she would have her revengefor her friends for herself this thought sustained her as their truck pulled to a stop outside a set of wroughtiron gates the entrance to the tomb of nabi imran dont try anything cassandra warned as if reading her mind john kane spoke to a gate attendant half leaning out the window a few omani rials passed hands the gate guard pressed a button and the gate swung open allowing the vehicle to pass inside kane pulled in slowly and parked the other truck took a position by the roadside stands kane hopped out and came back to open her door it could be taken as a chivalrous act in any normal circumstance at the present time it was merely a precaution he offered a hand to help her out safia refused climbing free herself cassandra came around the back of the truck she carried the silver case what now safia searched around her where to begin they stood in the middle of a flagstone courtyard walled and bordered by small orderly gardens across the courtyard a small mosque rose its whitewashed minaret climbed blindingly into the midday glare topped by a brownish gold dome a small circular balcony at the top marked the place for the muezzin to sing the adhan the muslim call to prayer five times a day safia offered her own prayer silence was her only answer but it still gave her comfort within the courtyard the sounds of the surrounding town were muted hushed as if the very air had stilled at the holiness of the shrine a few worshipers moved discreetly through the grounds respectful of the burial tomb that stretched along one side a long low building framed in arches painted white trimmed in green within the building stood the gravesite of nabi imran the father of the virgin mary cassandra stepped in front of her the womans impatience her pentup energy stirred the air leaving a wake behind her that was almost palpable so where do we begin at the beginning safia mumbled and strode forward they needed her though a prisoner she would not be rushed knowledge was her shield cassandra strode after her safia walked toward the entrance to the burial sanctuary a robed man one of the tombs attendants strode out to meet their party salam alaikum he greeted alaikum as salam safia responded as fa he apologized and pointed to his head women are not allowed into the tomb with their hair uncovered he pulled free a pair of green scarves shuk ran safia thanked him and quickly donned the apparel her fingers moved with a skill she long thought lost she found not a small degree of satisfaction when the man had to help cassandra the caretaker stepped away peace be with you he offered as he retreated to the shaded gallery back to his post well have to take off our shoes and sandals too safia said nodding to the row of abandoned footwear outside the door soon barefoot they entered the tomb the sanctuary was simply one long hall encompassing the length of the building at one end was a raised brown marble headstone the size of a small altar incense burned atop the marble in a pair of matching bronze braziers giving the room a medicinal scent but it was the grave below the headstone that captured the immediate attention down the middle of the hall stretched a thirtymeterlong sepulcher raised a half meter above the floor and draped in a rainbow of cloths imprinted with phrases from the koran flanking the grave the floor was draped with prayer rugs thats a big grave kane said softly a single worshiper rose from his rug glanced at the newcomers and silently exited the room they had the space to themselves safia paced the thirtymeter length of the shrouded tomb it was said that if you measured the length along one side of the sepulcher youd never get the same measurement on the other she had never tested this bit of folklore cassandra followed at her shoulder gazing around what do you know about this place safia shrugged as she circled the end of the tomb and began the return journey toward the marble headstone the tomb has been revered since the middle ages but all these trappings she waved her hand to encompass the vault and courtyard all of this is relatively new safia strode forward to the marble headstone she placed a hand on its surface this was the spot where reginald kensington excavated the sandstone statue that hid the iron heart some forty years ago cassandra stepped forward with the small case she circled the stone altar the floating snakes of incense from the pair of braziers stirred in her passage an angry writhing motion kane spoke up so the virgin marys father is really buried here theres some controversy surrounding that claim cassandra glanced at her how so most major christian groupscatholics byzantines nestorians jacobitesbelieve marys father was a man named joachim but this is contested the koran claims she descended from a highly respected family that of imran as does the jewish faith according to their stories imran and his wife desired a child but his wife was barren imran prayed for a male child one whom he would dedicate to the temple in jerusalem his prayer was answered his wife became pregnantbut with a female child mary joyous still her parents devoted her to live a life of piety in honor of gods miracle until she got knocked up by an angel yes thats when things get sticky between the religions what about the statue the one at the head of the grave cassandra asked drawing the conversation back to their goal why was it placed here safia stood before the marble headstone and pondered the same question herself as she had on the whole journey from london why would someone place a clue to ubar in a place tied to the virgin mary a figure revered by all three religious faithsjudaism christianity and islam was it because they knew the site would be protected throughout the ages each religion had an interest in preserving the tomb no one couldve anticipated reginald kensington excavating the statue and adding it to his collection back in england but who originally brought the statue to the shrine and why was it because salalah marked the beginning of the incense road was the statue the first signpost the first trail marker leading into the heart of arabia safias mind spun with various scenarios the age of the statue the mysteries surrounding the tomb the multifaith veneration of the site she turned to cassandra i need to see the heart why because youre right the statue mustve been placed here for a reason cassandra stared at her for a long moment then knelt atop one of the prayer rugs snapped open the case the iron heart shone dully within its black rubberized cushioning safia joined her and lifted the heart free again she was surprised by its weight it felt too dense for plain iron as she stood she felt the vague sloshing from within heavy as if some molten lead filled the hearts iron chambers she carried it over to the marble altar the statue was said to be propped up here as she swung around a few bits of frankincense dribbled from the end of one of the hearts vessels and scattered like salt atop the marble altar safia held the heart up to her own chest positioning it anatomicallyventricles down the aortic arch passing on the leftas it would lie in her own body she stood above the long narrow tomb and pictured the museum statue before the explosion had blasted it apart it had stood almost seven feet a draped figure wearing a headdress and face scarf typical of the bedouin today the figure had borne aloft a long funerary incense burner on the shoulder as if aiming a rifle safia stared down at the grains of ancient frankincense was the same incense once burned here she cradled the fist of cold iron in the crook of one arm and picked up a few crystalline grains and tossed them in a neighboring brazier sending up a prayer for her friends they sizzled and gave off a fresh whiff of sweetness to the air closing her eyes she inhaled the air was redolent with frankincense the scent of the ancient past as she breathed she traveled back in time to before the birth of christ she pictured the longdead frankincense tree that produced this incense a scraggly scrubby tree with tiny graygreen leaves she imagined the ancients who harvested the sap they were a reclusive tribe in the mountains so isolated and old that their language predated modern arabian only a handful of tribesmen still survived in isolation up in their mountains eking out a meager living she heard their language in her head a singsong sibilance that was compared to birdsong these people the shahra claimed to be the last surviving descendants of ubar tracing their lineage to its founding fathers had such a people harvested this incense themselves as she drew the past into her with each breath she felt herself swoon the room spinning beneath her momentarily unable to discern up from down she caught herself on the edge of the altar her knees losing strength john kane grabbed her elbow the elbow cradling the heart it bobbled in her gripand fell the heart struck the altar with a dull clank and rolled across the slick marble spinning on its iron surface slightly wobbly as if whatever liquid was inside had thrown it off balance cassandra lunged for it no safia warned leave it be the heart spun a final time and came to rest as it settled it seemed to rock and swing slightly contrary then stopped completely dont touch it safia knelt down eyes even with the edge of the altar stone the incense cloyed the air the heart rested in the exact position she had been holding it a moment before ventricles down aortic arch up and to the left safia stood she adjusted her body to match the position of the heart again as if it were residing in her own chest once in position she corrected the placement of her feet and lifted her arms pretending to hold an invisible rifle in her handsor a funerary incense burner frozen in the pose of the ancient statue safia sighted down the length of her raised arm it pointed straight along the long axis of the tomb perfectly aligned safia lowered her arms and stared at the iron heart what were the odds that the heart would by pure chance settle into this exact position she remembered the sloshing inside the heart pictured its jittery spin its final wobble at the end like a compass she stared down the long length of tomb raising her arm to sight along it her gaze traveled past the walls out over the city and beyond away from the coast out toward the distant green mountains then she knew she had to be sure i need a map why cassandra asked because i know where we have to go next safety first december pm salalah omaha halfdrowsing in the trucks bed felt the telltale rattle under the seat of his pants damn it the vibration in the flatbed grew worse jarring those who had been dozing heads lolling in the heat glanced up faces creased with strained worry from the front of the truck the engine coughed a final time and died with a sighing gasp of smoke black clouds billowed over the truck issuing from under the hood a reek of burned oil accompanied it the flatbed coasted to the side of the road bumped into the sandy shoulder and braked to a stop end of the line omaha said the arabian stallion stamped a hoof in protest you and me both omaha thought he stood along with the others dusted off his cloak and crossed to the drop gate he yanked the release the gate fell away and crashed with a clatter into the sand they all clambered down as captain alhaffi and his two men barak and sharif vacated the cab smoke still billowed smudging into the sky where are we kara asked shielding her eyes and staring down the winding road to either side sugarcane fields climbed in swaths of dense fronds obscuring distances how far are we from salalah no more than a couple of miles omaha said punctuating with a shrug he was unsure it could be twice that captain alhaffi approached the group we should go now he waved an arm toward the smoke people will come to see omaha nodded it wouldnt be good to be found loitering around a stolen truck or even a borrowed one well have to walk the rest of the way painter said he was the last out of the flatbed he had the stallion in tow on a rope lead he led the skittish horse down the dropped gate it shook and danced a bit once on solid ground as painter consoled it omaha noted the mans left eye had begun to purple but appeared less swollen he glanced away balanced between shame for his earlier outburst and the residual anger he still felt with no gear they were soon under way trekking along the roads shoulder they moved like a small caravan in twos captain alhaffi led them painter and coral trailed last with the horse omaha heard the pair speaking in whispers strategizing he slowed to drop beside them he refused to be left out of the discussion kara noted this too and joined them whats the plan once we get into salalah omaha asked painter frowned we keep low coral and i will go to wait omaha cut him off youre not leaving me behind im not going to hide away in some hotel while you two go traipsing about his angry outburst was heard by all we cant all go to the tomb painter said well be spotted coral and i are trained in surveillance and intelligence gathering well need to reconnoiter the area search for safia stake it out if shes not arrived there yet and what if shes already been there and gone omaha asked we can find that out ask some discreet questions kara spoke up if shes gone we wont know where theyve taken her painter stared omaha noted the worry shadowing the mans eyes as dark as the bruise under the left one you think were already too late omaha said we cant know for certain omaha stared off into the distance a few buildings could be seen near the horizon the citys edge too far too late someone has to go on ahead omaha said how kara asked not turning around omaha pointed a thumb back over his shoulder the horse one of usmaybe twocould ride the horse into town go straight to the tomb check it out keep hidden watch for safia trail her if she leaves silence answered him coral met his eyes painter and i were just discussing that i should go painter said omaha stopped turning to face the man fully and why the hells that i know the city i know its back alleys painter stared him down you havent the experience in surveillance this is no time for amateurs youll be spotted give away our advantage like hell i will i may notve had any formal training but ive had years of fieldwork in places where its best not to be seen i can blend in if i have to painter spoke bluntly no bravado but im better this is what i do omaha clenched a fist he heard the certainty in the others voice a part of him wanted to pound it out of the man but another part believed him he didnt have painters experience what was the best choice how could he walk when he wanted to run to safia a cord of pain wrapped around his heart and what will you do if you find her nothing painter continued i will study their manpower find a weakness wait for the proper moment kara spoke up hands on her hips and what about us coral answered her as omaha and painter continued their standoff we have a safe house prearranged as backup in salalah cash and supplies of course they would omaha thought guns kara asked coral nodded well go there first load up ill make contact with washington debrief them on our status arrange for additional no painter interrupted no communication ill contact you all as soon as i can well move forward from there on our own no outside help omaha read the silent discourse that passed between painter and his partner it seemed it was not only the omani government that painter suspected of leaks but also their own government this woman cassandra sanchez had been one step ahead of them all along she must be getting inside information painters eyes settled back to omaha are we straight with this plan omaha slowly nodded though it was like iron bars had been rammed down the back of his neck painter began to turn away but omaha stopped him moving in closer omaha pulled free the pistol from inside his cloak and passed painter the gun if you have a chanceany chance ill take it he said accepting the weapon omaha stepped back and painter mounted the stallion he rode bareback using a makeshift rein of towline ill see you all in salalah he mumbled and kicked the horse into a trot then a full gallop crouched low i hope hes as good a spy as he is a rider kara said omaha watched painter vanish around a bend in the road then the group set off again moving slowly too slowly toward the waiting city pm safia leanedover the topographical map of the dhofar region it lay spread over the hood of their truck she had a digital compass resting in the center along with a straightedged plastic ruler she made a subtle alteration in the rulers position on the map aligning it exactly along the same axis as the tomb of nabi imran before leaving the vault she had spent several minutes using the lasercalibrated compass to get the precise measurement what are you doing cassandra asked at her shoulder for the fifth time still ignoring her safia bent closer nose almost to the paper this is the best i could do without computers she held out a hand pen kane reached into an inside jacket pocket and passed her a ballpoint glancing up she caught a brief glimpse of a gun holstered at his shoulder she took the pen cautiously from his fingers she refused to meet his eyes more than cassandra the man made her edgy shook her resolve safia concentrated on the map focusing her full attention on the mystery the next clue to the secret heart of ubar she drew a line along the edge of the ruler then pulled it away a blue line arrowed straight out from nabi imrans tomb and shot across the countryside she followed the line with her finger noting the terrain it crossed searching for a specific name she had a good idea what she would find as her finger followed beyond the city of salalah the lines of the topographic map began to multiply as the landscape rippled up into foothills then mountains she followed the line of blue ink until it crossed a small black dot atop a steepsided mount her finger came to rest and tapped the spot cassandra leaned closer and read the name printed beneath her finger jebal eitteen she glanced to safia mount eitteen safia said and studied the small black dot that marked the small mountain atop here lies another tomb and like the one here this spot is also revered across all faithschristianity judaism and islam whose tomb is it another prophet ayoub or in english job cassandra simply frowned at her safia elaborated job appears in both the bible and the koran he was a man rich in wealth and family who remained steadfast in his devotion to god as a test all was stripped from him wealth children even his own health so horrible were his afflictions that he was shunned and forced to live in isolation here she tapped the map on mount eitteen still despite the hardships job continued in his faith and devotion for his loyalty god told job to strike the ground with your foot a spring was called forth from which job drank and bathed his afflictions were cured and he became a young man again he lived the rest of his life on mount eitteen and was eventually buried there and you think this tomb is the next spot on the road to ubar if the first signpost was erected at this tomb it only follows that the next would be in a similar location another gravesite of a holy personage revered by all the religions of the region then thats where we must go next cassandra reached to the map safia slapped a hand atop the paper stopping her theres no way i can be certain what if anything well find there ive been to jobs tomb before i saw nothing significant related to ubar and we have no clue where to begin to search not even an iron heart she again pictured the way the heart had wobbled atop the marble altar aligning itself like a compass it could take years to discover the next piece to the puzzle that is why youre here cassandra said snatching up the map and waving for kane to get the prisoner back into the suv to solve this riddle safia shook her head it seemed an impossible task or so safia wanted cassandra to believe despite her protests she had a distinct idea of how to proceed but she was unsure how to use this knowledge to her advantage she climbed into the back again with cassandra and settled into her seat as the truck angled through the entry gate out in the street the vendors were beginning to load up their wares as the afternoon waned a lone stray dog all ribs and leg bones wandered listlessly among the strip of stands and carts it lifted its nose as a horse passed slowly along behind the row of makeshift shops led by a man draped from head to toe in a bedouin desert cloak the truck continued down the lane aiming for another mitsubishi parked at the end the procession would continue into the foothills safia stared at the gps navigation system on the dashboard streets radiated outward the countryside awaited and another tomb she hoped it wasnt her own pm mount eitteen damned scorpions dr jacques bertrand crushed the blackarmored intruder under his heel before settling to the rug that cushioned his workspace he had been gone only minutes to fetch more water from his land rover and the scorpions had already invaded his shaded alcove in the cliff in this harsh landscape of hardscrabble bitterbrush and stone nothing went to waste not even a spot in the shade jacques sprawled on his back in the niche faceup an inscription in epigraphic south arabian had been carved into the roof of the niche an ancient burial crypt the surrounding landscape was littered with them all overshadowed by jobs tomb atop the mount where he labored the entire region had become a cemetery this was the third crypt he had documented today the last for this long interminably hot day he already dreamed of his hotel suite at the salalah hilton a dip in the pool a glass of chardonnay with this thought firming him to his task he set to work running a camelhair brush over the inscription he cleaned it a final time as an archaeologist specializing in ancient languages jacques was currently on a grant to roadmap early semitic scripts tracing their lineage from past to present aramaic elymaic palmyrene nabataean samaritan hebrew gravesites were great sources of the written word immortalizing prayers praises and epitaphs with a prickly shiver jacques lowered his brush he suddenly had an intense feeling of being watched it welled over him some primeval sense of danger raising up on an elbow he stared down past his legs the region was rife with bandits and thieves but in the shadow of jobs tomb a most holy shrine none would venture to commit a crime it would be a death sentence knowing this he had left his rifle back in the rover he stared out into the brightness nothing still he pulled his booted feet fully into the niche if someone was out there someone meaning him harm perhaps he could remain hidden a ticktick of a pebble rolling down a rocky slope sounded from the left his ears strained he felt trapped then a shape moved across the entrance to the crypt it padded past sauntering lazy but confident with power its red fur speckled in shadow blended with the red rock jacques held his breath trapped between terror and disbelief he had heard tales been warned of their presence in the wilds of the dhofar mountains panthera pardus nimr the arabian leopard nearly extinct but not extinct enough for his tastes the large cat moved past but it was not alone a second leopard strode into view moving faster younger more agitated then a third a male huge paws splaying with each step yellow claws a pack he held his breath praying near mindless a caveman huddling against the dangers beyond his hole then another figure strode into view not a cat bare legs bare feet moving with the same feline grace a woman from his vantage point he could see nothing above her thighs she ignored him as surely as the leopards moving swiftly past heading higher up the mountain jacques slipped from the crypt like lazarus rising from his grave he could not stop himself he poked his head out on his hands and knees the woman climbed the rock face following some path known only to her she was the color of warm mocha sleek black hair to the waist naked unashamed she seemed to sense his gaze though she did not turn around he felt it in his head the overwhelming feeling of being watched again it bubbled through him fear prickled but he could not look away she strode among the leopards continuing upward toward the tomb at the top her form seemed to shimmer a heat mirage across sunbaked sand a scratching sound drew his glance to his hands and knees a pair of scorpions scuttled over his fingers they were not poisonous but dealt a wicked sting he gasped as more and more boiled out of cracks and crevices scrabbling down walls dropping from the roof hundreds a nest he scrambled from the crypt he felt stings sparks of fire on his back ankles neck hands he fell out of the opening and rolled across the hard soil more stings flashed like cigarette burns he cried out maddened with pain he clambered up shaking his limbs stripping his jacket slapping a hand through his hair he stamped his feet and stumbled back down the slope scorpions still scuttled about the crypts opening he glanced higher suddenly fearful of drawing the leopards attention but the cliff face was empty the woman the cats had vanished it was impossible but the fire from the scorpion stings had burned all curiosity from him he fell back and away retreating for his parked rover still his eyes quested moving higher to the top to where the tomb of job waited he pulled open the door to his rover and climbed into the drivers seat he had been warned away he knew it with dread certainty something horrible was going to happen up there pm salalah safias stillalive painter said as soon as he strode through the door of the safe house it was not so much a house as a tworoom flat above an importexport shop that bordered the alhaffa souk with such a business fronting the safe house none would question the comings and goings of strangers just a normal part of business the noise of the neighboring market was a chatter of languages voices and bartering the rooms smelled of curry and old mattresses painter pushed past coral who had opened the door upon his knock he had already noted the two desert phantoms posted discreetly out front watching the approach up to the safe house the others were gathered in the front room exhausted roadworn a run of water tinkled from the neighboring bathroom painter noted kara was missing danny omaha and clay all had wet hair they had been taking turns showering away the trail dust and grime captain alhaffi had found a robe but it was too tight for his shoulders omaha stood as painter entered where is she safia and the others were leaving the tomb just as i arrived in a caravan of suvs heavily armed painter crossed to the tiny kitchenette he leaned over the sink turned the tap and ran his head under the spigot omaha stood behind him then why arent you tracking them painter straightened sweeping back his sodden hair trails of water coursed down his neck and back i am he kept his eyes hard upon omaha then stepped past him to coral how are we equipped she nodded to the door leading to the back room i thought it best to wait for you the electronic keypad proved trickier than i had imagined show me she led him to the door the flat was a cia safe house permanently stocked one of many throughout the world sigma had been alerted to its location when the mission was assembled backup in case it was needed it was painter spotted the electronic keypad hidden under a fold of curtain coral had pinned the drape out of the way a small array of crude tools lay on the floor fingernail clipper razor blades tweezers nail file from the bathroom coral said painter knelt in front of the keypad coral had opened the casing exposing the electronics he studied the circuits coral leaned beside him pointing to some clipped wires red and blue i was able to disable the silent alarm you should be able to key into the equipment locker without alerting anyone but i thought it best you oversee my work this is your field of expertise painter nodded such lockers were rigged to silently send out an alarm notifying the cia when such a safe house was employed painter did not want such knowledge sent out not yet not so broadly they were deadand he meant to keep them that way for as long as possible his eyes ran along the circuits following the flows of power the dummy wires the live ones all seemed in order coral had managed to sever the power to the telephone line while leaving the keypad powered and untampered with for a physicist she was proving to be a damn good electrical engineer looks good then we can enter during his premission briefing painter had memorized the safe houses code he reached to the keypad and typed in the first number of the tendigit code he would have only one chance to get it right if he entered the code wrong the keypad would disable itself locking down a failsafe he proceeded carefully you have ninety seconds coral reminded him another failsafe the tendigit sequence had to be punched in within a set time span he tapped each number with care proceeding steadily as he reached the seventh number in the sequencethe number ninehis finger hovered the illuminated button seemed slightly dimmer than its neighbor easy to miss he held his finger was he being too paranoid jumping at shadows whats wrong coral asked by now omaha had joined them along with his brother painter sat back on his heels thinking he clenched and unclenched his fingers he stared at the numbernine button surely not painter coral whispered under her breath if he waited much longer the system would lock down he didnt have time to sparebut something was wrong he could smell it omaha hovered behind him making him too conscious of the time ticking away if painter was to save safia he needed what lay behind this door ignoring the keypad painter picked up the tweezer and nail file with a surgeons skill he carefully lifted free the numbernine key it fell into his hand too easily he leaned closer squinting damn behind the key rested a small square chip with a pressure plunger in its center the chip was wrapped tightly with a thin metal filament an antenna it was a microtransmitter if he had pressed the button it would have activated from the crudeness of its integration this was not a factory installation cassandra had been here sweat rolled into painters left eye he had not even been aware of the amount of moisture that had built up on his brow coral stared over his shoulder shit that was an understatement get everyone out of here whats going on omaha asked booby trap painter said anger firing his words out now grab kara coral commanded omaha ordering him into the bathroom she got everyone else moving toward the door as they fled painter sat before the keypad a litany of curses rang through his head like a favorite old song he had been singing this tune too long cassandra was always a step ahead thirty seconds coral warned as she slammed the flats door he had half a minute until the keypad locked down alone he studied the chip just you and me cassandra painter set down the nail file and picked up the nail clipper wishing he had his tool satchel he set to work on removing the transmitter breathing deeply staying in a calm place he touched the metal casing to bleed away any static electricity then set to work he carefully dissected away the power wire from its ground then just as carefully filed the plastic coating off the power wire without breaking it once the ground wire was exposed he tweezed it up and touched it to the hot wire there was a snap and a sizzle a hint of burned plastic wafted upward the transmitter was fried eight seconds he cut the dead transmitter free and plucked it out he closed his fingers over it feeling its sharp edge dig into his palm fuck you cassandra painter finished tapping in the final three digits beside him the doors locks tumbled open with a whir of mechanics only then did he sigh in relief straightening he inspected the doors frame before testing the knob it all looked untouched cassandra had counted on the transmitter doing the job painter twisted and pulled the knob the door was heavy reinforced with steel he said a quick final prayer as he hauled the door open from the doorway he stared inside a bare bulb illuminated the room damn it the neighboring room was filled with steel shelves and racks from floor to ceiling all empty ransacked again cassandra had taken no chances left no crumbs only her calling card a pound of c explosive rigged with an electronic detonator if he had tapped the numbernine button it would have taken out the entire building he crossed and pulled free the detonator frustration built into a painful pressure behind his rib cage he wanted to scream instead he crossed back to the flats entry door and called the all clear corals eyes were bright as she climbed the stairs she cleaned us out painter said as his partner entered omaha frowned following on corals heels who cassandra sanchez painter snapped safias kidnappers how the hell did she know about the safe house painter shook his head how indeed he led them to the empty locker stepped inside and crossed to the bomb what are you doing omaha asked im salvaging the explosives we may need them as painter worked omaha entered the locker kara followed her hair wet and tangled from her interrupted shower her body snugged in a towel what about safia omaha asked you said you could track her painter finished freeing the c and motioned them all back out i did now we have a problem there shouldve been a satellitelinked computer here a way to reach a dod server i dont understand kara said thinly her flesh shone pale yellow under the fluorescents she appeared wasted leaving painter to suspect it wasnt drugs that had worn the woman down but the lack of them painter led them back into the main room revising his plans with one step cursing cassandra with the next she knew about the safe house obtained the locker code and boobytrapped it how did she know their every move his gaze traveled over the group here wheres clay painter asked finishing a cigarette on the stairs danny answered he found a pack in the kitchen as if on command clay pushed through the door all eyes turned to him he was taken aback by all the attention what he asked kara turned to painter whats our next step painter turned to captain alhaffi i left the sultans horse with sharif downstairs do you think you could sell the stallion and quickly roust up some weapons and a vehicle that could carry us the captain nodded with assurance i have discreet contacts here you have half an hour what about safia omaha pressed were wasting too much time safia is safe for the moment cassandra still needs her or safia would be sharing that tomb with the virgin marys father right now they took her away for a reason if we hope to rescue her the cover of night might be best we have some time to spare how do you know where theyre taking safia kara asked painter searched the faces around him unsure how freely to speak well omaha pressed how the hell are we going to find her painter crossed toward the door by finding the best coffee in town pm omaha ledthe way across the alhaffa souk only painter followed the others were left at the safe house to rest and await the return of captain alhaffi and their transportation omaha hoped they had someplace to travel to dull anger throbbed with each step painter had seen safia been within yards of herand he had let the kidnappers ride off with her the mans confidence in his ability to track her had been shaken back at the safe house omaha saw it in painters eyes worry the bastard shouldve attempted to rescue her when he had the chance to hell with the odds the mans insufferable caution was going to get safia killed and then all their efforts would be too late omaha stalked among the booths and stalls of the market deaf to the chatter of voices the cries of hawkers the angry burble of heated bartering the squawk of caged geese the braying of a mule it all blended into white noise the market was near to closing for the day as the sun sank toward the horizon stretching shadows an evening wind had kicked up awnings rattled dust devils danced amid piles of littered refuse and the air smelled of salt spice and the promise of rain it was past monsoon season but the weather reports warned of a december storm a front moving inland they would have rain by nightfall the squall last night had been only the first in a series of storms there was talk that this weather system would cross the mountains and collide with the sandstorm rolling south creating the perfect monster storm but omaha had larger concerns than wild weather omaha hurried across the souk their goal lay on the far side where a modern strip of commercial facilities had sprouted including a pizza hut and a minimart omaha wound through the last of the stalls passing shops selling knockoff perfumes incense burners bananas tobacco handcrafted jewelry traditional dhofari dresses made of velvet and covered with beads and sequins at last they reached the street separating the souk from the modern strip mall omaha pointed across the way there it is now how is that place going to help you find safia painter headed across ill show you omaha followed he stared up at the signsalalah internet cafй the establishment specialized in elaborate coffees offering an international array of teas cappuccinos and espressos similar establishments could be found in the most remote places all it took was a telephone connection and even the most outoftheway corner of the world could be surfing the web painter headed inside he approached the counterperson a blondhaired englishman by the name of axe who wore a tshirt that readfree winona and gave him his credit card number and expiration date you have that memorized omaha asked you never know when youre going to be attacked by pirates at sea as the man ran the number omaha asked i thought you wanted to keep a low profile wont using your credit card give away that youre still alive i dont think it really matters anymore the electronic credit card machine chimed the man gave him a thumbsup how much time do you want is it a highspeed connection dsl mate no other way to surf thirty minutes should be enough brilliant machine in the corner is free painter led omaha over to the computer a gateway pentium painter sat down accessed the internet connection and typed in a long ip address im accessing a department of defenses server he explained how is that going to help find safia he continued typing fingers flying screens flashed refreshed disappeared changed through the dod i can gain access to most proprietary systems under the national security act here we go on the screen appeared a page with the mitsubishi logo omaha read over his shoulder shopping for a new car painter used the mouse to maneuver through the site he seemed to have full access flashing past passwordencrypted screens cassandras group was traveling in suvs mitsubishis they did not make much effort to hide their backup vehicles it didnt take much to get close enough to read the vin number off one in the alley vin the vehicle identification number painter nodded all cars or trucks with gps navigation systems are in constant contact with the orbiting satellites keeping track of their location allowing the driver to know where he is at all times omaha began to understand and if you have the vin number you can access the vehicles data remotely find out where they are thats what im counting on a screen appeared asking for the vin number painter typed it in not looking at his fingers he pressed the enter button then leaned back his hand had a slight shake in it he clenched a fist in an attempt to hide it omaha could read his mind had he remembered the number correctly what if the kidnappers had disabled the gps so many things could go wrong but after a long moment a digital map of oman appeared fed from a pair of geosynchronous satellites orbiting far above a small box scrolled a series of longitude and latitude designation the moving location of the suv painter sighed with relief omaha echoed it if we could find where they were holding safia painter clicked the zoom feature and zeroed in on the map the city of salalah appeared but the tiny blue arrow marking the trucks location was beyond its borders heading deeper inland painter leaned closer no goddamnit theyre leaving the city they mustve found something at that tomb omaha swung away then we have to go now we dont know where theyre going painter said remaining at the computer i have to track them until they stop there is only one highway the one theyre on we can catch up we dont know if theyll go overland they were in fourwheeldrives omaha felt pulled in two different directions to listen to painters practical advice or to steal the first vehicle he could find and race after safia but what would he do if he reached her how could he help her painter grabbed his arm omaha balled a fist with the other painter stared hard at him i need you to think dr dunn why would they be leaving the city where could they be going how the hell should painter squeezed his arm youre as much an expert in this region as safia you know what road theyre taking what lies along the way is there anything out there that the tomb here in salalah might point toward he shook his head refusing to answer they were wasting time goddamnit omaha for once in your life stop reacting and think omaha yanked his arm away fuck you but he didnt leave he remained trembling in place what is out there where are they going omaha glanced over to the screen unable to face painter afraid hed blacken the mans other eye he considered the question the puzzle he stared at the blue arrow as it wound away from town up into the foothills what had safia discovered where were they headed he ran through all the archaeological possibilities all the sites peppered across the ancient land shrines cemeteries ruins caves sinkholes there were too many turn over any stone here and you discover a piece of history but then he had an idea there was a major tomb near that highway just a few miles off the road omaha moved back to the computer he watched the blue arrow coursing along the road theres a turnoff about fifteen miles up the highway if they take that turn i know where theyre headed thatll mean waiting a bit more painter said omaha crouched by the computer it seems we have no choice pm painter boughttime on another computer he left omaha to monitor the suvs progress if they could get a lead on where cassandra was headed with safia they could get a head start it was a slim hope alone with his computer painter again accessed the dod server there was no reason to feign death any longer hed left enough of an electronic trail besides considering the elaborate trap at the safe house cassandra knew he was aliveor at least she was acting that way that was one of the reasons he needed to log back onto the dod site he entered his private pass code and accessed his mail system he typed in the address for his superior dr sean mcknight head of sigma if there was anyone he trusted it was sean he needed to apprise his commander of the events let him know the status of the operation an email window opened and he typed rapidly relating a thumbnail sketch of events he stressed the role of cassandra the possibility of a mole in the organization there was no way cassandra could have known about the safe house the electronic code for the equipment locker without some inside information he finished i cannot stress enough that matters at your end must be investigated success of this mission will depend on cutting off further flow of intelligence trust no one we will attempt to rescue dr almaaz this evening we believe we know where cassandras group is taking the doctor it appears they are headed to painter paused took a deep breath then continued typing the yemeni border we are headed there right now in an attempt to stop the border crossing painter stared at the letter numb at the possibility omaha waved to him from the neighboring computer they made the turnoff on the side road painter hit the send button the letter vanished but not his guilt cmon omaha crossed to the exit we can close the distance painter followed at the door he gave one final glance back to his workstation he prayed he was wrong footprints of the prophet december pm dhofar mountains safia staredout the window as the truck wound up a switchback through the mountainous hills after they left the highway asphalt had given way to gravel which in turn disintegrated into a rutted red dirt path they proceeded slowly cautious of the deep gorge that shouldered the road to the left below the valley flowed away in deepening shades of lush green disappearing into shadows near the bottom as the sun set to the west a scatter of baobab trees dotted the slope monstrous trees with tangled rooted trunks that seemed more prehistoric than specimens of the modern world everywhere the land rolled in shades of emerald striped in shadows a waterfall glistened between two distant hills its cataracts sparkling in the last rays of the sun if safia squinted she could almost imagine she was back in england all the lushness of the high country was due to the annual monsoon winds the khareef that swept the foothills and mountains in a continual misty drizzle from june through september even now as the sun set a steady wind had begun to blow buffeting the truck the sky overhead had darkened to slate gray canopied with frothy clouds that brushed the higher hills the radio had been tuned to a local news channel during the ride up here cassandra had been listening for reports on the ongoing salvage operation on the shabab oman still no survivors had been found and the seas were again kicking up with the approach of a new storm system but what dominated the weather reports was news of the fierce sandstorm continuing its sweep south across saudi arabia heading like a freight train for the desert of oman leaving a swath of destruction the wild weather matched safias mood dark threatening unpredictable she felt a force building inside her below her breastbone a tempest in a bottle she remained tense tingling it reminded her of an impending anxiety attack but now there was no fear only determined certainty she had nothing so could lose nothing she remembered her years in london it had been the same she had sought comfort by becoming nothing cutting herself off isolating herself but now she had truly succeeded she was empty left with only one purpose to stop cassandra and that was enough cassandra remained lost in her own thoughts only occasionally leaning forward to speak in hushed tones to john kane up front her cell phone had rung a few minutes ago she had answered it tersely turning slightly away speaking in a whisper safia heard painters name she had tried to eavesdrop but the woman kept her voice too low blocked by the babble of the radio then she had hung up made two other calls and sunk into a palpably tense silence anger seemed to radiate in waves from the woman since then safia kept her attention on the countryside searching for places where she might hide mapping the terrain in her head just in case after another ten minutes of slow trekking a larger hill appeared its top still bathed in light the golden bell of a short tower glinted in the sun safia straightened jobs tomb is that the place cassandra stirred eyes still narrowed safia nodded sensing that now was not the time to provoke her captor the suv coasted down a final slope circled the base of the mount and then began a long climb toward the top crawling up a switchback a group of camels lounged beside the road as their vehicle neared the hilltop tomb the beasts were all couched for a rest kneeling down atop their knobby knees a few men sat in the shadow of a baobab tribesmen from the hills the eyes of both camels and men followed the passage of the three trucks after a last switchback the walled tomb complex appeared consisting of a small beige building a tiny whitewashed mosque and a handsome garden courtyard of native shrubs and flowers parking was merely an open stretch of dirt in front presently empty because of the lateness of the day as before kane settled the truck to a stop then came around to open safias door she climbed out stretching a kink from her neck cassandra joined them as the other two suvs parked and the men unloaded they were all dressed in civilian clothes khakis and levis shortsleeved shirts polos but all the men wore matching windbreakers with the logo for sunseeker tours all a size too big hiding their holstered weapons they quickly dispersed into a loose cordon near the road feigning interest in the gardens or walls a pair had binoculars and scanned the immediate area turning in a slow circle except for the road leading here the remaining approaches were steep almost vertical cliff faces it would not be easy to flee on foot john kane went among his men nodding bowing his head in lastminute instructions then returned where first safia motioned vaguely to the mosque and vault from one tomb to another she led the way through the opening in the wall place looks deserted kane commented there must be a caretaker somewhere about safia said and pointed to the steel chain that lay loose beside the entrance no one had locked the place cassandra signaled to two men search the grounds obeying the pair took off cassandra led the way after them safia followed with kane at her side they entered the courtyard between the mosque and small beige vault the only other feature of the complex was a small set of ancient ruins near the back neighboring the tomb an ancient prayer room supposedly all that was left of jobs original home closer by the door to the tomb lay open unlocked like the gate safia stared toward the doorway this may take some time i dont have the slightest idea where to begin to look for the next clue if it takes all night then it takes all night were staying here safia could not keep the surprise from her voice cassandra wore a hardedged expression for as long as it takes safia swept the courtyard with her gaze she prayed the caretaker had been careless in locking the place up and had already left she feared hearing a gunshot somewhere out there marking his death and what if other pilgrims came later how many more would die safia felt conflicted the sooner cassandra had what she wanted the less chance that other innocent folk would die but that meant helping her something she was loath to do with no other choice she crossed the grounds and entered the crypt she had an inkling of what needed to be foundbut not where it might be hidden she stood a moment in the entryway the crypt here was smaller than nabi imrans tomb a perfect square the walls were painted white the floor green a pair of red persian prayer rugs flanked the grave mound which again was draped in silk shawls imprinted with passages from the koran beneath the cloths was the bare dirt in which jobs body was said to have been buried safia made a slow circle around the mound there was no marble headstone as there had been at imrans tomb only a scattering of clay incense burners scorched black from frequent use and a small tray for visitors to leave gifts of coins the room was otherwise unadorned with the exception of a wall chart listing the names of the prophets moses abraham job jesus and muhammad safia hoped they wouldnt need to track all these mens tombs on the road to ubar she ended back at the entrance none the wiser cassandra spoke at the door what about that iron heart can we use it here as before she had brought the silver case and had set it outside the door safia shook her head sensing that the heart would not be significant here she exited the chamber slipping between cassandra and kane as safia stepped outside she realized she had walked through the tomb in her shoes she had also left her hair uncovered she frowned where was the caretaker she eyed the grounds fearful for the mans safety again hoping hed already left the winds had kicked up scurrying through the yard bobbing the heads of a row of daylilies the place appeared deserted displaced in time yet safia sensed somethingsomething she could not name almost an expectation maybe it was the light it cast everythingthe neighboring mosque the edges of the walls even the hardpacked gravel of the garden pathin stark flat detail a silver negative held over a bright light she sensed if she waited long enough all would be revealed in full color and clarity but she didnt have the time what now cassandra pressed drawing her back safia turned beside the entranceway a small metal door was affixed to the ground she bent to the handle knowing what lay beneath it what are you doing cassandra asked my job safia let her disdain shine through too tired to care if she provoked her captor she tugged up the door hidden below was a shallow pit sixteen inches deep dug from the stone at the bottom was a pair of petrified prints a large mans bare footprint and a horses hoof whats all this kane asked safia explained if you remember my story of job he was afflicted with disease until god ordered him to strike his foot down and a healing spring was called forth she pointed into the stone pit to the footprint that is supposedly jobs footprint where he struck the ground she pointed to the hole in the ground and there is where the spring bubbled up fed from a water source at the foot of the hill the water traveled uphill kane asked it wouldnt be a miracle otherwise cassandra stared down what does the hoofprint have to do with the miracle safias brow crinkled as she stared at the hoof it was stone too there is no story associated with it she mumbled still something tweaked her memory petrified prints of a horse and a man why did that sound familiar throughout the region there were countless stories of men or beasts turning to stone some even concerned ubar she shuffled through her memories two such stories found in the arabian nights collectionthe petrified city and the city of brassrelated the discovery of a lost desert city a place so evil it was damned and its inhabitants frozen in place for their sins either petrified or turned to brass depending on the story it was a clear reference to ubar but in the second story the treasure hunters hadnt stumbled upon the condemned city by accident there had been clues and signposts that led them to its gates safia recalled the most significant signpost from this story a sculpture of brass it depicted a mounted horseman who bore aloft a spear with an impaled head atop it on the head an inscription had been written she knew the line from the story by heart having done extensive research for kara about arabian mysteries o thou who comest unto me if thou know not the way that leadeth to the city of brass rub the hand of the horseman and he will turn and then will stop and in whatsoever direction he stoppeth thither proceed for it will lead thee to the city of brass to ubar safia pondered the passage a metallic sculpture turning with a touch to point to the next signpost she pictured the iron heart aligning itself like a compass needle atop the marble altar the similarity was uncanny and now this she stared into the pit a man and a horse petrified safia noted how both the foot and hoofprint pointed in the same direction as if the man were walking his mount was that the next direction she frowned sensing the answer was too easy too obvious she lowered the lid and stood cassandra kept at her side youre onto something safia shook her headlost in the mystery she strode in the direction of the prints walking where the longdead prophet would have headed with his horse she ended up at the entrance to the small archaeological site located behind the main tomb separated from the newer building by a narrow alley the ruins were a nondescript structure of four crumbling walls no roof outlining a small chamber ten feet across it seemed once a part of a larger home long gone she walked through the threshold and into the interior while john kane guarded the door cassandra followed her inside what is this place an ancient prayer room safia stared up at the darkening skies as the sun sank away then stepped over a kneeling rug on the floor safia walked to where two of the walls had crude niches constructed into them built to orient worshipers about the direction in which to pray she knew the newer one faced toward mecca she crossed to the other the older niche here is where the prophet job prayed safia mumbled more to herself than cassandra always facing jerusalem to the northwest safia stepped into the niche and faced backward back the way she had come through the dimness she made out the metal lid of the pit the footsteps led right here she studied the niche it was a solid wall of sandstone quarried locally the niche was a tumble of loose stone blocks long deteriorated by age she touched the inner wall sandstonelike the sculpture where the iron heart had been found cassandra stepped next to her what do you know that youre not telling us a pistol pressed into safias side under her rib cage safia had not even seen the woman pull it free keeping her hand flat against the wall safia turned to cassandra it was not the pistol that made her speak but her own curiosity i need a metal detector pm as nightfell painter turned off the main highway onto the gravel side road a green sign with arabic lettering statedjebal eitteen km the truck bounced from the asphalt surface to gravel painter didnt slow down spitting a shower of stones onto the highway gravel rattled in the wheel wells sounding distinctly like automatic fire it heightened his anxiety omaha sat in the shotgun seat his window rolled half down danny sat behind his brother in the backseat remember this piece of crap doesnt have fourwheel drive his teeth rattled as much as the vehicle i cant risk slowing down painter called back once nearer ill have to go more cautiously with the lights off but for now we have to push it omaha grunted his approval painter punched the accelerator as they reached a steep incline the vehicle fishtailed painter fought it steady it was not a vehicle suited for backcountry trekking but they had no other choice upon returning from the internet cafй painter had found captain alhaffi waiting with a volkswagen eurovan coral was examining his other purchases three kalashnikov rifles and a pair of heckler amp koch mm handguns all traded for the sultans stallion and while the weapons were sound with plenty of extra ammunition the van would not have been painters first choice the captain hadnt known theyd be leaving the city and with time running short they had no time to seek alternate transportation still at least the van could carry all of them danny coral and the two desert phantoms sat crammed in the backseat kara clay and captain alhaffi in the extra third row painter had attempted to dissuade them all from accompanying him but he had little time to state his case the others wanted to come and they unfortunately knew too much salalah was no longer safe for any of them cassandra could dispatch assassins at any time to silence them there was no telling where she had eyes and painter didnt know whom to trust so they stuck together as a group he bounced the van around a tight switchback his headlights swung about and blinded a large animal standing in the road the camel stared at the van as painter slammed on the brakes they skidded to a stop the camel glanced down at the vehicle eyes shining red and slowly sauntered the rest of the way across the road painter had to creep onto the shoulder in order to edge around it once past he acceleratedonly to brake again in another fifty feet a dozen more camels filled the road ambling along in no order freeroaming beep your horn omaha said and alert cassandras group that someones coming painter said with a scowl someone will have to get out and scatter a path through them i know camels barak said and slid out as soon as his feet hit the gravel a handful of men stepped out from behind boulders and shadowed alcoves they pointed rifles at the van painter caught movement in his rearview mirror there were another two men back there they wore dusty anklelength robes and dark headdresses bandits omaha spat reaching to his holstered pistol barak stood beside the open van door he kept his palms bared away from his weapon not bandits he whispered theyre the bait kathir bedouin nomads could distinguish various tribes at a distance of a hundred yards from the way they tied their headcloths to the colors of robes to the saddles of their camels how they carried their rifles while painter did not have this ability he had educated himself on all the local tribes of southern arabia mahra rashid awamir dahm saar he knew the bait kathir too tribesmen of the mountains and desert a reclusive insular group prone to taking affront at the least slight they could be dangerous if provoked and very protective of their camels more so even than they were of their wives one of the tribesmen stepped forward a man worn by sun and sand into just bone and skin salam alaikum he muttered peace be on you they were strange words coming from someone still holding a weapon aimed at them alaikum as salam barak responded palms still bared on you be peace he continued in arabic what is the news the man lowered his rifle a fraction what is the news was the standard question all tribesmen asked upon meeting it could not be left unanswered a flurry of words passed between barak and the tribesman information about the weather of the sandstorm threatening the desert of the predicted megastorm to come of the many bedouin fleeing the arrimal the sands of the hardships along the way of the camels lost barak introduced captain alhaffi all desert folk knew of the phantoms a murmur passed among the remaining men rifles were finally slung up painter had vacated the van and stood to the side an outsider he waited for the ritual of introductions and news to be shared it seemed if he followed the discourse correctly that sharifs greatgrandmother had worked on the film lawrence of arabia with the leader of this bands grandfather with such a bond an air of celebration began to arise voices grew more excited painter sidled to captain alhaffi ask them if they saw the suvs the captain nodded bringing a serious tone to his voice nods answered him their leader sheikh emir ibn ravi reported that three trucks had passed forty minutes ago did they come back down painter urged speaking now in arabic slowly infiltrating the conversation perhaps his own brown skin ambiguously ethnic helped alleviate their suspicion of his foreignness no the sheikh answered waving a hand toward the rising lands they stay at the tomb of nabi ayoub painter stared up the dark road so they were still up there omaha stood by the open passenger door he had heard the exchange enough already he urged lets get going the bait kathir had begun to round up their camels and shoo them off the road the beasts protested with gurgles and angry belches wait painter said he turned to captain alhaffi how much money do you have left from the sale of the stallion the man shrugged nothing but a handful of rials enough to buy or rent a few camels the captains eyes narrowed you want the camels for what cover to get closer to the tomb a small group of us the captain nodded and turned to sheikh emir they spoke rapidly two leaders conferring omaha stepped to painter the van is faster on these roads not much faster and with the camels we should be able to get very close to the tomb without alerting cassandras group im sure she noted these tribesmen on her way up their presence will not be unexpected just a part of the natural landscape and what do we do when were up there painter already had a plan in mind he told omaha the gist of it by the time he was done captain alhaffi had reached some agreement with the sheikh he will lend us his camels the captain said how many all of them the captain answered painters look of surprise it is unseemly for a bedu to refuse the request of a guest but there is a condition what is that i told them of our wish to rescue a woman from the group up at the tomb they are most agreeable to help it would be an honor to them plus they like to shoot their guns barak added painter was reluctant to put them in danger omaha did not share his hesitation they do have weapons if your plan is going to work the more firepower the better painter had to agree with painters acquiescence the sheikh broke into a broad grin and rallied his men saddles were cinched camels were dropped into crouched positions for easy mounting and ammunition was spread around like party favors painter pulled his own group together pooled in the headlights of the eurovan kara i want you to stay behind with the van she opened her mouth to protest but it was a weak effort her face shone with a film of sweat despite the wind and chill of the night painter cut her off well need someone to hide the van off the road then bring it forward on my signal clay and danny will stay with you with a rifle and a pistol if we should fail and cassandra flees with safia youll be the only ones able to track them kara frowned hard lines creasing her face but she nodded youd better not fail she said fiercely but even this outburst seemed to tax her to the side danny argued with his brother wanting to come along omaha stood firm you dont even have your goddamn eyeglasses youll just end up shooting me in the ass by mistake still he placed a hand on his younger brothers shoulder and im counting on you here youre the last line against trouble i cant risk losing her again danny nodded and backed down clay had no objection to being left behind he stood a step away a burning cigarette in his fingers his eyes stared at nothing almost glazed over he was nearing the end of his ability to handle all this with matters decided painter turned to the waiting camels mount up omaha strode beside him have you ever ridden a camel no painter glanced at him for the first time in the past day omaha wore a wide grin as he stepped away thisll be fun pm bathed inthe beams of two floodlights cassandra watched as one of kanes men waved the metal detector over the back wall of the niche just right of center in the wall the detector buzzed with discovery she tightened and turned to safia you knew something would be found how safia shrugged the iron heart had been posted by the coastal tomb of imran hidden in a sandstone sculpture it pointed here up into the mountains it only made sense that the next marker would be something similar another piece of iron like the heart the only mystery was where it was located cassandra stared at the wall despite the frustrated anger she felt for the prisoner the curator had indeed proven her worth what now safia shook her head it will have to be dug out freed from the stone like the iron heart from the statue she faced cassandra well have to proceed with caution a single misstep and the buried artifact could be damaged it will take days to extract it perhaps not cassandra turned and strode away leaving safia under kanes watch stepping out of the prayer room she crossed back toward the trucks following the white gravel path through the dark gardens as she marched past the entrance to the main tomb a flicker of shadow caught her eye in a fluid motion cassandra dropped to a knee sweeping a pistol from her shoulder holster fueled by reflex and wariness she covered the entrance and waited a full two breaths winds whispered the fronds of a palmetto bush her ears strained to listen nothing no movement from the tomb she rose smoothly pistol held steady on the opening she sidled toward the entrance stepping off the path and onto the bare dirt to avoid the crunch of gravel she reached the doorway covered one side of the room edged in and swept the other the back windows allowed in enough reflected glow from the powerful work lights next door the grave mound was a shadowed hummock there was no furniture no place to hide the tomb was empty she backed out and holstered her pistol just a mirage of shadows and lights perhaps someone had stepped in front of one of the work lights with a final glance around she swung back to the path with determined strides she marched off toward the waiting trucks and silently scolded herself for jumping at shadows then again she had a good reason to be jumpy she pushed this thought aside as she reached the trucks the suvs carried not only kanes men but also an array of archaeological gear knowing theyd be heading out on a treasure hunt the guild had supplied her with an assortment of the usual equipment spades picks jackhammers brushes sifting screens but they had also outfitted her with stateoftheart electronic tools including a groundpenetrating radar system and an onthefly link to the landsat satellite system this last was capable of delving up to sixty feet under the sand to produce a detailed topographical map of what lay down below cassandra crossed to where one of the trucks had been offloaded to free up the metal detector she knew what tool she needed now she used a crowbar to crack open the proper crate the interior was lined with straw and styrofoam to protect the piece of equipment a guild design based on a darpa research project it looked like a shotgun but was belled at the end of the barrel and its ceramic stock was extra bulky wide enough to accept the battery block needed to charge the device digging in the crate cassandra freed the battery unit and locked it in place the device was heavy in her arms she hefted it to her shoulder and headed back to the prayer room spread along the perimeter kanes men remained at full attention there was no slacking no joking kane had trained them well cassandra followed the garden path back to the prayer room as she entered kane noted what she held in her arms his eyes glinted safia turned from where she was huddled in front of the wall she had chalked out a rectangle a foot wide at the top and about four feet tall were getting readings all along this area the curator said standing up she frowned as she caught sight of the device in cassandras arms a uls laser cassandra explained used to dig through rock but get back cassandra lifted the unit to her shoulder and pointed the belled barrel of the unit at the wall safia stepped aside cassandra pressed the button near her thumb the equivalent of a safety at her touch tiny beams of crimson light speared outward like the spray from a shower nozzle each beam was a tiny laser gun focused through alternating crystals of alexandrite and erbium cassandra centered her aim on the chalked section of wall the tiny dots of the idling laser formed a perfect circle she pulled the trigger the device vibrated on her shoulder as the array of tiny lasers began to spin faster and faster a sound beyond hearing ached the bones of her ear she concentrated staring over the barrel where the crimson beam struck the wall the stone began to disintegrate in a cloud of dust and silica for decades dentists had been using ultrasonics to scale tartar from teeth the same principle was being employed here only intensified by the concentrated energy of the lasers the sandstone continued to dissolve under the twin assault cassandra slowly swept the beam back and forth over the wall erasing the sandstone layer by layer the uls laser worked only on aggregate material like sandstone harder stone like granite was impervious to it it was even harmless to flesh the worst it would do was leave a bad sunburn she continued to work at the wall sand and dust filled the prayer room but the wind gusting through kept it relatively clear after three minutes she had worn a swath about four inches into the wall stop safia called out holding up an arm cassandra released the trigger she shifted the idling gun upward safia waved sand from her face and moved to the wall winds scurried the last of the smoky dust out through the roof as she leaned forward cassandra and kane joined her kane shone a flashlight into the cubbyhole worn by the laser a bit of metal glinted ruddy from the depths of the pocket iron safia said behind her a trace of awe in her voice a mix of pride and incredulity like the heart cassandra retreated back and lowered her weapon then lets see what prize is in this fucking cracker jack box she pulled the trigger now concentrating around the iron artifact spinning lasers again dissolved sandstone to dust eroding away layers more and more of the artifact became clear lit by the crimson glow from the stone details emerged a nose a heavy brow an eye the corner of a lip its a face safia said cassandra continued her careful sweep wiping stone away as if it were mud revealing the face beneath it seemed to be pushing out of the stone toward them my god kane muttered bringing his flashlight to bear bathing it brightly the likeness was too remarkable for chance kane glanced over to safia its you pm painter satatop the camel staring across the dark valley that separated their party from jebal eitteen atop the far hill the tomb blazed against the moonless night sky the brightness was enhanced by the nightvision goggles he wore turning the tomb into a lighthouse beacon he studied the terrain it was an easily defensible site there was only one approach the dirt road winding up the south face of the mount he adjusted the magnification on his goggles he had counted fourteen hostiles but no sign of safia she must already be within the tomb complex at least he hoped so she had to be alive the alternative was unthinkable he pulled off the goggles and attempted to shift into a comfortable position atop his camel he failed captain alhaffi sat on a camel to his right omaha on his left they both seemed as relaxed as if they were sitting on lounge chairs the saddles double vises of wood over palm thatch offered little cushioning positioned on the animals withers in front of the hump to painter it was a torture device designed by a sadistic arab after only a half hour he felt as if he were being split slowly in half like some human wishbone grimacing painter pointed down the slope well proceed as a group to the bottom of the valley then ill need ten minutes to get in position after that time everyone will slowly climb the road toward the tomb make lots of noise once you reach that last switchback stop and settle in like youre going to overnight there set up a fire itll blind their night vision let the camels graze the movement will make it easier to get yourselves into sniping positions then wait for my signal captain alhaffi nodded and passed on the instructions as he slowly worked down the line coral took the captains place at painters side she leaned forward a bit in her saddle her face tight it seemed his partner was not any happier about their mode of transportation than he was she crossed her arms atop her saddle perhaps i should be the one to take the lead on this op ive more experience with infiltration than you she lowered her voice and im less personally involved painter tightened his grip as the camel shifted under him my feelings for safia will not interfere with my abilities i meant cassandra your expartner she lifted one eyebrow are you trying to prove something is any of that energy going into this operation painter glanced to the tomb blazing atop the neighboring hill when he had been searching the complex noting terrain and manpower a part of him had also been watching for some sign of cassandra she had orchestrated everything since the british museum still he had yet to see her face how would he react she had betrayed murdered kidnapped all in the name of what cause what could make her turn against sigmaagainst him just money or was it something more he had no answers he stared at the lights was that a part of the reason he insisted on taking point on this mission to see her for himself to look in her eyes coral broke the silence dont give her any leeway no mercy no hesitation play it cold or youll lose it all he remained silent as the camels continued their slow painful trek down to the bottom of the valley the vegetation grew thicker as they descended along the dirt road tall baobab trees cast a thick canopy while massive tamarinds heavy with yellow flowers towered like sentinels everywhere ropy liana vines tangled amid wreaths of jasmine the party stopped in this patch of dense forest camels began to drop and unload their riders one of the bait kathir approached painters camel helping him couch the beast farha krr krr the man said as he stepped before the animal farha was the camels name meaning joy to painter nothing could be further from the truth the only joy he could imagine would be getting off her hump the camel dropped under him swaying backward and settling to her hindquarters painter held tightly legs clenching she then sank to her hocks in front shuffling her knees down and came to a rest on the ground with the camel couched painter slid from the saddle his legs were rubbery his thighs knotted he stumbled a few steps away as the tribesman cooed at the camel and kissed her on the nose earning a soft burble from the beast it was said the bait kathir loved their camels more than their wives it certainly seemed that way with this fellow shaking his head painter crossed to join the others captain alhaffi sat on his haunches beside sheikh emir drawing in the dirt of the road holding a penlight outlining how to best distribute the men sharif and barak watched over omaha and coral as the two americans prepped their kalashnikov rifles each of them had an israeli desert eagle pistol as a backup weapon painter took the moment to check his own guns a pair of heckler amp koch pistols in the dark he slipped out and checked the mm magazines seven rounds apiece he had two additional magazines loaded and ready in his belt satisfied he holstered the weapons one at the shoulder one at the waist omaha and coral approached him as he cinched the small ditty bag to his belly he didnt check its contents having inventoried it all back in salalah when does the tenminute clock start running omaha asked exposing his wristwatch as he stopped pushing a button to illuminate its face painter coordinated his own watch with corals breitlinger now coral caught his gaze concern in her blue eyes stay cold commander as ice he whispered omaha blocked him as he turned to the road leading up to the hilltop tomb dont come back without her this was as much a plea as a threat painter nodded acknowledging both and headed out ten minutes pm working underthe glow of a pair of floodlights safia used a pick and brush to loosen the artifact from the sandstones embrace the winds had kicked up stirring the sand and dust trapped by the four walls of the roofless prayer room safia felt caked in it a living statue of sandstone with the fall of night the temperature dropped precipitously heat lightning flickered to the south getting closer accompanied by the occasional bass rumble a clear promise of rain wearing gloves safia brushed grit from the artifact afraid of scratching it the lifesize iron bust of a woman shone in the sharp lights eyes open staring back at her safia feared that gaze and concentrated on the work at hand cassandra and kane whispered behind her cassandra had wanted to use her laser gun to finish freeing the iron artifact but safia had urged caution lest it be damaged she feared the laser might etch the metal erasing details safia picked away the last of the stone she attempted not to stare at the features but found herself glancing at it from the corner of her eye the face was remarkably similar to her own it could have been a younger version of herself perhaps at eighteen but this was impossible it had to be just a racial coincidence it merely depicted a southern arabian woman and as a native of the region safia would of course bear some resemblance even with her mixedblood heritage still it did unnerve her it was like staring at her own funereal mask especially as the bust was impaled atop an iron spear four feet long safia leaned back the artifact occupied the center of the chalked rectangle on the wall of the prayer niche the red iron spear stood upright the bust impaled atop it all one object though the sight disturbed her safia was not totally surprised it made a certain historical sense if this takes any longer cassandra interrupted her thoughts im going to pull out the goddamn uls laser again safia reached forward and tested the rocks hold on the iron object it wobbled with her touch another minute she set to work kane shifted his shadow dancing on the wall do we need to remove it maybe its facing the right direction already its facing southeast safia answered him back to the coast that cant be the way theres another riddle to solve with her words the topheavy artifact broke free of the rock and fell face forward safia caught it on her shoulder about time cassandra mumbled safia stood cradling the bust she held the spear haft in both of her gloved hands it was heavy with the iron head resting near her ear she heard the slight sloshing sound coming from inside like the heart a molten heaviness lay at its core kane took the artifact from her lifting it like it was a stalk of corn so what do we do with it cassandra pointed a flashlight back to the tomb like in salalah no safia said not this time she slipped past cassandra and led the way she thought about delaying the search dragging it out but she had heard the jingle of camel bells echoing up from the valley there was an encampment of bedouin nearby if any of them should wander up here safia hurried forward and crossed to the covered pit near the entrance to the tomb she knelt down and hauled it open cassandra shone her light down into the hole illuminating the pair of footprints safia remembered the story that had made her follow those footsteps the tale of the brass horseman who had borne a spear in his hand a spear impaled with a head safia glanced past cassandras shoulder to kane and the artifact after untold centuries she had found that spear what now cassandra asked there was only one other feature in the pit one that had yet to yield a clue the hole in the center of the pit according to the bible and the koran through this hole a magical spring had gushed forth one that led to miracles safia prayed for her own miracle she pointed to the hole plant it there kane straddled the pit positioned the haft end of the spear and settled it into the hole tight fit he stood back the spear remained standing firmly rooted the bust atop it stared out over the valley safia walked around the impaled spear as she inspected it rain spattered out of the dark skies tapping the packed dirt and stone with a sullen beat kane grumbled bloody brilliant he pulled out a ball cap and tugged it over his shaved head in moments the rain began to fall more heavily safia circled the spear a second time frowning now cassandra shared her concern nothings happening were simply missing something pass me the torch safia took off her dirty work gloves and held out a palm for the flashlight cassandra relinquished it with clear reluctance safia shone it over the length of the spear its shaft was striated at regular intervals was it decoration or something significant with no idea safia straightened from a crouch and stood behind the bust kane had planted the spear with the face still pointing south toward the sea clearly the wrong way her eyes drifted to the bust staring at the back of the head she spotted tiny writing on the base of the neck shadowed by the hairline she brought the flashlight closer the lettering must have been partially obscured by the residual dust but the rain was washing it clean four letters became clear cassandra noted her attention and the script what does it mean safia translated her frown deepening a womans name biliqis is it the woman sculpted here safia didnt answer too astounded could it be she stepped around and studied the womans face if true then this is a find of phenomenal significance biliqis was a woman revered across all faiths a woman lost in mystery and myth said to be half human half spirit of the desert i never heard of her safia cleared her throat still stunned by the discovery biliqis is better known by her title the queen of sheba as in the story of king solomon among countless other tales as rain pattered down and ran in rivulets over the iron face the statue appeared to be crying safia reached and wiped the tears from the queens cheek with her touch the bust moved as if pivoting on slippery ice swinging from her fingertips it spun once fully around then slowed and wavered to a stop staring in the opposite direction to the northeast safia glanced back to cassandra the map cassandra ordered kane get the map tomb raider december pm jebal eitteen painter checkedhis watch one more minute he lay flat on his belly at the base of a fig tree sheltered behind an acacia bush rain pitterpattered against the canopy of leaves overhead he had positioned himself far to the right of the road carefully picking his way up a nearly sheer cliff face to reach this spot he had a clear view of the parking lot with the nightvision goggles fixed to his face the guards were easy to spot in the darkness all in their blue windbreakers now with hoods pulled up against the rain most were posted near the road leading here but a few others slowly circled wider it had taken precious minutes to creep into position moving forward as the guards shifted past painter took slow steady breaths preparing himself it was a thirtyyard dash to the nearest suv he fixed the plan visualizing it refining it once things began to roll he would have no time to think only react he glanced at his watch time was up he slowly raised himself into a crouched position staying small compact he strained to listen tuning out the rain nothing he glanced at his watch again ten minutes had passed where were then he heard it a song being sung by a handful of voices rose from the valley behind him he glanced over a shoulder through his nightvision lenses the world was cast in shades of green but sharp shards of brilliance bloomed below torches and flashlights he watched the bait kathir begin a slow steady climb up the road singing as they proceeded painter swung his attention back to the tomb complex the guards had noted the stirring of the tribesmen and had slowly shifted positions to concentrate on the road two men fled into the brush flanking the road and continued down the switchback with the forces pulled away from the parked suvs painter made his move he swept from his hiding place staying low and raced across the thirty yards to the nearest truck he held his breath as he ran avoiding the noisy splash of puddles no alarm was raised reaching the first suv he ducked behind it while pulling open the oiled zipper of his ditty bag he removed the prewired c packages each wrapped in cellophane and tucked one into the trucks wheel well near the gas tank painter silently thanked cassandra for the gift of the explosives it was only fitting that he return what was hers staying low he hurried forward to the next suv and planted the second package he left the third truck untouched only checked to make sure the keys had been left in the ignition such a precaution was a common practice in an ops situation when the shit hit the fan you didnt want to have to hunt down the driver with the keys satisfied he checked the lot the guards remained focused on the approaching band of camels and men swinging around he darted toward the low wall that enclosed the tomb complex he kept the line of suvs between him and the guards behind he heard shouts rising from belowin arabicjovial arguing the singing had ceased a pair of camels bleated forlornly accompanied by the jingle of harness bells the bedouin were halfway up the hill he had to hurry painter vaulted the low wall it was only four feet high he had chosen an isolated spot behind the mosque he landed with more of a thud than he intended but the rain covered the noise with a grumble of thunder he paused light flowed down either side of the mosque coming from the courtyard in front of the building it shone blindingly bright through his nightvision goggles he heard mumbled voices but the rain drummed away any distinction he had no clue how many were out there crouching to keep his silhouette below the wall he fled along the back of the mosque keeping to the shadows he came to a back door checked the knob locked he could force the door but it would make too much noise he continued on looking for a window or another way inside he would be too exposed if he attempted to reach the central courtyard directly from either side of the building there was no shelter and too much light he needed a way through the mosque a way to get closer to abduct safia from under cassandras nose he would need to be close to the action he reached the far corner of the mosque still no windows who built a place with no windows in back he stood in a small weedy vegetable garden two date palms guarded over it painter stared up one of the palms grew close to the mosques wall shadowing the roofs edge the mosques roof was flat if he could scale the palmreach the roof he stared at the clumps of dates hanging beneath the fronds it would not be an easy climb but hed have to risk it with a deep breath he jumped as high as he could straddling his arms around the trunk hitching his feet up on it the bark offered no purchase he promptly slid down landing on his backside in the mud as he began to push back up he spotted two things both hidden behind a hedgerow flanking the back wall an aluminum ladderand a pale hand painter tensed the hand did not move he crawled forward parting the bushes a ladder leaned against the back wall along with a pair of clipping shears of course there had to be a way to reach those hanging dates he should have known to search for a ladder he moved to the figure stretched out on the ground it was an older arab man in a dishdasha robe embroidered with gold thread he was most likely a member of the tombs staff a caretaker of some sort he lay in the dirt unmoving painter pressed fingers to the mans throat he was still warm a slow pulse beat under painters fingers alive unconscious painter straightened had cassandra darted the man as she had done to clay but why drag him back here and hide him it made no sense but he had no time to ponder the mystery he hauled out the ladder checked to make sure he was still hidden from the guards and propped it against the back wall of the mosque the ladder reached just shy of the roofline good enough he quickly scaled the rungs as he climbed he glanced over his shoulder he saw that the guards had moved to block the road completely downslope he spotted the lights and torches of the bait kathir clan as they clustered a short way down they had stopped and begun to make camp he heard occasional snatches of loud voices all in arabic as the men kept up the pretext of nomadic travelers bunking down for the night reaching the top of the ladder painter grabbed the edge of the roof and hauled himself up hooking a leg over the lip and rolling out of sight staying low he hurried across the roof aiming for the minaret near the front just a few feet above the roofline an open balcony encircled the tower where the call to prayer would be sung for the local worshipers it was easy to grab the railing and vault over the balustrade painter crouched and edged around the balcony he had a birdseye view of the courtyard it was too bright for his nightvision gear so he pushed the goggles up and studied the layout across the way the small set of ruins blazed with light a flashlight lay abandoned near the entrance to the neighboring tomb its shine illuminated a metal pole planted in the ground it appeared to be surmounted by some sculpture a bust by the looks of it voices rose from belowcoming from the squat tomb its door to the courtyard lay open lights glowed from inside he heard a familiar voice show us on the map it was cassandra painters gut clenched fiery and determined then safia answered her it makes no sense it could be anywhere painter crouched lower thank god she was still alive a surge of relief and renewed concern swept through him how many people were with her he spent a few minutes studying the shadows across the frosted windows it was hard to say but it didnt appear that more than four were in the room he watched the courtyard for additional guards it remained quiet everyone seemed to be in the one building out of the rain if he moved quickly as he began to swing away a figure stepped out of the tomb doorway a tall muscular man dressed in black painter froze afraid of being spotted the man tucked the brim of a ball cap farther over his eyes and shoved into the rain he crossed and knelt beside the pole painter spied as the man reached to the bottom of the pole and ran his fingers slowly up its length what the hell was he doing reaching the top of the shaft the man stood and hurried back to the tomb shaking out his ball cap sixtynine he said as he disappeared inside are you sure cassandra again yes im bloody damned sure painter dared wait no longer he ducked through the archway to reach the tower stairs that spiraled down into the mosque he flipped his nightvision goggles in place and inspected the dark staircase it seemed quiet he pulled free his pistol and thumbed off the safety wary of guards he proceeded with one shoulder near the wall gun pointed forward he continued down the short spiral sweeping the mosques prayer room as he descended highlighted in green the room was empty prayer mats stacked in back he stepped out and moved toward the entryway in front the outer doors were open he pushed the goggles back up and sidled to the entrance he crouched to one side a covered porch spread along the front directly ahead three steps led down to the courtyard to either side a short stucco wall framed the porch topped by arched openings painter waited and checked the immediate area the courtyard remained empty voices murmured across the way if he dashed across to the tomb hid outside the doorway painter calculated in his head unblinking for this to work speed was essential he straightened pistol held steady a slight noise froze him in place it came from behind an electric thrill of terror lanced through him he wasnt alone he swept around in a crouch pistol pointing into the depths of the mosque out of the gloom a pair of dark shadows stalked toward him eyes glowing in the reflected light of the courtyard feral and hungry leopards as silent as the night the two cats closed in on him pm show meon the map cassandra said the curator knelt on the floor of the tomb she had spread out the same map as before a straight blue line led from the first tomb on the coast to this one in the mountains now a second line this one in red branched away heading northeast crossing out of the mountains and into a great blank expanse of the desert the rub alkhali the vast empty quarter of arabia safia shook her head running a finger along the line out into the sands it makes no sense it could be anywhere cassandra stared down at the map for several breaths they were looking for a lost city in the desert it had to be somewhere along that line but where the line crossed through the center of the vast expanse it could be anywhere were still missing something safia said leaning back on her heels she rubbed her temples kanes radio buzzed interrupting them he spoke into his throat mike how many a long pause okay just keep a bloody close eye on them keep them away let me know if anything changes cassandra eyed him as he finished he shrugged those sand rats we saw on the side of the road have returned theyre setting up camp where we spotted them earlier cassandra noted the concern in safias face the woman feared for her countrymens safety good order your men to shoot anyone who gets close safia tensed at her words cassandra pointed to the map the sooner we solve this mystery the sooner were out of here that should light a fire under the curator safia stared sullenly at the map there must be some distance marker built into the artifact something we missed a way to determine how far down this red line we must travel safia closed her eyes rocking a bit then she suddenly stopped what cassandra asked the spear she said glancing to the door i noticed striations along its shaft marks scored into it i thought them merely decoration but back in the ancient past measurements were often recorded as notches on a stick so you think the number of marks could signify a distance safia nodded and began to stand i have to count them cassandra distrusted the woman it would be easy to lie and lead them astray she needed accuracy kane go out and count the number of marks he grimaced but obeyed slapping on his sodden ball cap after he left cassandra crouched by the map this has to be the final location first the coast then the mountain now the desert safia shrugged youre probably right the number three is significant to ancient faiths whether its the trinity of the christian godthe father the son and the holy spiritor the ancient celestial trinity the moon the sun and the morning star kane appeared in the doorway shaking rain from his cap sixtynine are you sure he scowled at her yes im bloody damned sure sixtynine safia said that has to be right why cassandra asked turning her attention back to the curator as she bent over the map six and nine safia explained to the map multiples of three just like we were talking about sequential too a very magical number and here i always thought sixtynine meant something else kane said seemingly deaf to the man safia continued to work measuring with a protractor and tapping a calculator cassandra watched over her this is sixtynine miles along the red line safia circled the spot it ends up here in the desert cassandra knelt down took the protractor and rechecked her measurements she stared at the red circle noting the longitude and latitude in her head so this may be the location of the lost city safia nodded she continued to stare at the map as best i can tell cassandras brow crinkled sensing the woman was keeping something from her she could almost see the woman calculating something in her head she grabbed safias wrist what are you holding back a shot rang out nearby clipping away any further words it could be a misfire it could be one of the bedouin shooting off his rifle but cassandra knew better she swung around painter pm painters firstshot went wild as he fell backward out the mosques doorway and onto the porch a corner of a wall blasted away in a shower of plaster inside the leopards parted vanishing into the shadows of the mosque painter flung himself to the side sheltering behind the half wall of the porch stupid he shouldnt have shot he had reacted out of instinct selfpreservation that wasnt like him but some terror beyond the leopards had gripped him as if something had jangled the deepest root of his brain and now he had given away the element of surprise painter the shout came from the direction of the tomb it was cassandra painter dared not move leopards prowled on the inside cassandra on the outside the lady or the tiger in this case both meant death i know you came for the woman cassandra shouted into the rain a rumble of thunder punctuated her words painter remained quiet cassandra couldnt know for sure in which direction his gunshot had come from sound traveled oddly among these mountainous hills he imagined her hiding in the tomb calling out from the doorway she dared not move into the open she knew he was armed but she didnt know where he was how could he use that to his advantage if you dont show yourselfarms up hands emptyin the next ten seconds im going to shoot the prisoner he had to think quickly to reveal himself now would only mean his death along with safias i knew youd come crowe did you really think that id believe you were heading to the border of yemen painter flinched he had sent out the email only hours ago planted with false information delivered through a secure server to his boss it had been a test balloon as he feared word had reached cassandra intact a sense of despair settled over him that could only mean one thing the betrayal of sigma started at the very top sean mcknighthis own boss was that why sean had paired him with cassandra to begin with it seemed impossible painter closed his eyes and took a deep breath sensing his isolation he was now alone out here cut off he had no one to contact no one to trust oddly this thought only helped energize him he felt a giddy sense of freedom he had to rely on himself and his immediate resources that would have to be enough painter reached into his ditty bag and palmed the radio transmitter thunder growled throatier guttural rain fell harder five seconds crowe all the time in the world he stabbed the transmitters button and rolled toward the stairs pm from seventyyards away omaha jolted as the twin explosions rocketed the two suvs into the air as bright as lightning strikes the dark night went brilliant the concussion squeezed his ears thundered in his rib cage it was painters signal he had secured safia a moment ago omaha had heard a single gunshot terrifying him now flames and debris rained down across the parking lot men lay sprawled in the dirt two were on fire bathed in burning gasoline it was time to move now omaha shouted but his yell sounded tinny in his own ears still rifle fire spat out of the forest to either side of omaha additionally a few flashes of muzzle fire sparked from a high shoulder that overlooked the parking lot coming from a pair of bait kathir snipers up at the tomb two guards had been picking themselves off the ground they suddenly jerked bodies thrown backward shot other guards sought cover reacting with wellhoned skill these were no amateurs they retreated over the compound walls seeking fast cover omaha lifted his binoculars atop the hills plateau the two burning suvs lit the parking lot the third vehicle had been shoved a few feet by the concussion pools of flaming gasoline dotted the dirt and hood steaming in the rain painter was supposed to use the vehicle as an escape vehicle he shouldve been there by now where was he what was he waiting for an ululating cry rose to omahas right bells jangled a dozen camels scattered uphill amid them ran more of the bait kathir cover fire rained from out of the tree line a few shots now answered a camel bellowed dropping to one knee skidding in the dirt an explosion ripped into the hillside off to omahas left a flash of fire and torn tree limbs smoking leaves and dirt flumed upward a grenade and then a new sound it came from the deep gorge to the right shit five small helicopters rose into view as swift as gnats and as tiny oneman vehicles just blades engine and pilot they looked like flying sleds spotlights swept the grounds peppering the area with automatic gunfire camels and men fled in all directions omaha clenched a fist the bitch had been expecting them shed had a backup force lying in wait an ambush how had she known coral and barak appeared at omahas elbow painters going to need help coral hissed he cant reach the escape vehicle now its too exposed omaha glanced up to the lot now a bloodbath of bodies and camels from the forest shots fired up at the helicopters driving them higher but they continued a zigzagging pattern over the compound guarding it tightly the entire plan had fallen to shit but safia was up there omaha was not leaving her again coral freed her pistol im going in omaha grabbed her arm her muscles were cords of steel he held tight brooking no argument this time were all going in pm kara stareddown at the kalashnikov rifle on her lap fingers twitching uncontrollably on the stock she found it hard to concentrate her eyes felt too large for her head threatening a migraine while nausea lapped at her belly she dreamed of a little orange pill to her side clay fought to get the engine started he cranked it again but it failed to turn over danny sat in the backseat with the lone pistol the explosion had lit up the northern hills like a rising sun it was painters signal across the intervening two valleys echoing spatters of gunfire sounded like fireworks piece of shit clay swore and struck his hand on the steering wheel youve flooded it danny said sourly from the back kara stared out the passenger window a ruddy glow persisted to the north it had started if all went well the others would be racing downhill in one of the kidnappers suvs the remainder of the party would scatter into the hills the bait kathir knew many paths through the forested mountains but something felt wrong maybe it was just the edgy frazzle in karas head it grew more acute with each breath pain lanced behind her eyes even the light of the dashboard stabbed painfully bright youre going to wear the battery down danny warned as clay engaged the engine again let it rest five minutes at least a buzzing filled karas skull as if her body were an antenna tuning in on static she had to move she could no longer sit still she pulled open the latch and half fell out the door bobbling her rifle what are you doing clay called to her frightened she didnt answer she stepped into the road the van had been pulled under the branches of a tamarind tree she crossed out into the open and wandered a short distance up the road out of sight of the van gunfire continued to echo kara ignored it her attention focused closer at hand an old woman stood in the roadway facing kara as if waiting for her she was dressed in a long desert cloak her face hidden behind a black veil in her bony fingers she carried a staff of gnarled wood worn smooth and shiny karas head throbbed then the static in her head finally tuned to a proper station pain and nausea drained from her she felt momentarily weightless unburdened the woman merely stared numbness filled the empty spaces inside her she didnt fight it the rifle dropped from karas limp fingers she will need you the woman finally said turning away kara followed after the stranger moving as if in a dream back by the tamarind tree she heard the vans engine crank and fail kara continued walking leaving the road behind and heading down into the forested valley kara did not resist even if she had been able to she knew who needed her pm safia hadbeen forced to her knees hands on top of her head cassandra crouched behind her a pistol pressed at the base of her skull another pointed toward the entrance they both faced the doorway poised tensely on the far side of the chamber the grave mound stood between them and the exit with the explosion cassandra had extinguished the lights and sent kane out a back window to circle around to hunt down painter safia clenched her fingers together could it be true could painter still be alive be somewhere out there if that was so had the others survived tears welled no matter what she was not alone painter had to be out there gunfire still rattled from beyond the compound fires cast the night in crimson and shadow she heard the beat of helicopters spatters of automatic fire just let us go safia pleaded you have ubars location cassandra remained silent in the dark her full attention on the door and windows safia didnt know if she had even heard her plea from beyond the door a shuffling sound reached them someone was coming painter or kane across the doorway a large shadow passed lit momentarily by the lone flashlight still out in the courtyard a camel it was a surreal sight as it sauntered past soaked by the rain in its wake a woman stood framed in the doorway naked she seemed to shimmer in the crimson glow of the nearby fires you cassandra gasped in one hand the stranger carried the silver case containing the iron heart it had been resting just outside the door no you dont bitch cassandra fired her pistol two rounds deafeningly close to safias left ear crying out from the painful sound of the blast safia fell forward onto one of the prayer rugs she rolled a step away toward the grave mound cassandra followed still firing at the door safia craned up her head ringing the doorway was empty again she glanced sidelong to cassandra whod assumed a shooters stance both pistols pointed toward the open door safia saw her chance she grabbed the edge of the prayer rug which she now shared with cassandra in a swift motion she lunged up dragging the rug with her caught by surprise cassandra toppled her feet going out from under her a pistol fired plaster shattered from the ceiling as cassandra fell backward safia dove over the grave mound and rolled toward the door at the entrance she leaped headlong over the threshold another blast in midair safia felt a kick in her shoulder shoving her around she hit the ground and skidded in the mud her shoulder burned shot panicked reacting on pure instinct she rolled to the side away from the doorway rain washed over her she scrambled around the corner pushing through a hedgerow to enter the narrow alley between the tomb and the ruins of the prayer room as she reached cover a hand from behind reached out of the darkness and clamped over her mouth hard bruising her lips pm painter heldtight to safia clinging to her stay quiet he whispered in her ear leaning against the wall of the ruins she quaked in his grip he had been hiding here for the past few minutes watching the courtyard attempting to ascertain some way to draw cassandra out but his expartner seemed entrenched patient letting her team do the work for her while she guarded the prize spotlights from the hovering helicopters crisscrossed the yard keeping him pinned down again cassandra had outwitted him hiding an aerial force probably sent here in advance all seemed hopeless then a moment ago he had watched a camel stroll by through the rain seemingly unconcerned by the gunfire moving with steady determination to pass his hiding place and disappear in front of the tomb next a spatter of shots and safia came tumbling out we have to reach the back wall of the complex he whispered motioning down the alleyway there was too much gunfire coming from out front theyd have to take their chances on the steep slopes out back try to reach cover he released his grip on her but she still clung to him keep behind me he urged twisting around painter led the way in a low crouch heading back toward the rear of the complex the shadows lay thicker there he kept a keen watch through his nightvision glasses wary and tense pistol pointed forward nothing moved the world was defined in shades of green if they could reach the far wall that encircled the complex taking another step he saw the alleyway bloom with light blindingly bright through the goggles burning the back of his eye sockets he tore away the scopes dont move painter froze a man lay flat atop the wall of the ruins he held a flashlight in one hand a pistol in the other both aimed at painter dont even twitch the man warned kane safia moaned behind him painter cursed silently the man had been lying in wait atop the wall spying from on high waiting until they had moved into his line of sight drop your weapon painter had no choice if he refused hed be shot where he stood he let the pistol fall from his fingers a new voice called sharply from behind him coming from the entrance to the alleyway cassandra just shoot him pm omaha crouchedbeside coral as she finished checking the body on the ground barak covered them with his rifle they were hidden at the edge of the parking lot awaiting a chance to make a run across the open space clutching his desert eagle omaha fought to keep his heart from hammering out of his chest he seemed incapable of getting enough oxygen a minute ago he had heard pistol blasts from within the complex safia ahead the parking lot was still lit by flaming pools of gasoline a pair of helicopters swept by overhead searchlights crisscrossing in a deadly pattern both sides had settled into a standoff only occasional spates of gunfire shattered the stillness lets go coral said standing up still shadowed by the limbs of the wild fig tree her eyes were on the skies she watched a second pair of helicopters swoop overhead be ready to run omaha frownedthen saw the grenade resting in her palm taken from the dead guard at her feet she pulled the pin and stepped out into the open her full attention on the skies she pulled her arm back leaning like a pitcher onto one leg she held that stance for a breath what are you doing omaha asked physics she answered vector analysis timing angle of ascent she threw the grenade with a wicked fling of her entire body omaha immediately lost sight of it in the darkness run coral dove ahead following the momentum of her toss before omaha could even move the grenade exploded overhead in a brilliant flash lighting up the underbelly of the oneman craft its spotlight swung wildly as the concussion hit it shrapnel ripped into the belly a piece must have struck its fuel tank the copter blew up in a fiery bloom run coral called again urging omaha to move barak was already on corals heels omaha ran debris rained down off to the right a piece of rotor impacted the ground with a thunking twang then the flaming bulk smashed into the tree line casting up backwash of fire and black smoke he continued his flight across the lot the other helicopters had swung away scattering like a flock of startled crows ahead coral reached the lone suv she flew into the drivers seat barak hauled open the back door leaving the front passenger seat to omaha as his fingers closed on the door the trucks engine roared to life omaha had barely gotten the door open when coral shifted into gear and hit the accelerator omahas arm was wrenched he had to run and leap inside coral had no time for stragglers he fell into the seat as a rifle blast exploded omaha ducked but the shot was not from the enemy from the backseat barak had shot out the trucks moonroof he used an elbow to crack away the shattered safety glass then shoved his body up through the opening along with his rifle he immediately began firing as coral fought the steering wheel spinning tires in the mud the truck slipped as she made a sharp turn toward the open gate in the compound wall wheels mired the suv struggled to move another helicopter hove into view blades angled steeply automatic fire flashed from its nose chattering and digging a trough toward their mudbogged vehicle it would slice them in half coral grabbed the stick shoved the suv into reverse and jammed the accelerator the suv found traction again barreled backward as the guillotine of bullets sliced just inches in front of the bumper a second helicopter dove toward them barak opened fire skyward the copters searchlight shattered away but it kept coming still going in reverse coral spun the wheel the car fishtailed in the mud omaha your left while barak was busy with the helicopter one of the guards had decided to take advantage of his inattention the man rose with his rifle on his shoulder omaha leaned back in his seat the suv swung to face the man no choice omaha fired his desert eagle through the windshield he squeezed two more shots the safety glass held but fractured into spiderwebs the guard ducked away the suv caught traction in the fresh mud and sped across the lot still in reverse craned around coral expertly maneuvered the vehicle aiming for the gate to the compound going in ass backward pursued by the helicopters hold on pm pinned inthe alley safia stood between painter and cassandra ahead kane pointed his gun everyone had frozen for half a breath as the helicopter exploded behind them shoot him cassandra repeated staying focused no safia attempted to step around painter to shield him every movement flamed her shoulder blood ran down her arm kill him and i wont help you youll never discover the secret at ubar painter held her back protecting her from kane cassandra pushed through the hedge kane you have your order safia glanced between the two armed assailants she spotted a shift of shadows behind the man something rose from a crouch sharing the crest of the wall eyes shone a feral red painter tensed beside her with a growled roar the leopard pounced on kane his pistol fired safia felt the shot whistle past her ear and strike the dirt with a thud man and cat tumbled off the wall into the prayer room beyond painter ducked grabbed safias arm and swung her behind him as he turned to face cassandra he had a second pistol in his free hand he fired cassandra leaped backward crashing through the bushes the bullet missed clipping the corner of the tomb she ducked to the side next door screams arosebloody and sharp it was impossible to discern man from beast bullets ricocheted off the sandstone walls as cassandra returned fire staying low around the corner shooting through the bushes painter pushed safia against the tombs wall out of direct line of fireat least for the moment make for the outer wall he urged and shoved her down the alley what about you shell follow us the slopes too exposed he intended to hold cassandra at bay but you goddamnit go he pushed her harder safia stumbled down the alley the sooner she reached safety the sooner painter could make his own escape so she justified it in her head but a part of her knew she was simply running for her own life with each step her shoulder throbbed protesting her cowardly flight still she kept going the exchange of gunfire continued in the neighboring ruins of the prayer room all had gone deathly quiet the fate of kane unknown more gunfire erupted from the parking lot a helicopter flashed low overhead whipping up the rain with its rotor wash reaching the end of the alleyway safia lunged across the wet gardens toward the far wall it was only four feet high but with her wounded shoulder she feared shed never make it over blood soaked through the shirt from beneath a baobab tree a camel appeared on the far side of the wall it moved to meet her it seemed to be the same camel that had sauntered past the tombs door earlier in fact it had the same companion the naked woman only now she rode atop the camel safia didnt know whether to trust the stranger or not but if cassandra shot at her then the woman had to be on her side the enemy of my enemy the stranger offered her arm as safia reached the wallthen spoke it wasnt arabic or english yet safia understood itnot because she had studied the language which she had but because it seemed to translate through her skull on its own welcome sister the stranger said in aramaic the dead language of this land be at peace safia reached for the womans hand fingers gripped hers hard and strong she felt herself pulled up effortlessly pain lanced out shooting down her wounded arm a cry escaped her blackness closed her vision to a pinpoint peace the woman repeated softly safia felt the word wash over her through her taking pain and the world with it she slumped and slipped away pm painter pulledthe screen off the window beside his head it was a flimsy affair with his back pressed against the tombs wall he fired his pistol twice keeping cassandra at bay he used his palm to slide open the window thankfully it was unlocked he glanced down the alleyway and watched safia vanish around the corner dropping to a knee painter fired another shot ejected his clip grabbed another from his belt and slammed it home cassandra fired again the slug struck the wall by his leg where was another goddamn leopard when you needed one painter returned a shot then holstered his weapon without a second glance he leaped up boosted himself through the window and fell in an undignified tumble into the tomb inside he rolled to his feet his eyes discerned a central shrouded mound he kept to the wall and circled the gravesite his pistol back in his hand aimed at the door crossing past the back window he felt a wet breeze through it so that was how that bastard got the jump on me painter glanced through the window noting movement outside beyond the wall a camel turned away heading down the far slope a naked woman sat astride it seemingly guiding it with her knees in her arms she cradled another woman limp unmoving safia the camel and its riders descended out of sight a pair of leopards bounded from the dark gardens to the wall then away following the camel before he could decide to pursue or not painter heard a scuff by the door he dropped and turned a shadow lay draped across the entry this isnt over crowe cassandra called in to him painter kept his pistol trained a new roar reached his ears a truck barreling his way shots fired he recognized the retort of a kalashnikov someone from his own group cassandras shadow vanished sweeping out of sight retreating painter hurried to the door keeping his weapon ready he spotted a discarded map on the floor he reached down and crumpled it in a fist out in the courtyard one of the mitsubishi trucks bounced through the gardens digging ragged furrows a figure protruded through the moonroof a muzzle pointed skyward flashed barak painter checked the rest of the yard it appeared empty cassandra had retreated into hiding outgunned for the brief moment he stepped out of the tomb and waved the crumpled map spotting him the driver of the mitsubishi swung sharply its back bumper aimed for him he fell back inside to avoid getting hit the suv skidded to a stop scraping paint off its side panels its backseat door landed abreast of the tomb he spotted coral in the drivers seat get in barak called painter glanced back to the tombs back window safia whoever had taken her they had at least been heading away out of immediate harm that would have to do for now turning back he popped the handle dove inside and slammed the door go he called to the front coral jostled the suv into forward gear and the truck sped away a pair of helicopters gave chase barak shot at them from his topside vantage the suv raced toward the open gate coral leaned forward to peer through the cracked windshield they swept out of the complex bounced over a muddy rut momentarily airborne then jammed back down wheels spun caught and the suv sped toward the road and the cover of the heavy forest from the front omaha stared back at him eyes lost wheres safia gone painter shook his head unblinking shes gone mountain trek december am dhofar mountains safia wokefrom slumber falling she threw her arms out panic racking her body as familiar as her own breath agony speared her shoulder calm yourself sister someone said near her ear i have you the world swirled into focus midnight dark she was propped against a couched camel who chewed its cud with indifference a woman loomed at her side an arm under her good shoulder holding her up where she mumbled but her lips seemed glued together she tried to find her legs but failed memory slowly returned the fight at the tomb gunfire filled her head flashes of images one face painter she shuddered in the womans arms what had happened where was she she finally found enough strength to stand leaning heavily on the camel safia noted that her wounded shoulder had been crudely bandaged wrapped to slow the bleeding it ached with every movement the woman at her side shadowy in the gloom appeared to be the one who had rescued her only now she wore a desert cloak help comes the other whispered who are you she forced out suddenly noting the cold of the night she was in some jungle grotto the rain had stopped but drops still wept from the canopy overhead palm and tamarind trees rose all around her tangles of lianas and hanging gardens of jasmine draped everywhere perfuming the air the woman remained silent she pointed an arm a bit of fiery light pierced the jungle ahead glowing brightly through the ropy vines someone was coming bearing aloft a torch or lamp safia had an urge to flee but her body was too weak to obey the arm around her shoulder squeezed as if the woman had heard her heart but it didnt feel like she was attempting to hold safia captive only to reassure her in moments safias eyes acclimated to the gloom enough to recognize that the jungle immediately before her hid a rocky limestone cliff thick with vines creepers and small bushes the approaching light came from a tunnel in the face of the cliff such caverns and passages riddled the dhofar mountains formed from the trickles of monsoon flows melting through the limestone as the light reached the tunnel entrance safia spotted three figures an old woman a child of perhaps twelve and a second young woman who couldve been the twin of the one beside her all were identically dressed in desert cloaks hoods thrown back additionally each bore an identical bit of decoration a ruby tattoo at the outer corner of the left eye a single teardrop even the child who carried the glass oil lantern she who was lost the woman at her side intoned has come home the elder said leaning on a cane her hair was gray tied in a braid but her face though lined looked vital safia found it hard to meet those eyes but also impossible to turn away be welcome the elder said speaking english stepping aside safia was assisted through the entrance supported by the woman once she was through the child led the way lantern held high the elderly woman kept behind them thudding with a walking stick the third woman left the tunnel and strode to the couched camel safia was led onward no one spoke for several steps safia edgy with questions could not hold her tongue who are you what do you want with me her voice sounded petulant even to her own ears be at peace the elderly woman whispered behind her you are safe for now safai added silently she had noted the long dagger carried in the belt of the woman who had left the tunnel behind them all answers will be given by our hodja safia startled a hodja was a tribal shaman always female they were the keepers of knowledge healers oracles who were these people as she continued she noted a continual wisp of jasmine in the air the scent calmed her reminding her of home of mother of security still the pain in her wounded shoulder kept her focused blood had begun to flow anew through the bandage and down her arm she heard a scuffing sound behind her she glanced over her shoulder the third woman had returned she bore two burdens collected from the camel in one hand she carried the silver suitcase battered now that held the iron heart and on her shoulder leaned the iron spear with its bust of the queen of sheba they had stolen the two artifacts from cassandra safias heart thudded louder vision tightening were they thieves had she been rescued or been kidnapped again the tunnel stretched ahead continuing deep under the mountain they had passed side tunnels and caves angling this way and that she was quickly lost where were they taking her finally the air seemed to freshen growing stronger the scent of jasmine richer the passage lightened ahead she was led forward a wind flowed down the throat of the tunnel coming from up ahead as they rounded a bend the tunnel dumped into a large cavern safia stepped into it no not a cavern but a great bowl of an amphitheater the roof of which high overhead bore a small opening to the sky water flowed through the hole in a long trickling waterfall draining into a small pond below five tiny campfires circled the pool like the points of a star illuminating the flowering vines that wreathed the room and hung in long tangles from the roof some reaching the shallow bowl of the floor safia recognized the geology it was one of the countless sinkholes that peppered the region some of the deepest were found in oman safia gaped more cloaked figures moved or sat about the chamber some thirty or so faces turned toward her as the party entered the illuminated cavern reminded safia of the thieves cave from the story of ali baba only these forty thieves were all women all ages safia stumbled into the room suddenly weak from the trek blood running hot down one arm the rest of her body shivering a figure rose by one of the fires safia she focused on the speaker the woman was not dressed like the others safia could make no sense of her presence here kara am thumrait air base oman cassandra leanedover the chart table in the captains office using a satellite map of the region she had recreated the curators map with a blue sharpie marker she had drawn a line from the tomb in salalah to the one in the mountains and with a red marker a line from jobs tomb to the open desert she had circled their destination in red the location of the lost city her present position thumrait air base lay only thirty miles away how quickly can you have the supplies ready she asked the young captain licked his lips he was the leader of the harvest falcon depot the usafs source of supplies and war materials for its bases and troops throughout the region he carried a clipboard and tapped items off with the tip of a ballpoint pen tents shelters equipment rations fuel water medical supplies and generators are already being loaded into transport helicopters youll be supplied onsite at zero seven hundred as instructed she nodded the man still wore a frown as he studied their place of deployment this is the middle of the desert refugees are funneling into the air base hourly i dont see how placing an advance camp out there will help a gust of wind rattled the asphalt shingles atop the building you have your orders captain garrison yes sir but his eyes looked little settled especially when he glanced out the window to the hundred men lounging on packs checking weapons wearing duncolored sand fatigues no insignia cassandra let him have his doubts as she headed to the door the captain had received his orders passed through the chain of command from washington he was to aid her in outfitting her team guild command had orchestrated the cover story cassandras team was a searchandrescue unit sent to help refugees fleeing the coming sandstorm and to aid in any rescue during the storm itself they had five allterrain trucks with giant sand tires an eighteenton m highspeed desert tractor a pair of transport hueys and six of the oneman vtol copter sleds each fitted and lashed to openbed fourwheeldrive trucks the overland team would leave within the half hour she would be accompanying them exiting the command depot for harvest falcon cassandra checked her watch the sandstorm was due to slam into the region in another eight hours reports were coming in of winds gusting to eighty mph already the winds here where the mountains met the desert were kicking up and they were heading into the teeth of the storm they had no choice word had come from guild command some hint that the source of the antimatter could be destabilizing that it could selfdestruct before it was discovered that must not happen timetables had been accelerated cassandra searched the dark airfield she watched a lumbering british vc tanker touch ground off in the distance illuminated by landing lights guild command had shipped in the men and additional equipment yesterday the minister had coordinated with her personally after the firefight last night it was damn lucky she had learned the location of the lost city before losing safia with such a significant discovery the minister had been grudgingly satisfied with her performance she was not she pictured painter crouched in the alley between the ruins and the tomb the sharpness of his eyes the crinkles of concentration the way he moved so swiftly pivoting on one leg sweeping out his gun she should have shot him in the back when she had the chance she risked hitting safia but she had lost the woman anyway still cassandra hadnt shot even when painter swung on her she had paused a fraction of a second falling back instead of pushing forward she clenched a fist she had hesitated she cursed herself as much as she cursed painter she would not make that mistake a second time she stared across the acres of tarmac and gravel would he come she had noted that he had stolen her map during his escape along with one of the vehicles her own truck they found it abandoned and stripped of gear buried in the forest a few miles down the road but painter had the map he would definitely come yet not before she was ready for him she had plenty of manpower and firepower to hold off an army out there let him try she would not hesitate a second time a figure appeared from a small outbuilding near the parked trucks her temporary command center john kane strode toward her his left leg stiff in a splint he scowled as he stomped to her side the left side of his face was sealed with surgical glue giving his features a bluish tint beneath the glue claw marks slashed across his cheek and throat blackened with iodine his eyes glinted brighter than usual in the sodium lights a slight morphine haze he refused to be left behind cleanup was completed an hour ago he said tucking back his radio mike assets have all been cleared out she nodded all evidence of their involvement with the firefight at the tomb had been removed bodies weapons even the wreckage of the vtol copter sled any word on crowes crew vanished into the mountains scattered there are side roads and camel trails throughout the mountains and heavy patches of forest in all the deep valleys he and those sand rats have tucked their tails and gone into hiding cassandra had expected as much the firefight had left her team with limited manpower for a proper pursuit and search they had to take care of their own wounded and clear the site before local authorities responded to the fiery attack she had evacuated in the first airlift radioing guild command of the operation playing down the chaos highlighting their discovery of the true site of ubar the information had bought her life and she knew to whom she was indebted for that what about the museum curator she asked i have men patrolling the mountains still no trace of her signal cassandra frowned the microtransceiver she had implanted on the woman had a range of ten miles how was it possible that they hadnt picked up her signal maybe interference from the mountains maybe it was the storm system either way shed eventually expose herself shed be found cassandra pictured the small pellet of c incorporated into the transceiver safia might have escapedbut she was dead already lets move out she said am dhofar mountains good girlsaff omaha mumbled painter stirred from his post by the road what had the man discovered with his nightvision glasses he had been watching the dirt track the volkswagen eurovan stood parked under a stand of trees omaha and the others gathered at the back of the van the tailgate ajar omaha and danny were bent over the map he had stolen from the tomb site next to them coral had been inventorying their supplies pilfered from the back of cassandras suv downslope from the tomb they had run into clay and danny frantic about karas disappearance they had found her rifle in the road but no sign of the woman herself they had called and called for her but no answer and with cassandra on their tail and helicopters in the air they could not wait long while painter and omaha searched for kara the others had hurriedly shoved all the supplies from the suv into the eurovan then drove the suv over a steep slope painter feared cassandra would track them with its gps feature just as he had additionally the eurovan was unknown to her a small advantage so they had taken off hoping kara had kept her head low painter paced the road now less settled with his decision they had found no body where had kara gone did her disappearance have something to do with her withdrawal from the drug he took a deep breath maybe it was best away from them kara might have a better chance of surviving still painter paced off to the side barak shared a smoke with clay the two men a contrast in size form and philosophy bonded by the lure of tobacco barak knew the mountains and had led them through a series of rutted roads well camouflaged they ran with their lights off going as fast as safety allowed stopping at times whenever the sound of helicopters approached it was just six of them now he and coral omaha and danny barak and clay the fate of captain alhaffi and sharif remained unknown scattered to the winds with the fleeing bait kathir they could only hope for the best after three hours of harried driving they had stopped to rest regroup plan what to do next all they had to guide them from here were the inked marks on the map at the van omaha straightened a kink in his back with a pop that was heard all the way to the road she tricked the bitch with the mountain valley quiet and dark painter walked back to join the others what are you talking about omaha waved him over come see this painter joined him at least omahas belligerence toward him had lessened en route painter had related his story of the leopards the firefight the intervention of the strange woman omaha finally seemed to settle on the belief that as long as safia was away from cassandra it was an improvement omaha pointed to the map see these lines the blue one clearly leads from the tomb in salalah to jobs tomb here in the mountains safia mustve found some clue at the first tomb to lead to the second painter nodded okay what about the red line safia found some clue at jobs tomb too the metal post with a bust on it i suppose it doesnt matter any longer see here shes marked a circle along this red line out in the desert like this is where to go next the location of ubar painter felt a sick sinking feeling if cassandra already knew where it was no its not the location danny said omaha nodded i measured it the circle is marked sixtynine miles from jobs tomb along this red line painter had debriefed them on all the details including overhearing the tall man call out the number sixtynine measuring something along the pole so it matches the number i heard painter said but they figured miles omaha said our miles so omaha gave him a look as if it were obvious if that artifact they found at jobs tomb was dated the same as the iron heartand why wouldnt it bethen it goes back to sometime around bc okay painter said accepting the fact back then a mile was defined by the romans a mile was calculated as five thousand roman feet and a roman foot is only eleven and a half inches safia would know this she let cassandra believe it was modern miles she sent the bitch on a wildgoose chase so whats the real distance painter asked moving closer to the map at his side omaha chewed the edge of his thumb clearly doing a calculation in his head after a moment he spoke sixtynine roman miles is equivalent to just over sixty three modern miles hes right coral said she had been doing her own calculation so safia sent cassandra six miles past the true location painter frowned thats not too far in the desert omaha countered six miles is more like six hundred painter didnt squash the mans pride in safia but he knew the ruse would not fool cassandra for long as soon as she realized that nothing was at that false site shed start consulting someone would solve the mystery painter estimated safias ruse bought them a day or two at most so where on the map is the true location painter asked omaha bobbed his head excited lets find out he quickly adjusted his strings and pins measuring and rechecking a frown crinkled his brow that doesnt make sense he stuck a pin in the map painter leaned over and read the name pinned there shisur omaha shook his head dismay in his voice its been a goddamn wildgoose chase all along what do you mean omaha continued to frown at the map as if it were to blame danny answered for him shisur is where the old ruins of ubar were originally discovered back in by nicolas clapp and a few others danny glanced to painter theres nothing there all this running around just leads to a place thats already been discovered and scoured painter could not accept that there has to be something omaha slammed a fist on the map ive been there myself its a dead end all this danger and bloodshedfor nothing there has to be something everyone has missed painter persisted everyone thought those two tombs we were at before had been thoroughly examined but in a matter of days new discoveries were made discoveries made by safia omaha said sourly no one spoke for a long stretch painter focused on omahas words realization slowly dawned shell go there omaha turned to him what are you talking about safia she lied to cassandra to stop her from getting to ubar but like us she knows where the clues truly pointed to shisur to the old ruins exactly omaha frowned but like we said theres nothing there and like you said safia discovered clues where no one found them before shell think she can do the same at ubar shell go there for no other reason but to keep whatever might be there from cassandras grasp omaha took a deep begrudging breath youre right thats if shes allowed to go coral said from the side what about the woman who took her away the one with the leopards barak answered her his voice somewhat embarrassed ive heard tales of such women spoken around campfires out in the desert spoken among all tribes of the sands warriors of the desert more djinn than flesh able to speak to animals vanish on command yeah right omaha said there was indeed something strange about that woman painter conceded and i dont think this is the first time weve had a runin with her what do you mean painter nodded to omaha your kidnappers in muscat it was a woman you saw in the market what you think shes the same woman painter shrugged or perhaps one of the same group theres another party involved in all this i know it i dont know if its baraks warrior women or just some group looking to make a buck either way theyve taken safia for a reason in fact they may have even attempted to kidnap you omaha because of safias affection for you to use you as leverage leverage for what to get safia to help them i also spotted the silver case tied on the camels back why take the artifact unless theres a good reason everything keeps pointing back to ubar omaha pondered his words nodding his head then thats where well go with that bitch distracted well wait and see if safia shows up and search the place in the meantime coral said she nodded to the stacked gear theres a groundpenetrating radar unit in here good for looking under sand and weve a box of grenades additional rifles and i dont know what this is she held up a weapon that looked like a shotgun with a belled end to it from the glint in her eyes she was dying to try it out everyone turned to painter as if waiting for his agreement of course were going he said omaha clapped him on the shoulder finally something we agree on am safia huggedkara what are you doing here im not sure kara trembled in her grip her skin felt clammy moist the others i saw painterwhat about omaha his brother as far as i know everyones okay but i was away from the fighting safia had to sit down her legs weak knees rubbery the cavern swam a bit around her the tinkling of the waterfall through the hole in the roof sounded like silver bells firelight from the five campfires dazzled her eyes she sank to a rumpled blanket by the fire she couldnt feel the heat of the flames kara followed her down your shoulder youre bleeding shot safia didnt know if shed spoken aloud or not three women approached arms full they carried a steaming basin folded cloths a covered brazier and oddly out of place a box with the red cross of an emergency medical kit an elderly woman not the same as the one who had led her here followed with a tall walking stick fiery in the glow of the campfire she was ancient shoulders hunched hair white but neatly combed and braided back over her ears rubies adorned her lobes matching her teardrop tattoo lie down daughter the old woman intoned english again let us see to your injuries safia had no energy to resist but kara guarded over her she had to trust that her friend would protect her if necessary safias blouse was stripped from her the soiled bandage was then soaked in a steaming poultice of aloe and mint and slowly peeled back it felt as if they were flaying the skin off her shoulder she gasped and her vision darkened youre hurting her kara warned one of the three women had knelt and opened the emergency medical kit i have one ampoule of morphine hodja the woman said let me see the wound the elder leaned down supported by her staff safia shifted so her shoulder was bared the bullet passed cleanly through shallow good well not have to operate sweet myrrh tea will ease her pain also two tablets of tylenol with codeine hook an iv to her good arm run in a liter of warmed lrs what of the wound the other woman asked well cauterize pack and wrap the shoulder then sling the arm yes hodja safia was propped up the third woman poured a steaming mug of tea and handed it to kara help her drink it will give her strength kara obeyed accepting the mug with both hands youd best sip too the old woman told kara to clear your head i doubt this is strong enough doubt will not serve you here kara sipped the tea grimaced then offered it to safia you should drink you look like hell safia allowed a bit to be dribbled between her lips the warmth flowed down into the cold pit that was her stomach she accepted more two pills were held in front of her for the pain the youngest of the three women whispered all three looked like sisters only a few years apart take them saffie kara urged or ill take them myself safia opened her mouth accepted the medication and swallowed them down with a bit more of the tea now lie back while we minister to your wounds the hodja said safia collapsed to the blankets warmer now the hodja slowly lowered to the blanket beside her moving with a grace that belied her age she rested her walking stick over her knees rest daughter be at peace she placed one hand atop safias a gentle bleary feeling swelled through her fading all the ache from her body leaving her floating safia smelled the jasmine wreathed about the cavern whowho are you safia asked were your mother dear safia flinched denying the possibility offended her mother was dead this woman was too old she must be speaking metaphorically before she could scold all sight dissolved away only a few words followed her away all of us were all your mother am kara watchedthe group of women attend to safia as her friend lolled on the blankets a catheter was inserted into a vein in her right hand and hooked to an intravenous drip attached to a warm bag of saline held aloft by one of safias nurses the other two rinsed and daubed the bullet wound in safias shoulder the injury was smaller than a dime a cauterizing powder was sprinkled generously over the site which was then painted with iodine packed with cotton gauze and expertly wrapped safia thrashed slightly but remained asleep make sure she keeps her arm in a sling the older woman said watching the work of the others when she is awake make sure she drinks a cup of the tea the hodja lifted her staff posted it on the ground and pulled herself up she faced kara come let my daughters care for your sister i wont leave her kara moved closer to safia she will be well cared for come it is time for you to find what you have sought what are you talking about answers to your life come or stay it makes no matter to me the old woman thumped off i will not argue with you kara glanced to safia then to the elder answers to your life kara slowly rose if anything happens but she didnt know whom she was threatening the nurses seemed to be taking good care of her friend with a shake of her head kara set off after the hodja where are we going ignoring kara the hodja continued they left the trickling waterfall and fires behind and crossed into the deeper gloom that rimmed the chamber kara stared around she barely remembered entering this cavern she had been conscious of it but it was as if she had moved in a pleasant fog plodding behind a similarly clad older tribeswoman after leaving the van they had walked for well over an hour through a shadowy forest to an ancient dry well accessed via a narrow cut in the rock they had spiraled down into a mountainside walking for some time once they reached the cavern here kara had been abandoned by the fire told to wait the fog lifting from her with its dissipation her headache tremors and nausea had returned like a leaden blanket she felt barely able to move let alone find her way out of this warren of tunnels questions she asked were ignored and she had many she stared at the back of the elder ahead of her now who were these women what did they want with her and safia they reached a tunnel opening in the wall a child waited at the entrance bearing a silver oil lamp like something youd rub to raise a genie a tiny flame lapped the tip of the lamp the girl no more than eight wore a desert cloak that appeared too large for her the hem bunching slightly at her toes her eyes were huge upon kara as if she were staring at some alien being but there was no fright only curiosity the hodja nodded the child forward go yaqut the child turned and shuffled forward down the tunnel yaqut was arabic for ruby it was the first time she had heard a name spoken here she stared at the hodja at her side what is your name the old woman finally glanced at her green eyes flashed brightly in the lamps flame i am called many names but my given name is lulu i believe in your language that means pearl kara nodded are all your women named after jewels there was no answer as they continued walking behind the child in silence but kara sensed the womans acknowledgment in arabic tradition such jeweled names were given to only one caste of folk slaves why did these women pick such names they certainly seemed freer than most arab women the child turned off the tunnel into a limestone chamber it was cold the walls damp scintillating in the lamplight a prayer rug lay on the caves floor cushioned by a bed of straw beyond it stood a low altar of black stone kara felt a thrill of fear ice through her why had they brought her here yaqut walked to the altar circled behind it and bent out of sight suddenly flames crackled brighter behind the stone yaqut had used her oil lamp to light a small stack of wood kara smelled incense and kerosene from the pile scented and oiled for easy lighting the kerosene burned away quickly leaving only the sweet fragrance of frankincense as the flames licked higher kara saw her mistake the dark altar was not opaque but crystalline like a chunk of black obsidian only more translucent the glow of the flames shone through the stone come lulu intoned and led kara to the prayer rug kneel kara exhausted from lack of sleep and shaky from the drain of adrenaline from her system both naturally and artificially induced gratefully sank to the soft rug the hodja stood behind her this is what you have come so far and searched so long to find she pointed her stick toward the altar kara stared at the block of translucent stone her eyes widened as the stack of wood blazed behind the altar shining through it not opaque stone raw glass flames lit the interior illuminating the heart of the glass block inside embedded like a fly in amber rested a figure plainly human blackened to bone legs curled fetally but arms out in agony kara had seen a similar stricken figure in the ruins of pompeii a form turned to stone buried and petrified under hot ash from the ancient eruption of vesuvius the same posture of tortured death but worst of all kara knew why she had been brought here shown this answers to her life she collapsed to her hands on the rug her body suddenly too heavy no tears burst to her eyes she knew who lay buried in the heart of the glass preserved in agony a cry escaped her wrenching everything from her body strength sight hope even the will to live leaving her empty papa am safia woketo music and warmth she lay on a soft blanket instantly awake but she languished in the moment she listened to the soft stringed cords from a lute accompanied by the soft piping from a reed instrument haunting and lonely firelight danced across the roof overhead limning the drapes of vines and flowers the tinkling water added counterpoint to the music she knew where she was there was no slow waking back to the present only a vague muzzyheadedness from the codeine she had ingested she heard voices speaking softly occasional dazzling flashes of laughter a child playing she slowly sat up earning a grumpy complaint from her shoulder but the pain was dull more a deep ache than a sharp twinge she felt inordinately rested she checked her watch she had been asleep only a little more than an hour but she felt as if she had slept for days relaxed and rested a young woman stepped toward her kneeling down a mug warmed between her hands the hodja wishes you to drink this safia accepted the tea with her good arm the other lay in a sling across her belly she sipped gratefully and noticed a conspicuous absence kara my friend when you finish your tea im to take you to the hodja she waits with your sister safia nodded she sipped her tea as quickly as its steaming heat would allow the sweet tea warmed through her she placed the mug on the ground and crawled to her feet her escort offered a hand to help but safia declined feeling steady enough this way safia was led to the far side of the sinkhole cavern and down another tunnel with a lantern in one hand her guide walked her assuredly through the maze of passages safia addressed her guide who are you all we are the rahim she answered stiffly safia translated rahim was the arabic word for womb were they some bedouin tribe of women amazons of the desert she pondered the name it also held an undercurrent of divinity of rebirth and continuity who were these women ahead a light appeared glowing from a side cavern her escort stopped a few steps away and nodded safia forward she continued feeling for the first time since waking a tingle of unease the air seemed to grow thicker harder to breathe she concentrated on inhaling and exhaling riding through the moment of anxiety as she stepped nearer she heard sobbing heartdeep broken kara safia pushed aside her fears and hurried to the cavern she found kara collapsed on a rug in the cavern the elder hodja knelt at her side cradling kara the old womans green eyes met safias safia rushed over kara whats wrong kara lifted her face eyes swollen dampcheeked she was beyond words she pointed an arm toward a large stone with a fire behind it safia recognized the chunk as slag glass molten sand that had hardened she had found such pieces around lightning strikes they were revered by ancient peoples used as jewelry sacred objects prayer stones she didnt understand until she spotted the figure in the glass oh no kara croaked itsits my father oh kara tears welled up in safias eyes she knelt on karas other side reginald kensington had been like a father to safia too she understood her friends grief but confusion shattered through how why kara glanced at the old woman too overwhelmed to speak the hodja patted karas hand as ive already explained to your friend lord kensington is not unknown to our people his story leads here as much as the story of you two he had entered sands forbidden on the day he died he had been warned but chose to dismiss it and it was not chance that brought him to those sands he sought ubar like his daughter he knew those same sands were near its heart and could not stay away what happened to him to tread the sands around ubar is to risk the wrath of a power that has lain hidden for millennia a power and place we women guard he heard of the place was drawn to it it was his doom kara sat up clearly having heard all this already what is this power the hodja shook her head that we dont know the gates of ubar have been closed to us for two millennia what lies beyond those gates has been lost to the ages we are the rahim the last of its guardians knowledge passed from mouth to ear from one generation to another but two secrets were never spoken after ubar was destroyed never passed to our line by the surviving queen of ubar so great was the tragedy that she sealed the city and with her death those two secrets died where the gates keys were hidden and what power lies under the sand at the heart of ubar each word spoken by the old woman raised a thousand questions in safias mind the gates of ubar the last of its guardians the heart of the lost city hidden keys but some inkling reached through to her the keys she muttered the iron heart the hodja nodded to lead to ubars heart and the spear with the bust of biliqis the queen of sheba the elder bowed her head she who was the mother of us all the first of the royal house of ubar it is only right she adorns the second key safia reviewed the known history of ubar the city had indeed been founded around bc the same period during which the historical queen of sheba lived ubar prospered until the collapse of a sinkhole destroyed the city aroundad it had a long reign but the existence of the ruling house was well documented safia questioned this fact i thought king shaddad was the first ruler of ubar the greatgrandchild of noah there was even a reclusive clan of bedouin the shahra who claimed to be descendants of this same king the old woman shook her head the line of shaddad were administrators only the line of biliqis were the true rulers a secret hidden from all but the most trusted ubar gave its powers to the queen chose her allowed her to birth her line strong and sure a line that continues to this day safia remembered the visage on the bust the young women here bore a striking resemblance could such a line remain pure for over two millennia safia shook her head incredulous are you saying your tribe can trace their lineage all the way back to the queen of sheba the hodja bowed her head it is more than thatmuch more she lifted her eyes we are the queen of sheba pm kara feltsick nauseousbut not from withdrawal in fact since her arrival here in these caves she felt less jagged the shakes slowly subsiding as if something had been done to her head but what she now suffered was a thousandfold worse than the lack of amphetamines she felt crushed heartsick worn thin devastated all this talk of secret cities mysterious powers ancient lineages meant nothing to her her eyes stared at the remains of her father his mouth frozen in a rictus of agony words of the hodja had locked up her brain he had sought ubar like his daughter kara recalled the day of her fathers death the hunt on her sixteenth birthday she had always wondered why they had traveled all the way out to that section of the desert there was good hunting much closer to muscat why fly out to thumrait air base travel overland in rovers then start their pursuit on sand cycles had he used her birthday as an excuse to hunt those lands anger built in her chest shining out of her like the flames behind the chunk of glass but it had no focus she was angry at these women who had held this secret for so long at her father for throwing his life away on a deadly quest at herself for following in his footstepseven at safia for never making her stop even when the search was destroying kara from the inside the fire of her fury burned away the dregs of her sickness kara sat back and turned to the old hodja she interrupted her history lesson with safia her words bitter why was my father searching for ubar kara safia said in a consoling tone i think that can wait no anger put command in her voice i want to know now the hodja remained unimpressed bowing before karas fury like a reed in the wind you are right to ask that is why you are both here kara frowned from lips to brow the woman glanced between kara and safia what the desert takes it also gives back what does that mean kara snapped back the hodja sighed the desert took your father she waved toward the gruesome stone but it gave you a sister she nodded to safia safia has always been my dearest friend despite her anger karas voice flared with emotion the truth and depth of her words spoken aloud struck her bruised heart with more impact than she would have imagined she tried to shake them away but she was too raw she is more than your friend she is your sister in both spiritand flesh the hodja raised her staff and pointed it at the body entombed in glass there lies your father and safias the hodja faced the two stunned women you are sisters am safias mindcould not grasp what the woman was saying impossible kara said my mother died when i was born you share a father not a mother the hodja clarified safia was born from a woman of our people safia shook her head they were half sisters the peace she had experienced upon waking moments ago had shattered for ages she had known nothing about her mother only that she had died in a bus accident when safia was four nothing was known about her father even among the vague memories of her childhood before the orphanagefoggy glimpses scents a whisper in the earthere had never been a male figure a father all she had left from her mother was her name almaaz calm yourself both of you the woman raised her hands one palm toward each this is a gift not a curse her words drained some of the wild beating in safias heart like a palm placed on a thrumming tuning fork still she could not bring herself to glance toward kara too ashamed as if her presence somehow fouled the good memory of lord kensington safias mind went back to the day she was taken from the orphanage a terrifying hopeful day reginald kensington had chosen her above all the other girls a mixedblood child taken her home put her in her own room kara and safia had instantly bonded had they even at that young age recognized a secret bond an easy comfort of family why hadnt reginald kensington ever told them of their secret sisterhood if only id known kara gasped out reaching out to safia safia looked up she read no blame in her friends eye the anger of a moment ago had been snuffed all she saw was relief hope and love maybe we did know safia mumbled and leaned into her sisters embrace maybe we always knew down deep tears flowed and just like that they were no longer just friendsthey were family they hugged for a long moment but questions eventually pulled them apart kara kept safias hand in her own the hodja finally spoke your shared story goes back to lord kensingtons discovery of the statue at the tomb of nabi imran his remarkable find was significant to us the statue dated from the founding of ubar buried at a tomb tied to a woman of miracles the virgin mary safia asked a nod answered her as guardians one of our number had to get close to examine the funerary object it was said that the keys to the gates of ubar would reveal themselves when the time was right so almaaz was sent almaaz safia said noting the pronunciation was slightly off almaaz the hodja repeated more firmly kara squeezed her hand all the women here are all named after jewels the hodja s name is lulu pearl safias eyes widened almaaz my mothers name was diamond the orphanage thought it was her family name almaaz so what happened to her the hodja lulu shook her head with a weary frown like many of our women your mother fell in love in investigating the discovery of the statue she allowed herself to get too close to lord kensingtonand he to her they both were lost to each other and after a few months a child grew in her womb seeded the natural way of all women safia frowned at the strange choice of words but didnt interrupt the pregnancy panicked your mother it was forbidden for one of us to bear a child from a mans loins she fled lord kensington back to us we cared for her until she gave birth but after you were born she had to leave almaaz had broken our rule and you a child of mixed blood were not pure rahim the old woman touched her teardrop tattoo the ruby symbol of the tribe safia had no tattoo your mother raised you as best she could in khaluf on the omani coast not far from muscat but the accident left you an orphan during all this time lord kensington never gave up his search for your motherand the possible child she carried he scoured oman spent fortunes but when one of our women wish to be unseen we are not found the blood of biliqis has blessed us in many ways the old woman glanced down to her staff when we learned you were orphaned we could not abandon you we found where you were taken and passed the information to lord kensington he was heartsick to hear of almaaz but as the desert takes it also returns it gave him back a daughter he collected you and pulled you into his family i suspect he planned on waiting until you both were old enough to understand the complexities of the heart before revealing your shared blood kara stirred on the morning of the huntmy father told me that he had something important to tell me something that on my sixteenth birthday i was woman enough to hear she swallowed hard voice cracking i thought it was only something about school or university notnot safia squeezed her hand its all right now we know kara glanced up her eyes full of confusion but why did he still pursue ubar i dont understand the hodja sighed it is one of many reasons we are forbidden from men perhaps it was a whisper across a pillow a bit of history shared between lovers but your father learned of ubar he sought the lost city maybe as a way of being closer to the woman he lost but ubar is dangerous the burden of its guardianship is a heavy one as if demonstrating the old woman hauled herself up with considerable effort and what of us now safia asked standing with kara i will tell you along the way she said we have far to travel where are we going safia asked the question seemed to surprise the hodja you are one of us safia you brought us the keys the heart and the spear a nod she turned away after two millennia we go to unlock the gates of ubar part four the gates of ubar crossroads december am dhofar mountains as theskies brightened to the east omaha slowed the van at the top of the pass the road continued down the far sideif the rutted stoneplagued track could be called a road his lower back ached from the constant bump and rattle of the last ten miles omaha braked to a halt here the road crested the last pass through the mountains ahead the highlands dropped to salt flats and gravel plains in the rearview mirror fields of green heather spread dotted with grazing cattle the transition was abrupt to either side of the van lay a moonscape of red rock interrupted by patches of straggly redbarked trees bent by the winds flowing over the pass boswellia sacra the rare and precious frankincense trees the source of wealth in ages past as omaha braked painters head snapped up from a light drowse what is it he asked blearily one hand rested on the pistol in his lap omaha pointed ahead the road descended through a dry riverbed a wadi it was a rocky treacherous course meant for fourwheeldrive vehicles its all downhill from here omaha said i know this place barak said behind them the fellow never seemed to sleep whispering directions to omaha as they wound through the mountains this is wadi dhikur the vale of remembrance the cliffs to either side are an ancient graveyard omaha popped the van into gear lets hope it doesnt become ours why did we come this way painter asked in the third row of seats coral and danny stirred slumped against each other they sat straighter listening clay seated beside barak merely snored head craned back lost to the world barak answered painters question only the local shahra tribe know of this route down the mountains to the desert they still collect frankincense from the trees around here in the traditional manner omaha had never met anyone from the shahra clan they were a reclusive bunch almost stone age in their technology frozen in tradition their language had been studied at length it was unlike modern arabic almost a reedy singsong and contained eight additional phonetic syllables over time most languages lose sounds becoming more refined as they mature with the additional syllables the shahri language was considered to be one of the most ancient in all of arabia but more particularly the shahra called themselves the people of ad named after king shaddad the first ruler of ubar according to oral traditions they descended from the original inhabitants of ubar those who fled its destruction inad in fact barak might be leading them down the very path to ubar that the people of ad had once used to flee its destruction a chilling thought especially shadowed by the entombed graves barak finished at the bottom of the wadi it is only thirty kilometers to reach shisur it is not far omaha began their descent in the lowest gear creeping at five miles per hour to go any faster risked sliding out in the loose shale and rocky scree despite the caution the van skidded all too often as if traveling on ice after half an hour omahas hands were damp on the wheel but at least the sun was up a dusty rose in the sky omaha recognized that hue a storm was coming due to strike the area in a few more hours already winds off the sands blew up the wadi blustering against the lessthanaerodynamic van as omaha rounded a blind bend in the riverbed two camels and a pair of robed bedouin appeared ahead he hit the brakes too hard fishtailed the rear end and struck broadside into a precariously stacked set of stone slabs alongside the road metal buckled the slabs toppled clay startled awake with a snort there goes our collision deposit danny griped the two camels loaded and strapped with bales and overflowing baskets gurgled at them tossing their heads as they were walked past the stalled van it looked like they were carrying an entire household on their backs refugees painter said nodding to other similarly laden camels mules and horses moving up the dry watercourse theyre fleeing the storm is everyone okay omaha asked as he fought the gearshift knob punching the clutch the van lurched rocked and finally began to roll again what did we hit back there coral asked staring at the toppled stones danny pointed to other similar stone piles that peppered the graveyard triliths he answered ancient prayer stones each was composed of three slabs leaned against one another to form a small pyramid omaha continued down the road wary of the stacked stones this was made more difficult as traffic grew thicker the lower down the riverbed they traveled folks were fleeing the desert in droves i thought you said no one knew about this back door out of the mountains painter asked barak the arab shrugged when youre facing the mother of all sandstorms you run toward higher ground any ground i wager every riverbed is being climbed like this the main roads are surely worse they had heard periodic reports over the radio as reception came and went the sandstorm had grown in size as large as the eastern seaboard whipping up eightymileperhour winds packed by scouring sands it was shifting sand dunes around like they were whitecaps on a stormswept sea and that was not the worst the high pressure system off the coast had begun to move inland the two storm systems would meet over the omani desert a rare combination of conditions that would whip up a storm unlike any seen in ages before even as the sun dawned the northern horizon remained cloaked in a smoky darkness as they descended the mountain road the storm ahead grew taller and taller a tidal wave cresting they finally reached the bottom of the wadi the cliffs fell away to either side spilling out into the sandy salt flats welcome to the rub alkhali omaha announced the empty quarter the name could not be more fitting ahead stretched a vast plain of gray gravel etched and scoured with pictographic lines of bluewhite salt flats and beyond a red ridge marked the edge of the endless roll of dunes that swept across arabia from their vantage the sands glowed in pinks browns purples and crimsons a paint pot of hues omaha studied their fuel gauge with luck theyd have just enough gas to reach shisur he glanced over to the desert phantom their only guide thirty kilometers right barak leaned back and shrugged thereabouts shaking his head omaha turned forward and set off across the flatlands a few straggling folk still trudged toward the mountains the refugees showed no interest in the van heading toward the storm it was a fools journey no one in the van spoke eyes fixed forward on the storm the only sound the crunch of sand and gravel under their tires with the cooperative terrain omaha risked pushing the van up to thirty miles per hour the winds unfortunately seemed to pick up with every half mile blowing streams of sand from the dunes they would be lucky to have any paint on the van when they reached shisur danny finally spoke its hard to believe this used to be a vast savannah clay yawned what are you talking about danny shifted forward this wasnt always desert satellite maps show the presence of ancient riverbeds lakes and streams under the sand suggesting arabia was once covered by grasslands and forests full of hippos water buffalo and gazelle a living eden clay stared at the arid landscape how long ago was this some twenty thousand years you can still find neolithic artifacts from that time ax blades skin scrapers arrowheads danny nodded to the wastelands then began a period of hyperaridity that dried arabia into a desert wasteland why what triggered such a change i dont know a new voice intervened answering clays question the climatic change was due to milankovitch forcing attention turned to the speaker coral novak she explained periodically the earth wobbles in its orbit around the sun these wobbles or orbital forcings trigger massive climatic changes like the desertification of arabia and parts of india africa and australia but what could cause the earth to wobble clay asked coral shrugged it could be simple precession the natural periodic changes in orbits or it could be something more dramatic a flipflop of the earths polarity something thats occurred a thousand times in geologic history or it might have been a burp in the rotation of the earths nickel core no one can really say however it happened danny concluded this is the result before them the dunes had grown into massive hummocks of red sand some stretching six hundred feet high between the dunes gravel persisted creating winding chaotic roadways nicknamed dune streets it was easy to get lost in the maze of streets but the more direct route over the dunes could bog the hardiest vehicle something they could not chance omaha pointed ahead directing his question to barak meeting the desert phantoms eyes in the rearview mirror you know your way through there right the giant of an arab shrugged again his usual response to everything omaha stared at the towering dunesand beyond them a wall of churning dark sand rising from the horizon like the smoky edge of a vast grass fire sweeping toward them they had no time for wrong turns am safia marchedbeside kara down another tunnel the rahim clan spread out ahead and behind them traveling in groups carrying oil lanterns in the darkness they had been walking for the past three hours stopping regularly to drink or rest safias shoulder had begun to ache but she didnt protest the entire clan was on the move even the children a nursing mother strode a few steps ahead accompanied by six children whose ages ranged from six to eleven the older girls held the younger ones hands like all the rahim even the children were bundled in hooded cloaks safia studied the young ones as they sneaked glances back at her they all appeared to be sisters green eyes black hair burnished skin even their shy smiles carried the same dimpled charm and while the adult women varied in minor wayssome were wiry others heavier built some longhaired others shorn shorttheir basic features were strikingly similar lulu the tribal hodja kept pace with them after announcing their journey to the gates of ubar she had left to organize the clans departure as guardians of ubar for centuries none of the rahim would be left out of this momentous occasion once they were under way lulu had gone silent leaving kara and safia plenty of time to discuss the revelation of their sisterhood it still seemed unreal for the past hour neither had spoken each lost to her own thoughts kara was the first to interrupt the silence where are all your men she asked the fathers of these children will they be joining us along the way lulu frowned at kara there are no men that is forbidden safia remembered the hodja s comment earlier about how safias birth had been forbidden did permission have to be granted was that why they all looked so identical some attempt at eugenics keeping their bloodline pure its just you women kara asked the rahim once numbered in the hundreds lulu said quietly now we number thirtysix the gifts granted to us through the blood of biliqis the queen of sheba have weakened grown more fragile stillborn children trouble us others lose their gifts the world has grown toxic to us just last week mara one of our elders lost her blessings when she went to the hospital in muscat we dont know why safia frowned what gifts are these that you keep mentioning lulu sighed i will tell you this because you are one of us you have been tested and found to harbor some trace of ubars blessing tested kara asked glancing to safia lulu nodded at some point we test all halfbred children of the clan almaaz was not the first to leave the rahim to lie with a man to forsake her lineage for love other such children have been born few have the gift she placed a hand on safias elbow when we heard of your miraculous survival of the terrorist bombing in tel aviv we suspected that perhaps your blood bore some power safia stumbled at the mention of the bombing she remembered the newspaper reports heralding the miraculous nature of her survival but you left the country before we could test you never to return so we thought you lost then we heard of the keys discovery in england at a museum you oversaw it had to be a sign a bit of fervor entered the womans voice so full of hope when you returned here we sought you out lulu glanced down the tunnel voice lowering at first we attempted to collect your betrothed to use him to draw you to us kara gasped you were the ones who tried to kidnap him he is not without talents of his own the old woman conceded with half a smile i can see why you pledged your heart to him safia felt a twinge of embarrassment after you failed to kidnap him what did you do since we couldnt draw you to us we came to you we tested you in the old manner she glanced to safia with the snake safia stopped in the tunnel remembering the incident in the bath at karas estate you sent the carpet viper after me lulu halted with kara a few of the women continued past such simple creatures recognize those with the gift those blessed by ubar they will not harm such a woman but find peace safia could still feel the viper draped over her naked chest as if sunning on a rock content then the maid had walked in and screamed triggering it to strike at the girl you couldve killed someone lulu waved them onward nonsense were not foolish we dont stick to the old traditions in that regard we had removed the snakes fangs you were at no risk safia slowly continued down the tunnel too stunned to speak kara was not what is all this about a gift what was the snake supposed to sense about safia those who bear the blessing of ubar have the ability to project their will upon other minds beasts of the field are especially susceptible bowing to our wishes obeying our command the simpler the beast the easier to control come see lulu stepped to the wall where a small hole opened in the sandy floor she opened her hands a gentle buzzing floated about safias head from the hole a small vole emerged blind whiskers twitching it climbed as docile as a kitten into the hodja s palm lulu caressed it with a finger then let it go it dashed back into its hole surprised to be out such simple creatures are easy to influence lulu nodded to kara as she continued down the tunnel as are those minds weakened by abuse kara glanced away nevertheless we have little control over the wakened mind of man the best we can manage is to cloud and dull their perceptions when we are close at hand to hide our presence for a short timeand then only of our own form even clothes are difficult to whisper away it is best done naked and in shadows kara and safia glanced at each other too amazed for words it was some form of telepathy mind bending lulu adjusted her cloak and of course the gift can be used on oneself a concentration of will directed inward this is our greatest blessing securing our line back to queen biliqis she who was our first and last safia remembered tales of the queen of sheba stories found throughout arabia ethiopia and israel many involved fanciful embellishments magic carpets talking birds even teleportation and the most significant man in her life king solomon was said to be able to speak to animals like the hodja claimed now safia pictured the leopard that attacked john kane could these women truly control such beasts was such talent the source of all the wilder tales surrounding the queen of sheba kara spoke into the stunned silence what happens when you direct your gift inward the greatest blessing lulu repeated with a wistful edge to her voice we ripen with child a child born of no man kara and safia shared a look of disbelief a virgin birth kara whispered like the virgin mary safia pondered this revelation is that why the first key the iron heart had been hidden at marys fathers tomb an acknowledgment of some sort one virgin to another lulu continued but our births are not any birth the child of our body is our body born afresh to continue the line safia shook her head what do you mean lulu raised her staff and passed it forward and backward encompassing all the clan we are all the same women to speak in modern terms we are genetically identical the greatest blessing of all is the gift to keep our line pure to produce a new generation out of our own womb clones kara said no safia said she understood what the hodja was describing it was a reproductive process found in some insects and animals most notably bees parthenogenesis safia said aloud kara looked confused its a form of reproduction where a female can produce an egg with an intact nucleus containing her own genetic code which then grows and is born an identical genetic duplicate of the mother safia stared up and down the tunnel all these women somehow their telepathic gift allowed them to reproduce themselves genetically intact asexual reproduction she recalled one of her biology professors at oxford how he had mentioned that sexual reproduction was a relatively strange thing for our bodies to do that normally a bodily cell divided to produce an exact duplicate of itself only the germ cells in ovaries or testicles divided in such a manner to produce cells with only half of their original genetic codeeggs in females spermatozoa in malesallowing for the mix of genetic material but if a woman could somehow by sheer will stop this cellular division in her unfertilized egg the resulting offspring would be an exact duplicate of the mother mother safias breath caught in her throat she stopped and searched the faces around her if what lulu said was true if her mother was from this clan then all around her stood her mother she was seeing her in all her possible incarnations from newborn babe suckling on a teat to the mother who nursed that child from the young girl walking hand in hand with her older sister to the elder at her side all her mother safia now understood the cryptic words of the hodja earlier all of us were all your mother it wasnt metaphor it was fact before safia could move or speak two women marched past one carried the silver case holding the iron heart the next bore the iron spear with the bust of the queen of sheba safia noted the iron countenance on the statue the face of sheba the face of these women sudden understanding struck safia almost blinding her she had to lean against the tunnel wall sheba lulu nodded she is the first and the last she is all of us an early exchange with the hodja echoed in safias mind we are the queen of sheba safia watched the cloaked women march past these women had been reproducing themselves asexually far back into history tracing their genetic code to one woman the first to produce a child in this manner to regenerate herself biliqis the queen of sheba she stared into the face of lulu into the green eyes of the longdead queen the past living in the present the first and the last how was this possible a shout rose from the front of the line were through the mountains the hodja said come the gates of ubar await am painter shieldedhis eyes as he stared at the stalled van at the rising sun at the walls of sand all around this would not be a good place to be trapped when the coming sandstorm struck he imagined those mountainous dunes spilling over them like crashing waves against rocks they had to get moving again a few minutes ago the van had been careening along a stretch of flat sand riding along the edges of dunes a volkswagen surfboard the graveled streets they had been following had finally vanished completely requiring them to furrow through hardpacked sand only not all of the sand was packed camel wallow barak commented on his knees staring at the back end of the van its front and rear tires were mired to the axle sand here is very loose and deep like quicksand camels roll in them to clean their bodies can we dig the van out omaha asked theres no time painter said barak nodded and the deeper you dig the deeper the van will sink then well have to unload what we can travel on foot danny groaned from his seat in the sand we really have to be choosier with our means of transportation first the flatbed truck now this junker painter stepped away too full of nervous energy or maybe it was the electricity in the air some cloud of static charge pushed ahead of the sandstorm im going to climb that dune see if i can spot shisur it cant be more than a mile in the meantime clean out the van weapons equipment everything painter set off up the hill omaha trudged after him i can check by myself painter said waving him off omaha kept climbing every step pounded deep as if he were punishing the sand painter didnt feel like arguing with him so the pair trudged up the dune face it was more of a trek than painter had imagined down below omaha drew a step nearer im sorry painters brow crinkled in confusion about the van omaha mumbled i shouldve spotted the wallow dont worry about it i wouldve hit it too omaha continued upward i just wanted to say im sorry painter sensed the mans apology covered more than the mired vehicle at last they reached the knifeedged crest of the dune it crumbled underfoot runnels of sand coursed down the far side the desert held a perfect crystal stillness no birdsong no chirp of insect even the wind had subsided momentarily the calm before the storm painter gaped at the expanse before them dunes stretched to all horizons but what held his attention was the roiling wall to the north a hurricane of sand the dark clouds reminded painter of stacked thunderclouds he spotted even a few bluish flashes static discharges like lightning they needed to reach cover there omaha said and pointed his arm that cluster of date palms painter made out a tiny patch of greenery about half a mile away buried among the dunes easy to miss the oasis of shisur omaha said they were not far as he turned away movement caught his eye in the sky to the east a black gnat flew limned in the morning sunlight he lifted his nightvision goggles over his eyes flipping up the ordinary lenses rather than the lowlight feature he telescoped closer what is it a transport helicopter united states air force probably from thumrait its circling to land out there a rescue mission because of the storm no its cassandra painter heard her voice in his head did you really think that id believe you were heading to the border of yemen here was more confirmation of how high up cassandras group had its teeth and claws in washington how could painter hope to win out here he had only five people with him few with military training are you sure its her painter watched the helicopter rotor down to the sands vanishing among the dunes yes thats the spot on the map six miles off course painter lowered his goggles cassandra was too close for comfort we have to get moving he said painter fixed the bearings and headed back downhill the two men slid their way down making faster time reaching the bottom painter eyed the stacked gear it was a load but they dared not leave anything they might need how far coral asked half a mile painter said looks of relief spread among the others but coral stepped to his side noting his tension cassandras already here he said off to the east coral shrugged thats good when the sandstorm hits shell be pinned down it might buy us another day or two out here especially if that coastal highpressure system crashes on top of us the predicted megastorm painter nodded taking a deep breath coral was right they could still pull this off thanks he mumbled to her anytime commander they quickly divided the gear the largest crate held the groundpenetrating radar unit painter and omaha hauled it between them it was monstrously heavy but if they were to search the ruins for buried treasure they might need such a tool so they set off winding around a vast dune that crested two football fields in height then slogged up and over smaller ones the sun continued its climb heating the sand and the air soon their pace became a crawl as they were drained of adrenaline bonetired and exhausted but at last they climbed a low dune and discovered a cluster of modern cinderblock buildings wooden structures and a small mosque in the valley beyond the village of shisur down in the valley the endless red of the rub alkhali was interrupted by green acacia bushes grew alongside the buildings stretches of yellowflowering tribulus spread across the sand along with thickets of palmetto larger mimosalike trees trailed flowering fronds to the ground creating shaded arbors and the ubiquitous date palms climbed high after the desert trek where the only vegetation had been a few straggly salt bushes and wan patches of tasseled sedge the oasis of shisur was eden in the village nothing moved it appeared deserted the winds had kicked up again as the forward edge of the storm pushed toward them bits of refuse spun in dust devils cloth curtains flapped out open windows no ones here clay noted omaha stepped forward scanning the tiny township evacuated then again the place is pretty much abandoned during the offseason shisur is mostly a waystation for the wandering bait musan tribe of bedouin they come and go all the time with the discovery of the ruins just outside the town and the beginning of tourism here it has grown into a somewhat more permanent village but even thats pretty seasonal so where exactly are the ruins painter asked omaha pointed off to the north a small tower of crumbling rock poked above the flat sands painter had thought it a natural outcropping of limestone one of the many flattopped mesas that dotted the desert only now he noted the stacked stones that composed the structure it look like some watchtower the citadel of ubar omaha said its highest point more of the ruins are hidden below out of sight he set off toward the empty township the others began the final push to shelter leaning against the stubborn wind faces turned from the gusts of sand painter remained a moment longer theyd made it to ubar at last but what would they find he stared at the danger looming to the north the sandstorm filled the horizon erasing the rest of the world even as he stared painter watched more of the desert being eaten away again crackles of static electricity danced where the storm met the sands he watched a particularly large discharge roll down a dune face like a balloon cast before a stiff wind it faded in moments seeming to seep into the sand itself and vanish painter held his breath he knew what he had just witnessed ball lightning the same as had ignited the meteorite at the british museum they had come full circle a voice spoke at his shoulder startling him the blue djinn of the sands barak said having noted the same natural phenomenon storms always bring out the djinn painter glanced to barak wondering if the man believed they were evil spirits or just a story to explain such phenomena barak seemed to sense his question whatever they are theyre never good he set off down the hill after the others for a moment longer painter studied the monstrous storm eyes stinging from the blowing sand it was just beginning as he headed down the slope his gaze cast off to the east nothing moved the roll of dunes hid everything a vast sea but cassandra and her team waited out there sharkscircling and circling am safia hadnot expected this mode of transportation not from an ancient clan whose bloodline ran back to the queen of sheba the dune buggy ramped up the sandy face its huge knobby tires finding good traction they shot over the crest flew airborne for an extended breath then landed solidly on the downward slope tires and shock absorbers cushioned their impact still safia clung with her one good arm to the roll bar in front of her like the security latch on a rollercoaster car kara held fast in the same manner whiteknuckled both women wore matching desert cloaks hoods pulled up and secured with a sand scarf over their lower face protecting skin from the scouring wind they also wore polarized sun goggles pinched over their eyes in the passenger seat up front lulu rode next to the rahim driver a young woman of sixteen named jehd the driveror pilot as the case was at timesheld her lips in a firm determined line though a glint of girlish excitement lit her eyes other dune buggies followed each loaded with five of the clan women they crisscrossed one anothers paths to avoid the sand cast up by the vehicles in front to either side flanking the buggies rode a dozen sand bikes motorcycles with ballooned wheels chewing through the larger vehicles wakes making huge leaps over the crests of dunes the caravans speed was born of necessity to the north the sandstorm barreled toward them upon leaving the subterranean warren of tunnels safia found herself on the far side of the dhofar mountains at the edge of the rub alkhali they had crossed under the entire mountain range the passages they had traversed were old river channels worn through the limestone bedrock free of the tunnels the buggies and bikes awaited them kara had commented on the choice of vehicles expecting camels or some other less sophisticated means of transportation lulu had explained we may trace our lineage into the past but we live in the present the rahim did not live their entire lives in the desert but like the queen of sheba herself they wandered educated themselves prospered even they had bank accounts stock portfolios realestate holdings traded in oil futures the group now raced toward shisur trying to beat the storm safia had not argued against such haste she did not know how much longer the ruse she had used to deceive cassandra would last if they were to gain the prize before cassandra did they would need every advantage lulu and the others were counting on safia to lead the way in the hodja s words the keys revealed themselves to you so will the gates safia prayed the woman was right she had used intuition and knowledge to lead them this far she hoped her expertise would carry her the rest of the way in the front seat lulu lifted a motorola walkietalkie and listened then spoke into it all words were lost to the growl of motors and torrents of winds once done she swung around in her seatbelt restraints there may be trouble lulu yelled the scouts we sent ahead report a small band of armed strangers entering shisur safias heart leaped to her throat cassandra perhaps they are just seeking shelter the scouts found a vehicle an old van stuck in a camel wallow kara leaned forward intense a vanwas it a blue volkswagen why it may be our friends those who were helping us kara glanced to safia eyes hopeful lulu lifted her walkietalkie and carried on a brief conversation she nodded then turned to kara and safia it was a blue eurovan thats them kara exclaimed how did they know where to find us safia shook her head it seemed impossible we should still be careful maybe cassandra or her men captured them and even if it was their friends a new fear clutched safias heart who had survived painter had attempted to rescue her risked all stayed behind to cover her retreat had he made it out the exchange of gunfire she had heard as she fled the tomb echoed in her head all answers lay at shisur after another ten minutes of dune racing the small township of shisur appeared over a ridge in a slight valley surrounded by the rolling desert the villages tiny mosque poked its minaret above the tumble of shacks and cinderblock buildings the buggies all stopped below the ridgeline a few of the women climbed out and up to the sandy crests they dropped flat their cloaks matching the sands clutching sniper rifles fearing a volley of accidental gunfire safia exited the buggy kara followed she crossed up to the ridge caution drew her to hands and knees across the village she saw no sign of movement had they heard the approach of the dune buggies and gone into hiding fearing the unknown group safia surveyed the area to the north ruins covered fifteen acres surrounded by crumbling walls excavated from the sands and reconstructed guard towers interrupted the walls at regular intervals roofless stony circles a story high but the most dramatic feature of the ruins was its central citadel a threestory structure of stacked stone the castle perched atop a low hill that overlooked a deep ragged cleft in the ground the hole encompassed most of the land within the walls its bottom lay in shadows safia knew that the ruins of the hilltop fortress were only half of the original structure the other half lay at the bottom of the hole destroyed when the sinkhole opened up under it taking down sections of walls and half the castle the tragedy was explained by the continual drop of the lands water table a natural limestone cistern lay underneath the city as the water inside it dropped from drought and overuse it left behind a hollow subterranean cavern that eventually collapsed in on itself taking out half the city movement drew safias attention back to the village fifty yards away from a doorway below a figure appeared dressed in a dishdasha robe his head wrapped in a traditional omani headdress he lifted a mug into the air i just put a fresh pot on if you want a cup of joe youd best get your butts down here safia stood she recognized that flash of a rakish grin omaha a flush of relief washed through her before she knew it she was running down the slope toward him eyes blurry with tears even as she ran the depth of her reaction surprised her she stumbled across the gravel roadway hold it right there omaha warned backing up a step from windows and neighboring doorways rifles suddenly bristled a trap safia stopped stunned wounded before she could react a figure swept out of hiding from behind a low wall grabbed her swung her around a fist snatched a handful of hair and yanked back baring her neck something cold touched her flesh a long dagger glinted pressed a voice whispered with an icy ferocity it chilled her more than the knife at her throat you took a friend of ours omaha stepped to her shoulder we spied you coming i wouldnt forget the face of someone who tried to kidnap me what have you done with dr almaaz the voice hissed at her ear as the dagger pressed harder safia realized her face was still covered by scarf and goggles they thought her one of the women bandits perhaps breathless from fright she reached up and pulled down her scarf and goggles omaha did a double take he gaped at her face then lunged and pushed the mans arm away freeing her ohmygod saffie he hugged her tightly fire flared in her shoulder omaha my arm he dropped back others appeared in doorways and windows safia glanced behind her a man stood there the dagger in his hands painter she had not even recognized his voice she had a hard time reconciling this man with her image of him she still felt the blade against her skin the fist twisted in her hair painter backed up a step his face shone with relief but his blue eyes also glowed with an emotion almost too raw to read shame and regret he glanced away to the neighboring slope cycles and buggies now lined the ridge engines revving the rahim had been preparing to come to her rescue women all dressed and cloaked like safia appeared around nearby corners of buildings rifles on shoulders kara stomped down the slope arms in the air everyone back down she called loudly it was only a misunderstanding omaha shook his head that woman doesnt need to remove her mask id recognize that screech of command anywhere kara painter said stunned how omaha turned to safia are you all right im fine she managed to squeak out kara joined them she removed her scarf leave her be she waved them off give her some room to breathe omaha pushed back he nodded to the slope warily the rahim had begun to march down so who are your friends kara shrugged that may take some explaining am open desert cassandra steppedup to her tent a us army desert survival model meant to withstand winds up to eighty miles per hour she had reinforced it with a windandsand shield on the windward side of the tent the team here had similar accommodations the larger transport trucks had also been positioned as a windbreak at her tent cassandra shook sand from her fatigues she wore a widebrimmed hat tied down around her ears a scarf over her face the winds gusted now snapping tent lines causing sheets of sand to course underfoot the sandstorm rumbled like a passing freight train she had just returned from a final inspection of their deployment ensuring all the copters were battened down the men had already planted the gps beacons to fix their position coordinated with the fixed orbital satellites feed should be flowing into her computerized mapping system cassandra had a couple hours before the static electricity of the sandstorm would threaten the electronics requiring them to be shut down plenty of time to intercept the data from the landsat satellite as it focused on her gps beacons the satellites radar had the capability of delving sixty feet under the sand it would give her an overview of what lay underfoot some indication of where to begin digging as soon as the sandstorm blew itself out her team would set to work with dozers and backhoes by the time anyone was aware of their excavation theyd be long gone that was the plan cassandra pushed through the tent flap the interior of the tent was spartan a cot and a duffel the remainder of her tent was an elaborate satellite communication system she had other electronic gear stored in carryalls she crossed to the laptop computer and used her cot as a seat she linked to jpl in houston and fed the proper authorization to access landsat data the pass should have been completed five minutes ago the data awaited her she tapped the keys and began the download finished she sat back and watched the screen slowly fill with an image of the desert she spotted her trucks tents even their trenched latrine it was the survey pass perfect alignment a second image slowly fed into her laptop the deeper scan cassandra leaned in closer the terrain stripped away to display a different conformation revealing the bedrock under the sand it was a fossil of a different time preserved in limestone while most of the terrain was flat it was etched by an old riverbed coursing along one corner of the image it drained into an ancient lake bed buried under their site cassandra studied the landscape a snapshot from another time she saw nothing significant no meteor crater no artifact that intrigued she sat back she would forward it to a pair of geologists on the payroll with the guild perhaps they could read more into it a noise at her tent flap drew her attention around john kane limped into her tent weve picked up dr almaazs signal cassandra swung to face him when where eight minutes ago it took another few minutes to get a fix her signal blipped into existence ten miles west of here by the time we triangulated shed stopped moving she went to ground about six miles from here he hobbled over to the map on her worktable and tapped right here cassandra leaned next to him reading the name shisur whats there i asked one of the techs at thumrait he says its where the old ruins of ubar were found back in the nineties cassandra stared at the map her lines in blue and red still looked fresh the red circle marked her present position she put her finger on the circle and followed the red line backward it crossed shisur she closed her eyes again picturing the curators expression when cassandra had drawn the circle she had continued studying the map her eyes had been distant calculating in her head the goddamn bitch cassandras finger on the map closed to form a fist anger burned through her yet deeper down a flash of respect flared john kane stood with his brows crinkled cassandra stared back at the landsat image theres nothing here she fucked us were at the wrong place captain she faced kane get the men up were heading out i want the trucks moving in the next ten minutes the sandstorm fuck it weve just enough time were moving out we cant let ourselves get pinned down here she herded kane toward the doors leave the equipment tents supplies weapons only kane swept out of the room cassandra turned to one of her carrying cases she snapped it open and removed a handheld digital radio transmitter she flipped it on dialed in the proper frequency and channel to match the curators implanted transceiver she held a finger over the transmit button one touch and the c pellet in dr almaazs neck would explode severing her spine and killing her instantly she felt an overwhelming urge to press it instead she switched the unit off it was not compassion that held her hand safia had proven her prowess at riddle solving such skill might still be needed but more than that she didnt know for certain if painter was at the womans side that was important cassandra wanted painter to see safia die picking a lock december am shisur safia securedher goggles in place does everyone have their gear it looks like nights falling clay said by the open doorway they had boarded up the windows to the cinderblock building they had chosen this particular home because it had a solid door to close against the winds it also opened on the south face of the structure away from direct assault by the storm through the doorway safia could see that the morning sky had been swept away by higherblowing sand darkening the world to an eerie twilight dust clouds shadowed the sun closer at hand channels of swirling sand swept along the alleys to either side of the home eddying in front of the door it was the leading edge of the storm farther out the heart of the sandstorm moaned and roared like some ravenous beast gnashing through the desert they didnt have much time safia faced the group assembled in the plain room most buildings in shisur were left open or unlocked the seasonal residents simply stripped the place to the plaster before moving on leaving nothing to steal except for a few broken bits of pottery a dirty cracked dish in the kitchen sink and a handful of pale green scorpions even the curtains had been taken you all have your assigned places to search safia said she had a map nailed to one wall she had divided the site into five sections one for each of their metal detectors scrounged from the ruins work shack they had motorola radios to keep in contact everyone except the youngest children had an assigned grid to help search armed with pickaxes shovels and spades if you detect something mark it let your companions dig it out keep moving keep searching nods met her orders all the searchers were outfitted in reddish brown desert cloaks supplied by lulu faces were muffled eyes shielded by goggles it was like they were preparing to go underwater if anything of significance is found radio it in ill come see and remember she tapped the watch on the wrist of her slung arm after fortyfive minutes we all return here the storms full brunt is due to hit in just under an hour well weather the worst of the storm in here examine anything we find and move on from there as the winds die down any questions no one raised a hand lets go then the thirty searchers set off into the storm as the citadel was the most likely spot to search for the gates of ubar safia led a majority of the team members to the ruins of the fortress to concentrate attention there painter and clay lugged the groundpenetrating radar sled barak held the metal detector over his shoulder like a rifle behind him coral and kara carried excavating tools trailing last lulu and the dunebuggy driver jehd followed all the other rahim had broken up into teams to search the other grids safia stepped around the corner of the cinderblock building she was immediately blown back a step by a gust it felt like the hand of god shoving her roughpalmed and gritty she bent into the wind and set off toward the entrance gates to the ruins she noted painter studying the hodja they had all exchanged their respective stories upon meeting catching everyone up safias story was of course the most shocking and seemingly fanciful a secret tribe of women whose bloodline ran back to the queen of sheba a line granted strange mental powers by some source at the heart of ubar though painters face was goggled and wrapped in a muffler his very posture expressed doubt and disbelief he kept a wary pace between safia and the hodja they crossed out of the village proper and through the wooden gates to the ruins each party dispersed to its grid assignments omaha and danny lifted their arms in salute as they headed toward the sinkhole below the citadel with their field experience the two men would oversee the search of the sinkhole the chasm was another likely spot for a possible significant find as a corner of the towering fortress had collapsed into the hole still omaha had not been happy about his assignment since safias arrival he had followed her every step sat next to her his eyes seldom leaving her face she had felt a flush at his attention half embarrassment half irritation but she understood his relief at discovering her alive and didnt rankle against his attention painter on the other hand held back from her dispassionate clinical he kept busy listening to safias story without any reaction something had changed between them become awkward she knew what it was she forced her hand not to rub her neck where he had held the dagger he had shown a side of himself a fierce edge sharper than the dagger neither knew how to react she was too shocked unsettled he had closed off focusing on the mystery here safia led her team up a steep trail to the hilltop fortress as they climbed the entire system of ruins opened out around them it had been a decade since safia had last laid eyes upon the ruins before there had only been the citadel in disrepair just a mound of stones and a short section of wall now the entire encircling ramparts had been freed from the sands partially rebuilt by archaeologists along with the stumplike bases of the seven towers that once guarded its walls even the sinkhole thirty feet deep had been excavated and sifted through but most of the attention had been devoted to the citadel the piled stones had been fitted back together like a jigsaw puzzle the base of the castle was square in shape thirty yards on each side supporting its round watchtower safia imagined guards pacing the parapets wary of marauders watchful of approaching caravans below the fortress a busy town had prospered merchants hawked wares of handcrafted pottery dyed cloths wool rugs olive oil palm beer date wine stonemasons labored to build higher walls and throughout the town dogs barked camels brayed and children ran among the stalls bright with laughter beyond the walls irrigated fields spread green with sorghum cotton wheat and barley it had been an oasis of commerce and life safias eyes drifted to the sinkhole then one day it all came to an end a city destroyed people had fled in superstitious terror and so ubar vanished under the sweep of sands and years but all that was all on the surface stories of ubar went deeper tales of magical powers tyrant kings vast treasures a city of a thousand pillars safia glanced at the two women one old one young identical twins separated by decades how did both stories of ubar hang together the mystical and the mundane the answers lay hidden here safia was sure of it she reached the gateway into the citadel and stared up at the fortress painter flicked on a flashlight and shone a bright beam into the dark interior of the citadel we should begin our search safia stepped over the threshold as soon as she entered the fortress the winds died completely and the distant rumble of the sandstorm dimmed lulu joined her now barak followed them turning on the metal detector he began to sweep behind her as if wiping away her footprints from the sand seven steps down the hall a windowless chamber opened a manmade cavern the back wall was a collapsed ruin of tumbled stone sweep the room safia directed barak the tall arab nodded and began his search for any hidden artifacts painter and clay set up the groundpenetrating radar as she had instructed safia swung her flashlight over the walls and ceiling they were unadorned someone had lit a campfire at one time soot stained the roof safia paced the floor eyes searching for any clue barak marched back and forth intent on his metal detector searching floor and walls as the room was small it didnt take long he came up empty not even a single ping safia stood in the center of the room this chamber was the only inner sanctum still remaining the tower overhead had collapsed in on itself destroying whatever rooms lay above painter activated the groundpenetrating radar flicking on its portable monitor clay entered the room slowly dragging the red sled over the sandy stone floor pulling it like a yoked ox safia came over and studied the scan more familiar with reading the results if there were any secret basement rooms they would show up on the radar the screen remained dark nothing solid rock limestone safia straightened if there was some secret heart to ubar it had to lie underground but where maybe omaha was having better luck with his team safia lifted her radio omaha can you hear me a short pause yeah whats up did you find anything no anything down in the pit were just finishing with the sweep but so far nothing safia frowned these were the two best spots to expect to find answers here was the spiritual center of ubar its royal house the ancient queen would have wanted immediate access to the secret heart of ubar she would have kept its entrance close safia turned to lulu you mentioned that after the tragedy here the queen sealed ubar and scattered its keys lulu nodded until the time was ripe for ubar to open again so the gate wasnt destroyed when the sinkhole opened that was a bit of luck too much luck she pondered this sensing a clue maybe we should bring the keys here painter said no she dismissed this possibility the keys would only become important once the gate was found but where if not at the citadel painter sighed arms crossed what if we tried recalibrating the radar heightened the intensity searched deeper safia shook her head no no were looking at this all wrong too high tech thats not going to solve this puzzle painter had a slightly hurt look technology was his bailiwick were thinking too modern metal detectors radar grids mapping things out this has all been done before the gate to survive this long undisturbed must be entrenched in the natural landscape hidden in plain sight or else it wouldve been found before we need to stop leading with our tools and start thinking with our heads she found lulu staring back at her the hodja wore the face of the queen who had sealed ubar but did the two share the same nature safia pictured reginald kensington frozen forever in glass a symbol of pain and torment the hodja had remained silent all these years she mustve dug up the body taken it to their mountain lair and hidden it away only the discovery of ubars keys had broken the womans silence loosened her tongue to reveal her secrets there was a pitiless determination in all this and if the ancient queen had been like the hodja she would have protected ubar with that same pitiless determination a mercilessness that bordered on the ruthless safia felt a well of ice rise around her remembering her initial question how did the gate conveniently survive the sinkholes collapse she knew the answer she closed her eyes with dawning dismay she had been looking at this all wrong backward it all made a sick sense painter must have sensed her sudden distress safia i know how the gate was sealed am painter hurriedback from the cinderblock building safia had sent him running to fetch the radx scanner it had been a part of the equipment taken from cassandras suv apparently cassandra had even demonstrated it to safia back in salalah showing her how the iron heart bore a telltale sign of antimatter decay to convince safia of the true reason for this search along with the radx scanner painter had discovered an entire case of analyzing equipment more sophisticated than anything he was acquainted with but there was a hungry gleam in corals eye as she had looked at the equipment her only comment nice toys painter hauled the entire case safia was onto something the storm fought him as he passed through the wooden gate and into the ruins sand peppered every exposed inch of skin wind tore at his scarf and cloak he leaned into the wind the day had turned to twilight and this was only the front edge of the storm to the north the world ended in a wall of darkness flashing in spidery crackles of blue fire static charges painter smelled the electricity in the air nasa had done studies for a proposed mars mission to judge how equipment and men would fare in such sandstorms it wasnt the dust and sand that most threatened their electronic equipment but the extreme static charge to the air formed from a combination of dry air and kinetic energy enough to fry circuits in seconds create agonizing static bursts on skin and now this storm was swirling up a giant squall of static and it was about to roll over them painter ducked toward the low hill burrowing through the wind and blowing sand as he reached the area he headed down instead of up following the steep trail that descended into the sinkhole the deep pit stretched east to west along its longer axis on the west end the citadel sat atop its hill maintaining a vigil over the sinkhole safia and her team crouched on the other side at the eastern end of the chasm by now the rahim had gathered too around the rim of the pit most lay flat on their bellies to lessen their exposure to the wind ignoring them painter slipped and slid down the sandy path reaching the bottom he hurried forward safia omaha and kara were bent over the monitor of the groundpenetrating radar unit safia was tapping at the screen right there see that pocket its only three feet from the surface omaha leaned back clay drag the radar sled back two feet yeah right there he bent over the monitor again painter joined them what did you find a chamber safia said omaha frowned its only a remnant of the old well long gone dry im sure its already been documented by other researchers painter moved closer as omaha clicked a button on the monitor a vague threedimensional cross section of the terrain under the radar sled appeared on the monitor it was conical in shape narrow at the top and wider at the bottom its only ten feet at its widest omaha said just an uncollapsed section of the original cistern it does look like a blind pocket kara agreed safia straightened up no its not she faced painter did you bring that radiation detector painter lifted the case got it run the scanner painter opened the case snapped the detection rod on the radx scanners base and activated it the red needle swept back and forth calibrating a blinking green light steadied to a solid glow all ready he slowly turned in a circle what was safia suspecting the red needle remained at the zero point nothing he called back i told you omaha started he was cut off now check the cliff face safia pointed to the rock wall get close painter did as she directed the scanner held out before him like a divining rod sand swirled around inside the pit a minidust bowl stirred by the winds overhead he hunched over the scanner as he reached the cliff face he ran the detection rod over the rock face mostly limestone the needle shimmied on the dial he held the scanner more steadily shielding it from the wind with his own body the needle settled to a stop it was a very weak reading barely shifting the needle but it was a positive reading he shouted over his shoulder i got something here safia waved back we have to dig where the sled is positioned three feet down open the pocket omaha checked his watch we only have another twenty minutes we can do it its just packed sand and small rocks if several people dig at the same time painter agreed feeling a surge of excitement do it in less then a minute a ring of diggers set to work safia stood back cradling her arm in the sling are you ready to explain yourself omaha said safia nodded i had to be sure weve been thinking about this all wrong we all know the sinkhole opened under ubars township and destroyed half the town driving folks away in superstitious fear of gods wrath after this disaster the last queen of ubar sealed its heart to protect its secrets so kara asked standing beside the hodja doesnt it strike you as odd that the gate was conveniently spared during the devastation here that as the city folk fled the queen stayed behind and performed all these secret acts sealed the gate in such a manner that it has never been discovered forged and hid keys at sacred sites of that time i suppose kara said omaha brightened visibly i see what youre getting at he glanced to the diggers back to safia grabbing her good arm weve been looking at this assbackward would someone care to explain it to us layfolk painter asked irritated at omahas understanding omaha explained the chronology has to be wrong chickenandegg scenario weve believed the sinkhole was the reason ubar was sealed now think about it in a new light safia added as if you were the queen what would such a disaster matter to the royal house anyway the true wealth of ubar the source of its power lay elsewhere the queen couldve simply rebuilt she had the wealth and the power omaha chimed in the pair working as an experienced team the town was not important it was only a mask hiding the true ubar a facade a tool one turned to a new use safia said a means of hiding the gate kara shook her head clearly as confused as painter omaha sighed something truly terrified the queen enough to drive her from the wealth and power of ubar force her and her descendants to live a nomadic existence existing on the fringe of civilization do you really think a simple sinkhole like this wouldve done it i guess not painter said he noted the excitement growing between safia and omaha they were in their element he was excluded on the outside looking in a flare of jealousy prickled through him safia picked up the thread something terrified the royal family enough that they wanted ubar locked from the world i dont know what that event was but the queen did not act rashly look at how methodical her preparations were afterward she prepared keys hid them in places sacred to the people wrapped them in riddles does this sound like an irrational response it was calculated planned and executed as was her first step in sealing ubar safia glanced to omaha he filled in the final blank the queen deliberately caused the sinkhole to collapse a stunned moment of silence followed she destroyed her own town kara finally asked why safia nodded the town was only a means to an end the queen put it to its final use to bury ubars gate omaha glanced all around the rim the act also had a psychological purpose it drove folks away frightened them from ever approaching i wager the queen herself spread some of the stories about gods wrath what better way to hang a religious do not trespass sign on these lands how did you figure all that out painter asked it was only a conjecture safia said i had to test it if the sinkhole was used to bury something then there must be something down here since the metal detectors discovered nothing either the object was too deep or it was some type of chamber painter glanced at the diggers safia continued as with the tomb sites the queen cloaked clues in symbols and mythology even the first key the iron heart it symbolized the heart of ubar and in most towns the heart of their community is the well so she hid the gate of ubar in the well buried them in sand as the iron heart was sealed in sandstone then dropped the sinkhole on top of them driving people away painter mumbled he cleared his throat and spoke more clearly what about the radiation signature it would take dynamite to drop this sinkhole omaha answered safia nodded or some form of an antimatter explosion painter glanced at lulu the hodja had remained stoically quiet the entire time had her ancestors really utilized such a power the old woman seemed to note his attention she stirred her eyes were hidden by goggles no you cast aspersions the queen our ancestor would not kill so many innocent people just to hide ubars secret safia crossed to her no human remains were ever found in or around the sinkhole she must have found some way to clear the city a ceremony or something then sank the hole i doubt anyone died here still the hodja was unconvinced even taking a step back from safia a shout rose from the diggers we found something danny yelled all their faces turned to him come see before we dig further painter and the others all shifted over coral and clay stepped aside for them danny pointed his shovel in the center of the trenchlike hole the dark red sand had turned to snow what is that kara asked safia hopped down dropped to a knee and ran her hand over the surface its not sand she glanced up its frankincense what painter asked silver frankincense safia elaborated and stood up the same as what was found plugging the iron heart an expensive form of cement its stoppered the top of the hidden chamber like a cork in a bottle and below it painter asked safia shrugged theres only one way to find out am cassandra clutchedher laptop as the m highspeed tractor mashed over another small dune the transport vehicle looked like a brown winnebago balanced on a pair of tank treads and despite its eighteenton weight it chewed across the landscape with the efficiency of a bmw down the autobahn she kept the pace reasonable respecting the terrain and weather visibility was poor only yards ahead windblown sand flumed all around whipping off the tops of dunes in vast sails the sky had darkened cloudless the sun no more than a wan moon above she dared not risk bogging down the tractor theyd never drag it free so they proceeded with sensible caution behind her the other five allterrain trucks traveled in the tracks of the larger tractor as it blazed a trail through the desert in the rear were the flatbeds with the cradled vtol copters she glanced to the clock in the corner of the laptops screen while it had taken a full fifteen minutes to get the caravan moving they were now making good time theyd reach shisur in another twenty minutes still she kept an eye on the screen two display windows were open on it one was a realtime feed from an noaa satellite that tracked the path of the sandstorm she had no doubt theyd reach the shelter of the oasis before the full storm struck but just barely and of even greater concern the coastal highpressure system was on the move inland due to collide with this desert storm in the next few hours it would be hell out here for a while the other screen on the monitor displayed another map of the area a topographic schematic of this corner of the desert it diagrammed every building and structure in shisur including the ruins a small blue spinning ring the size of a pencil eraser glowed at the center of the ruins dr safia almaaz cassandra stared at the blue glow what are you up to the woman had led her off course away from the prize she thought to steal it out from under cassandras nose using the cover of the storm smart girl but intelligence carried you only so far strength of arm was just as important sigma had taught her that pairing brawn and brain the sum of all men sigmas motto cassandra would teach that lesson to dr almaaz you may be smart but i have the strength she glanced to the side mirror to the trail of military vehicles inside one hundred men armed with the latest in military and guild hardware directly behind in the tractors transport bed john kane sat with his men rifles bristled as they performed the deadly sacrament of a final weapons inspection they were the best of the best her praetorian guards cassandra stared ahead as the tractor ground its way inevitably forward she attempted to pierce the gloom and windswept landscape dr almaaz might discover the treasure out there but in the end cassandra would take it she glanced back to the laptops screen the storm ate away the map of the region consuming all in its path on the other display window the schematic of the town and ruins glowed in the dim cabin cassandra suddenly tensed the blue ring had vanished from the map dr almaaz was gone am safia hungfrom the caving ladder she stared up at painter above his flashlight blinded her she flashed on the moment in the museum when she hung from the glass roof and he was below her encouraging her to wait for security only now their roles were reversed he was on top she was below yet once again she was the one hanging above a drop just a few more steps he said his scarf whipping about his neck she glanced to omaha below he held the ladder steady i got you bits of crumbling frankincense cascaded around her boulders of it lay around omahas feet and the air in the subterranean chamber was redolent with its aroma it had taken only a few minutes with pickaxes to perforate into the conicalshaped cave once they had broken through omaha had lowered a candle into the cave both to check for bad air and to light the interior he then went down the collapsible ladder inspecting the chamber himself only when he was satisfied did he let safia climb down with her injured shoulder she had to loosen her left arm from her sling and carry most of her weight with her right she struggled the rest of the way down omahas hand found her waist and she leaned into his grip gratefully he helped her to the floor im all right she said when he kept a hand on her elbow he lowered his hand it was much quieter out of the wind making her feel slightly deaf already painter had mounted the ladder coming down moving swiftly soon three flashlights shone across the walls its like being inside a pyramid painter said safia nodded three rough walls tilted up to the hole at the top omaha knelt on the floor running his fingers across the ground sandstone safia said all three walls and floor is that significant painter asked this is not natural the walls and floor are hewn slabs of sandstone this is a manmade structure built atop bedrock of limestone i imagine then sand was poured around the outside once it was covered they plugged the hole at the top and covered it with more loose sand omaha stared up and to make sure no one found it by accident they dropped the sinkhole atop it frightening everyone away with ghost stories but why do all that painter asked whats this supposed to be isnt it obvious omaha grinned at him looking suddenly striking to safia his goggles lay draped under his chin his scarf and hood thrown back he had not shaved in a couple of days leaving a bronzed stubble over cheek and chin his hair stuck up in odd places she had forgotten how he looked in the field half wild untamed he was in his natural element a lion on the veldt all that came to her with only the flash of his grin he loved all thisand once she had too she had been as wild and uninhibited his companion lover friend colleague then tel aviv whats obvious painter asked omaha flung an arm this structure you saw one of these today painter frowned safia knew omaha was teasing this out not from malice but simply from pure enjoyment and awe we banged into one of thesea much smaller oneas we descended out of the mountains painters eyes widened his gaze swept the space those prayer stones a trilith omaha said were standing inside a giant trilith safia suspected omaha wanted to jump up and down and truth be told his excitement was contagious she could not stand still herself we need to bring the keys down here what about the storm painter cautioned screw the storm omaha said you and the others can go and hide out in town im staying here his eyes fell on safia she nodded weve good shelter here if someone could lower the iron artifacts water a few supplies let omaha and me figure out what to do with them we might have the riddle solved by the time the worst of the storm blows itself out otherwise well lose a whole day painter sighed i should stay here too omaha waved him off crowe youre not much use to us to use your own words from earlier this is my area of expertise guns military opsthats you here youre simply taking up space storm clouds built behind painters blue eyes safia placed a conciliatory hand on the mans arm omahas right weve got radios if we need anything someone has to make sure everyone stays safe when the storm hits with clear reluctance painter stepped to the ladder his eyes lingered on her glanced to omaha then away he climbed up and called back radio what youll need he then shooed everyone away herding them back to the shelter of the cinderblock homes safia suddenly became acutely aware of how alone she was with omaha what had seemed so natural a moment ago now seemed strange and uncomfortable as if the air had suddenly soured in here the chamber felt too cramped claustrophobic maybe this wasnt such a brilliant idea where do we start omaha asked his back to her safia lifted her arm back into her sling we look for clues she stepped away and shone her light up and down each wall each appeared to be the identical size and shape the only mark was a small square hole cut halfway up one wall perhaps a place to rest an oil lamp omaha lifted a metal detector from the floor safia waved him to put it down i doubt thats going to as soon as he flipped on its power the detector pinged omahas eyebrows rose talk about beginners luck but as he swept the device over more of the floor the detector continued its pinging as if the metal lay everywhere he lifted it to the sandstone walls more pinging okay omaha conceded dropping the detector getting nowhere im beginning to really hate that old queen shes hidden a needle in a haystack all this must have been too deep for the surface detectors time to go lowtech omaha pulled free a notepad and pencil with compass in hand he began mapping out the trilith so what about those keys what about them if theyre from the time of ubars downfall how did they end up in a statue from bc or at jobs tomb ubar fell inad look around you safia said they were skilled artisans in sandstone they must have found those holy sites balanced whatever energy source lies within these keys antimatter or whatever and burrowed the artifacts into elements already at the tombs the statue in salalah the prayer wall at jobs tomb then they sealed them over again with sandstone with a skill that left their handiwork undetectable omaha nodded continuing his sketching the bark of the radio startled them both it was painter safia i have the artifacts ill be returning with water and a couple mre rations anything else you need the winds are becoming fierce she considered staring at the walls around her then realized something that might come in handy she told him roger that ill bring it as she signed off she found omahas eyes on her he glanced too quickly to his notepad heres the best i could sketch he mumbled and showed her his diagram any thoughts she asked well traditionally the three stones of the trilith represent the celestial trinity sada hird and haba the moon the sun and the morning star safia said naming them as they were known today a trinity revered by the early religions of the region again the queen was showing no preferential treatment between the faiths but which stone slab represents which celestial body omaha asked she nodded where to begin in the morning id say the morning star appears at dawn in the southeast sky omaha patted the appropriate wall so that seems obvious enough which leaves us two other walls safia said taking over now the northern wall is aligned along the eastwest axis straight as an arrow the path the sun takes across the sky safia brightened even that little hollow square in the north wall could represent a window to let sunlight inside then that leaves this last wall to be the moon omaha stepped to the southwest wall i dont know why this one represents the moon but sada was the predominant deity to the desert tribes of arabia so it must be significant safia nodded in most cultures the sun was the major divinity paramount lifegiving warming but in the searing deserts it was deadly merciless unforgiving so instead the moon sada was most worshiped for its cooling touch the moon was the bringer of rain represented by the bull with its crescentshaped horns each quarter phase of the moon was named il or ilah which over the years came to be known as a term for god in hebrew el or elohim in arabic allah the moon was paramount still the wall appears blank omaha said safia neared him there must be something she joined the search the surface was rough pocked in places a crunch of sand announced painters arrival omaha climbed halfway up the ladder and passed supplies to safia below howre things going in there painter called as he lowered a plastic gallon of water slow safia said but were making progress omaha interjected painter leaned into the wind unburdened as he was it looked like the next strong gust might kite him away omaha climbed back down skitters of windblown sand followed him youd better get back to the shelter safia called up worried for painters safety he gave her a salute and pushed away into the sandy gale now where were we omaha asked am out ofthe sinkhole painter fought through the storm an eerie night had fallen dust covered the sun casting the world in crimson visibility shut down to mere feet in front of his face he had his nightvision goggles fixed in place but even they gained only another yard of sightline he barely saw the gates as he hunched through them among the village buildings sand flowed underfoot with the winds as if he were walking along a streambed his clothes spat with static electricity he tasted it in the air his mouth felt chalky his lips brittle and dry finally he ducked around into the lee of their shelter out of the direct teeth of the storm he felt capable of taking full breaths sand flumed in wild eddies streaming over the roofline he walked with one hand along the cinderblock wall feet in front of him a figure folded out of the swirls of darkness a ghost taking form a ghost with a rifle it was one of the rahim scouts on guard he hadnt seen her until he was on top of her he nodded to her as he passed no acknowledgment he marched by her to the doorway stopping he glanced back she was gone again vanished was it just the storm or was it a part of her ability to blend into the background to cloud perception painter stood in front of the door he had heard the story from safia but it seemed too wild to believe as a demonstration of their mental abilities the hodja had placed a pale green scorpion on the floor and made it do figure eights in the dust over and over again seeming to control it was it some trick like snake charming as he reached to the knob the winds took a slightly different keen the roar had grown so constant that he barely heard it anymore but for a moment a deeper rumble arose a sound carried on the wind rather than the wind itself he remained still listening for it again trying to pierce the veil of sweeping sand the storm continued its steady growl the grumble was not repeated was it just the storm he stared out to the east he was certain the sound had come from that direction he yanked open the door and twisted inside half pushed by the winds the room was crowded with bodies he heard a child crying upstairs he had no trouble picking coral out from among the women an iceberg in a dark sea she rose from a crosslegged position she had been cleaning one of her pistols recognizing his worry she met him in quick strides whats wrong am all thetrucks gathered in the lee of a dune lined up as if awaiting the beginning of a parade men hunched in the relative shelter of the vehicles but details were murky in the gloom they were a quarter mile outside of shisur cassandra strode with kane down the ranks she wore nightvision goggles khaki fatigues and a hooded sand poncho belted at the waist kane marched with one hand covering the earpiece of his radio listening to a report a company of twenty soldiers had left ten minutes ago roger that hold for further orders he lowered his hand and leaned toward cassandra the team reached the towns outskirts have them circle the area both town and ruins pick vantages from which to snipe i dont want anything or anyone leaving that place aye captain he returned to speaking into the throat mike relaying orders they continued to the rear of the line to where six flatbed trucks carried the vtol copter sleds the helicopters were covered in tarps and lashed to their transport cradles they continued to the last two trucks men tugged free the ropes securing the copters a tarp went flying into the wind billowing high cassandra frowned at this these are your best two pilots cassandra asked kane as he finished with the radio the bastards had better be kanes eyes were on the storm both cassandra and kanes lives were now staked on the success of this mission the screwup at the tomb had cast both of them in a bad light they needed to prove themselves to the guild command but more than that cassandra noted an idiosyncratic quality in the man a new savageness less humor more deepseated fury he had been bested maimed scarred no one did that to john kane and lived to tell about it they reached the group of flatbed trucks cassandra found the two pilots waiting she strode toward them they had helmets tucked under one arm trailing electronic cords that would feed radar data to fly in this weather would be to fly by instruments only there was no visibility they straightened once they recognized her difficult with everyone muffled up and bundled in ponchos cassandra eyed them up and down gordon fowler you two think you can get these birds in the air in this storm yes sir gordon acknowledged fowler nodded weve attached electrostatic sand filters over the engine intakes and uploaded sandstorm software into our radar array were ready cassandra saw no fear in their faces even as the winds howled in fact they both looked flushed excited two surfers ready to tackle big waves youre to keep in constant contact with me personally cassandra said you have my com channel nods one will scout the town the other the ruins kane has a software patch to load into your onboard computers it will let you pick up the signal of the primary target the target is notand let me repeat not to be harmed understood gordon mumbled any other hostiles cassandra finished are to be shot on sight nods again cassandra swung away then lets get these birds in the air am omaha watchedsafia crawl on her knees sweeping sand off the floor with one hand he found it hard to concentrate he had forgotten how wonderful it was to work alongside her he noted the tiny beads of perspiration on her brow the way her left eye crinkled when she was intrigued the dab of dirt on her cheek this was the safia he had always knownbefore tel aviv safia continued sweeping was there any hope for them she glanced up to him noting that hed stopped he stirred and cleared his throat what are you doing he asked and motioned to her sweeping of the floor the maid comes tomorrow she sat back and patted the wall tilted above her head this is the southeast side the slab of the trilith that represents the morning star rising each day in the southeastern skies right i told you that so safia had been working in silence for the past ten minutes laying out the supplies painter had lugged here very methodically her usual way of doing things she had spent most of this time examining the keys whenever he tried to interject a question she would hold up a palm safia went back to her sweeping weve already determined which wall corresponds to which celestial bodymoon sun or morning starbut now we have to figure out which keys match those celestial bodies omaha nodded okay and what are you figuring we have to think in a context of ancient times something cassandra failed to do accepting modern miles for roman ones the answer lies in that fact safia glanced back to him testing him he stared at the wall determined to solve this riddle the morning star is actually not a star its a planet venus to be specific identified and named by the romans omaha straightened then twisted to look at the artifacts venus was the roman god of love and beauty he knelt and touched the iron spear with the bust of the queen of sheba atop it and heres a definite beauty thats what i figured so like at jobs tomb there must be a place to insert it a hole in the ground she continued her search he joined herbut searched elsewhere you have it wrong he said its the wall thats significant not the floor he ran his palm over the surface and continued his reasoning enjoying the match of wits in solving this riddle its the slab that represents the morning star so it is in the slab youll find his words died as his fingers discovered a deep pock in the wall waisthigh up the slab it looked natural easy to miss in the shadowy darkness his index finger sank fully into it he crouched there like the dutch boy at the dike safia rose up beside him you found it get the artifact safia stepped over grabbed the iron spear omaha pulled his finger free and helped her insert its end in the hole it was an ungainly process with the wall angled but they wiggled it into place it kept sinking farther and farther the entire haft of the spear was swallowed away until only the bust was left now hanging on the wall like some human trophy safia manipulated it further look how the wall is indented along this side it matches her cheekbone she turned the bust and pushed it flush a perfect fit she stepped back like a key in a lock and look where our iron queen is staring now safia followed her gaze the moon wall now the heart omaha said does it belong to the sun wall or the moon i would guess the sun wall the moon was the predominant god of the region its soft light brought cooling winds and the morning dew i think whatever were looking for next the final key or clue will be associated with that wall omaha stepped to the north wall so the heart belongs to this wall the sun the harsh mistress safia glanced to the artifact a goddess with an iron heart omaha lifted the artifact up there was only one place to rest it in the small window cut into the northern slab face but before settling it in place he ran his fingers along the sill having to stretch on his toes to feel the floor of the niche there are vague indentations in here like on the wall a cradle for the heart a lock and key it took a bit of rolling around to find the match between the iron hearts surface and the indentations in the sandstone he finally settled it in place it rested upright the end plugged with frankincense pointed at the moon wall okay id say thats an important slab omaha said what now safia ran her hands along the last wall nothings here omaha slowly turned in a circle nothing that we can see in the dark safia glanced back at him light all the celestial bodies illuminate the sun shines the morning star shines omaha squinted but upon what do they shine safia backed up she noted again the abnormally rough surface of the wall its pocked moonscape flashlights she mumbled they each retrieved one from the floor safia took a post by the mounted bust omaha moved to the heart in the window let there be light holding the flashlight over his head he positioned its beam as if it were sunlight pouring through the window angled to match the position of the plugged end the sun shines through a high window and the morning star shines low on the horizon safia said kneeling by the bust aiming her beam in the direction of the busts gaze omaha stared at the moon wall lit askance by their two light sources from two different angles the imperfections of the wall created shadows and crevices a form took shape on the wall painted with these shadows omaha squinted it looks like a camels head or maybe a cows its a bull safia stared at omaha her eyes bright embers sada the moon god is depicted as a bull because of the beasts crescentshaped horns omaha studied the shadows but then where are the bulls horns the animal on the wall had nothing between its ears safia pointed to the supplies get me that while i hold the light omaha placed his flashlight in the window resting it beside the iron heart he crossed to the gear and grabbed the device that looked like a shotgun only with one end belled out like a satellite dish safia had specifically asked painter to bring it he was anxious to see how this worked he passed it to her taking her post with the flashlight she strode to the center of the room and pointed the laser excavator a circle of red light appeared on the wall she fixed it above the shadow figure between the ears she pulled the devices trigger the red lights spun and sandstone immediately began to crumble as the laser energy vibrated the crystalline structure sand and dust billowed out also shinier bits flakes of metal red iron shavings omaha realized understanding now why the metal detector was constantly abuzz the architects of this puzzle had mixed iron shavings with the sand in the rock back at the wall the beam acted like a tornado furrowing through the sandstone as if it were soft dirt with his flashlight held steady omaha watched slowly a brighter glitter revealed itself within the stone a mass of iron safia continued to work moving the laser up and down in a matter of minutes an arch of horns appeared seated atop the shadowy image definitely a bull omaha agreed sada safia mumbled lowering the gun the moon she walked over and touched the rack of embedded horns as if making sure they were real a shower of blue sparks erupted with the contact youch are you all right yes she said shaking her fingers just a static shock still she backed a step away studying the mounted horns on the wall the horns certainly appeared as a sharp crescent protruding from the rock sand and dust cast from the excavation swirled into the chamber as the winds above grew suddenly more stiff seeming to blow directly down through the hole in the roof omaha glanced up above the sinkhole the skies were dark but something even darker stirred the air sweeping downward a light suddenly speared from it oh no am safia foundherself grabbed around the waist and tackled to the side omaha dragged her into the shadows below the tilted slabs what are you before she could finish a beam of bright light slammed through the hole overhead casting a pillar of brilliance through the center of the trilith chamber helicopter omaha yelled in her ear safia now heard the vague beat of rotors against the dull roar of the storm omaha held her tightly its cassandra the light blinked off as the floodlight swept away but the thump of the copters rotors persisted it was still out there searching in the storm safia knelt with omaha with the floodlight gone the chamber seemed darker i have to alert painter safia said she crawled to the motorola radio as her fingers reached to its surface another electric spark arced from radio to fingertips stinging like a wasp she jerked her hand back only now did she notice the escalation of static electricity she felt it on her skin crawling like ants her hair crackled with sparks as she glanced at omaha safia come back here omahas eyes were wide he circled toward her keeping to shadows his attention was not on the helicopter but fixed to the center of the chamber safia joined him he took her hand shocking them both hairs tingling in the center of the chamber a bluish glow billowed where the helicopters beam had once shone it shimmered roiling in midair edges ghostly with each breath it coalesced swirling inward static electricity omaha said look at the keys the three iron artifactsheart bust and hornsshone a dull ruddy hue theyre drawing the electricity out of the air acting like some lightning rods for the static charge of the storm above feeding power to the keys the blue glow grew into a scintillating cloud in the rooms center it stirred to its own winds churning in place the keys shone even brighter the air crackled traceries of charge coruscated from every fold of cloak or scarf safia gaped at the sight sandstone was a great nonconductive insulator freeing the horns from the stone must have completed some circuit among the three and the chamber was acting like a magnetic bottle trapping the energies we have to get the hell out of here omaha urged safia continued to stare entranced they were witnessing a sight set in motion millennia ago how could they leave omaha grabbed her elbow fingers digging saff the keys theyre like the iron camel at the museum and now a ball of lightning is forming in here safia flashed back to the video feed from the british museum the ruddy glow of the meteorite the cerulean roil of the lightning ballomaha was right i think we just activated a bomb down here omaha said pulling safia to her feet and shoving her to the collapsible ladder and its about to explode as she set her foot on the first rung the world flashed blindingly bright she flinched tightening in place a deer in headlights the helicopter had returned hovering directly overhead death waited aboveas surely as it did below down the rabbit hole december am shisur painter layflat on the roof of the cinderblock building he had bundled his cloak tightly under his legs the ends of his scarf tucked away he didnt want any telltale flapping of material to reveal his position he waited for the helicopter to make another pass over the town he would get one shot he had to assume the copter was outfitted with night vision the muzzle flash would give away his position he waited the galil sniping rifle at his cheek resting on a bipod the israeli weapon borrowed from one of the rahim had the capability to deliver a head shot at three hundred yards but not in this storm not with visibility so low he needed the helicopter close painter lay in wait the copter was up there somewhere searching an aerial hunter hidden in the storm any movement and it would open fire with its double guns painter noted the glow deeper in the storm in the direction of the ruins the second helicopter he prayed that safia and omaha had kept their heads down he had tried to radio them earlier when he first suspected the danger but something blocked the signal perhaps interference from the static charge of the storm he attempted to reach them on foot but the helicopters had swooped in targeting anything that moved if there were birds in the air then this was no small scouting party cassandra had somehow learned of her mistake and moved full forces in the radio in his ear whispered with static the channel left open words formed out of the white noise commander it was coral reporting in from the field as you suspected ive hostiles coming in on all sides theyre doing a buildingbybuilding search painter touched his transmitter trusting that the storm kept their words private the children and older women ready barak awaits your signal painter searched the skies where are you he needed to take out the helicopter if they were to have any hope of breaking through the noose around the town the plan was to strike out west of the ruins collecting safia and omaha along the way risking the wild weather though the storm was growing worse with every minute it could cover their retreat if they left the ruins behind perhaps cassandra would be satisfied enough to make only half an effort to hunt them down if they could get back to the mountains painter felt a fury build in him he hated to retreat to hand cassandra a victory here especially with the discovery of the secret chamber under the sinkhole cassandra would surely bring in heavy excavating equipment something lay down there the rahim were living proof of something extraordinary his only hope was to abscond with safia delaying cassandra enough for him to alert someone in washington someone he could trust and that certainly was not the command structure of sigma anger built in him stoking a fire in his gut he had been set up all of them had his mind flashed to safia he could still feel the beat of her heart under the blade he held at her throat he had seen the look in her eyes afterward as if he were a stranger but what did she expect this was his job sometimes hard choices had to be made and even tougher actions like now with corals report of forces moving into the towns outskirts they would be surrounded in minutes he could no longer wait for the helicopter to show itself it would need to be flushed out novak is the rabbit ready to run on your go commander rev it up painter waited cheek against the gun one eye peering through the telescopic lens the other on the skies a bright light burst down in the town shining from an open doorway details were murky but through his nightvision goggles the light shone brilliant a throaty engine growled and whined let her run painter ordered rabbits loose from the building a sand cycle burst forth its path was only evident as a brightness tearing down an alley between buildings it zigzagged through the tangle of streets painter watched the skies to either side and above then it appeared diving like a hawk the helicopters guns chattered flashes in the storm painter adjusted his rifle aimed for the source of the gunfire and pulled the trigger the recoil struck his shoulder like a mule kick he didnt wait he squeezed off another three shots ears ringing then he saw it a flare of flame a heartbeat later an explosion lit the storm fiery wreckage spat in all directions but the main bulk tumbled in a steep path it struck a building burst brighter then crashed into the roadway go painter yelled into his radio he shouldered the rifle and rolled off the roofs lip the soft sand cushioned his fall all around engines ignited with rumbles and coughing whines lights flared bikes and buggies burst forth from alleyways leantos and out of doorways one bike sped past painter a woman leaned over the bars another sat behind her rifle on her shoulder the women would sweep a path ahead guard their rear from the doorway kara appeared carrying a girl in her arms others followed barak helped an old woman followed by two others supporting each other clay and danny held childrens hands one on each side not a whimper from the lot of them not even clay follow me painter said and set off he kept his rifle shouldered but held a pistol in one hand as he rounded the corner of their shelter a barrage of gunfire sounded from the ruins through the gloom a floodlight flared the second helicopter oh god kara said behind him knowing what the gunfire meant safia and omaha had been found am runomahascreamed as they ran across the floor of the sinkhole but his words never reached his own ears the rattle of guns was deafening he pushed safia ahead of him they raced blinded by the swirling sand chased by a twin line of bullets chewing across the ground directly ahead rose the western cliff of the sinkhole shadowed from above by the citadels ruins the wall was lightly scalloped coved in if they could get under the lip of rock out of direct line of fire theyd have some shelter safia ran an arms length ahead of him slightly encumbered by her sling loping the stiff winds tangling her cloak about her feet sand blinded they hadnt even had time to pull their goggles in place moments ago they had decided that the helicopter was the lesser of two evils the powder keg building in the trilith chamber meant certain death so they took their chances on the run the chatter of guns grew louder as the helicopter swept behind them the only reason they had survived this long was the sandstorm the pilot fought to keep his craft trimmed in the winds it buffeted and fluttered a hummingbird in a gale throwing off the pilots aim they fled for shelter running blind omaha waited for bullets to shred into him with his last breath he would push safia to safety if need be it wasnt necessary the bullets suddenly stopped as if the craft had run out of ammunition the sudden silence drew omahas attention over his shoulder his ears still ringing the helicopters floodlight angled away the copter swept back with his attention turned he stumbled over a rock went down hard omaha safia came back to help he waved her off get to shelter omaha hobbled after her his ankle flaring with pain twisted sprained hopefully not broken he cursed his stupidity the helicopter retreated to the other side of the sinkhole it had them dead to rights they shouldnt have made it why had it pulled back what the hell was going on am eagleonedont hit the goddamn target cassandra screamed into the radio she banged a fist on the armrest of her seat in the m armored tractor on her laptop she stared at the blue glowing ring of the curators transceiver it had blinked into existence a moment ago the gunfire had flushed safia out into the open eagle one answered the pilots voice choppy ive broke off there are two of them i cant tell which one is the target cassandra had radioed just in time she pictured the pilot cutting down the woman the curator was her best chance to quickly root out the secrets here and abscond with the prize and the asinine pilot had almost mowed her down leave them both she said guard the hole they came out of whatever cavern the curator had disappeared into had to be important cassandra leaned close to her laptop watching the blue glow safia was still in the giant sinkhole there was nowhere she could go that cassandra could not find her even if the woman vanished into another cave cassandra would know where to find the entrance she turned to the tractors driver john kane take us in with the engine still running he shoved the gearshift the tractor jerked then trundled up the dune that hid them from the town of shisur cassandra sat back one hand on the laptop holding it steady as they reached the dunes summit the nose of the tractor rocked high then fell down the far slope the valley of shisur lay ahead but nothing could be seen beyond a few yards of the vehicles xenon headlights the storm swallowed the rest away all except a scatter of glows marking the town vehicles on the move a firefight between her forces and some unknown party still continued distantly echoes of sporadic gunfire reached her the captain of her forward forces had radioed in his assessment they all appear to be women it made no sense still cassandra remembered the woman she had chased through the back alleys of muscat the one who had vanished in front of her was there a connection cassandra shook her head it no longer mattered this was the endgame and she would not tolerate anyone thwarting her as she watched the show of lights in the darkness she lifted her radio and spoke to the leader of her artillery forward battery are you in position yes sir ready to light the candles on your order cassandra checked her laptop the blue ring of the transceiver persisted in the sinkhole nothing else mattered whatever they sought lay among the ruins with the curator raising her gaze cassandra stared at the shimmer of wavering lights where the town of shisur lay she lifted her radio called the forward troops and ordered a pullback she then switched back to the artillery captain level the town am aspainterled the others out of the village and through the gates of the ruins he heard the first whistle it pierced through the storms roar he swung as the first shell struck the town a fireball burst skyward lighting the storm illuminating a patch of the village briefly the boom reverberated in his gut gasps rose around him more whistles filled the air rockets and mortars he never suspected cassandra had such firepower at hand painter fumbled for his radio coral go dark whatever advantage of surprise they had gained by the sudden burst of vehicles from their hiding places had ended it was time to evacuate out in the town the lights of the vehicles were all extinguished under the cover of darkness the women were to retreat to the ruins more rockets struck blooming in wild spirals of fire whipped by the winds coral he yelled into the radio no answer barak grabbed his arm they know the rendezvous painter swung around more concussions pounded his gut over at the sinkhole the gunfire from the second helicopter had gone silent what was happening am safia huddledwith omaha under a lip of rock the bombs rattled pebbles from the ruins of the citadel atop the cliff above them to the south the dark skies glowed ruddy from fires another boom reverberated through the storms wail the town was being destroyed had the others had time to escape safia and omaha had left their radios down in the trilith chamber they had no way of knowing how the others had fared painter kara at her side omaha leaned most of his weight on his right foot she had seen him take that spill while fleeing here he had twisted his ankle omaha mumbled through his scarf you could still make a dash for it she was worn her shoulder ached the helicopter it still hovered over the sinkhole its floodlight had blinked off but she still heard it it swept a slow circuit over the sandy floor keeping them pinned the pilot broke off his attack before hes probably half blind by the storm if you stuck to the wall ran fasti could even take potshots from here omaha still had his pistol im not leaving without you safia whispered her statement was not all altruistic she squeezed his hand needing to feel his solidness he attempted to free his hand forget it id just slow you down she held harder noi cant leave your side he suddenly seemed to understand the deeper meaning in her words the raw fear he pulled her closer she needed his strength he gave it to her the helicopter swept by overhead the bell beat of its rotor wash suddenly louder it angled back over the center of the sinkhole unseen its path described by the beat of its passage she leaned into omaha she had forgotten how broad his shoulders were how well she fit against him staring over his shoulder safia noted a flicker of blue across the sinkhole a dance of lightning oh god she clutched omaha harder saff omaha mumbled lips by her ear after tel aviv the explosion blew away any further words a wall of superheated air slammed them both against the wall to their knees a flash of brilliance then all vision squeezed away rocks rained around them a tremendous crack sounded above a huge boulder struck the sheltering lip and thudded into the sand more stones fell a torrent of rocks half blind safia felt it under her knees a shift in the earth the citadel was coming down am painter hadreached the edge of the sinkhole when the explosion ripped up from there the only warning a flash of blue scintillation deep in the hole then a column of cerulean blue fire erupted from the chamber opening lighting every corner shoving back the storm both with its brilliance and its hot breath the ground shook underfoot he felt the rush of heat shoot by his face straight up confined by the walls of the deep sinkhole but its backwash still buffeted him backward cries arose all around him the jetted column of cerulean fire struck the last helicopter full in the belly knocking it skyward cartwheeling it its fuel tank exploded in a wash of red flame dramatic against the blue the wreckage of the helicopter scattered away not in pieces but in liquid jets of molten fire the entire craft had melted within the bath of cobalt flame next from the sinkholes south rim painter watched the ruins of the citadel perched precariously over the western edge begin a slow tumble into the pit and at the bottom lit by the balefire flames as they petered out two figures stumbled across the floor rocks falling all around them safia and omaha am dazed omahaleaned on safia she had an arm under his shoulders they fought through the sands his eyes wept from the residual burn on his retinas but vision slowly returned first a glow formed dull bluish then he saw dark shadows falling around him thudding into the sand some bouncing a rain of rocks a biblical curse we must get clear safia yelled sounding as if she were underwater something struck the back of his good leg they were both thrown to the sand a deep grumble rattled behind them above them an angry god its coming down am painter racedheadlong down the path into the sinkhole to his left the back half of the citadel spilled into the chasm it groaned and rumbled pouring rock and sand into one end of the pit painter had witnessed a mud slide during a rainstorm an entire hillside liquefying this was the same only a bit slower rock proving more stubborn in snatches through the stormy gloom he spotted safia and omaha scrambling away from the avalanche as it slowly spilled toward them chasing them across the floor they fell down again as omaha was struck in the shoulder and spun around painter would not reach them in time a throaty growl whined behind him and a shout out of the way the shout threw him around a light flicked on spearing him in the face he was blinded but he saw enough in that split second to dive aside the sand bike sailed passed him down the slope spewing up gravel and sand it leaped the path ten feet from the bottom front wheel yanked up rear knobby wheel spinning it landed with a bounce a twist a crunch of sandthen tore off across the floor painter continued down the path he had spotted the rider bent over the handlebars it was coral novak cloaked and goggled hood thrown back white hair flagging behind her painter gave chase watching the cycle tear alongside the avalanche its headlamp flicked back and forth as coral dodged around obstacles then she reached the pair braking and skidding to them he heard her shout grab tight then she was off again shooting straight across the floor away from the tumbling stones hauling omaha and safia who clung to the seats back feet and legs dragging behind they raced clear of the rock slide painter reached the bottom well clear of the tumult of stone and sand by the time he reached the floor it was over the collapse of the hill and fortress settled to a stop the steep cliff was now a gentle slope edging the wide delta of spilled rock and sand painter hurried to the idling bike safia had climbed to her feet omaha leaned one hand on the seat coral sat astride the bike they all stared at the hole in the ground ahead of them it steamed and roiled like some entrance to hell it was where the trilith chamber had once opened only now it was ten feet across blasted wide and bubbling with water the headlamp of the bike illuminated the steaming surface as painter watched the waters receded draining away rapidly what was revealed held everyone silent am cassandra staredunblinking through the windshield of the m tractor a minute ago they had watched a blue flash of fire shoot skyward it had come from straight ahead in the direction of the ruins what the hell was that kane asked from the drivers seat they had halted the tractor a hundred yards off to the left the town flickered with a dozen fires directly ahead the ruins had gone dark again lost in the storm that was not one of our bloody mortars kane said it sure as hell wasnt cassandra glanced to her laptop the glow of the curators transceiver continued to shine though now it flickered as if some interference fluttered its signal what was going on over there she attempted to radio the only person who might know eagle one can you read me she waited for a reply none came kane shook his head both birds are down order another two copters in the air i want aerial coverage kane hesitated cassandra knew his concern the storm while already blowing fiercely was only beginning to ratchet up its full might had yet to strike and the coastal weather system was rushing up from the south promising even wilder weather to come as the two systems collided outfitted as they were with only six vtol copter sleds to send up another pair risked half their remaining aerial force but kane understood the necessity they dared not conserve their resources it was all or nothing he passed cassandras orders over his own radio once done he glanced to her silently asking her how to proceed she nodded ahead were going in should we wait until the birds are in the air no were armored she glanced over her shoulder to the men seated in the back compartment kanes commando team and we have enough land support with us somethings happening over there i can smell it he nodded shifted into gear and kicked the tractor into motion the lumbering tank ambled toward the ruins am safia knelton one knee and reached a hand over the holes lip she tested the heat with her palm winds tugged at her sand swirled in sweeps but not as fiercely the storm had abated slightly a momentary pause as if the explosion had sapped some strength from the gales force careful omaha said behind her safia stared down the hole at her feet the waters continued to recede it seemed impossible as the waters had drained away a glass ramp revealed itself spiraling deep the trilith chamber was gone all that was left was glass flowing downward in a corkscrew the entrance to ubar safia lowered her palm toward the ramps exterior slowly bringing it close to the glass it still glistened with drops of water radiant against the black surface reflecting the bikes headlight she felt no searing burn daring safia touched a finger to the black glass it was still warm very warm but it didnt burn she placed her palm flat its solid she said still cooling but the surface is hard she rapped on it to demonstrate standing up she reached a leg out and placed a foot on the ramp it held her weight the waters must have cooled it enough to harden painter stepped toward her weve got to get out of here coral spoke still astride her bike she lowered the radio from her lips commander all rahim are now gathered we can bug out on your word safia turned to the upper rim but it was lost in darkness she glanced down the throat of the glass spiral this is what we came to find if we dont leave now cassandra will bottle us here omaha joined them where will we go painter pointed west into the desert use the storm as cover are you mad this blow is just starting and the worst is yet to come what about that goddamn megastorm out in the open desert omaha shook his head id rather take my chances with that bitch safia pictured cassandra the ice in her manner the mercilessness in her eyes whatever mystery lay below would be cassandras to exploit she and her employer safia couldnt let that happen im going down she said cutting off the argument im with you omaha added at least its out of the storm new gunfire suddenly blasted up at the ridgeline everyone ducked and turned it looks like our decision is being made for us omaha mumbled coral barked into her radio painter into his along the rim lights flared headlamps engines revved vehicles began to descend into the sinkhole racing down what are they doing omaha asked painter shoved aside his radio his expression grim someone up there spotted the tunnel one of the women the hodja safia imagined with ubar now open the rahim wouldnt flee they would defend the site with their lives lulu was bringing the whole tribe down a pair of dune buggies even bounced across the tumbled rock slide vehicles closed in on their position the sudden eruption of gunfire died away coral explained holding her radio to her ear a hostile scouting party got into a sniping position atop one of the towers theyve been dispatched safia heard the respect in the womans voice the rahim had proven their mettle in this skirmish in moments buggies and bikes loaded with women braked in the sand the first buggy bore familiar faces crammed together kara danny and clay barak followed on a bike kara climbed out leading the others the winds were growing fiercer again snapping scarves flapping cloak edges kara held a pistol in one hand we spotted lights coming she said and pointed in the other direction off to the east lots of them trucks big ones and at least one helicopter took off i glimpsed its searchlight for a moment painter clenched a fist cassandras making her final move the hodja pushed through the throng ubar is open it will protect us omaha glanced back to the hole all the same ill keep my gun painter stared east we have no choice get everyone below stick together carry as much as you can manage guns ammunition flashlights the hodja nodded to safia you will lead us safia glanced down the dark spiral of glass suddenly less sure of her decision her breathing tightened when it was only her own life the risk was acceptable but now other lives were involved her eyes settled to a pair of children grasping each of clays hands they looked as terrified as the young man between them but clay held firm safia could do no less she allowed her heart to thunder in her ears but she calmed her breathing a new noise intruded carried on the wind a deep bass rumble of an engine something huge the eastern rim lightened cassandra was almost here go painter yelled he met safias eyes take them down quickly with a nod safia turned and began the descent she heard painter speak to coral i need your bike am cassandra watchedthe blue spinning ring on the transceiver blink out she balled a fist the curator was on the run again get us over there cassandra said between clenched teeth now were already here out of the gloom a stone wall appeared crumbling sandscoured more outline than substance illuminated by their headlights theyd reached the ruins kane glanced at her orders cassandra pointed to an opening in the wall near a broken tower get your men on the ground i want the ruins locked down no one leaves that chasm kane slowed the tractor enough for his crack team of commandos to roll out the side doors leaping over the trundling treads twenty men bristling with weapons spread into the storm vanishing through the gap in the wall kane drove the tractor ahead moving at a snails pace the tractor crunched over the stone foundations of the ancient wall and into the inner city of old ubar the tractors headlights pierced no more than a few feet as the storm wailed and cast up gouts of sand the sinkhole lay ahead dark and silent it was time to end all this the tractor braked its headlights pierced ahead men dropped flat along the rim using the cover of boulders and tumbled bits of ruins cassandra waited while the team took up positions winging out to either side encircling the sinkhole she listened to their radio chatter subvocalized over throat mikes in position quadrant three mongoose four on the tower rpgs locked and loaded cassandra hit command q on her keyboard and twentyone red triangles bloomed on the schematic on the map each of the commandos had a locator beacon tagged to his fatigues on the screen she watched the team maneuver into position no hesitation efficient fast kane directed his men from the command tractor he stood palms on the console leaning forward to stare out the windshield theyre all in position no movement seen below all dark cassandra knew safia was there hidden underground light it up kane relayed the order all around the rim a dozen floodlights snapped on carried by the soldiers and aimed down into the hole the chasm now glowed in the storm kane held one hand over his radio earpiece he listened for half a breath then spoke still no hostiles in sight bikes and buggies below can they see any cavern entrance down there kane nodded where the vehicles are parked a black hole video feed should be transmitting now channel three cassandra brought up another screen on her laptop realtime video feed the image was shaky pixilating and vibrating static interference a shimmer of electric charge danced down the whip antenna strapped outside the tractor the storm was kicking into full blow cassandra leaned closer on the screen she saw wavering images of the chasm floor sand bikes with huge knobby tires a scatter of sidewinder desert dune buggies but they were all abandoned where were all the people the image swung centered on a dark hole three yards wide it looked like a fresh excavation glistening reflecting back the spotlights a tunnel opening and all the rabbits had ducked into the hole the video image scrambled refocused then was lost again cassandra bit back a curse she wanted to see this for herself she closed the jittery window on the screen and glanced at the spread of kanes men on the glowing schematic they had the area locked down tight cassandra unbuckled im going to get a visual hold the fort she pushed to the back compartment and slid open the side door the winds knocked her back slamming her full in the face she bent into the wind with a grimace yanked a scarf over her mouth and nose and shoved out using the tractors tread as a step she jumped to the sand she crossed to the front of the tractor one hand on the tread for support winds battered her she had new respect for kanes men when she was ensconced inside the command vehicle their deployment seemed satisfactory quick efficient no fumbling now it seemed extraordinary cassandra crossed in front of the tractor stepping between the two headlights she followed the beams toward the sinkhole it was only steps but by the time she reached the rim she could barely hear the growl of the tractor over the roar of the storm hows things look captain kane asked through her radio earpiece she knelt and peered below the chasm stretched ahead of her opposite her position the far side of the sinkhole was a tumbled slope of rock still rolling with tiny slides a fresh avalanche what the hell had happened she shifted her gaze directly below her the tunnel entrance stared back at her a glistening eye crystalline glass her pulse quickened at the sight of it this had to be the entrance to whatever treasure lay below her gaze swept over the parked vehicles she could not let them steal the prize she touched her throat mike kane i want a full team ready to enter that tunnel in five minutes there was no answer kane she shouted louder twisting around the tractors headlights blinded her she shoved to the side suspicion flared she moved forward only then spotting something knocked on its side in the lee of the wall abandoned half covered in sand a sand bike only one person was that clever am the knifestabbed at his face tangled rolling across the floor painter turned his head avoiding a fatal plunge to the eye the dagger sliced his cheek grazing the bone under his eye fury and desperation fueled painters strength despite the blood flowing he kept his legs pinned around the other mans legs his right arm clenched around the mans neck the bastard was as strong as a bull bucking rolling painter pinned him trapping his knife arm as he had climbed through the side door of the tractor left conveniently ajar by cassandra hed recognized the man painter had been hiding buried under loose windblown sand piled against the crumbling wall five minutes ago he had ridden the sand bike at breakneck speeds up out of the sinkhole and raced to the gap in the east wall he knew cassandras forces would have to come through there with any vehicles he hadnt expected the behemoth of a tractor a twentyton monster from the look of it a bus fitted with tank treads but it suited his purpose better than an ordinary truck he had crawled out of hiding as the tractor stopped idling in the storm he had ducked between the back treads as he expected all attention had been focused on the sinkhole then cassandra had stepped from the vehicle giving him the opening he needed with the door unlocked painter had slipped into the back compartment pistol in hand unfortunately his wrestling partner john kane mustve caught painters reflection in the glass he had swung around on a splinted leg and snapped out with the other knocking the pistol from painters hand now they struggled on the floor painter maintained his choke hold kane tried to slam the back of his head into the bridge of painters nose painter avoided the blow instead he yanked the mans head back even farther and slammed it hard against the metal floor a groan he repeated the action three more times the man went limp painter continued to clamp his forearm over the mans neck only then did he note the blood spreading across the gray metal nose broken time running out painter let the man go he stood up and stumbled back if that leopard hadnt tenderized the bastard first painter would never have won that fight he shoved to the drivers seat popped the clutch and gave the tractor some gas the lumbering giant crunched forward surprisingly agile painter checked his landmarks and aimed the tractor toward the right trajectory straight for the sinkhole bullets suddenly peppered the side of the tractor automatic weapons his presence had been discovered the noise deafened painter continued forward unconcerned the tractor was armored and he had locked the side door the rim of the sinkhole appeared ahead he kept the tractor moving bullets continued to pound stones against a tin can the front end of the tractor crawled past the lip of the sinkhole that was good enough for painter trusting momentum he swept out of the seat the tractor slowed but crept farther past the edge of the sinkhole its forward end dipped down as the rim crumbled the floor tilted painter scrambled toward the rear door intending to jettison before the tractor went over taking his chances among the commandos but a hand snatched his pant leg yanking his feet out from under him he fell hard the wind knocked out of him kane dragged painter toward him still impossibly strong painter had no time for this the floor angled steeply he kicked out with a heel striking kanes broken nose the mans head snapped back his ankle was freed painter crawled and leaped up the sloped floor climbing a cliff of steel equipment and gear tumbled toward the front knocking into him he felt a sliding lurch gravity now gripped the tractor treads tore through stone it was going over leaping painter snatched the handle to the back hatch unfortunately it opened out he didnt have good purchase to shove it open using his toes his calves he just managed to push the hatch a foot up the wind did the rest the storm caught the door and flung it wide painter followed carried bodily outward beneath him the tractor fell away diving into the sinkhole he managed one kick leapfrogging off the back end he aimed for the cliff edge arms outstretched he made it barely his belly struck the edge he flung his torso on the ground legs dangling in the pit his fingers dug for purchase a screeching crash sounded below him he noted figures scrambling toward him they wouldnt reach him in time he slid backward there was no grip the tractors treads had churned the edge to mush he managed for a moment to catch a buried rock in the dust he hung for a breath by one hand and stared down forty feet below the tractor had slammed nosefirst into the glass hole tearing away crumpling a twentyton plug in the tunnel good enough his rocky purchase gave way painter fell tumbling into the pit distantly he heard his name called then his shoulder struck an outcropping of rock he bounced and the ground rushed up to meet him jagged with rocks and broken metal part five fire down below any port in a storm december pm underground safia hurrieddown the spiraling ramp leading the others the crash above them had thrown them into a panic debris rolled and skittered from above glass rocks even a broken rim of metal the last had rolled like a childs hoop skimming around the spiral through the mass of folk in flight and down into the depths omaha followed it with his flashlight until it vanished the noise above subsided echoing away what happened safia asked omaha shook his head painter i guess kara marched on her other side barak and coral went back to check behind them marched danny and clay backs loaded with gear they held flashlights clay held his with both hands as if it were a lifeline safia doubted hed ever volunteer for a field expedition again beyond them marched the rahim similarly encumbered with supplies and packs only a few flashlights glowed lulu bent in discussion with another elder led them they had lost six women during the fighting and bombing safia saw the raw grief in all their eyes a child wept softly back there as insulated as the rahim were a single death must be devastating they were down to thirty a quarter of them children and old women the footing suddenly changed underfoot going from rough glass to stone safia looked down as they wound around the spiral sandstone omaha said weve reached the end of the blast range kara shone her light back then forward the explosion did all this some form of shaped charge omaha said seemingly unimpressed most of this spiraling ramp was probably already down here the trilith chamber was its cork the bomb simply blew its top away safia knew omaha was simplifying things she continued forward if they had passed the transition from glass to stone then the end must be near the sandstone underfoot was still wet what if all they found was a flooded passage theyd have to go backface cassandra a commotion drew her attention coral and barak trotted up to them safia stopped along with the others coral pointed back painter did it dropped a truck over the entrance a big truck barak elaborated what about painter safia asked coral licked her lips eyes narrowed with concern no sign safia glanced past the womans shoulder searching that wont keep cassandra off our tail forever i already heard men up there digging coral waved forward painter bought us time lets use it safia took a deep shuddering breath coral was right she turned and continued down no one spoke for another turn of the spiral how deep are we kara asked id say over two hundred feet omaha answered around another bend a cavern opened about the size of a double garage their lights reflected off a well of water in the center it jostled gently its surface misty water dripped from the ceiling the source of the water flume omaha said the shaped charge of the explosion must have sucked it up like milk through a straw they all entered the cavern a lip of rock circled the well look kara pointed her light to a door on the far side they marched around the well omaha placed his palm on the doors surface iron again they sure like smelting around here there was a handle but a bar was locked across the doors frame to keep the chamber pressuresealed coral said behind them for the explosive vacuum she nodded back to the well of water far above them a crash echoed down omaha grabbed the locking bar and pulled it it wouldnt budge goddamnit its jammed he wiped his hands on his cloak and all oily to resist corrosion danny said he tried to help him but the two brothers fared no better we need a crowbar or something no the hodja said behind them she nudged folk aside with her walking stick and stopped beside safia the locks of ubar can only be opened by one of the rahim omaha wiped his hands again lady youre more than welcome to try lulu tapped her stick on the bar it takes someone blessed by ubar carrying the blood of the first queen to affect such sacred artifacts the hodja turned to safia those who bear the gifts of the rahim me safia said you were tested lulu reminded her the keys responded to you safia flashed back to the rainy tomb of job she remembered waiting for the spear and bust to point toward ubar nothing had happened at first she had been wearing work gloves kane had carried and placed the spear in the hole it hadnt moved not until she wiped away the rain like tears from the busts cheek with her bare fingertips not until she touched it then it had moved and the cresent horns of the bull nothing had happened until she had examined them sparking a bit of static electricity she had ignited the bomb with the brush of a finger lulu nodded her forward safia numbly stepped up wait coral pulled out a device from her pocket whats that omaha asked testing a theory she said i was studying the keys earlier with some of cassandras electronic equipment coral waved for safia to continue taking a breath safia reached out and gripped the bar with her good hand she felt nothing special no spark she tugged on the bar it lifted freely shocked she stumbled back damn omaha gasped oh this impresses you kara said i mustve loosened it for her coral shook her head its a magnetic lock what safia asked this is a magnometer coral lifted her handheld device it monitors magnetic charge the polarity of that length of iron changed as you touched it safia stared down at the bar how iron is highly conductive and responsive to magnetism rub a needle with a magnet and you pass on its magnetic charge somehow these objects respond to your presence some energy you give off safia pictured the spin of the iron heart atop the marble altar of imrans tomb it had moved like a magnetic compass aligning itself along some axis another crash sounded above omaha stepped forward however it got unlocked lets use it with the bar free he grabbed the handle and tugged the oiled hinges swung easily the door opened on a dark descending staircase carved into the stone after closing and blocking the door omaha led the way with the flashlight safia at his side the rest of the party followed the passage was a straight shot but steep it led down another hundred feet and emptied into a cavern four times larger than the first one a pool filled this chamber too dark and glassy the air smelled odd damp for sure but also a trace of ozone the smell that accompanies a thunderstorm but none of this held safias attention for more than a moment steps away a stone pier stretched into the water at the end floated a beautiful wooden dhow an arab sailing ship thirty feet long its sides glistened with oil shining brightly in the glow of their flashlights gold leaf decorated rails and masts sails useless here but still present were folded and tied down murmurs of awe rose among the group as they gathered to the left a wide watery tunnel stretched away into darkness at the prow of the dhow rose the figure of a woman barebreasted arms chastely crossed over her bosom face staring down the flooded tunnel even from here safia recognized the figures countenance the queen of sheba iron omaha said at her side noting her attention he focused his flashlight on the boats figurehead the statue was sculpted entirely in iron he moved toward the pier looks like were going sailing again pm at thebottom of the sinkhole cassandra stared at the mangled body she didnt know how to feel regret anger a trace of fear she didnt have time to sort it out her mind spun instead on how to put this to her advantage haul him up top get him into a body bag the two commandos lifted their former leader from the wreckage of the tractor others climbed in and out the back end salvaging what could be found setting the charges to blow apart the bulk of the smashed vehicle other men hauled debris out of the way using the dune buggies a pair of commandos unreeled a long wire through a gap in the wreckage all was in order cassandra swung to the sand cycle and mounted it she tightened her muffler and goggles then set off topside it would be another fifteen minutes until the charges were set she sped up the path and climbed out of the sinkhole as she cleared the rim the force of the sandstorm spun her around fuck it had already grown stronger she fought for traction found it and raced to the command base sheltered inside one of the few cinderblock buildings still standing the parked trucks circled it she skidded to a stop propped the bike against the wall and hopped off she strode through the door injured men sprawled on blankets and cots many had been wounded from the firefight with painters strange team she had heard the reports of the womens combat skills how they appeared out of nowhere and vanished just as easily there was no estimate even on their numbers but now they were all gone down the hole cassandra crossed to one cot a medic worked on an unconscious man taping a last butterfly suture over the cheek laceration there was nothing the medic could do about the big lump above his brow painter might have the nine lives of a cat but he hadnt landed on his feet this time he had struck a glancing blow to the head the only reason he lived was the loose sand along the inside rim of the sinkhole cushioning his fall from the heavylidded glances from her men they werent so appreciative of painters good luck they all knew of john kanes bloody end cassandra stopped at the foot of the cot hows he doing mild concussion equal and responsive pupils the bastards only knocked cold then wake him up smelling salts the medic sighed but obeyed he had other men his own men to attend to but cassandra was still in charge and she still had a use for painter am so whatdo we do omaha asked row get out and push from the bow of the boat he stared back the entire company had boarded the fanciful dhow barak hunched over the ships tiller clay knelt and scratched at a bit of the gold leaf danny and coral appeared to be studying the structure of the rudder leaning over the stern and staring down the rahim spread out examining details the dhow was even more impressive up close gold leaf adorned most every surface mother of pearl embellished knobs the stanchions were solid silver even the ropes had gold threads woven into them it was a royal barge but as pretty as it was it was not much use as a sailing vessel not unless a stiff wind would suddenly blow behind omaha kara and safia stood at the prow flanking the iron figurehead of the queen of sheba the hodja leaned on her walking stick so touch it kara urged safia the hodja had recommended the same safia had her good arm crossed under her sling her face lined with worry we dont know what will happen in her eyes omaha saw the flash of fire from the trilith chambers eruption safia glanced to the new crew of the dhow she feared endangering them especially by her own hand omaha stepped to her side he placed a hand on her shoulder saff cassandra is going to be coming down here guns blazing id personally rather take my chances with this iron lady than with that steelhearted bitch safia sighed he felt her relax under his palm surrendering hold on she whispered she reached out and touched the shoulder of the iron statue the way omaha was touching her as her palm made contact omaha felt a slight electric tingle shiver through him safia seemed unaware nothing happened i dont think im the one to no omaha said cutting her off hold firm he felt a gentle tremble underfoot as if the waters under the ship had begun to boil ever so slowly the boat began to move forward he swung around free the ropes he called to the others the rahim moved swiftly loosening ropes and ties whats happening safia asked keeping her palm in place barak you got the tiller near the stern the man acknowledged this with a wave of an arm coral and danny hurried forward the tall woman lugged a large case the boats speed gently increased barak aimed them toward the open mouth of the flooded tunnel omaha raised his flashlight and clicked it on the beam was lost in the darkness how far did it go where did it go there was only one way to find out safia trembled under his palm he stepped closer his body next to her she didnt object leaning back slightly omaha could read her thoughts the boat hadnt blown up they were still okay coral and danny were bent over the side of the boat again their flashlights shining can you smell the ozone she said to omahas brother yeah look how the waters steaming where the iron meets it curiosity drew all their eyes what are you guys doing omaha asked danny pushed back up face flushed research omaha rolled his eyes his brother was forever a science geek coral straightened theres some catalytic reaction going on in the water i believe it was triggered by the iron maiden its generating some propulsive force she leaned over the rail again i want to test this water danny nodded a puppy wagging his tail ill get a bucket omaha left them to their science project right now all he cared about was where they were going he noted kara eyeing himno him and safia caught staring kara glanced away toward the dark tunnel omaha noted the hodja doing the same do you know where this is taking us he asked the old woman she shrugged to the true heart of ubar a silence settled over the boat as they continued down the long dark throat omaha stared up half expecting a night sky but not here here they sailed hundreds of feet under the sand pm painter wokewith a start gasping choking eyes burning he attempted to sit up but was shoved back down his head rang like a struck bell light burned icily the room shuddered he rolled to the side and vomited over the edge of a cot his stomach clenched again and again awake i see the voice chilled the feverish pain from his body despite the glare and pain of the sharp lights he faced the woman at the foot of his bed cassandra she was dressed in duncolored fatigues with a kneelength poncho belted at the waist a hat hung by a cord behind her a scarf around her neck her skin glowed in the light her eyes shining even brighter he struggled to sit up two men held his shoulders cassandra waved them off painter slowly sat up guns pointed at him weve got some business to discuss cassandra dropped to one knee that little stunt of yours cost me most of my electronics though we were able to salvage a few things like my laptop she pointed to the computer resting on a folding chair it displayed a seawifs satellite map of the region with live feed of the sandstorm painter noted the scrolling weather data the coastal highpressure system off the arabian sea had finally crossed the mountains it was due to collide with the sandstorm in the next two hours a megastorm of sea and sand but none of that mattered now theres no way im telling you anything he croaked out i dont remember asking you anything he sneered at her even that hurt she shifted to the laptop and touched a few keys the screen contained an overlay of the area town ruins desert it was monochrome except for a small blue ring slowly spinning a quarter inch in diameter below it coordinates along the x y and zaxes changed a live feed he knew what he was looking at it was a signal from a microtransceiver a system designed by his own hand what have you done we implanted dr almaaz we dared not lose track of her the transmissionunderground he had a hard time making his tongue work there was enough of a gap in the wreckage to lower a weighted thread antenna it seems once we spooled enough wire we were able to pick up her signal there must be good acoustics down there weve lowered booster transmitters we can track her anywhere why are you telling me all this cassandra returned to his bed she had a small transmitter in her hand to inform you of a small modification in your design it seems with a bit more battery you can ignite a pellet of c i can show you the schematics painters flesh went cold cassandra what have you done he pictured safias face her shy smile theres just enough c to blow out someones spine you didnt she raised one eyebrow a gesture that used to excite quicken his heart now it terrified him painter clenched fistfuls of sheets ill tell you what you want to know how cooperative but again painter i dont remember asking you any questions she held up the transmitter and glanced to the screen its time to punish you for your little stunt today she pressed the button no his scream was lost in a monstrous explosion it felt as if his heart had detonated it took him a breath to understand cassandra smiled down at him deliciously satisfied laughter rose raw with little true humor from the men in the room she held up the device sorry i guess that was the wrong transmitter this one controlled the charges placed in the tractors debris my demolitions experts have promised me the explosives will clear a path to the tunnel all it requires now is a little cleanup well be moving in within the next half hour painters heart still ached thudding in his throat cassandra pulled out a second transmitter this is the real one keyed to safias transceiver shall we try that again painter simply hung his head she would do it ubar was open cassandra had no further need for safias expertise cassandra knelt closer now that i have your full attention maybe we can have that little chat am safia loungedone hand on the iron figurehead her hip leaning against the ships rail how could she be so terrified yet so tired at the same time it had been a half hour since they all heard the explosion coming from the direction of the spiral ramp sounds like cassandras come knocking omaha had said by that time their boat had sailed far down the tunnel still tensions had escalated many flashlights pointed backward nothing came safia could only imagine cassandras frustration at finding them gone and faced with a flooded tunnel it would be a long swim if cassandra and her team attempted to follow though the dhows pace was only a bit swifter than a fast walk they had been sailing now for over an hour they had to be at least six or seven miles away making a slow but regal escape with each passing moment everyone relaxed a bit more and who was to say if cassandra had even been successful in clearing the blockage atop the ramp still safia could not let go of another fear one closer to her heart painter what was his fate dead captured lost in the sandstorm there didnt seem to be any hopeful possibility behind safia a few of the rahim women sang softly sadly mourning their dead aramaic again safias heart responded grieving lulu stirred noting her attention our old language the language of the last queen dead now but we still speak it amongst ourselves safia listened taken to another time nearby kara and omaha sat on the planks heads bowed asleep barak stood by the wheel keeping them sailing straight as the course meandered in lazy scurves perhaps the passage had once been part of an old underground river system a few steps away coral sat crosslegged bent over an array of equipment powered by batteries her face was limned in the glow danny helped her kneeling at her side face close to hers beyond them safias eyes found one last member of their group clay leaned against the starboard rail staring forward barak and he had shared a cigarette a moment ago one of the few left in the arabs pack clay looked like he needed another he noticed her attention and came to join her howre you holding up she asked all i can say is that i had better get a good grade his smile was sincere if a bit shaky i dont know she teased theres always room for improvement fine thats the last time i take a dart in the back for you he sighed staring into the darkness theres a hell of a lot of water down here she remembered his fear of the sea flashing back to a similar chat by the rail of the shabab oman that now seemed like a world ago danny stood and stretched coral and i were discussing that about the sheer volume of water down here theres more than can be attributed to local rainfall or the water table omaha stirred speaking with his head down he had not been asleep only resting so whats the story then hotshot coral answered its earthgenerated omaha lifted his head say again since the s its been known that there was more water within the earth than can be explained by the surface hydrological cycle of evaporation and rainfall there have been many cases of vast freshwater springs found deep within the earth giant aquifers danny interrupted coraldr novak was telling me about one spring found during the excavation for the harlem hospital in new york it produced water at the rate of two thousand gallons a minute it took tons of concrete to produce enough pressure to plug the spring so where the hell does all this new water come from danny waved to coral you know it better she sighed clearly bothered at the interruption an engineer and geologist stephen reiss proposed that such new water is regularly formed within the earth by the elemental combination of hydrogen and oxygen generated in magma that a cubic kilometer of granite subjected to the right pressures and temperatures has the capability of yielding eight billion gallons of water and that such reservoirs of magmatic or earthgenerated waters are abundant under the crust interconnected in a vast aquifer system circling the globe even under the deserts of arabia omaha asked half scoffing certainly reiss up until he died in had over fifty years of success finding water at sites other geologists flatly predicted were impossible including the eilat wells in israel that continue to produce enough water for a city of a hundred thousand he did the same in saudia arabia and egypt so you think all this water down here might be part of that system perhaps coral opened a tiny door in one of her machines safia noted a whiff of fog rise from it a cooler of some sort she fished out a tiny test tube with tweezers she swirled it around whatever coral saw deepened a frown whats wrong danny asked noting her reaction theres something strange about this water what do you mean she lifted the test tube ive been attempting to freeze it so she held up the plastic test tube in the nitrogen cooler ive lowered the waters temperature to negative thirty celsius it still wont freeze what omaha leaned closer it makes no sense in a freezer water gives up its heat energy to the cold and turns solid well this stuff keeps giving off energy and wont solidify its like it has an unlimited amount of energy stored in it safia stared past the dhows rail she could still smell the ozone she remembered the slight steaming in the water around the iron do you still have the radx scanner among the equipment coral nodded eyes widening of course the physicist assembled the rodandbase unit she passed it over the test tube her eyes told what she found before she spoke antimatter annihilation she shoved to her feet and held the scanner over the rail moving from midship toward safias place at the bow it grows stronger with every step what the hell does it mean omaha asked the magnetism in the iron is triggering some annihilation of antimatter antimatter where coral stared all around her were sailing through it thats impossible antimatter annihilates itself with any contact with matter it cant be in the water it wouldve annihilated with the water molecules long ago youre right coral said but i cant dismiss what im reading somehow the water here is enriched with antimatter and thats whats propelling the boat safia asked perhaps somehow the magnetized iron has activated the localized annihilation of antimatter in the water converting its energy into motive force pushing us what about the concern of it all destabilizing omaha asked safia tensed she remembered painters explanation of how radiation from the decay of uranium isotopes might have triggered the museum explosion she pictured the smoking bones of the museum guard coral stared at her scanner im not reading any alpha or beta radiation but i cant say for sure the physicist returned to her workstation ill need to do more studies the hodja spoke for the first time she had ignored the excitement and simply stared forward the tunnel ends all eyes turned even coral regained her feet ahead a soft flicker of light danced waxing and waning it was enough to tell that the tunnel ended ten yards ahead they sailed forward in the last yard the roof became jagged like the maw of a sharks mouth no one spoke the ship sailed out of the tunnel and into a vast subterranean chamber mother of god omaha intoned pm cassandra heldthe receiver of the satellite phone tight to her left ear and covered her right to cut out the howl of the storm she was on the second floor of the cinderblock building that housed their command center the storm tore through the ashes of the town sand battered the boarded windows as she listened she paced the floor the voice digitally altered made it difficult to hear the head of the guild insisted on anonymity gray leader the minister continued to ask for such special treatment during this storm risks exposure of our desert op not to mention the entire guild i know it sounds excessive minister but weve found the target we are steps away from victory we can be out of shisur before the storm even ends thats if we can get those supplies from thumrait and what assurance can you give me that you will be successful i stake my life on it gray leader your life has always been at stake guild command has been studying your recent failures further disappointments now would make us seriously reconsider our need for your future employment bastard cassandra cursed to herself he hides behind his code name sitting behind some goddamn desk and he has the gall to question my competency but cassandra knew one way to spin her latest difficulty she had to give painter credit for that minister i am certain of victory here but i would also request that afterward i be able to clear my name i was assigned my team leader he was not of my own choosing john kane has mishandled and undermined my command it was his lack of security that caused both this delay and his own death i on the other hand was able to subdue and apprehend the saboteur a key member of darpas sigma force you have painter crowe cassandra frowned at the familiarity behind that tone yes minister very good gray leader i may not have misplaced my confidence in you after all youll have your supplies four armored tractors driven by guild operatives are already under way as we speak cassandra bit her tongue so all this browbeating was for show thank you sir she managed to force out but it was a wasted effort the minister had already hung up she shoved the phone down but continued to pace the room twice more breathing deeply she had been so sure of victory when she blew the tractor out of the hole she had enjoyed tormenting painter breaking him so hed talk she now knew the others posed no real threat a handful of experienced fighters but also lots of civilians children and old women after the wreckage had been cleared cassandra had gone down the hole herself ready for victory only to discover the underground river there had been a stone pier so the others must have found some vessel in which to row away alternate plans had to be madeagain she had to lean on the minister but despite her frustration the call couldnt have gone better she had found a scapegoat for her past failures and would soon have everything she needed to ensure her victory under the sand calmer now cassandra headed to the stairs she would oversee final arrangements she clomped down the wooden steps and entered the temporary hospital ward she crossed to the medic in charge and nodded youll have all the supplies you need trucks are coming in two hours the medic looked relieved the other men heard her and cheers rose she glanced to painter half sedated groggy on the bed she had left her laptop near his bed the blue light of safias transceiver glowed on the screen a reminder cassandra carried the transmitter in her pocket extra insurance for his good behavior and cooperation she checked her watch soon it would all be over pm kara stoodat the prow with safia she held her sisters free hand as safia somehow propelled the dhow with her touch they had done it found what her father had sought for so many years ubar the dhow sailed from the tunnel into a vast cavern arching thirty stories overhead stretching a mile out a massive lake filled the cavern to an unknown depth as they sailed the subterranean lake flashlights pointed in all directions spearing out from the dhow but additional illumination was not necessary across the ceiling scintillations of cobalt electricity arced in jagged displays while gaseous clouds swirled with an inner fire edges indistinct ghostly ebbing and flowing trapped static charge possibly drawn from the storm on the surface but the fiery display was the least cause for their amazement its glow reflected and dazzled off every surface lake roof walls its all glass safia said gazing up and around the entire cavern was a giant glass bubble buried under the sands she even spotted a scattering of glass stalactites dripping down from the roof blue arcs glistened up and down their lengths like electric spiders slag glass omaha said molten sand that hardened like the ramp what couldve formed this clay asked no one even hazarded a guess as the dhow continued its journey coral eyed the lake all this water it must be earthgenerated danny mumbled or once was coral seemed not to hear him if its all enriched with antimatter the possibility chilled them all into silence they simply watched the play of energies across the ceilings mirrored in the still waters finally safia let out a soft gasp her hand dropped from the shoulder of the iron figurehead and covered her mouth safia what then kara saw it too across the lake a shore appeared out of the darkness it rose from the waters and spread back to the far wall pillars of black glass stretched from floor to ceiling hundreds in all sizes mighty columns thin spires and unearthly twisted spirals the thousand pillars of ubar safia whispered they were close enough for further details to reveal themselves lit by the reflected glow of the electrical display from out of the darkness a city appeared glinting shining shimmering all glass clay murmured the miraculous city climbed the shore stretching high up the back wall scattered among the pillars it reminded kara of the seaside towns found along the amalfi coast looking like a childs toy blocks spilled down a hillside ubar the hodja said at her side kara glanced back as all the rahim knelt to the deck they had returned home after two millennia one queen had left thirty now returned the dhow had stopped after safia lifted her hand drifting on momentum omaha stepped to safias side encircling her with an arm closer she reached again to the iron shoulder the craft sailed again moving smoothly toward the ancient lost city barak called from the wheel another pier ill see if i can take us in the dhow angled toward the spear of stone kara gazed out at the city as they drew nearer flashlight beams leaped the distance adding further illumination details grew clearer the homes while all walled of glass bore adornments of silver gold ivory and ceramic tile one palace near the shoreline had a mosaic that appeared to be made out of emeralds and rubies a hoopoe bird the crested bird was an important element in many stories about the queen of sheba they were all overwhelmed slow us down barak called as they approached the pier safia released her hold on the iron statue the dhows pace immediately dropped barak slid the craft easily alongside the pier tie us up he said the rahim were again on their feet they leaped to the sandstone pier and tied lines to silver stanchions matching the ones on the royal dhow we are home lulu said tears brimmed her eyes kara helped the old woman back to the center of the ship so she could step from boat to pier once on solid ground the hodja waved safia to her you should lead us you have returned ubar to us safia balked but kara nudged her do the old lady a favor taking a deep breath safia climbed from the dhow and led the party to the glass shore of ubar kara marched behind safia and lulu this was their moment omaha even held back from rushing forward though he did keep darting his head left and right trying to see past the two womens shoulders they reached the shore all flashlights ablaze kara glanced up and around distracted she bumped into safias back she and the hodja had suddenly stopped oh god safia moaned lulu simply fell to her knees kara and omaha stepped around them they both saw the horror at the same time omaha flinched kara took a step back a few yards ahead a skeletal mummified body protruded from the street its lower half was still encased in glass omaha shifted his flashlights beam farther up the street other such bodies sprawled half buried in the roadway kara spotted a single desiccated arm poking up out of the glass as if drowning in a black sea it appeared to be a childs hand they had all drowned in glass omaha moved a few steps closer then jumped to the side he pointed his flashlight down to where he had just stepped his beam penetrated the glass revealing a human shape buried below burned to bone curled within the glass under his feet kara could not blink it was like her father she finally covered her face and turned away omaha spoke behind her i think we just discovered the true tragedy that drove the last queen of ubar out of here sealing the place cursing it he moved back to them this isnt a city its a tomb battle under the sand december pm shisur painter staredacross the makeshift medical ward the injection of sedatives still kept his head full of cobwebs but enough had worn off that he could think clearer straighter a fact he kept to himself he watched cassandra enter the room pushing in from the storm sand blowing in with her it took an additional shoulder to shove the door closed painter had heard enough earlier to determine that her attempt to chase down the others had hit some snafu but he had no details still from the confidence in her stride from the way the morale here seemed high she had not been fully thwarted as always she had another plan she noted his bleary attention crossed to him and plopped down on a neighboring cot his personal guard seated behind him shifted straighter the boss was here she pulled out a pistol and rested it in her lap was this the end from the corner of his eye he happened to note the tiny blue ring on the laptop computer at least safia was still alive she had moved well out of shisur by now due north her zaxis coordinate grid showed her still deep underground over three hundred feet cassandra waved off his bodyguard why dont you take a smoke ill watch the prisoner for a bit yes captain thank you sir he bolted away before she changed her mind painter heard the trace of fear in the mans voice he could guess how cassandra commanded here an iron fist and intimidation cassandra stretched so crowe painter curled a fist under the sheets not that he could do anything one of his ankles was cuffed to the cots foot she sat just out of reach what do you want sanchez come to gloat no but i just wanted to let you know that you seemed to have piqued the interest of my superiors in fact capturing you may have earned me a few steps up the chain of guild command painter glowered at her she had come not to gloat but to brag the guild so thats who signs your paychecks what can i say the salary was good she shrugged better benefits packages matching ks your own death squad whats not to like painter heard the combination of confidence and derision in her voice it did not bode well she certainly had a plan in place for victory here why throw your lot in with the guild he asked she stared down at him tied to the cot her voice grew contemplative but also somehow meaner true power can only be found in those willing to break all rules to achieve their ends laws and regulations do nothing but bind and blind i know what it feels like to be powerless her eyes drifted away into the past painter sensed a well of grief behind her words still ice entered her voice i finally broke free by crossing lines few will cross beyond that boundary i found power and i will never step backnot even for you painter recognized the futility of reasoning with her i tried to warn you to back down cassandra continued piss off the guild too many times and they have the tendency to bite back theyve taken a particular interest in you painter had heard whispers about the guild an organization structured after terrorist cells a loose association with a shadowy leadership structure they operated internationally no specific national affiliation though it was said they had risen out of the ashes of the former soviet union a combination of russian mobsters and former kgb agents but since then the guild had dissolved across all borders like arsenic in tea little else was known about them except that they were ruthless and bloody their goals were simple money power influence if they should gain access to the antimatter source it would be a prize equal to none other they could blackmail nations sell samples to foreign powers or terrorists the guild would be unstoppable and untouchable he studied cassandra how far did the guilds reach stretch into washington he remembered his test email he knew at least one man who was on their payroll he pictured sean mcknight they had all been set up he tightened his fist she pushed forward leaning elbows on knees when this is over im going to package you up put a ribbon around you and deliver you to guild command theyll pick apart your brain like a crab on a dead fish painter shook his head but he was not even sure what he was denying ive seen their interrogation methods firsthand cassandra continued impressive work there was one fellow an mi operative who attempted to infiltrate a guild cell in india the chap was so broken down that all he had left to give were a few plaintive whimpers the mewling of a beaten puppy then again id never seen a man scalped before electrodes drilled into his skull its fascinating stuff but why am i telling you all this youll get to experience it yourself painter had never imagined the depths of depravity and cunning in the woman how had he missed such a well of corruption how had he almost given his heart to her he knew the answer like father like son his father had married a woman who would eventually stab him to death how had his father missed such a murderous soul in the woman to whom he pledged his heart whom he slept beside each night with whom he bore a child was it some genetic blindness passed from one generation to the next his eyes drifted to the blue glow on the screen safia he touched the well of warm feelings there it was not love not yet at least not after so short a time but it was deeper than respect and friendship he grasped that possibility that potential inside him there were good women with hearts as genuine as his own and he could love them he stared back at cassandra the anger bled from him she must have seen something in his face she had been expecting defeat but found resolution and calmness instead confusion shone in her eyes and behind it painter caught a glimpse of something deeper anguish but it was only a flicker in a blink fury burned away all else cassandra shoved up hand on her pistol he simply stared at her let her shoot him it would be better than to be handed off to her superiors cassandra made a sound between a laugh and a sneer ill leave you to the minister but i may come to watch the minister his is the last face youll ever see she swung away painter heard the edge of fear behind her words with this last statement it sounded exactly like the guard who had departed moments ago fear of a superior someone ruthless and ironfisted painter sat very still on his cot the last cobwebs from the sedatives burned away in a sudden flame of insight the minister he closed his eyes against the possibility in that moment he knew with certainty who led the guild or at least guided cassandras hand it was worse than he imagined pm this hasto be the queens palace omaha said from across a courtyard of black glass safia stared up at the huge structure as omaha splashed his flashlights beam over the surface of the towering vaulted structure its base was square but it was surmounted by a fourstory round tower with crenellated battlements at the top arches of blown glass decorated the tower opening onto balconies that overlooked the lower city sapphires diamonds and rubies decorated rails and walls roofs of gold and silver shone in the blue coruscations that flickered across the cavern roof still safia gave it a critical eye this is a duplicate of the ruined citadel up top look at the dimensions the structure of the base they match my god saff youre right omaha stepped into the courtyard the space was walled on both sides with a huge arched opening in front safia stared behind her the palaceand there was no question this was the queens palacestood high up the cavern wall near the back of the city the rest of ubar stretched in winding crooked roads descending below in terraces stairs and ramps pillars rose everywhere lets peek inside omaha said he moved ahead followed by clay kara helped lulu the hodja had recovered from her initial shock still on their journey up here they had come across body after mummified body buried in glass most partially some completely consumed all around at every turn agonized poses stretched from the glass macabre skeletal trees of desiccated mummified limbs the poses spoke of a misery beyond comprehension one woman frozen against a glass wall sunk almost fully into it had tried to protect her child holding it up like an offering to god her prayer had not been heard her child lay in the glass over her head such misery was everywhere ubar must have once housed a population that numbered close to a thousand the elite of the city above royalty clerics artisans those who garnered the favor of the queen all killed though the queen sealed the place and never spoke of it some word must have escaped safia recalled the two stories from the arabian nights the city of brass and the petrified city both tales spoke of a city whose populace were frozen in time turned to brass or stone only the reality was much worse omaha moved toward the entrance to the palace we could spend decades studying all this i mean look at the artistry in the glasswork kara spoke up ubar reigned for a thousand years it had a power source at hand unlike any seen beforeor now human ingenuity will find a use for such power it would not go untapped this entire city is an expression of human resourcefulness safia had a hard time matching karas enthusiasm the city was a necropolis a city of the dead it was not a testament of resourcefulness but of agony and horror for the past two hours their small group had climbed the city exploring it for some answer to the tragedy but upon reaching the summit they had found no clue the others of their party remained below coral still worked by the lakes edge performing arcane acts of chemistry assisted by danny who had discovered a newfound passion for physicsor perhaps his passion lay more for the sixfoottall blond physicist coral seemed to be onto something before safia and the others left coral had asked for something odd a couple drops of blood from her and a few of the rahim safia had complied but coral refused to explain why she made such an odd request and went immediately to work meanwhile barak and the remaining rahim had spread out to search for some means to escape the tomb omaha led their group into the palace courtyard in the center of the open space a giant iron sphere four feet in diameter rested on a cradle of black glass sculpted into a palm safia eyed the sculpture as she circled it clearly it represented the touch of the queen upon such iron artifacts the source of all power here safia noted lulu studying it too not with the reverence of before horror still shone in her eyes they moved past it look at this omaha hurried forward he crossed to another sculpture sandstone this time perched on a glass pedestal it flanked one side of the arched entrance to the palace safia stared up at the cloaked figure bearing aloft an elongated lamp on one arm a twin to the sculpture that had once hidden the iron heart only the details of this one were not worn away it was stunning the intricate folds of cloth a tiny sandstone flame perched at the tip of the lamp the soft features of the face clearly a young woman safia felt a renewed bit of enthusiasm she glanced to the other side of the archway another black glass pedestal stood therebut no statue the queen took it from here safia said her own statueto hide the first key omaha nodded and planted it at nabi imrans tomb kara and lulu stood at the arched opening kara shone a flashlight inside you two should see this safia and omaha joined her beyond the entry a short hallway opened kara flashed her light along the walls they shone with rich earthen hues tans creams rose umber splashes of indigo and turquoise its sand kara said mixed in with the glass safia had seen such artistry before paintings done with differentcolored sands preserved behind glassonly in this case the artwork lay inside glass it covered walls ceiling floor portraying an oasis in the desert overhead a sun shone with rays of golden sand swirled with blue and white for the sky to either side date palms swayed and in the distance an inviting sapphire blue pool red dunes covered one wall done with such subtlety of shades and hues as to invite one to come strolling underfoot sand and stone actual sand and stone incorporated into the glass the group could not help but enter after the horrors of the lower city the beauty here was a balm for the heart the entry hallway was a short few steps opening into a large chamber with arched halls leading deeper a sweep of stairs curved to the right heading to the upper levels and everywhere about the room sand filled the glass creating panoramic landscapes of desert sea and mountains was this how the original citadel was decorated omaha wondered did the queen try to recreate the stone abode turning glass into sandstone it may have been a matter of privacy too safia said a light on the inside would reveal the queens every move they wandered the space finding enough in this one room to occupy their attention safia found herself studying one sand painting opposite the entry it was the first bit of decoration one saw upon entering it was a sweep of desert the sun setting shadows stretching sky a dark indigo silhouetted was a flattopped towering structure vaguely familiar a cloaked figure approached bearing aloft a lamp from atop the structure a spray of brilliant sand cascaded rays of light the quartz and silica of the sand glistened like diamonds the discovery of ubar lulu said it is an image passed from one generation to another the queen of sheba as a girl lost in the desert finds shelter and the blessings of the desert omaha stepped behind safias shoulder that structure with the rays of light shining out of it it looks like the citadel too safia now realized why the building looked familiar it was a crude rendering compared to the detail in other work perhaps it had been done much earlier than the others to either side the wall paintings depicted the ubar above and the ubar below the palace and citadel were prominent safia crossed between them she stopped before the depiction of the subterranean ubar all done in indigo and black sands a stunning depiction the depth of detail amazing she could even discern the two statues flanking the entryway the only other detail in the courtyard was the figure of the cloaked girl again the queen of ubar she touched the figure trying to understand her ancestor there were so many mysteries here some would never be known we should be getting back to base kara finally said safia nodded they reluctantly departed heading back down a winding thoroughfare led from lake to palace she marched beside the hodja kara helped the old woman especially with the stairs overhead silent crackles of blue fire lit their path only omaha kept his flashlight burning none of them cared to illuminate too clearly the horrors around them as they hiked the quiet of the city weighed upon them the press of eternity usually reserved for churches mausoleums and deep caverns the air smelled dank with a hint of electricity safia had once walked past a traffic accident cordoned off a power line down in the rain the wire had snapped and spit the air now smelled like that scene it made safia uneasy reminding her of sirens blood and sudden tragedy what would happen next pm omaha watchedsafia as she strode with the hodja around a curve in the glass road she looked a pale shade of herself he wanted to go to her comfort her but he feared his attentions would not be welcome he had seen that look in her eyes after tel aviv a desire to curl up and shut out the world he had been unable to comfort her then too kara moved closer to him her entire body expressed her exhaustion she shook her head and spoke in a hush she still loves you omaha stumbled then caught himself flashlight bobbling kara continued all you had to do was say youre sorry omaha opened his mouth then closed it again life is hard love doesnt have to be she continued past him her voice a bit harsher just be a goddamn man for once in your life indiana omaha stopped flashlight dropped to his side he was too stunned to move he had to force his legs to follow numbly the rest of the journey through the lower city was in silence at last the lake appeared ahead down a long ramp omaha was glad for the company barak was still missing still searching but most of the rahim had returned few could stomach the necropolis for long their expressions were somber at the sight of their former home danny spotted omaha and hurried over dr novak has discovered some intriguing findings come see omahas group followed him back to the pier coral had constructed a makeshift laboratory she had a haggard look to her eyes as she glanced up one of her pieces of equipment was a molten ruin it still smoked a bit and smelled like burning rubber what happened safia asked coral shook her head an accident what have you figured out omaha asked coral swiveled an lcd screen toward them data scrolled down one side the main window open on the screen showed a few line drawings her first words captured their attention the proof of gods existence can be found in water omaha raised an eyebrow care to elaborate or is that all youve come up with fortunecookie philosophy not philosophy but fact lets start at the beginning let there be light not that far back dr dunn basic chemistry water is composed of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen ho kara said a nod whats strange about water is that it is a bent molecule coral pointed to the first of the line drawings on the screen it is this bend that gives water its slight polarity a negative charge at the end with the oxygen atom a positive one at the hydrogen side the bend also allows water to form unusual shapes like ice ice is strange omaha asked if you keep interrupting coral scowled indiana let her finish coral nodded thanks to kara when matter condenses from a gas to a liquid to a solid it becomes more compact each time occupying less space denser not water though water achieves its maximum density at four degrees celsius before it freezes as water actually freezes that weird bent molecule forms an unusual crystalline shape with lots of extra space in it ice safia mumbled ice is less dense than water much less so it floats on top of water if it were not for this fact there would be no life on earth ice forming on the surface of lakes and oceans would constantly be sinking and crushing all life beneath it never giving early forms of life a chance to thrive floating ice also insulates bodies of water protecting life rather than destroying it but what does all this have to do with antimatter omaha asked im getting to that i needed to stress the strange properties of the water molecule and its propensity to form odd configurations because there is another way water will align itself it happens all the time in regular water but it lasts only nanoseconds its too unstable on earth but in space water will form and keep this unusual shape coral pointed to the next line drawing here is a twodimensional representation of twenty water molecules forming that complex configuration its called a pentagonal dodecahedron but its best visualized in three dimensions coral tapped the third drawing it looks like a big hollow sphere omaha said coral nodded it is the dodecahedron goes more commonly by the name buckyball named after buckminster fuller so these buckyballs are found in space safia said but last only briefly here its a stability problem so why are you telling us about them then kara asked danny danced back and forth on his toes behind them he pointed to the lake the water here is full of those buckyballs stable and unchanging a good portion of the water coral agreed how is that possible safia asked whats holding it stable what we came looking for coral said staring out at the water antimatter omaha moved closer coral tapped a few keys antimatter and matter being opposites attract each other which is why you dont find antimatter lying around on earth matter is everywhere antimatter would annihilate immediately in cern laboratories in switzerland scientists have produced antimatter particles and have held them suspended in magnetic vacuum chambers for periods of time buckyballs perform in the same manner how omaha leaned over corals shoulder as she brought up a new drawing because buckyballs have the capability of acting like microscopic magnetic chambers in the center of these spheres is a perfectly hollow space a vacuum antimatter can survive inside there she pointed to the a inside the diagrams sphere and antimatter in turn benefits the buckyball its attraction for the water molecules pulls the sphere tighter just enough to stabilize the buckyball and being perfectly surrounded by water molecules the antimatter atom is held in perfect suspension in the center unable to touch matter coral stared around at the group stabilized antimatter omaha said coral sighed stable until it gets a good jolt of electricity or comes in close contact to a strong magnet or radiation either will destabilize the balance the buckyball collapses antimatter comes in contact with the water molecule and annihilates itself releasing an exponential release of energy she glanced to smoldering ruins of one of her machines the answer to unlimited energy silence stretched for a time how did all this antimatter get here kara asked danny nodded we were talking about that just before you got here putting pieces together to form some idea remember omaha in the van when we were talking about the wobble in the earth that caused this region to go from a rich savannah to desert twenty thousand years ago he said danny continued dr novak postulated that perhaps an antimatter meteor large enough to survive passage through the atmosphere struck the arabian peninsula exploding and burying itself into porous limestone bedrock creating this crystalline bubble deep underground coral spoke up as everyone gazed out at the cavern the explosion must have broken into an earthgenerated water system cascading its effect through the deepearth channels literally shocking the world enough to affect the earths polarity or perhaps bobble the spin of its magnetic core however it happened it changed the local climate turning eden into a desert and as all this cataclysm happened the glass bubble formed danny continued again the explosion and heat of the impact triggered violent fog generation and expulsion of antimatter atoms and subparticles as the place cooled selfcontained and sealed water condensed around the antimatter atoms and formed the protective stabilized buckyballs and this place remained undisturbed for tens of thousands of years until someone found the friggin place omaha said he pictured a tribe of nomads stumbling upon this perhaps searching for water they mustve quickly learned of the waters strange properties an energy source in ancient times they would hide it protect it and as kara had mentioned earlier human ingenuity would find a way to harness it omaha remembered all the wild tales of arabia flying carpets magicians and sorcerers wielding incredible power enchanted objects of every shape and size genies bearing miraculous gifts had they all hinted at the mystery here what about the keys and other objects he said you mentioned something about magnetism before coral nodded i cant begin to fathom what level of technology these ancients managed they had access to a power source that will take decades to fully understand but they understood enough look at the glasswork the stonework the creation of the intricate magnetic triggers kara stared at the city they had a thousand years to perfect their art coral shrugged i wager the liquid inside the keys came from this lake buckyballs do have a slight charge to them if that charge could be shifted all in one direction then the iron container would magnetize and as the buckyballs inside are aligned with the irons magnetic field they remain stable and dont annihilate in that field what about the iron camel at the museum safia asked it exploded a chain reaction of raw energy danny answered the ball lightning must have been attracted to the iron and the strange polarity of its watery heart maybe even drawn to it look at the roof here tapping static from the storm omaha glanced upward as the electrical display flared with greaterthanusual brilliance danny finished so the lightning gave its electricity to the iron giving its energy in one jolt too much the effect was dramatic and uncontrolled leading to the blast coral stirred i wager even that explosion only occurred because the antimatter solution had been slightly destabilized by the trace radiation given off by the uranium atoms in the iron the radiation excited and increased the fragility of the buckyball configurations what of the lake here omaha mumbled eyeing the water coral frowned my instruments are too crude for a proper analysis ive detected no radiation out there but that doesnt mean its not present perhaps somewhere farther out in the lake well have to bring more teams down here if given the chance clay spoke up for the first time arms crossed over his chest so then what happened inad why all the bodies embedded in the glass was it one of those explosions coral shook her head i dont know but theres no evidence of a blast maybe an accident an experiment gone awry theres untold power in this reservoir she glanced to the city then back to safia but dr almaaz there is one last thing i must tell you about safia turned her attention back to the physicist its about your blood coral said before the physicist could elaborate a noise drew all their eyes to the lake a low whine everyone froze the noise grew sharper rapidly fast jet skis across the lake a flare shot high into the air lighting the water crimson reflecting off the roof and walls a second flare arced upward no not a flare it fell toward the citytoward them rocket omaha yelled get to cover pm painter waitedfor his chance the cinderblock room shuddered as the brunt of the sandstorm wailed against doors boarded windows and roof flashings it sounded like a ravenous animal digging to get inside unrelenting determined maddened by bloodlust it howled its frustration and roared its might inside someone had a radio playing the dixie chicks but the music was small and weak against the continual onslaught of the storm and the storm was creeping into their shelter under the doorjamb sand whistled in streaming and writhing along the floor like snakes through cracks in the windows it gasped and sighed in dusty puffs now almost a continual blow the air in the room had grown stale smelling of blood and iodine the only ones left here were the wounded one medic and two guards half an hour ago cassandra had cleared out the rest for her underground assault painter glanced at the laptop it showed safias blue spinning ring she was six miles due north of here deep under the sands he hoped the glow meant she was still alive but the transceiver would not die with her body its continual transmission was no assurance still from the scrolling numerical axis coordinates safia was on the move he had to trust she still lived but for how much longer time pressed against him like a physical weight he had heard the arrival of the m tractors from thumrait air base bringing in a shipment of new supplies and weapons the caravan had arrived just as the sandstorm blew at its worst still the group had managed to outrun the predicted megastorm in addition to the new supplies another thirty men swelled the forces hardeyed fresh heavily packed with gear they had stomped in like they owned the place more of the elite of the guild with no joking they had stripped out of their sandy clothes and into black thermal wet suits painter had watched from his bed a few cast stares his way they had already heard about john kanes demise they looked ready to rip his head off but they left quickly heading back out into the storm through the open doorway painter had seen a jet ski being wheeled by wet suits and jet skis what had cassandra found down there he continued to work under his sheets he had been stripped to his boxers one ankle cuffed to the foot of the bed frame he had only one weapon an inchlong eighteengauge needle a few minutes ago when the two guards had been distracted by the rooms door blowing open painter had managed to snag the needle from amid a pile of discarded medical gear he had quickly palmed it he sat up a bit and reached to his foot the guard lounging on the next cot lifted his pistol from the crook of his arm where he had been resting it lay back down painter obeyed just an itch too fucking bad painter sighed he waited for the guards attention to drift less focused on him he shifted his free foot to the cuffed one he had managed to pinch the needle between his big toe and its neighbor he now sought to pick the lock on the cuff tricky to do blind and with his toes but when theres a will theres a way closing his eyes he kept his movements minimal under the sheets finally he felt a satisfying slip in pressure on this trapped ankle he was free he lay still and glanced to the guard now what pm cassandra crouchedin the bow of the zodiac pontoon boat the motor idled behind her she had nightvision binoculars focused on the far shoreline three flares hung above the glass city lighting it brilliantly through the scopes despite the situation cassandra could not help but be amazed across the lake she heard the continual shatter of glass another rocketpropelled grenade arced from one of the six jet skis it struck deep into the city flashing blindingly through her scopes she lowered the binoculars the flares cast the city in shades of crimson and fire smoke billowed hanging in the still air above energy scintillated swelling crackling swirling a cerulean maelstrom there was such beauty in the destruction here a chatter of machinegun fire drew her attention farther toward shore a second zodiac zipped parallel to the city strafing the area with continuous fire more rpgs arced over the water smashing into the city pillars of glass collapsed like toppled redwoods truly beautiful cassandra slipped her portable tracker from a pocket of her combat jacket she stared at the trackers lcd screen the blue circle glowed moving away from her position seeking higher ground the artillery barrage was just to soften them up run while you can the fun is just beginning pm safia climbedwith the others up a winding narrow stairway explosions echoed all around amplified by the glass bubble smoke choked the air they ran through the dark all flashlights off omaha kept to her side helping lulu safia held a childs hand though she wasnt much reassurance to the girl with every bomb blast safia ducked fearing the end expecting the glass bubble to come down small fingers squeezed hers the others trailed ahead and behind kara helped another of the elders danny clay and coral followed behind leading more children several of the rahim had slipped away into side streets and terraces dropping into sniping positions others simply vanished whispering away to guard their rear safia had watched one woman take a few steps down a dark street and vanish in front of her eyes perhaps it was a trick of glass and shadowor maybe it was a demonstration of the gift lulu had told safia about to cloud perception and disappear the group reached the top of the stairs safia glanced behind her she had a panoramic view of the lower city and shoreline flares overhead lit the place brilliantly bathing the city in crimson down by the lake the royal barge was a smoldering ruin of broken timber the stone pier had been shattered the glass shore pitted deeply theyve stopped the bombardment omaha said safia realized he was right but the explosions still echoed in her head on the lake cassandras forces were moving in jet skis and pontoon boats angled and swept toward shore in unison like an aerial team closer in all along the shoreline itself smaller vs aimed through the waters safia squinted spotting men in wet suits atop motorized body boards they struck the beach surfed high and rolled into crouched positions rifles already in hand others darted into the streets and alleyways a gun battle erupted below flashing like fireflies popping loudly an exchange of fire between cassandras forces and some of the rahim but it was brief the snarl of dogs another grenade rocketed from one of the incoming jet skis striking where the gunfire had come from glass shattered in a spray of brilliance safia prayed that the rahim had already fled shoot and run it was their only chance they were far too few and vastly outgunned but to where could they run they were trapped in a glass bubble even the dhow was destroyed safia watched the jet skis and pontoons skid up to shore offloading more men they would hunt and blast their way through the city overhead the flares began to dim and fade sinking into the shattered city with the fading of the flares ubar darkened lit now by the showers of blue fire above basking the city in shades of indigo safia glanced up to the arched roof the crackles of energy and swirls of gaseous clouds had grown fierce roiling as if angry at the destruction another spate of gunfire blasted rattling somewhere else in the city we have to keep going omaha said urging her on where she asked turning to him he met her eyes he had no answer pm the sandstormcontinued to pound the cinderblock building it had worn everyones nerves raw sand dust and grit covered everything finding every crack and crevice to stream inside winds howled it didnt help matters that field reports radioed up from below described the battle clearly it was a rout cassandras superior forces were sweeping through finding little resistance enjoying the mayhem and the boys here werent allowed outside to play turn that goddamn dixie chicks shit off the guard yelled fuck you pearson the medic shouted back fixing a seeping bandage pearson swung around listen you piece of dogshit the second guard was back by the plastic water barrel tilting it while trying to fill a paper cup painter knew hed never have a better chance he rolled from his bed with hardly a squeak grabbed the pistol from the guards hand twisting the mans wrist savagely he pumped two bullets into the guards chest the impact blew the man backward onto the cot painter dropped to a shooters stance aimed at the second guard and fired three shots all at the mans head two struck home the guard went down brains and blood sprayed on the back wall leaping back painter held the gun out he trusted that the roar of the storm had muffled the shots he swept the room the wounded had clothes and weapons stacked nearby out of immediate reach that left only the medic painter kept his eyes focused on the man his peripheral gaze on the rest of the room on the cot pearson moaned bubbled and bled painter spoke to the medic go for a gun you die this man can be saved make your choice he backed to the laptop reached blindly for it snapped it closed and tucked it under his gun arm the medic kept his hands in the air palms toward him painter did not let his guard down he sidled to the door reached behind to the handle and yanked it open winds almost buffeted him straight back into the room he leaned against the onslaught and forced his way out he didnt bother closing the door once out he turned on a heel and spun away he aimed in the direction hed heard the armored tractors stop and tunneled through the sand and wind barefoot he wore only his boxers sand scoured him like steel wool he didnt bother keeping his eyes open there was nothing to see sand choked him with each breath he held the pistol out in front of him in his other hand he clutched the laptop it had data he needed on the guild on safia his outstretched gun struck metal the first of the tractors as much as he wouldve liked to take it he moved on the mammoth vehicle was pinned down by the others behind it he heard its engine running to keep the batteries charged he prayed they were all idling he continued down the line moving fast he vaguely heard shouts behind him word was out painter dug faster through the storms headwinds keeping a shoulder to each tractors tread he reached the last in the line its engine purred like a happy kitten a twentyton kitten sliding down the side painter found the door and struggled to open it against the wind not a onehanded job he tucked the pistol into his boxers waistband its weight half pulling his shorts down he set the laptop on the tread and finally got the door open enough to squeeze through he snatched the computer with him at last he slammed the door and latched it closed leaning his back against the door he spit sand from his mouth and rubbed his eyes clearing his eyebrows and lashes of grit gunfire peppered the side of the carriage stinging his back with their rattling impacts he shoved away the fun never stops around here he hurried to the drivers compartment and slid into the seat he tossed the laptop onto the other seat the sandstorm swirled beyond the windshield a permanent midnight he flipped on the lights visibility stretched for a whole two yards not bad he kicked the gear into reverse and headed out of dodge he retreated straight back if anything was back there hed simply have to trust that the armored behemoth could bull through it more gunfire chased him like kids throwing stones he fled noting when he cleared the charred remains of shisur he escaped into the desert shooting backward eventually hed think about forward gears but backward worked fine for now as he glanced to the windshield he noted twin glows bloom in the darkness out in the city pursuit pm as theothers took a brief rest omaha stared at the queens palace the structure had managed to escape the initial bombardment maybe they could make a stand here up in its tower he shook his head fanciful but impractical their only hope was to keep moving but they were running out of city not much lay above and beyond the palace a few streets and low buildings he glanced over the lower city sporadic gunfire still flared but it was both less frequent and closer the rahims defense was wearing thin the line being overwhelmed omaha knew they were doomed he had never considered himself a pessimist just a pragmatist still he glanced at safia with his last breath he would keep her safe kara stepped beside him omaha he looked at her she never called him omaha her face was exhausted lined by fear eyes hollow like him she sensed their end kara nodded to safia her voice was a sigh what the hell are you waiting for bloody christ she stepped away to the courtyard wall slumped against it and sank to a seat omaha remembered her earlier words she still loves you from steps away he watched safia she knelt beside a child holding both the girls small hands between her own her face shone in the glow overhead madonna and child he moved closerthen closer again karas words inside his head life is hard love doesnt have to be safia didnt look up but she still spoke these are my mothers hands she said so quietly so calmly defying their situation she stared at the child all these women my mother still lives through them an entire life from babe to elder a full life not one cut short omaha dropped to one knee he stared into her face as she studied the child she simply took his breath away literally safia he said softly she turned to him eyes shining he met her gaze marry me she blinked what i love you i always have she turned omaha its not that simple he touched her chin gently with a finger and turned her face back to his he waited for her eyes to find him thats just it yes it is she attempted to shift away he would not let her escape this time he leaned closer im sorry her eyes shone a bit brighter not from happiness but from the threat of tears you left me i know i didnt know what to do but it was a boy who left you he lowered his hand gently taking hers it is a man on his knees now she stared into his eyes wavering movement over her shoulder caught his eye figures pushed out of the dark around the corner of the palace men a dozen omaha leaped to his feet scrambling to push safia behind him out of the shadows a familiar figure strode forth barak omaha scrambled to comprehend the giant of an arab had been missing since before the attack more men followed behind barak in desert cloaks they were led by a man with a crutch under one arm captain alhaffi the leader of the desert phantoms waved to the men behind him sharif was among them as hale as when omaha had last seen him out at jobs tomb he had survived the firefight without a scratch sharif and the men dispersed down the streets strapped with rifles grenades and rpg launchers omaha stared after them he didnt know what was going on but cassandra was in for a surprise pm all thatwas left was the cleanup cassandra kept one foot on the pontoon of her boat she listened to the open channel as various teams swept the city in quadrants clearing away pockets of resistance she clutched her electronic tracker fingers digging she knew exactly where safia was within the city cassandra allowed the curator to scurry like a mouse while her crew mopped behind her wearing through her resistance cassandra still wanted the bitch alive especially with painter now on the run she had to resist screaming her frustration she would have the balls of every man topside if painter escaped she took a deep shuddering breath there was nothing she could do down here she had to secure this place root out its secrets which meant capturing safia alive and with safia in hand cassandra would have a card to play against painter a pretty little ace in the hole an explosion drew her attention back to the city she was surprised her men needed to employ another grenade she watched an rpg sail into the air she blinked at its trajectory fuck she leaped from her perch and sprinted down the shoreline her rubber soles gave her good purchase on the rough glass she dove behind a sheltering pile of debris as the grenade struck the pontoon boat the explosion deafened her making her ears ache even stinging her eyes glass and water sprayed high she rolled up and away as broken glass rained down she covered her head with her arms jagged pieces fell around her dancing off other glass slicing skin and clothes stinging like a rain of fire after the deadly shower ceased she stared up at the city had someone commandeered one of her teams launchers another two rpgs flew by new automatic fire flared from a dozen places what the hell was going on pm as theexplosions echoed away and gunfire chattered safia watched captain alhaffi clump forward on his crutch the shock of his arrival still held everyone speechless the captains eyes settled on lulu he dropped his crutch and lowered himself to one knee he spoke in arabic but in a dialect few had heard spoken aloud safia had to strain her ears to recognize the words of the singsong speech your highness please forgive your servant for arriving so late he bowed his head the hodja was as mystified as anyone else by his arrival and posturing omaha stepped to safias side hes speaking shahran safias mind spun the shahra were the mountain clan that traced their lineage to king shaddad the first ruler of ubaror rather the consort of its first queen barak spoke hearing omaha we are all of the shahra clan captain alhaffi rose to his feet another man returned his crutch safia realized what she had just witnessed the formal acknowledgment of the kings line to its queen captain alhaffi motioned them to follow speaking again in english i had thought to get you clear but all i can offer is shelter we must hope my men and your women can hold the marauders off come he led the way back around the palace everyone followed omaha paced next to barak you are shahra the man nodded so thats why you knew about that back door out of the mountains through that graveyard you said only the shahra knew of that path the vale of remembrance barak intoned more formally the graves of our ancestors back to the exodus from ubar captain alhaffi hobbled alongside lulu kara helped her from the other side continuing their conversation is that why you all volunteered for the mission because of its ties to ubar the captain bowed his head i apologize for the ruse lady kensington but the shahra do not reveal their secrets to outsiders that is not our way we are as much guardians of this place as the rahim we were given this burden by the last queen of ubar just before our two lines parted ways as she divided the keys so she divided the royal lines each with its own secrets safia stared between the two the houses of ubar joined again what secret was left with you omaha asked him the old path into ubar the one walked by the first queen we were forbidden to open it until ubar was tread again a back door omaha said safia should have known the queen who sealed ubar after the horrible tragedy here was too meticulous she had contingency plans stacked atop contingency plans spreading them across both lines so theres a way out of here omaha asked yes to the surface but there is no escape there the sandstorm rages which makes crossing atop ubars dome dangerous it was what took us so long to get here once we learned from barak that the gate had been breached well better late than never danny said behind them yes but now a new storm strikes the area rising from the south it will be death to walk those sands so were still trapped omaha said until the storm abates we must simply hold out until that time with that sobering thought they crisscrossed a few more streets in silence finally reaching the back cavern wall it looked solid but captain alhaffi continued forward then safia spotted it a straight fracture in the glass wall it angled inward making it difficult to spot captain alhaffi led them to the crack the surface lies a hundred and fifty steps up the passage can act as a shelter for the children and women and a trap if we cant hold off cassandra she still outnumbers us and outguns us captain alhaffi stared across the group my men could use help anybody who can hold a gun safia watched danny and coral accept weapons from a stash inside the crack even clay stepped forward and held out his hand her student caught her surprised look i really want that a was all he said as he stepped away his eyes shone with terror but he did not back down omaha went last i already have a pistol but i could use a second captain alhaffi handed him an m but thisll do safia stepped up as he moved away omaha she had never acknowledged what he had said back by the palace had his words been a deathbed confession knowing they were doomed he smiled at her you dont have to say anything i made my stand i havent earned your response yet he moved away but i hope at least youll let me try safia shoved up to him and put her arm around his neck and held him tight she spoke into his ear i do love youi just dont know she couldnt finish the statement it hung there between them he squeezed her anyway i do and ill wait until you do too an argument forced them apart words between kara and captain alhaffi i will not let you fight lady kensington i am perfectly able to shoot a gun then take a gun with you to the stairs you may need it kara fumed but the captain was right the last stand might come to a fight on the stairs captain alhaffi placed a hand on her shoulder i owe your family a debt let me pay it this day what are you talking about kara said he bowed his head his voice grew mournful and shamed this is not the first time ive lent my services to your family when i was a young man a boy really i volunteered to help you and your father karas frown deepened captain alhaffi lifted his face to hers my first name is habib kara gasped and stumbled back a step the guide on the day of the hunt that was you i was to attend your father because of his interest in ubar but i failed fear kept me from following you and your father that day into the forbidden sands only when i saw that you intended to enter the nisnases did i come after you but it was too late so i collected you from the sands and returned you to thumrait i did not know what else to do kara appeared dumbstruck safia stared between them everything had come full circleback to these same sands so let me protect you nowas i failed to do in the past kara could only nod captain alhaffi moved away kara called after him you were only a boy now im a man he turned to follow the others back down to the city safia heard an echo of omahas words the hodja stared among those remaining it is not over yet with those cryptic words she entered the cleft we must walk the path of the old queen storm watch december pm shisur they werestill on his tail painter saw the glow of his pursuers back in the sandstorm he lumbered forward eking out as much speed as possible which was approximately thirty miles per hour and in the current teeth of this storm this was a highspeed chase he checked both side mirrors one truck tracked on each side he caught the barest glimpse of his hunters two loaded flatbed trucks despite their loads they moved faster than he could but they also had to compensate for the terrain he on the other hand aimed the twentyton tractor in one direction trundling over anything in his path riding up one dune and down another sand obliterated all sight lines if this were a blizzard it would be described as a whiteout painter had set the tractors cruise control he checked its other features it had a radar dish but he didnt know how to operate it he did find the radio his initial plan had been to travel as close to thumrait air base as necessary and contact the omani royal air force someone would listen if he had any hope of rescuing the others he had to blow his cover and alert the government here but the trucks had set him on a course away from the base deeper into the storm he had no chance to swing around the other trucks were too fast as he climbed a monstrous dune an explosion thundered on his left side shrapnel and a wave of sand struck that side like a bitchslap from god himself an rpg for a moment an awful grating sound tore at the treads painter winced but the tractor rode through it grinding away whatever had clogged its gears it moved up the long slope another explosion this time directly behind him the noise was deafening but the armor plating proved its mettleor in this case its polycarbonate steel and kevlar let them take potshots at him the wind and storm would surely throw off their aim and the tractors armor would do the rest then he felt a sickening lurch the tractors treads still spun but painters speed slowed the m began to slide he suddenly realized what his hunters bombing had intendednot to take out the twentyton tractor but to make it lose its footing they were bombing the slope triggering an avalanche the whole slope was sliding backward taking the tractor with it he switched off the cruise popped the clutch and kicked to a lower gear he slammed the accelerator trying to regain traction in the slippery slope no luck he just churned himself into the loose sand painter braked the tractor fishtailing the back end then hit reverse he fled with the sand now swimming with the riptide in the avalanche he turned the tractor until he was parallel with the slope the tractor tilting dangerously he had to take care not to roll it he pushed the gear into neutral braked then back into first the tractor moved forward again now surfing down the slope running along its flank finding good traction and speed he raced down to the bottom the trucks gave chase but they ran into the toppling sand and had to slow down painter reached the end of the dune and cut around the corner he was done running from these fuckers he positioned the tractor to run straight then reset the cruise letting go of the wheel he made sure the tractor continued its course he then retreated quickly to the back he found his own launcher he loaded one of the rocketpropelled grenades balanced the long tube on his shoulder and crossed to the back hatch of the tractor he kicked the door open sand blew in but not too fiercely as he was traveling into the wind he stared out behind him he waited until he spotted two glows rounding the last dune coming at him again come to papa he mumbled and aimed he set the crosshairs and pulled the trigger the launcher exploded with a whoosh he felt the backwash of heated air as the grenade rocketed away he watched the red fire of its trail a shooting star the hunters spotted it too painter saw them both wheel to either side too late at least for one of them the grenade exploded painter enjoyed seeing one of the glows shoved high into the air and explode into a fiery ball shining brightly in the darkness it crashed back into the sands the other truck had vanished hopefully in its haste it had bogged down among the dunes painter would watch for it he returned to his seat and checked both side mirrors all dark with a moment to breathe painter opened the stolen laptop slowly pixels charged and bloomed to light on the dark screen he prayed the batteries held the schematic of the area reappeared painter stared oh god there was no blue marker panic prickled then the familiar tiny spinning blue ring appeared it had taken an extra minute for the wireless feed to pick up again safia was still transmitting he checked the scrolling coordinates they were still changing she was moving alive he hoped that meant all the others were safe as well he had to get to herto them though the implanted transceiver could not be removedit was tamperproofed to blow unless deactivatedhe could get safia out of cassandras range get her to a surgeon and demolition expert as he stared he realized only the zaxis coordinates were changing that axis measured elevation or depth the negative number was growing smaller approaching zero safia was climbing up she was almost on the surface she must have found a back door out of the caves good girl as he watched he frowned the z coordinates passed zero and continued to climb into the positive numbers safia had not only reached the surface she was climbing higher what the hell he checked her position she was miles from his position as he had already been heading in the general direction he had only to adjust his course slightly aiming directly for her he crept the speed up another five miles per hour breakneck speed in the current conditions if safia found a back door so would cassandra he had to reach safia and the others as soon as possible he glanced back to the blue glow he knew one other person was surely monitoring this transmission cassandraand she still had the portable detonator pm safia marchedup the long dark stairs the others trailing behind her climbing in twos children and old or injured women kara carried their only flashlight pointed it up the passage casting safias shadow ahead of her they sought to put as much distance as possible between them and the war below echoes of the fighting still reached them a continual gunfire safia fought to shut it out she ran a hand along the wall sandstone the steps underfoot had been worn by countless sandals and bare feet how many others had walked this same path she imagined the queen of sheba herself climbing or descending these stairs as she ascended safia sensed times constriction the past and present merging into one more than anywhere here in arabia the past and present blurred history was not dead and buried under skyscrapers and asphalt or even trapped behind museum walls it lived here tied intimately to the land merging story and stone into one she dropped her fingers lulu joined her i heard you speaking to your beloved safia didnt want to talk about it hes notthat was before you both love this land the hodja continued ignoring her attempt at a protest youve let too much sand come between you but such dust can be swept aside its not that easy safia stared down at her hand where a ring once rested gone like a promise once made how could she trust hed be there when she needed him it was a boy who left you it is a man who kneels here now could she believe that in contrast she pictured anothers face painter the way he held her hand his quiet respect and comfort even the agony in his eyes when he frightened her lulu spoke as if reading her mind there are many men with noble hearts some take a little longer to grow into theirs safia felt tears rising i need more timeto think things through youve had time like us youve spent too much time alone choices have to be madebefore we are left with none as proof a short way up the storms rush of winds moaned across the opening at the top safia felt a breath of it across her cheek she felt drawn to it after so long below she wanted to be free of this prison of rock if only for a moment to clear her head im going to check the storm safia mumbled ill come with you kara said a step behind her as will i the hodja added i would see with my own eyes what the first queen saw i would see the original entrance to ubar the three of them continued alone up the last flights of stairs the winds grew stiffer and sand swirled down atop them the three pulled up hoods scarves and goggles safia hiked to the top the opening was a crack ahead kara clicked off her flashlight the storm was lighter than the dark passage the exit stood a yard away safia spotted a crowbar leaning near the exit beyond the threshold rested a large flat boulder partially blocking the way the rock mustve hidden the entrance kara said safia nodded captain alhaffis men must have used the crowbar to pry the stone aside enough to pass through perhaps if they outlasted the storm they could all escape push the stone back in place and block cassandra the fresh wind filled safia with hope even from here the storm did not seem as dark as she remembered back at shisur maybe the brunt of it was ending safia bent through the crack but stayed sheltered behind the stone sand still covered the sun but full night had become twilight again she could see the sun again a wan moon through the storm the storm looks less severe kara said confirming safias assessment lulu disagreed do not be fooled these sands around ubar are deceptive there is a very real reason tribes avoid this area calling it cursed haunted the sands of djinns and devils the hodja led them farther out of the entrance safia followed the wind tugging at her cloak and scarf she looked around she realized that they were atop a mesa some thirty or forty feet above the desert floor it was one of countless rocky prominences that poked from the dunes ships of the sands they were named by the nomadic tribes safia stepped farther out examining their perch she recognized the shape of the mesa it was the same as the sand painting at the palace here was where the first entrance to ubar was discovered almost three millennia ago she stared around both the citadel and the queens palace had been patterned after this mesa the most precious of all the ships of the desert beyond the mesa the storm drew safias eye the swirling clouds in this area appeared strange a mile or so out the sandstorm darkened in bands encircling the plateau safia could hear distant winds howling its like were in the eye of a hurricane kara said it is ubar lulu said it draws the might of the storm to itself safia remembered how for a short time after the keys erupted and opened the gate the sandstorm had seemed less intense kara crept dangerously near one of the rims it made safia nervous you should get back from there safia warned afraid a gust of wind might carry her over the edge theres a path down this side more of a goat track maybe we could make it down i can see three trucks below about forty yards out captain alhaffis transportation safia edged closer she could not imagine trying to traverse a cliffside path in these winds they gusted unpredictably lulu agreed with safia it is death to attempt those sands kara glanced back at the hodja her expression argued that it was just as dangerous to stay clearly kara was willing to take the chance lulu understood her thought your father dismissed warnings of these sands as you do now even after all youve seen her words only angered kara what is there to fear lulu swept her arms out these are the sands of the nisnases both safia and kara knew that name the black ghosts of the sands it was the nisnases that were to blame for reginald kensingtons death lulu pointed to the southwest a small whirlwind stirred twisting a tornado of sand it scintillated in the darkness aglow with static charge for a moment it burst more brilliantly then vanished ive seen a dust devil like that kara said lulu nodded the nisnases bring the burning death safia pictured reginald kensingtons tortured body locked in glass it reminded her of the mummified citizens below how were they connected another devil bloomed off to the east another due south they seemed to stir up from the sand and into the air safia had seen thousands of such whirlwinds but never ones so brilliant with static charge kara gazed out i still dont under directly before them a wall of sand blew up from below the mesas edge they all fell back a nisnase lulu gasped the whirlwind formed just beyond the mesa swirling in a sinuous column both kara and the hodja retreated for the passage safia remained where she stood mesmerized vast waves of static charge swept up its length chasing up from the sand and into the sky her cloak billowed not from winds this time but from the play of electricity in the air crackling over her skin clothes and hair it was a painful but somehow ecstatic feeling it left her body cold her skin warm she exhaled not realizing she had been holding her breath she took a step forward close enough to see the full breadth of the snaking whirlwind energy continued to jitter through the column she saw the devil centered around one of the three vehicles from her vantage point she could see the sands around the truck forming a whirlpool beneath it she jumped a bit when something touched her elbow it was kara she had strengthened her nerve to watch kara found and took safias hand in her touch safia sensed kara reliving an old nightmare beneath the truck the sands began to darken a burning odor wafted up to them karas hand clenched on safia she had recognized that smell the sands grew black molten sand glass the nisnase the energies in the whirlwind whipped wildly glowing through the entire column from their perch they watched the truck sink into the molten pool at first slowly its rubber tires melting and poppingthen there was a tremendous whoosh of static the devil collapsed and in the instant before it vanished safia watched the glass turn as black as nothingness the truck fell away as if through air the black pit melted deeper into the sand and the last winds swept fresh sand over it wiping away all trace a ghost come and gone a moment later a soft blast burped the sand in the area bumped up fuel tank kara said they both raised their eyes more of the deadly whirlwinds were popping up all over there had to be a dozen of them now whats happening kara asked safia shook her head the encircling wall of storm had also grown blacker contracting toward them moving closer in all directions lulu stared around them with a look of terror the other storm system from the coast it has come the two are feeding on each other becoming something worse the megastorm safia said its forming around us more and more whirlwinds danced across the sands their glows were flames rising from the sands it was a hellish landscape the storm beyond grew blacker and wilder it screamed now to move across those sands invited certain death safia heard a sound closer at hand a noise from her radio she freed it from a pocket omaha had asked her to leave the channel open in case he needed to reach her she fished it out and backed toward the passageway a voice whispered through static at her safiaifcan hear me kara leaned next to her who is it safia pressed it to her ear listening tightly icomingsafia can you hear who kara asked safias eyes widened its painter hes alive some vagary of the storms static let his voice reach her clearly for a moment im two miles from your position hold tight im coming static erased any further reception safia pressed the send button and held the radio to her lips painter if you can hear me dont come do not come did you hear me she released the button only static he hadnt heard she stared out at the netherworld of storm fire and wind it was death to travel those sandsand painter was coming here pm cassandra crouchedwith two of her men gunfire rattled and spat all around after the first rpg blast had caught her off guard cassandra had entered the fray moving into the wreck and tumble of the town fighting continued but her team was making steady progress she stared through the sights of a rifle and waited the cluster of blocky homes lay before her limned in shades of emerald and silver through her nightvision goggles having also employed an overlay of infrared she watched a red blob move beyond a glass wall near a corner one of the enemy she studied the silhouette her target carried a tube on his shoulder blazing like a small sun fiery hot one of the launchers she had instructed her men to focus their attention on such objectives they had to eliminate the enemys longrange capabilities by the wall her target shifted moving out into the open positioning the grenade launcher cassandra centered her crosshairs on the hottest part of the enemys bodythe head she squeezed her trigger just once thats all she needed through the infrared she saw the spray of fire blossom outward a clean shot but some twitched reflex fired the launcher cassandra watched the rpg blast away blinding on her scopes she rolled to her back dazzled the grenade sailed high overhead the aim way off course as the enemys body fell backward angled toward the roof as the grenade was she lost sight of it against the brilliant display of electrical discharges storming across the ceiling she flipped away the infrared overlay and toggled off the nightvision mode through the regular lenses the roof still blazed the display had grown more violent filling the entire cap of the dome small arcs of electricity speared out like bolts of lightning across the lake the misfired rpg exploded it had struck the far wall opposite the city she focused the telescopic view fuckshe could not catch a goddamn break the grenade struck the wall above the tunnel leading into the cavern she watched a section of the glass wall tear away from the rock behind it along with a portion of the tunnel room it collapsed sealing the tunnel their exit was now blocked she rolled to her stomach the surface team would just have to dig them out the immediate concern was to secure this town capture safia and extract the prize here she flipped her infrared overlay back over her goggles lenses it was time to continue the hunt her two men had gone forward already to check the body and confiscate the launcher they were ready to move on cassandra paused to check her electronic tracker safia lay a short distance ahead red triangles the beacons from her team closed on her position from all directions satisfied cassandra almost pocketed the device but the elevation reading alongside the blue glowing ring caught her eye she froze that didnt make sense cassandra stared up again at the blazing roof if the reading was correct safia was on the surface was there another way out she touched her throat mike and sent out a general alert over the open channel reaching every man close in now full run leave no one alive cassandra rose from her position and joined her men lets finish this pm omaha heardthe cry from captain alhaffi in arabic pull back to the stairs all forces retreat to the exit omaha crouched with coral danny and clay they had taken up a position inside the courtyard of the palace a grenade blasted twenty yards away they all pressed against the wall we have to go clay said id love to omaha said just tell that to the two men around the corner they were pinned down in here they had been for the last minute moments ago omaha and clay had run into the courtyard from one direction danny and coral from the other both teams chased by commandos now all four were pinned down a standoff only cassandras soldiers had an advantage sophisticated scopes that seemed to track their every move we should pull back into the palace coral said slapping a fresh magazine into her pistol wed have a better chance of losing them omaha nodded they made a dash for the palace entrance what about captain alhaffi and the others clay asked as they ducked inside they might leave without us omaha crouched on one knee gun pointed toward the courtyard coral took his flank danny and clay behind them leave where omaha asked id rather take my chances out here than in the cramped stairwell at least here we have some elbow the shot pinged off the wall by his ear glass shattered needling the side of his face damn more bullets chewed omaha dropped flat next to coral danny and clay retreated into the far room the only reason omaha was still alive was that the ironandglass statue of the palm holding the sphere in the courtyards center had blocked a direct shot into the entrance across the courtyard one of the commandos ran into view angling to the side a grenade launcher on his shoulder pointed at the door of the palace bullets continued to pepper suppression fire for the artillery soldier a gutsy move something had lit a fire under cassandras team in the last few minutes coral twisted around and aimed her pistol at the man with the grenade launcher she was too slow the gods above were not from the roof a dazzling bolt of energy struck the ground near the man crackling for a half a breath searing the retinas it was not true lightning just an arc of energy between the roof and floor it did not blast a crater it did not even knock the man down it did much worse the glass under the man instantly transmogrified from solid to liquid changing states in one breath the soldier fell into the pool up to his neck the scream that burst from his mouth was a sound only heard in the deepest pit of hell the scream of a man burned alive it cut short after an instant the mans head fell backward steam rising from his mouth dead the glass was solid again the suppression fire died with the man others had witnessed it in the distance the fighting continued echoing with rifle blastsbut here no one moved omaha raised his gaze the roof was on fire filling the dome other bolts jumped between ceiling and floor somewhere across the way another scream erupted a twin to the one heard here its happening again coral said omaha stared at the dead man buried in glass he knew what she meant fiery death had returned to ubar pm painter bouncedin his seat as the twentyton tractor flew over a small dune he could see nothing now the visibility of a few yards had dropped to the tip of his nose he was driving blind he could be blithely aiming for the edge of a cliff and hed never know a few minutes ago the sandstorm had suddenly whipped up with a renewed ferocity the buffeting winds sounded like giant fists striking the tractor painters head throbbed from the concussion of the forces still he continued blindly forward his only guidance glowed on the laptop beside him safia he had no idea if she heard his radio call or not but she hadnt moved since the broadcast she was still abovegroundactually about forty feet aboveground there must be a hill ahead hed have to slow once he was nearer a shimmer of reflection caught his eye in the side mirror the second pursuit vehicle it was following the tractors larger lights the hunter had to be as blind as he following in his tracks keeping to his packed path letting him encounter any obstacles the blind leading the blind painter continued he dared not leave his post the winds suddenly whipped even more savagely for a moment the tractor tilted up on one tread then slammed down christ for some reason a laugh bubbled out of him the gibbering amusement of the damned then the winds ended as if someone had unplugged the fan the lumbering tractor rode out into more open sands the skies even lightened from midnight to twilight sand still stirred and winds did indeed still blow but at a tenth of the velocity of a moment ago he glanced to the side mirror a solid wall of blackness blanketed the view he must have traveled completely through its heart and out the other side as he watched he saw no sign of the pursuit vehicle its glow lost in the total darkness perhaps that last burst of winds had flipped the sucker he focused forward his sight line stretched for a good quarter mile in the distance he could see a shadowy prominence of dark rock a desert mesa he glanced at the laptop the blue glow lay directly ahead so thats where you are he kicked up the speed of the tractor he wondered if safia could see him reaching out he took the radio in hand he kept one eye on the road throughout the region minitornadoes whipped and snaked joining desert to sky they glowed with a cobalt radiance crackles of static charge spun up from the ground most stood in one place but a few meandered over the desert landscape he was close enough to see one etch down a dune face sand coughing up around it in its wake it left a trail of black sand a squiggled sigil a pen stroke from some storm god painter frowned he had never seen such a phenomenon but it was none of his concern he had more pressing worries he raised the radio to his lips safia if you can read me let me know you should be able to see me he waited for a reply he didnt know if safia still had one of their radios it was the frequency to which he had set the tractors transmitter noise burst from the receiver ainter go turn back it was safia it sounded like she was in trouble he hit the transmit button im not turning back ive got an arc of electricity leaped from the radio receiver to his ear yelping out he dropped the radio he smelled burning hair he felt a surge of static charge throughout the vehicle every surface shocked him he kept his hands on the rubbercoated wheel the laptop sizzled then gave off a loud pop the screen went dead the sound of a foghorn reached him blaring persistent not a foghorna trucks horn he glanced at the side mirror from the storms black wall the pursuit truck flew out into the open the last winds slapped the back end its frame tilted beginning to flip then it was free it struck the sands the tires on one side then the other it bounced skidded and spun a full turn but it was out of the storm painter swore the trucks driver must have been as shocked to be alive as painter was to see him the flatbed idled it looked like hell one tire was flat the bumper was curled into a steel smile the tarp over its load in back had been blown to one side tangled amid the ropes painter pressed his accelerator racing forward putting as much distance between himself and the truck he remembered the rpg bombardment he wanted a little breathing room then hed take care of this truck in the side mirror the truck followed limping after him painter prepared to fight setting the cruise ahead the desert was a forest of whirling sand devils glowing in the twilight gloom they all seemed to be on the move now he frowned they were all moving in unison some unearthly ballet then he felt it a familiar lurch in the sand he had felt the same when the grenades had triggered an avalanche over the dune face the shift of sands under his treads but he was on flat ground all around the whirlwinds danced static electricity sparked and the desert loosened under him against all odds the twentyton tractor was becoming mired his speed slowed he felt its back end fishtailing the tractor swung around dragged by unknown forces then he was trapped stopped his side window now faced toward the pursuit truck it continued toward him closing in on its wide knobby sand tires then the sand under it became powder it sank to its rimsthen axle bogged both hunter and prey were trapped flies in amber but this amber still flowed he felt it beneath him the sand was still moving pm safia gaveup on the radio she could only watch in horror alongside kara and lulu it was a landscape out of a nightmare a painting done by salvador dalн the world melted and stretched she stared out at the whirlwinds the deadly electrical discharges pools of black sands streaks of the same carved out by skittering devils the dusty clouds in the sky glowed from the amount of energy flowing into them fed by the snaking columns of sand and static charge but that was not the worst for as far as she could see the entire desert floor had begun to churn in one giant whirlpool spinning around the buried bubble of ubar the sandstone mesa was a boulder in the current but there were smaller rocks painters tractor and another truck mired in the churning sands whirlwinds closed in on the vehicles etching the sand with molten fire a crash echoed to the left a piece of the mesa tore away tumbling into the sand a glacier calving into the sea we cant stay here kara said itll tear this island apart painter safia said her clothing sparked and crackled with discharges as she stepped toward the mesas edge he had come to rescue them driving to his doom they had to do something hes on his own kara said we cant help him the radio suddenly crackled in her hand she had forgotten she was holding it painter safia can you hear me it was omaha she lifted her radio im here his voice sounded distant as if from another planet something strange is going on down here the static is arcing all over its zapping the glass melting spots its the cataclysm all over again stay away can you get up here to the stairs no danny clay coral and i are holing up in the palace a commotion by the tunnel drew her eye sharif climbed out kara moved to meet him he pointed to the tunnel weve retreated to the stairs he said panting captain alhaffi will attempt to hold the enemy off you should his voice died as he suddenly caught a view of the desert his eyes widened another splintering crack erupted rocks crashed the rim of the mesa crumbled allah preserve us sharif prayed kara waved him back hed better because were bloody damn well running out of places to hide pm cassandra knewtrue terror for the first time in ages the last time she had felt this gutlevel fear was as a child listening to her fathers footsteps outside her bedroom door at midnight this was the same a fear that gelled the insides and turned bone marrow to ice breathing was a talent forgotten she cowered inside a tiny glass building more a chapel enough for one person to kneel its only entrance was a short door that had to be ducked into no windows past the door the lower city spread below her she watched the continual arcing bolts of discharge some struck the lake grew more intense then sucked back to the roof brighter for the effort as if the storm above were feeding off the waters below the same was not true when it struck the glass every surface absorbed the strange energy becoming a liquid pool but only as briefly as a lightning flicker then it turned solid again she had watched one of her men succumb to such a bolt he had been sheltering behind a wall leaning on it then the bolt struck the wall he fell through it his support suddenly gone the wall solidified again half his body on one side the other half on this side between he had been burned to bone even his clothes had caught fire a human torch on two sides of glass all across the city the fighting had stopped men sought shelter they had seen the mummified bodies they knew what was happening the cavern had gone deathly quiet accept for the occasional gunshot by the back wall where the enemy had sequestered itself in some passageway anyone who approached was shot cassanda clutched her electronic tracker she watched the spread of red triangles her men or those few that were left she counted of the fifty on the assault team only a dozen were left she watched as another blinked out a shattering scream fluttered through the city death stalked her men she knew even such enclosed shelters were not safe she had seen the mummified bodies within a few of the homes the key seemed to be movement perhaps the amount of static in the room was such that any stirrings attracted a bolt to stab out at it so cassandra sat still very still she had done the same in her childhood bed it hadnt helped then she doubted it would now she was trapped pm omaha layflat at the entryway to the palace the quiet pressed upon him beyond the courtyard the firestorm worsened bolts crackled shattering into brilliant forks the dome shone like the corona of a bluewhite sun omaha watched and knew death was near but at least he had told safia he loved her he had made his peace he would have to be satisfied with that he glanced upward he prayed safia was safe she had relayed another short message describing the chaos upstairs death above death below take your pick coral lay with him studying the storm were inside the worlds largest transformer what do you mean they spoke in whispers as if afraid to draw the sleeping giants attention the glass cavern with its energized antimatter solution is acting like a massive insulated superconductor it draws energy to itself like the iron camel did at the museum in this case it collects the static energy of any passing sandstorm sucking it down from above but as energy builds in the chamber crossing some threshold it must need to shed its excess energy like lightning does during a thunderstorm only this is aimed from sand to sky shooting upward again in immense discharges creating those momentary blasts of deadly whirlwinds on the deserts surface like its draining its battery omaha said but whats going on in here a storm in a bottle the megastorm is pouring too much energy down here the bubble cant discharge it fast enough so some of its lashing back zapping itself redistributing charge she corrected glass is a great conductor it merely takes the excess energy it cant discharge to the surface and passes it down to the floor below the glass here captures the energy and disperses it a cycle to keep the charge spread evenly throughout the entire glass bubble rather than just the dome its that equilibrium of energy that keeps the antimatter lake stable during this storm a balance of charges what about those pockets of molten glass i dont think its molten glass at least not exactly omaha glanced questioningly in her direction what do you mean glass is always in a liquid state have you ever seen antique glass the flowing streaks that slightly distort the clarity gravity affects glass like a liquid slowly pulling it down in streams but what does that have to do with whats going on here the energy bolts arent just melting the glass theyre changing its state instantaneously breaking all bonds liquefying the glass to the point that it borders on gaseous when the energy disperses it resolidifies but just for a flash its in a fiery state between liquid and gas thats why it doesnt flow it keeps its basic shape omaha hoped this discussion was leading to some solution is there anything we can do about it coral shook her head no dr dunn im afraid were fucked pm the fieryexplosion drew painters attention to the mesa a truck parked near the sandstone prominence flipped in the air spewing flaming fuel one of the roving sand devils continued past it it left a steaming trail of blackened sand molten glass these sinuous columns of static charge were somehow discharging astronomical amounts of heat energy burning their way across the landscape painter remembered safias warning over the radio before it shorted out she had tried to warn him away he hadnt listened now he was trapped inside the tractor as it slowly spun in a vast whirlpool of churning sand for the past five minutes it had carried him along sweeping him in a wide arc slowly spinning him in place he was a planet orbiting a sun and all around death danced for every whirlwind that blew itself out with a sharp discharge of static another three took its place it was only a matter of time before one crossed his path or worse yet opened up under him as he spun he saw the other truck it was faring no better another planet smaller maybe a moon painter stared across the sands that separated them he saw one chance it was a madmans course but it was better than sitting here waiting for death to come knocking if he had to die hed rather die with his boots on he stared down at his naked form he wore only his boxers okay hed have to forgo the whole boot dream he stood up and crossed to the back hed have to travel light he took a single pistoland a knife outfitted he stepped to the back door hed have to be fast he took a moment to take several deep breaths he opened the back door the clear expanse of desert suddenly erupted yards away a devil spun up from the sand he felt the backwash of its static his hair flumed around his head crackling he hoped it didnt catch fire stumbling back he fled away from the back door time had run out he darted to the side door shoved it open and leaped hitting the ground he sank to his calves the sand was damnably loose he glanced over a shoulder the devil loomed behind the tractor crackling with energy he smelled ozone heat pulsed from the monster fleet feet little skeet it was a nursery rhyme his father had often whispered in his ear when he was caught dawdling no papano dawdling here painter hauled his feet free from the sand and raced around the front end of the tractor the whirlpool dragged at him bordering on quicksand he spotted the flatbed truck fifty yards half a football field he sprinted for it fleet feet little skeet he ran the rhyme a mantra in his head across the sand the trucks door popped open the soldier stood on the running board and pointed a rifle at him no trespassers luckily painter already had his pistol up he fired and fired there was no reason to spare the bullets he squeezed and squeezed the driver fell backward arms out the explosion behind painter shoved him forward facefirst a wave of fire seared spitting sand he leaped up and away he glanced back to see the tractor on its side on fire its tank exploded by the heat of the devil as it expanded its reach painter pounded away flaming fuel rained down all around splashing into the sand he simply ran hellbent reaching the flatbed he skipped the cab door used the drivers body as a steppingstone and scrambled into the flatbed in back the tarp was still tangled in the ropes he used his knife to slice the lashings they were taut and popped like overstretched guitar strings he kicked tarps and ropes aside he exposed what lay underneath what he had spotted when the flatbed mired one of the copter sleds this little skeeter found his wings pm safia heardthe staccato firing of a pistol painter she had been huddling just inside the stairway passage kara and lulu kept guard with her she had been pondering some way to escape the doom here she sensed an answer just beyond reach a clue she was missing letting fear frazzle through her but fear was an old companion she took deep breaths inhaling calm exhaling tension she thought about the mystery she remembered her thoughts on the way up here how the past and the present were merging in countless ways she closed her eyes she could almost feel the answer rising inside her like a bubble in water then the gunshots followed by an explosion like the one that had taken out one of captain alhaffis trucks a minute or so ago safia bolted back to the top of the mesa a fireball billowed upward shredding in the winds the tractor lay on its side oh godpainter she spotted a naked figure scrambling by the smaller truck kara joined her its crowe safia grabbed on to that hope are you sure he really needs to cut his hair the figure climbed into something in the back of the truck then safia spotted the spread of collapsible rotors she heard a distant whine the rotors churned a helicopter kara sighed that man is resourceful ill give him that safia noted a tiny whirlwind one of the untethered ones scribing through the dunes swing in a wide arc aiming for the truck and copter did painter see it pm painter layflat on his belly in the sled the controls were near his arms one for each hand he kicked up the rotor speed he had flown helicopters during special forces training but never one like this but how different could it be he yanked the right throttle nothing happened he pulled on the left still nothing okay maybe things were a bit different he pulled on both throttles and the copter lifted out of its cradle and into the air he kept the throttles pulled and shot up in a wobbly arc spun by the winds the thumpthump of the rotors matched his heart fast and furious as the copter swung he caught a glimpse of a twister on his tail it glowed and spat fire like a demon risen from hell painter played with the controls leaning right left and forward forward was good he sped away dipping too low like sliding down a snowy slope he attempted to get his nose up before he buried himself in the sand he worked the throttle rolled to the left balanced it out and finally found a way to bring the nose up now he was aiming directly for a monstrously huge whirlwind he climbed higher and to the rightand successfully managed to spin himself in place while still flying toward the large devil he felt his stomach flip he dragged the left throttle stopped the spin and just managed to miss the devil but as a parting shot the whirlwind spat an arc of static zapping him painter felt the shock from the tip of his toes to his eyebrows so did the sled all power died instruments twirled he plummeted rotors churning uselessly he switched all systems off then back on again rebooting a small whine answered the motor coughed then died the mesa lay ahead he aimed for it as best he couldwhich was at the side of its cliffs he rebooted again the motor caught this time the spinning rotors must have helped jumpstart the engine he pulled both throttles the copter climbed the cliffs rushed at him cmon he mumbled between clenched teeth as he reached the mesa he caught a glimpse of its top he willed the craft up another few inches the landing skids brushed the edge of the lip caught a bit tilting the copter on its side rotors tore into stone they shattered away the sled compartment flipped high and landed upside down atop the mesa a lucky break painter banged his head but he lived he popped the side hatch and fell out he lay on the stone panting surprised to be alive it was a good surprise safia hurried over to him kara followed staring down at him arms crossed good effort but have you ever heard of the phrase out of the frying pan into the fire he sat up what the hells happening we must get to a safe place safia said helping him stand where kara asked taking his other arm the sandstorm is tearing apart the desert and ubar is on fire below safia straightened i know where we can go firestorm december pm ubar safia stoodwith captain alhaffi at the base of the stairs she stared out at the azure maelstrom roiling over the arched room it blinded bolts of cerulean energy lanced forked and speared all across the chamber the most disturbing feature was the absolute quiet no thunder here how far to the palace she asked the captain forty yards she stared back up the staircase the rahim were down to fourteen adult women and the original seven children captain alhaffis dozen men were now eight none of them looked ready to enter ubar with its electrical wildfire but they stood ready to follow safia she faced the path they had to walk one misstep meant a fiery death are you sure about this kara asked behind her she was flanked by lulu and painter as much as i can be safia answered painter had borrowed a cloak from one of the shahran men but he was still barefoot his lips were tight far back echoing down the passage behind them the tumble of stones reached them the preparation had taken longer than safia would have liked already the upper sections of the stairway were falling apart youre putting a lot of trust in that old queen painter said she survived the cataclysm the kings line survived during the last cataclysm the royal line was protected they were the only ones how safia turned and emptied the folded cloak she held in her hand sand poured out and covered the glass in front of her it skittered down the path sand is a great insulator the royal palace of ubar is covered with sand paintings on floors walls and ceilings the mix of so much sand in the glass must ground the structure against the static bursts protecting those inside she tapped her radio like it has so far with omaha coral danny and clay painter nodded she read the respect and trust in his eyes she took strength from his solid faith in her he was a rock when she needed something to hang on to again safia turned and stared back at the long line of folk everyone carried a burden of sand they made bags out of cloaks shirtseven the children carried socks full of sand the plan was to pour a sand path from here to the palace where theyd shelter against the storm safia lifted her radio omaha here saff were setting off be careful she lowered the radio and stepped out onto the sandcovered glass she would lead them moving forward she used a boot to spread the sand as far as it would go and still leave good insulation underfoot once she reached the end painter handed her his bag of sand she turned and cast the new sand down the path extending the trail and continued on overhead the cavern roof blazed with cobalt fire she still lived it was working safia crept down the sandy path behind her a chain grew passing bagful after bagful from one hand to another watch where you step safia warned make sure sand is under you at all times dont touch the walls watch the children she poured more sand the trail snaked from the back wall winding around corners down stairs along ramps safia stared out at the palace they crept closer at a snails pace static charges lanced at them almost continuously now attracted to their movements stirring whatever electromagnetic field stabilized the place but the glass on either side always drew away the charge like a lightning rod their path remained safe safia dumped a load of sand from a cloak then heard a cry behind her sharif had slipped several yards back on one of the sandy stairs he caught his balance on a neighboring wall and used it to push up dont safia yelled it was too late like a wolf on a straggling lamb a lance of brilliance lashed out the solid wall gave way sharif fell headlong into the glass it solidified around his shoulders his body spasmed but there was no scream his face trapped in glass he died immediately the edges of his cloak smoldered children cried out and pushed their faces into their mothers cloaks barak ran up from farther back slipping past others his face a mask of pain she nodded to the women and children keep them calm safia said keep them moving she took the next bag her hands shook painter stepped next to her taking the bag let me she nodded falling back into second place kara was behind her it was an accident she said not your fault safia understood it with her head but not her heart still she did not let it paralyze her she followed painter passing another sack to him they crept onward at last they rounded the courtyard wall ahead the entry to the palace glowed omaha stood in the archway flashlight in hand i left the porch light on for you guys he waved them forward safia had to resist the urge to run forward but they were not safe yet they continued at the same steady pace rounding the iron sphere resting in its cradle finally their long trail reached the entry safia was allowed through first she stepped inside and hugged her arms around omaha collapsing against him he picked her up in his arms and carried her back to the main room she didnt object they were safe pm cassandra hadwatched the procession not moving barely breathing she knew to move meant death safia and painter had passed within a few yards of her small glass alcove painter had been a surprise how could he be here but she did not react she kept her breathing even she was a statue the many years of special forces training and field ops had taught her ways to remain still and quiet she used them all cassandra had known safia was coming she had mapped their progress moving only her eyes and had watched the very last red triangle on her tracker vanish a moment ago she was all that was left but it wasnt over cassandra had watched in amazement as safia returned to the cavern from above returning here passing so close a sand trail safia had discerned the only safe haven in the cavern the large towering building that stood fifteen yards away cassandra heard the others happy voices as they reached their sanctuary she remained perfectly still the sandy track wound only two yards from her position two large steps moving only her eyes she watched the skies she waited tensing every muscle preparing herself but she remained a statue then a bolt struck down about three yards away close enough cassandra sprang through the door trusting in the old adage lightning never strikes the same place twice she had nothing else to go on one foot touched glass only long enough to leap away her next foot landed on sand she dropped to a crouch on the path safe she took deep breaths half sobbing in relief she allowed herself this moment of weakness she would need it to steel herself for the next step she waited for her heart to stop pounding for the shakes to subside finally her body calmed she stretched her neck a cat awakening she took a deep breath then let it out now down to business she stood and took out the wireless detonator she checked to make sure it hadnt been damaged or its electronics fritzed all appeared in order she tabbed a key pressed the red button then tabbed the key again a deadmans switch rather than pressing the button to blow the chip in safias neck all she had to do was lift her finger prepared she slipped her pistol from her holster time to greet the neighbors pm seated onthe floor painter stared around the crowded room coral had already reported and debriefed him on all that had happened her theories and her concerns she now sat beside him checking her weapon across the room safia stood with her group they smiled and soft laughter floated from them they were a new family safia had a new sister in kara a mother in lulu but what about omaha he stood at her side not touching but close painter saw how safia would lean ever so slightly in the mans direction almost touching but not coral continued cleaning her gun sometimes you just have to move on before he could respond a shadow shifted on his right by the entryway he watched cassandra step into the room pistol in one hand she was calm unconcerned as if she had just come in from a stroll to the park now isnt this cozy she said her appearance startled everyone weapons were snatched cassandra didnt react she still had her pistol pointed at the ceiling instead she held out a familiar device is that any way to greet a neighbor dont shoot painter boomed already on his feet nobody shoot he even moved to stand in front of cassandra shielding her i see you recognize a deadmans switch she said behind him if i die poor dr almaaz loses her pretty little head omaha heard her words he had already shoved safia behind him what is this bitch talking about why dont you explain crowe i mean the transceiver is your design he turned to her the tracker is not the bomb what bomb omaha asked his eyes both scared and angry painter explained when cassandra had safia in her custody she implanted a small tracking device cassandra modified it with a small amount of c she holds the detonator if she lets go of the trigger it will blow why didnt you tell us before omaha said we couldve removed it do that and it blows too cassandra said unless i first deactivate it painter glared at her then back to safia id hoped to get you somewhere safe then have a surgical and demolition team remove the device his explanation did little to quell the horror in her eyes and painter knew some of it was directed at him this was his job so now that were all friends cassandra said ill ask you to throw all your weapons out into that courtyard everyone now im certain dr crowe will ensure that every weapon is accounted for one slip and i may have to lift my finger and scold someone we wouldnt want that to happen would we painter had no choice he did as cassandra instructed rifles pistols knives and two grenade launchers were piled into the courtyard as coral threw her halfassembled gun with the others she remained by the entry her eyes were on the cavern painter followed her gaze whats the matter he asked the storm its grown worse since your arrival much worse she pointed to the roof the energy is not draining fast enough its destabilizing what does that mean the storm is building into a powder keg in here she turned to him this place is going to blow pm from thesecondstory balcony of the palace safia stared with the others out at the maelstrom the cavern roof could no longer be seen the roiling clouds of static charge had begun a slow spin across the dome a vortex of static in the center a small downspout could be seen perceptibly lowering like the funnel cloud of a tornado it aimed for the antimatter lake novaks right cassandra said she was studying the phenomenon through her nightvision goggles the entire dome is filling up its the megastorm coral said it must be much stronger than the ancient storm that triggered the cataclysm two thousand years ago its overwhelming the capacity here and i cant help but think a fair amount of the lake water is probably destabilized like the contents of the iron camel what will happen safia asked coral explained have you ever seen an overloaded transformer blow it can take out an entire power pole now picture one the size of this cavern one with a concentrated antimatter core it has the capability of taking out the entire arabian peninsula the sobering thought silenced them all safia watched the vortex of energies churn the funnel in the center continued to drop slowly inexorably primitive fear laced through her so what can we do this question came from an unlikely source cassandra she pulled up her nightvision goggles we have to stop this omaha scoffed like you want to help i dont want to die im not insane just evil omaha muttered i prefer the word opportunistic she directed her attention back to coral well coral shook her head we ground it painter said if this glass bubble is the insulator for this energy then we need to find a way to shatter the bubbles underside ground the electrical storm send its energy into the earth its not a bad theory commander coral said especially if you could break the glass under the lake itself get the antimatter waters to drain into the original earthgenerated water system from whence it came not only would the energy dissipate but it would lessen the risk of an antimatter chain reaction the enriched waters would simply dilute away to the point of impotency safia felt a glimmer of hope it didnt last past corals next words its the practical application of that plan thats the big problem we dont have a bomb massive enough to blow out the bottom of the lake for the next few minutes safia listened to the discussions of possible explosive devices while knowing what lay implanted in her own neck knowing what had happened back in tel aviv back at the british museum bombs marked the turning points in her life they might as well mark her end the threat should have terrified her but she was beyond fear she closed her eyes she half noted the various ideas being bandied aloud from rocketpropelled grenades even to the bit of c in her neck theres nothing here strong enough coral said yes there is safia said opening her eyes she remembered the blast at the british museum she pointed down into the courtyard its not a camel but it may do the others stared where she pointed to the giant iron sphere resting in the glass palm we sink it into the lake safia said the worlds largest depth charge danny said but how do you know it will explode like the camel coral asked it might just fizzle like the iron maiden these iron artifacts dont all function the same way ill show you safia said she turned and led the way back down the stairs once in the main room she waved to each of the sandpainted walls opposite the entry is the first ubar a rendering of its discovery over on that far wall is the depiction of ubar above its face to the world and this wall of course is the true heart of ubar its pillared glass city she touched the painting of the palace the detail is amazing even down to the sandstone statues guarding the entrance but on this picture both statues are shown because one was used as a vessel for the first key omaha said safia nodded this depiction was done obviously before the destruction but note whats missing no iron sphere no glass palm in the center of the paintings courtyard stands the queen of ubar a place of prominence and importance x marks the spot so to speak what do you mean cassandra asked safia had to bite back a sneer her effort to save her friends to save arabia would also be saving cassandra safia continued not meeting the womans eye symmetry was important in the past balance in all things the new object was placed on a site that matches the position of the queen in the rendering a place of distinction it must be important omaha turned staring out the entry to the iron sphere even the way the palm is positioned if you straightened the wrist it would be like shes throwing the sphere toward the lake safia faced them all its the queens last key a failsafe a bomb left to destroy the lake if needed but can you be sure painter asked what does it hurt to try omaha countered either it works or it doesnt coral had wandered to the entrance if were going to try this wed better hurry safia and the others crowded forward in the center of the cavern a glowing funnel cloud twisted and writhed below it the antimatter lake had begun to churn matching the vortex on the roof what do we do first painter asked i have to place my hands on the sphere safia said activate it like all the other keys then we get the ball rolling omaha said pm omaha stoodon the sandy path out in the courtyard it had taken a minute to sweep the trail so it reached the cradled sphere safia stood before the fourfootwide globe of red iron the skies raged above safia approached the sphere she rubbed her palms then reached between the glass fingers of the sculpture omaha saw her shoulder flinch the bullet wound paining her he wanted to rush to her side pull her away but she bit her lower lip and placed both palms on the sphere as her skin touched metal a crackling blue flash arced over the irons surface safia flew back with a yelp omaha caught her in his arms and helped her gain her feet on the sand thanks sure babe he kept one arm around her and helped her back to the palace she leaned on him it felt good the grenade is set on a twominute timer painter said get to cover he had planted the explosive charge at the base of the sculpture the plan was to blast the sphere free gravity would do the rest the avenue beyond the palace flowed all the way to the lake purposeful safia had said the ball once freed was meant to roll to the lake on its own omaha helped safia back into the main room a blindingly bright flash flared behind them burning their shadows on the far wall of the main room omaha gasped fearing it was the grenade he jerked safia to the side but there was no explosion one of the static bolts coral said rubbing her eyes it struck the sphere safia and omaha swung around out in the courtyard the irons surface shimmered with blue energies they watched the glass sculpture melt slowly tilting on its own the hand spilled the ball onto the courtyard floor it bobbled then rolled toward the arched entry it passed through and continued on coral sighed beautiful omaha had never heard so much respect uttered in one word he nodded that queen would have made a great professional bowler down painter shoved them all to the side clotheslining omaha across the neck the explosion deafened glass shards spattered into the room from the courtyard outside painters grenade had gone off on schedule as the blast echoed away omaha met his eyes good job there he patted painter on the shoulder good job its still rolling danny called from above they all hurried up the stairs to the upper balcony where everyone else was gathered omaha pushed forward with safia the course of the iron sphere was easy to follow its movement drew bolts from the roof zapping it again and again its surface glowed with a cerulean aura it bounced rolled and wended its way down the royal avenue forked lightning struck and dazzledbut it kept rolling to the lake its energizing itself coral said drawing power into it becoming the depth charge danny said what if it blows up as soon as it touches the lake clay asked hanging back ready to duck into the palace at the first sign of trouble coral shook her head as long as it keeps dropping moving through the water itll only leave a trail of annihilation but the reaction will end as soon as the ball moves on but when it stops rests at the bottom danny said coral finished then the weight of all the water above it pressing on the stationary object will trigger a localized chain reaction enough to light the proverbial fuse on our depth charge then boom danny said boom indeed coral concurred all eyes remained on the glowing ball all eyes saw it reach the halfway point roll along a ramp hit a tumbled pile of debris from cassandras bombardment and stop shit danny mumbled shit indeed coral concurred pm safia stoodwith the others on the balcony as dismayed as the rest arguments raged around her what about using one of the rpgs cassandra asked staring through her nightvision goggles shoot a grenade at an energized antimatter bomb omaha said yeah lets do that and if you miss the debris pile painter said youll bring down another wall and block the road even more right now its only hung up if it could be rolled aside a couple of feet cassandra sighed safia noted the womans finger still pressed the transmitter protecting it from anyones reach cassandra could definitely focus with all that was going on all the danger she was not letting go of her trump card keeping it in play clearly intending to use it if everything worked out she was a stubborn fighter then again so was safia clay held his arms crossed over his chest what we need is someone to go out and give it a good push feel free to try cassandra said with clear disdain the first sign of movement and youll be bathing in molten glass coral stirred previously lost in deep thought of course its movement that draws the bolts like the rolling ball or my men cassandra added the bolts must be attracted to shifts in some electromagnetic field a giant motiondetecting field coral stared down but what if someone could move through the field unseen how painter asked coral glanced to the hodja and the other rahim they can be unseen when they want to be but thats not physical painter said its some way they affect the viewers mind clouding perception yes but how do they do that no one answered coral stared around then straightened oh i never told you you know painter said coral nodded and glanced at safia then away i studied their blood safia remembered coral had been about to mention something about that when cassandras forces had attacked what was this about coral pointed toward the cavern like the lake the water in the rahims red blood cellsall their cells and fluids i imagineis full of buckyballs they have antimatter in them omaha asked no of course not its just that their fluids have the capability of maintaining water in buckyball configurations i wager the ability comes from some mutation in their mitochondrial dna dread grew in safias chest what painter touched her elbow a little slower coral sighed commander remember the briefing on the tunguska explosion in russia mutations arose in flora and fauna of the area the indigenous evenk tribe developed genetic abnormalities in their blood specifically their rh factors all caused by gamma radiation from antimatter annihilation she waved an arm out toward the storm raging the same here for who knows how many generations the population residing here has been exposed to gamma radiation then a pure bit of chance happened some woman developed a mutationnot in her own dna but the dna in her cellular mitochondria mitochondria safia asked trying to remember her basic biology they are the small organelles inside all cells floating in the cytoplasm little engines that produce cellular energy theyre a cells batteries to use a crude analogy but they have their own dna independent of a persons genetic code it is believed that mitochondria were once some type of bacteria that absorbed into mammalian cells during evolution the little bit of dna is left over from the mitochondrias former independent life and as mitochondria are found only in the cytoplasm of cells it is the mitochondria of a mothers egg that becomes the mitochondria of the child thats why the ability passes only through the queens line coral swept a hand over the rahim and it is these mitochondria that mutated from the gamma radiation omaha asked yes a minor mutation the mitochondria still produce energy for the cell but it also produces a little spark to actively maintain buckyball configuration giving it a little juice i wager this effect has something to do with the energy fields in this chamber the mitochondria are attuned to it aligning the charge of a buckyball to match the energy here and these charged buckyballs give these women some mental powers painter asked incredulous the brain is ninety percent water coral said charge that system up with buckyballs and anything could happen weve seen the womens ability to affect magnetic fields this transmission of magnetic force directed by human will and thought seems to be able to affect the waters in the brains of lower creatures and somewhat upon us affecting our will and perception corals eyes glanced to the rahim and if focused inward the magnetic force can stop meiosis in their own eggs producing a selffertilized egg asexual reproduction parthenogenesis safia whispered okay painter said even if i could accept all that how does any of this get us out of this mess havent you been listening coral asked glancing over her shoulder to the vortex of storm above and now stirring the lake they were running out of time minutes only if one of the rahim concentrates she can attune herself to this energy alter her magnetic force to match the electromagnetic detecting field they should be able to walk through safely how do they do that by willing themselves invisible who would be willing to take that chance omaha asked the hodja stepped forward i will i sense the truth in her words coral took a deep breath licked her lips and spoke im afraid youre too weak and i dont mean physicallyat least not exactly lulu frowned coral explained with the storm raging the forces out there are intense it will take more than experience it will take someone extremely rich in buckyballs turning corals eyes met safias as you know i tested several of the rahim including the elder here they only have a tenth of the buckyballs found in your cells safia frowned how is that possible im only half rahim but the right half your mother was rahim it was her mitochondria that were passed to your cells and there is a condition in nature called hybrid vigor where the crossing of two different lines produces stronger offspring than crossing the same line over and over again danny nodded to the side mutts are basically healthier than purebreds youre new blood coral concluded and the mitochondria like it omaha stepped to safias side you want her to walk to the trapped sphere through that electrical storm coral nodded i believe shes the only one who could make it screw that omaha said safia squeezed his elbow ill do it pm omaha watchedsafia standing out on the sandy path in the courtyard she had refused to let him come she was alone with the hodja so he waited in the entryway painter stood vigil with him the man looked none too pleased with safias choice either in this the two men were united but this choice was safias her argument was simple and irrefutable either it works or we all die anyway so the men waited safia listened it is not hard the hodja said to become invisible is not a concentration of will it is the letting go of will safia frowned but the hodja s words matched corals the mitochondria produced charged buckyballs aligned to the energy signature in the room all she had to do was let them settle into their natural alignment the hodja held out a hand first youll need to strip out of your clothes safia glanced sharply at her clothes affect our ability to turn invisible if that woman scientist was right with all that mumbo jumbo clothes might interfere with the field we generate over our bodies better safe than sorry safia shed her cloak kicked her boots off and shimmied out of blouse and pants in her bra and panties she turned to lulu lycra and silk im keeping them on she shrugged now relax yourself find a place of comfort and peace safia took deep breaths after years of panic attacks she had learned methods for centering herself but it seemed too small a pittance against the pressure around her you must have faith the hodja said in yourself in your blood safia inhaled deeply she glanced back to the palace to omaha and painter in the mens eyes she saw their need to help her but this was her path to walk alone she knew this in places beyond where her heart beat she turned forward resolved but scared so much blood had been shed in the past in tel avivat the museumon the long road here she had brought all of these folks here she could no longer hide she had to walk this path safia closed her eyes and let all doubt flow from her this was her path she evened her breathing releasing control to a more natural rhythm very good child now take my hand safia reached over and gripped the old womans palm gratefully surprised at the strength there she continued to relax fingers squeezed reassuring her she recognized the touch from long ago it was her mothers hand warmth flowed from this connection it swelled through her step forward the hodja whispered trust me it was her mothers voice calm reassuring firm safia obeyed bare feet moved from sand to glass one foot then the other she moved off the path her arm behind her holding her mothers hand open your eyes she did breathing evenly keeping the warmth of maternal love deep inside her but eventually one had to let go she slipped her fingers free and took another step the warmth stayed with her her mother was gone but her love lived on in her in her blood in her heart she walked on as the storm raged in flame and glass at peace omaha was on his knees he didnt even know when he fell he watched safia walk away shimmering still present but ethereal as she brushed through the shadow under the courtyard archway she completely vanished for a moment he held his breath then beyond the palace grounds she reappeared a wisp moving steadily downward limned in storm light tears brimmed in his eyes her face caught in silhouette was so contented if given the chance he would spend the rest of his life making sure she never lost that look painter shifted moving back as silent as a tomb painter climbed the stairs to the second level leaving omaha alone he crossed to where the entire group gathered all eyes watched safias progress down through the lower city coral glanced to him her expression worried and with good reason the swirling vortex of charges neared the lakes surface below it the lake continued its own whirling churn and in the center lit by the fires above a water spout was rising upward a reverse whirlpool the energies above and the antimatter below were stretching to join if they touched it was the end of everything themselves arabia possibly the world painter focused down upon the ghost of a woman moving sedately along the stormlit streets as if she had all the time in the world she vanished completely when in shadows he willed her to be safe but also to move faster his gaze fluttered between storm and woman omaha appeared from below hurrying to join them having lost sight of safia from his post below his eyes glistened full of hope terror and as much as painter didnt want to see it love painter swung his attention back to the cavern safia was almost to the sphere cmon omaha moaned it was an emotion shared by all safia gently walked down the stairs she had to step with care the passage of the iron sphere had crushed its way through loose glass littered the steps cuts pierced her heel and toes she ignored the pain keeping calm breathing through it ahead the iron sphere appeared its surface glowed with an azure blue aura she stepped up and studied the obstruction a fallen section of wall the ball had to be rolled two feet to the left and it would continue its plummet she glanced the rest of the way down it was a clear shot to the lake there were no other tumbles to block the spheres path a second time all she had to do was shift it over though heavy it was a perfect sphere one good shove and it would roll clear she moved next to it set her legs raised her palms took another cleansing breath and shoved the electrical shock from the charged iron shot into her arcing over her body and out her toes she spasmed neck thrown back bones on fire her momentum and convulsive jerk shoved the sphere away rolling it free but as her body broke contact a final crack of energy snapped her like a whip she was flung backward hard her head hit the wall behind her the world went dark and she fell into nothingness safia omaha could not breathe he had seen the brilliant arc of energy and watched her be tossed aside like a rag doll she landed in crumpled pile no longer ethereal grounded she was not moving unconscious electrocuted or dead oh god he spun around painter grabbed his arm where the hell do you think youre going i have to get to her fingers tightened on his arm the storm will kill you within two steps kara joined him omahapainters right cassandra stood by the rail watching everything through her damned scopes as long as she doesnt move she shouldnt attract the bolts im not sure thats a great place to be when the sphere hits the lake though out in the open like that omaha saw that the sphere was almost to the lake beyond the titanic forces swirled an hourglass hung in the center of the vast cavern a tornado of charge coming down to meet a rising spout of water and the ball rolled toward it lightning bolts chased the sphere stabbing at it i have to try omaha said and ripped away he sprinted down the stairs painter followed at his heels goddamnit omaha dont throw your life away omaha landed its my life he slid to the entryway dropping onto his rear skidding he yanked off his boots his left ankle sprained protested the rough treatment painter frowned at his actions its not just your life safia loves you if you truly care about her dont do this omaha pulled off his socks im not throwing my life away he crawled on his knees to the entryway and scooped handfuls of sand from the path and poured them into his socks what are you doing making sand shoes omaha leaned back and shoved his feet into the socks squeezing them inside and massaging the sand so it covered the bottoms of his feet painter stared at his actions why didnt yousafia wouldntve had to i just thought of it necessity is the mother of goddamn invention im going with you no time omaha pointed to painters bare feet no socks he sprinted away skidding and skating across the sandy path he reached the clean glass and kept running he wasnt as confident of his plan as he had portrayed to painter bolts dazzled around him panic fueled run sand hurt his toes his ankle flamed with every step but he kept running cassandra had to give these folks some credit they did have balls of steel she tracked omahas mad flight through the streets had a man ever loved her with so much heart she noted painters return but did not look his way would i have let him cassandra watched the spheres last few bounces it now rolled toward the lake aglow with cobalt energies she had a job to finish here she considered all her options weighed the possibilities if they survived the next minute she kept a finger pressed to the button she saw painter staring at safia below as omaha reached her she and painter had both lost out off by the shore the sphere took a final hop bounced up and landed in the water with a splash omaha reached safia she lay unmoving bolts rained fire all around him his eyes were only on her her chest rose and fell alive off in the direction of the lake a huge splash sounded like a belly flop the depth charge had been dropped no time they needed shelter he scooped safia in his arms and swung around he had to keep her from touching any surfaces carrying her prone form her head resting on his shoulder he stepped toward the opening of an intact home and ducked inside it might not protect him from the deadly static bolts but he had no idea what would happen when the sphere reached the lake a roof over his head seemed like a good idea the motion stirred safia she moaned omaha im here baby he crouched down cradling her on his knees balanced on his sand shoes im here as omaha and safia vanished into a building painter watched the flume of water geyser up after the iron sphere hit the water it was as if the ball had been dropped from the empire state building it shot toward the roof cascading outward water droplets igniting when they brushed the dazzle of the storm raining back down as liquid fire antimatter annihilation the whirl in the lake eddied and shook the waterspout jiggled but overhead the vortex of static charge continued its deadly descent painter concentrated on the lake already the whirlpool settled again churning away with tidal forces nothing happened fire from the plume struck the lake ignited pools which quickly extinguished reestablishing its equilibrium state nature loves balance the ball must still be rolling coral said seeking the lowest point in the lake bottom the deeper the water the better the heightened pressure will help trigger the localized chain reaction and direct its force downward painter turned to her does your mind ever stop calculating she shrugged no why danny stood at her side and if the sphere reaches the lowest point then thats also the best place to crack the glass over any earthgenerated cistern draining the lake water away painter shook his head those two were peas in a pod cassandra straightened next to kara the five of them were the last ones still on the balcony lulu had led the rahim to the back rooms below captain alhaffi and barak led the handful of shahra somethings happening cassandra said out on the lake a patch of black water glowed a ruddy crimson it was not a reflection the glow came from deep below a fire under the lake in just the half second it took to look the crimson blasted out in all directions a deep sonorous whump sounded the entire lake lifted a few feet and dropped ripples spread outward from the lakes center the growing waterspout collapsed get below painter yelled too late a force neither wind nor concussion blasted outward flattening the lake sweeping in all directions pushing before it a wall of superheated air it struck painter half around the corner caught a glancing shove to the shoulder he was ripped away tossed bodily across the room lifted on wings of fire others had taken the force fully and were driven straight back in a tangle they hit the far wall painter kept his eyes squeezed shut his lungs seared with the one breath he had taken then it ended the heat vanished painter gained his feet shelter he squeaked out waving in vain the quake came next no warning except for an earsplitting clap deafening as if the earth were being cracked in half then the palace jumped several feet up then down again throwing them all flat the rattling worsened the tower shook jolted to one side then the other glass shattered an upper story of the tower went crashing down pillars broke and toppled smashing into city or lake all the while painter kept flat a loud splintery pop exploded by his ear he turned his head and saw the entire balcony beyond the archway shear and tilt away a small limb waved it was cassandra she had not been blown through the doorway like the rest of them but knocked against the palaces outer wall she fell with the balcony in her hand she still held the detonator painter scrambled toward her reaching the edge he searched below he spotted cassandra sprawled in the tumble of broken glass her fall had not been far she lay on her back clutching the detonator to her chest i still have it she hollered hoarsely to him but he didnt know if it was in threat or reassurance she gained her feet hang on he said im coming down dont a bolt of charge stabbed out as she stood striking at her toes the glass melted underfoot she dropped into the pool thighdeep before the glass solidified under her she didnt scream though her entire body wrenched with pain her cloak caught on fire she still held the detonator in a fist hugged to her neck a gasp finally escaped her painter he spotted a patch of sand in the courtyard below he leaped and landed hard wrong ankle turning skidding it was nothing he stood and kicked sand a meager path to reach her side he dropped next to her knees in sand he could smell her flesh burning cassandraohmygod she held out the transmitter every line on her face agonized i cant hold squeeze he grabbed her fist covering it with his own she relaxed her own grip trusting him to keep her finger pressed now she fell against him her pants smoldering blood poured where charred skin met glass too red arterial why he asked she kept her eyes closed only shook her head owe you what she opened her eyes met his her lips moved a whisper i wish you couldve saved me he knew she didnt mean a moment agobut back when they were partners her eyes closed her head fell to his shoulder he held her then she was gone safia awoke in omahas arms she smelled the sweat on his neck felt the tremble in his arms he clutched tightly to her he was crouched down balanced on the balls of his feet cradling her in his lap how was omaha here where was here memory snapped back the spherethe lake she struggled to get free her movement startled omaha he tipped caught himself with a hand then yanked his arm back saff stay still what happened his face was strained nothing much but lets see if you saved arabia he hauled her up still carrying her and ducked out the door safia recognized the place where the rolling sphere had jammed they both looked to the lake its surface still swirled eddying the skies overhead blazed and crackled safia felt her heart sink nothings changed hon you slept through a whirlwind and a major quake as if on cue another aftershock rattled around them omaha took a step back but it ended he returned to studying the lake look at the shoreline she turned her head the waters edge had receded about twenty yards leaving a bathtub ring around the lake the water levels dropping he hugged her tighter you did it the lake must be draining into one of those subterranean cisterns coral was yammering about safia stared back up at the static storm on the roof it too was slowly subsiding grounding out she glanced across the spread of the darkening city both upper and lower so much destruction but there was hope no bolts she said i think the firestorm is over im not taking any chances cmon he hiked her higher in his arms and marched up the slope toward the palace she didnt protest but she quickly noted omaha wincing with every step whats wrong she asked arms hugged around his neck nothing just some sand in my shoes painter saw them approach safia was riding piggyback on omaha painter called to them as they reached the courtyard omaha the electrical discharging is over he said you can put safia down omaha marched past him only over the threshold he never made it shahra and rahim all gathered around the pair in the courtyard congratulating and thanking danny hugged his brother he must have said something about cassandra because omaha glanced to the body painter had covered it with a cloak he had already deactivated the detonator and switched off the transceiver safia was safe he studied the group besides plenty of bruises scrapes and burns they had all weathered the firestorm fine coral straightened she held one of the launchers and placed a belt buckle against its side it stuck she caught him staring magnetized she said tossing it aside some type of magnetic pulse intriguing before he could respond another aftershock rocked the place strong enough to shatter away another pillar weakened by the original quake it fell across the city with a resounding crash that sobered everyone up to the dangers still here they were not safe to emphasize this fact a deep rumble rose from below trembling the glass underfoot a low sound accompanied it a subway train passing underground no one moved everyone held their breath then it came a whooshing geyser erupted from the lake fountaining upward three stories high as thick around as a twohundredyearold redwood prior to this moment the lake had drained to a small pool a quarter of its original size monstrous cracks skittered along its basin like the inside of a broken eggshell now water spewed back out again they all gaped the aftershocks must have ruptured into the original earthgenerated springs danny said one of the global aquifers the lake quickly began to refill this place is going to flood painter said we need to get out of here from fire to water omaha grumbled this just gets better and better safia helped gather the children they hurriedly fled from the palace the younger shahra men helped the older rahim women by the time they reached the foot of the stairs the lake had already climbed over its original banks drenching into the lower city and still the geyser continued to spray flashlights bobbling the strongest men pushed ahead boulders and tumbled piles of rocks blocked the passage in places they hauled and burrowed a path through them the rest of the group waited following as best they could climbing as quickly as possible crawling over obstructions the stronger helping the weaker then a shout from above a cry of joy hurreeya it was a cheer safia was relieved to hear freedom the group fled up the stairs painter waited at the top he helped pull her through and out he pointed an arm and reached to kara behind her safia barely recognized the mesa now it was a tumbled pile of rubble she glanced around the winds blew hard but the storm was gone its energy sucked and damped into the firestorm below overhead a full moon shone casting the world in silver captain alhaffi waved a flashlight at her motioning to a path down through the jumble making room for the others the exodus continued off the mount the group marched from the rocks and into the sands it was uphill the prior whirlpool in the sand had worn a declivity miles across they passed the charred husks of the tractor and trucks the landscape was scribed with swatches of molten sand still steaming in the night air painter darted away to the overturned tractor he climbed inside disappeared for a bit then came back out he carried a laptop in his hand it looked broken the case scorched safia raised an eyebrow at his salvaging but he never explained they continued into the desert behind them water now fountained from the ruins of the mesa the declivity behind slowly filled with water safia walked with omaha his hand in hers people spoke in low whispers safia spotted painter hiking alone give me a second safia said squeezing omahas hand and letting go she crossed over to painter matching his stride he glanced at her eyes questioning surprised painter ii wanted to thank you he smiled a soft shift of his lips you owe me no thanks its my job she strode with him knowing he was concealing a well of deeper emotion it brimmed in his eyes the way he seemed unable to meet hers she glanced at omaha then back at painter iwe he sighed safia i get it but he faced her his blue eyes raw but certain i get it i do he nodded back to omaha and hes a good man she had a thousand things she wanted to say go he murmured with that soft pained smile with no words that could truly comfort she drifted back to omaha what was that all about he asked attempting to sound casual but failing miserably she took his hand again saying goodbye the group climbed to the crest of the sandy declivity a full lake now grew behind them the crumbled mesa almost flooded over do we need to worry about all that water having antimatter in it danny asked as they paused at the top of the crest coral shook her head the antimatterbuckyball complexes are heavier than ordinary water as the lake drained into the massive spring here the buckyballs should have sunk away over time theyll dilute through the vast subterranean aquifer system and slowly annihilate away no harm done so its all gone omaha said like our powers lulu added standing between safia and kara what do you mean safia asked startled the blessings are gone no grief only simple acceptance are you sure lulu nodded it has happened before to others as i told you it is a fragile gift easily damaged something happened during the quake i felt it a rush of wind through my body nods from the other rahim safia had been unconscious at the time the magnetic pulse coral said overhearing them such an intense force would have the ability to destabilize the buckyballs collapse them coral nodded to lulu when one of the rahim loses their gifts does it ever come back the hodja shook her head interesting coral said for the mitochondria to propagate buckyballs in cells it must need a few buckyballs as patterns seeds like those found in the original fertilized egg but wipe them all out and the mitochondria alone cant generate them anew so the powers are truly gone safia said dismayed she looked at her palms remembering the warmth and peace gone the hodja took her hand and squeezed safia sensed the long stretch of time from the scared little girl lost in the desert seeking shelter among the stones to the woman standing here now no maybe the magic wasnt completely gone the warmth and peace she had experienced before had nothing to do with gifts or blessings it was this human touch the warmth of family the peace of self and certainty that was blessing enough for anyone the hodja touched the ruby teardrop by her left eye she spoke softly we rahim call this sorrow we wear it to represent the last tear shed by the queen as she left ubar shed for the dead for herself for those who would follow and carry her burden lulu dropped her finger we rename it this night under the moon simply farah safia translated joy a nod the first tear shed in happiness for our new life our burden is finally lifted we can leave the shadows and walk again in full sunlight our time of hiding is over a trace of dismay must have persisted in safias expression the hodja reached and gently turned safia around remember child life is not a straight line it cycles the desert takes but it gives back she freed her hand and motioned to the new lake swelling behind them ubar is gone but eden has returned safia gazed across the moonlit waters she pictured the arabia lost to the past before ubar before the meteor strike a land of vast savannahs verdant forests meandering rivers and plentiful life she watched the flow of water across the parched sands of her home the past and present overlapping could it be possible the garden of edenreborn from behind omaha settled against her arms reaching around welcome home he whispered in her ear epilogue april pm darpa headquarters arlington virginia paintercrowestood outside the office doors he watched the custodian unscrew the nameplate it had been there since the inception of sigma force mixed feelings warred in him pride and satisfaction certainly but also anger and a little shame he had not wanted to gain this position under these awful circumstances the nameplate fell off the door director sean mcknight the former leader of sigma it was tossed in the garbage the custodian grabbed the new blackandsilver plate from the secretarys desk he pressed it to the door and used an electric screwdriver to affix it in place he stepped back hows that the man asked tipping back his cap he nodded staring at the plate director painter crowe the leader of sigma forces next generation he was due to be sworn in and take his oath in half an hour how could he sit behind that desk but it was his duty presidential directive after all that had happened in oman darpa had been shaken from top to bottom the leader of the guild had been a member of their own organization painter had brought both his suspicions and proof out of oman the experts here were able to recover the data from the hard drive of cassandras laptop it left a trail confirming painters claim the minister was exposed his plan to corrupt sigma stopped he unfortunately swallowed his own pistol before he could be taken into custody it was surely a blow to the guild but they were like the mythic hydra cut off one head and another would eventually arise painter would be ready a scuff of shoe drew his attention around painter smiled broadly reaching out a hand what are you doing down here sir sean mcknight took his hand old habits die hard i just wanted to make sure youre settled in here fine sir he nodded clapped painter on the shoulder im leaving sigma in good hands thank you sir sean stepped forward noted his old nameplate in the trash and bent to retrieve it he picked it up and tucked it inside his jacket painters face burned with shame but sean merely smiled and patted his jacket for old times sake he strode away ill see you at the swearingin ceremony they would both be taking their oaths today as painter was filling seans position sean would be filling the vacancy in the directorship left behind by vice admiral tony the tiger rector the minister the bastard was so vain as to use a code name derived from his own last name rector meaning a member of the clergy in oman painter had almost pegged sean as the traitor but when painter had heard cassandra mention the minister he had realized his mistake two men sent him on this mission sean mcknight and admiral tony rector naturally sean would have passed painters intelligence to rector his boss but it was rector who had leaked it to cassandra the laptops data confirmed the connection rector had been attempting to usurp sigma for himself cassandra was his first mole even back at foxwoods she had been ordered to orchestrate and facilitate the passing of military secrets to the chinese through xin zhang the purpose was to embarrass sigmas leadership this failure had been intended as a crowbar to pry sean mcknight out of office so rector could place someone loyal to the guild in charge but now it was over he stared at the closed door it was a new chapter of his life he thought back to the long road that had led him here the letter was still in his jacket pocket standing now he took it out he fingered its sharp edges ran a thumb over the oatmeal envelope his name was neatly embossed on the front he had received it last week if he wasnt brave enough to face this hed never get past the door here standing still he sliced open the seal and pulled out the contents translucent vellum textured cotton card stock handdeckled edge nice a slip of paper fell out he caught it and flipped it over be there kara with a slight shake of his head and a small smile he opened the invitation and read through it a june wedding to be held on the banks of lake eden the new inland freshwater lake of oman drs omaha dunn and safia almaaz he sighed it hadnt hurt as much as hed expected he thought about all the others who had brought him to this door coral was already on another assignment in india danny and clay the best of buddies were on a dig togetherin india the choice of dig sites had to be dannys idea the shahra and rahim had united their clans to much celebration in oman and a new shabab oman was being built kara was overseeing the ships construction while financing the repairs to the british museum he had read in people magazine that she was involved with a young doctor someone she met while in rehab he glanced back to karas note be there maybe he could but first he had to get through this door painter strode up grabbed the handle took a deep breath and pushed on to the next big adventure authors note as ive done previously i thought i would share a few of the facts and fictions that composed this book i hope that by doing so i might interest a few folks in exploring some of the topics and places in more detail first the whole concept of antimatter is it the stuff of science fiction not any longer cern laboratories in switzerland has in fact produced antimatter particles and has been able to hold them stable for short periods of time nasa and the fermi national laboratories have also explored the development of antimatter engines including the development of the electromagnetic penning traps for storing and transporting antimatter as to antimatter meteors they have been postulated to exist in space but their existence remains theoretical the theory that the tunguska explosion in russia was due to a small antimatter meteor is one of many postulated explanations however the described effectsthe unusual nature of the blast the em pulse the mutations in flora and faunaare factual regarding subjects related to water all the chemistries described in the book are based on facts including the weird conformation of water into buckyballs the topic of magmatic or earthgenerated water is also based on the work of geologist stephen reiss among many others moving to arabia the geology of the region is unique twenty thousand years ago the deserts of oman were indeed once verdant savannahs full of rivers lakes and streams wildlife was abundant and neolithic hunters roamed the lands this desertification of the region has indeed been attributed to a natural condition called orbital forcing or milankovitch forcing basically its a wobble in the earths rotation that occurs at periodic intervals most of the archaeological and historical details of oman are real including the tomb of nabi imran in salalah the tomb of ayoub job in the mountains and of course the ruins of ubar at shisur photos of all these places will be linked on my web site wwwjamesrollinscom for the curious or armchair traveler also to read more about the discovery of ubar i highly recommend the road to ubar by nicolas clapp on to some minor miscellaneous details first the reclusive shahra tribespeople do exist in the dhofar mountains and claim heritage to the kings of ubar they still speak a dialect considered to be the oldest in arabia the omani flagship the shabab oman is an actual ship sorry for blowing it up and speaking of blowing things up the iron camel that exploded at the beginning of the novel still resides somewhere at the british museum safe and soundat least for now acknowledgments iimposeon too many people first carolyn mccray must be acknowledged and worshiped
