john lescroart son of holmes the first book in the auguste lupa series for lisa preface all the events in this book are true despite the disclaimer which you have just read if you read a book from cover to cover a certain concession has been made so that living persons involved may not be subjected to inconvenience scrutiny or unwanted harassment nevertheless no names have been changed no places altered the concession has been the disclaimer which will convince most of the public that even this preface is fiction though this is not the case prologue the martha hudson dinner had been set for the sixth of january to followers of the master sherlock holmes this date is as important a day as the year offers for on january holmess birthday his followers from all corners of the globe gather to celebrate his genius on this date in i was invited to the hudson dinner in arlington massachusetts at the time i was living in rather cramped quarters in cambridge and a free dinner meant much more to me than intellectual stimulation i hadnt read many detective stories and knew little about them however id naturally heard about holmes and thought the night might prove interesting it was bitter cold and snowingthe wet slushy snow of the citywhen i left my apartment wrapped in an old army coat the suit i had borrowed for the affair was illfitting and i waited in great discomfort for the bus out of harvard square the ride to arlington took nearly fortyfive minutes and i kept asking myself as i shivered if all this was worth a free meal for the past several months i had been trying and failing to make my living as a songwriter in the boston area i had finally taken a clerical job to pay the bills but after less than a month had given that up i turned to giving piano lessons and within a few weeks had several pupils their combined fees totaling about sixty dollars per week i met mr kevin james in november during one of my pupils recitals hed been dragged along by the childs mother together with a host of other poor souls and had stood silently near the back door as soon as the recital began he slipped out and i joined him enjoying yourself i asked he leaned languidly against the doorpost you go to these affairs often naturally im the instructor how do you stand it i shrugged comes with the job normally they serve punch later i tapped the pocket of my wellworn coat punch with a punch he grinned dont mind if i do we became friends and he had me to his house for dinner two or three times one night wed been speaking of detective stories and he asked me to join him at the martha hudson dinner i was happy to accept the dinner was held at a rambling structure in arlington heights known for some obscure reason as the ranch the crowd was not exactly what i had expected consisting mostly of people my own age they all appeared rather more welltodo than i however which was not surprising as drinks were served we all congregated in the large drawing room the principal furnishings of which were the bookshelves that lined three of the walls the huge oil portrait of i later learned the master and a long table upon which had been set bound copies of some reference works a violin a pipe and a cap our host mr hugo arrowroot proposed a toast to martha hudson then to holmes after which things assumed a more informal air we ate a fine dinner of which coq au vin was the main course and over brandy fell into a heated discussion concerning the actual existence of fictional characters it all began i imagine said kevin with dante when he included in his fictional divine comedy portraits of his enemies i would suppose its even an older practice than that much older offered another of the guests a hirsute harvard student all the greek playwrights did it in their comedies aristophanes got in a lot of trouble because of it not surprising kevin continued and were all familiar with historical works that are finally more fictitious than the most imaginative novel several students chuckled kevin was smoking a briar sitting on the edge of the table fingering the open pages of one of the reference works but consider this angle suppose there was a man whose life was as interesting as could be hoped and he had a companion who was given to writing could that companion refrain from biography a boswell to johnson relationship i doubt it but again suppose that the principal involved eschewed this kind of aggrandizing publicity for any number of reasons and forbade his companion to publish what could they do one solution would be to publish the biography as a fictional account using fictional names but actual events i contend that in this theory lies the root of truth in our more celebrated detective heroes he paused and relit his pipe youre not saying that you think holmes actually existed i said precisely john precisely arrowroot spoke up its not a new theory at all as far back as readers were proposing it holmes was still alive at that time remember but a man of his supposed stature i protested i should think that even fictionalized hed be immediately recognizable to the public james bond isnt kevin said james bond come on they shrugged at one another its been established that hes alive and working right now of course though it hurts to admit it fleming was better at peripherals than conan doyle peripherals i asked you know names of minor characters addresses that sort of thing fleming never used real names or addresses at least so far as we know and while of course holmes was not named holmes and didnt live at b baker street actually we think he lived in bond street near selfridgesconan doyle couldnt help but leave a few characters untouched he was probably leaving us clues he had such a fine sense of play but hugo here is really the expert he turned to arrowroot perhaps youd like to take it from here all right he said but im sure wed all be more comfortable sitting down we went out to the hall and brought in more chairs the novices among us of whom there were about five including myself joked about this preposterous theory when wed gotten arranged and the brandy had been passed again arrowroot from a large chair near the fireplace began the characters that conan doyleor should i say watsonleft intact for us were martha hudson and irene adler youre all familiar with martha hudson at least you should be after this evening she worked for the man who was holmes until he died in sussex downs after which she came back to london and worked for lord peter thatcher of the bank of london until she never divulged holmess true identity except of course to thatcher as a reference in all probability thatcher himself knew long before in any event when thatcher died in the bombings of london the secret of holmess identity was lost forever since mrs hudson died shortly after she began her retirement and certainly conan doyle never told there was also as ive said irene adler the only woman according to holmes she was indeed a famous continental singer in the late s who disappeared between the years and and mark this those are the very years that holmes disappeared after following moriarty to the reichenbach falls he paused for a moment ive read somewhere ventured another guest that letters addressed to b baker street get answered though kevin snickered poppycock a bank clerk answers those letters theyre not even worth considering kevins right arrowroot continued those public incidentals mean nothing the man who was holmes would have never allowed use of so blatant a giveaway he might just as well have let conan doyle use his proper name as his proper address no he saw conan doyles clues and obviously enjoyed them as he tolerated them so the path to the truth follows these clues not the obvious fictions of names and addresses and there are a few others mycroft for example we all looked questioningly at him mycroft holmes sherlocks brother the most brilliant man in england his last name was not holmes of course but we believe his first name was actually mycroft he ran the british government singlehandedly especially during world war i as head of the secret service among other things he was known as m a title which im sure is familiar to all of you his initial became the title for the head of british intelligence that by the way is perhaps flemings only slip in the matter of peripherals we also believe that holmess code name during world war i was actually altamont that he raised bees injected himself with cocaine smoked a pipe and played the violin what we dont believe is that he actually wrote down a few of his own adventuresthat again was conan doyle with his sense of play in all you seehe spread his hands out before himthere is quite a good case but nothing really conclusive i said ever the cynic kevin smiled well no nothing really finally conclusive no sworn affidavit but there is one other major bit of evidence that hugo has overlooked he looked to arrowroot the articles our host chuckled oh yes of course he looked at his guests if you read the holmes stories you will note from time to time that watson talks of articleslittle monographs he calls themthat holmes has written about any number of subjects ranging from beekeeping to medicine to musical criticism probably the most famous is his treatise on tobaccos and their ashes all of these articles appeared in periodicals of the times and all anonymously so nothing conclusive but it is an interesting array of facts isnt it he stood up i invite you all to look through the reference books i have here and please help yourselves to the brandy everyone stood up and gravitated toward the center table general murmuring once again filled the room after a few moments i found myself again with kevin very interesting theory i said you seemed a bit skeptical he answered lightly but it does sound strange on the first hearing especially if as youve said youve never read conan doyle is holmes really that good he smiled he is the masterof deduction of disguise of detection i thought for a moment presumably such a mana man skilled in the art of detectionwould have no trouble escaping detection himself quite so kevin said which is why those who have sought to authenticate the holmes legend have had such a time of it i finished my drink and looked at my watch quarter past eleven and i had students in the morning i asked kevin if he were going home by way of cambridge and would he mind giving a skeptical friend a lift we said our goodbyes and thanked arrowroot then stepped out into the bitter boston night i didnt have occasion to think again of that night until nearly five months later on january i received the happy news that four of my songs had been accepted for a television premiere and with the arrival of a royalty advance i found myself at least by my earlier standards a rich man accordingly i bid a hasty farewell to my students and to the boston winter and booked passage on a steamer to morocco where i passed the winter and early spring by midapril i was anxious to get back to writing yet in no particular hurry to return to the us one of my songs was having some popular success and my agent had written several times asking me to send him a tape as soon as possible during the three months in morocco i had had a fine time but hadnt written a note so i decided to settle somewhere for the summer and to devote the time to work on april i flew from casablanca to lyon france where a woman i knew had been spending the winter after looking for several days we came across an ad in the international herald tribune that looked ideal a summer home surrounded by oaks and vineyards with a brook and arbor near valence which is about halfway between lyon and marseilles i took the train the next day and walked out to the address a little more than a mile from town it was an old white adobe house not too large and extremely well kept the owner was a madame giraudneuilly a woman nearing seventy whose family she said had lived in the house for nearly a century we spent the afternoon talking and drinking beer i found her delightful every one of my friends had warned me to beware of the frenchthat they were a haughty lot supercilious and unfriendly but if madame giraudneuilly were any example my friends had been wrong i spoke french passably well and that certainly didnt hurt our relationship at about her husband jacques neuilly came home and they invited me to stay for dinner he showed me the wine cellar which they hadnt used since le père had died in the s saying i was welcome to use it for storage if i cared to clean it up we worked out the details after dinner and by the time i returned to lyon the next day i had a house ten days later i moved in since the house was furnished getting settled took no time at all i spent the first month working the kinks out of my piano playing and writing daily i took the five songs with which id been happiest taped them and sent them to new york then i decided to take a few days off to celebrate and explore i started with the cellar hoping to find some old wine the cellar hadnt been used for fifty years and it looked it boxes were lying everywhere covered with cobwebs the casks lining the right wall were thick with dust i turned one of the spigots and it broke off i was about to go back upstairs when i noticed something in the far corner reflecting the light from my lantern i picked my way back and found that id been luckyit was a half case of unopened wine in the other half of the case lay a sheaf of papers yellow and brittle bound by twine i lifted the whole box and brought it upstairs the wine was unlabeled and i assumed that it was homemade the sediment was thick on the bottom and i hadnt been careful enough in moving it since i had to let the wine sit for some time before decanting it i picked up the sheaf of papers got myself a beer and went out to the arbor thinking only to pass the time until the wine settled the papers were written in a thick continental hand in french of course after i got used to the style i became engrossed i read on forgetting about the wine until it got dark then moved inside and finished the manuscript sitting at the kitchen table at first i thought it a rather poor attempt at a novel but as i read on it appeared to be more and more genuinea personal account of madame giraudneuillys father during world war i but something else was even more interesting to me if this were a genuine manuscript it was proof of arrowroots theory for the auguste lupa of the manuscript could be none other than holmess son the next day i wrote to madame giraudneuilly asking her if she could tell me anything about her fathers exploits during the war specifically any undercover operations he might have been involved in i then set myself to the arduous task of translating within two weeks i had my landladys reply yes her father had been active in the war as some kind of agent she didnt know too much about it though and suggested that i question her half brother jean chessal who was living in valence he was a retired soldier pushing eighty and very reluctant to discuss anything with a nosy american finally though i persuaded him to take the manuscript a few days later i went to pick it up have you read it i asked i said i would well well what what do you think is it true he squinted at me through his thick glasses and scratched at his head as if trying to understand the question how would i know i wasnt there but your mother my mother was tania chessal before she married jules what does that prove but of course it proved quite a lot i returned home to find a letter from kevin james i had written to him asking him to send any information he had regarding holmess progeny the letter was mostly tongueincheek but it did present several facts about holmess relationships none of which were inconsistent with anything in the manuscript id been slightly bothered by the initials s h on lupas watch but kevin assured me that individuals who used aliases often kept their own initials i became angry with myself after some weeks of translating id become convinced of the manuscripts authenticity with no more proof than its evident age and its conformance to hugo arrowroots pet theory there was only one thing to do to finally satisfy myself accordingly i spent most of the next few months tracking down and interviewing anyone who might have known or worked with the man who had been auguste lupa for the year he lived and worked in valence during world war i those interviews laid to rest my every doubt in translating i have tried to use contemporary americanisms wherever possible though in places where the meaning is clear from context i have retained the french finally i apologize for the prose style in this prologue i am not a prose writer by trade and if i had not come to believe in the importance of this manuscript i would certainly have left it where i found it gathering dust in a wine cellar it was embarrassing but with a war going on embarrassment was a luxury i couldnt permit myself the deep gray and cold of dawn were burning off into a pleasant morning as i walked along the rue st philip in valence trying to piece together all id heard about the man i was to meet and solicit auguste lupa we hadnt made an appointment but i knew where he would be since every morning he followed a strict routine up at eight am a walk through the town garden then a corner table at la couronne from nine thirty until noon drinking beer and reading newspapers nearly always alone during the afternoons he would disappear for five hoursno one seemed to know where hed then reappear just before six prepared to work as chef at la couronne where he was reputed to be a genius even in this land of chefs sans pareille what was embarrassing was that we needed him and i was chosen to meet him because of a weakness we shared for beer we needed him a chef not yet turned twentyfive because he was the best spy in europe may the huns were having a heyday plumbing the depths to which humanity could sink theyd already shown their disregard for treaty and commitment by marching across neutral belgium last august but the events of this month surprised even those of us who were supposedly inured to their perfidy two weeks ago theyd torpedoed the ship lusitania killing hundreds of civilians and on the battlefield at ypres theyd just introduced a new element into warfare the heretoforeoutlawed poison gas the streets of valence were filled with redeyed women whose sons fathers and brothers had left for the front determined to repulse the german invaders at ten oclock this tuesday morning i arrived at la couronne and sat opposite lupa whom id never before seen there are some men who can sit in a corner or in a room and simply disappear blending into their surroundings if such men make good assassins this lupa could never be one he didnt blend in at all in fact he very nearly commanded the entire street sitting at his table quietly drinking his beer of course it was hethe high forehead and dark brown hair combed straight back the eyes not quite open and yet missing nothing the heavy lips puckering after every swallow i too had a paper and settled back to watch him he was a big man and looked immensely strong even dressed in an illfitting brown suit his yellow shirt which would have been garish orworsememorable on an assassin was tight across his middle but didnt bulge at the waist the garçon came out to his table with two more beers removed the two empty glasses and was returning when i stopped him for two of my own lupa had set the paper down and was leaning back with a beer he let the foam settle slightly then took a deep swallow draining the contents of the glass in a single gulp as he lowered the glass to the table his eyes narrowed slightly and the corners of his mouth turned suddenly downward the garçon came with my beer it was still a bit early and lupa and i were the only people there he looked at me briefly when my beer arrived and i nodded the informal recognition of two people sharing the same type of moment his head inclined a mere centimeter then turned back to the newspaper i reached for the beer and took a small drink making an elaborate face of disgust crossing my legs i sat back and picked up the paper stopping every two or three minutes to continue my little charade with the beer a sip a look of distaste meant of course only for myself but obvious to anyone especially to lupa i set the first glass down when id finished and with a little flourish pushed the empty glass as far from me as the table allowed i then stared down the street glaring lupa finished his third glass and leaned back with his eyes closed drumming his fingers methodically on the edge of the table after a few seconds his fingers came to an abrupt halt and he glanced over at me mal i said with a weak smile insupportable he took the other glass and poured it slowly to the ground the corners of his mouth turned slightly upward and he watched me jen ai marée ive had enough i took a gamble and decided to make a scene garçon when he arrived i spoke too loudly this beer is horrible it is possibly the worst beer in france and at any rate its the worst ive had this gentlemani nodded in lupas directionhas just poured his to the sidewalk where it belongs and i only refrain because i deplore waste especially during wartime take this glass remove it and give its contents to the plants or the pigs then bring me a glass of wine i looked at lupa sir would you join me in a glass he nodded thank you i would and charles he said to the waiter dont pour it on the plants or use it in the mustard perhaps it wouldnt completely destroy the pork he crossed to my table and bowed more an inclination of the head than a bow auguste lupa he said jules giraud i motioned to the empty chair we sat and he began to talk i too sir deplore waste though i could argue that there was no waste involved in pouring that beer to the ground that beer was waste when it arrived and what pains me is that ive been putting up with it for months now i am indebted to you monsieur giraud sometimes i need a nudge to act though i generally decide instantly on matters of taste but i have an inordinate fondness for beer and since good beer cannot be purchased here ive allowed my integrity an unforgivable laxity he closed his eyes and sighed and there was indeed a burden of sadness around him it will be hard without beer but my taste applauds yours sir the wine arrived and he raised his glass after first sniffing it and looking through the dark red liquid santé he said and damn this war we both drained our glasses he signaled for another and i began to smile youre amused he asked it seems strange i said raising the second glass to find myself agreeing with a man whose major concern in the midst of european destruction is the lack of quality beer but you do agree of course damn it i smiled again the living must continue to live but you are wrong about something i said and that is the dearth of good beer there is a great quantity of excellent beer not four kilometers from where we sit but it is not for sale he looked at me patiently and warily monsieur giraud i dont know you but you dont seem given to idle jesting i have been cooking here in valence for the winter and have searched tirelessly for a supply of good beer and to no avail i have some talent at discovering things that people try to keep hidden and there is no beer there is and it is hidden and privately brewed by a man who values his privacy no more than six men know of it they are very discreet men he said very i continued they have to be but thats no matter even knowing that the beer exists you would never find it for youre not likely to see me again and you dont know the other five i drained my glass and got up to go its been a pleasant morning sir i said good luck i hadnt gone ten paces when he spoke monsieur giraud i turned yes would your chef mind terribly if you missed a meal he goes nearly mad i said but occasionally i stopped abruptly how did you know i had a chef he nodded his eyes narrowing somewhat perhaps with humor youve just confirmed it yes but monsieur giraud he said there was nothing sinister i assure you in the question it was mere conjecture but how simplicity itself its clear that you are a man of taste regarding your palate your clothing further bespeaks a certain degree of wealth and your accentindeed even the way you hold a wineglassbetrays good breeding finally your coloring is pale yes surely that is enough i laughed in spite of myself im afraid i dont follow you he ticked off the steps of his deduction with the fingers of his right hand first you can afford a chef second you would demand fine meals especially at home third if you yourself spent the required amount of time behind a hot stove your complexion would be ruddy like my own it is not ergo you have a chef youre very astute i said he waved it off its nothing childs play literally in my case my father was something of a stickler for such matters ive kept it up as a hobby more or less just now i made an educated guess and your reaction confirmed it true deduction is a closed systemit confirms itself still im impressed well then perhaps youll permit me to impress you with my small skills as a chef would you care to lunch the eyes were sharp now though the face was relaxed and friendly its rather early i said hesitating a moment he continued egg of pigeon poached in red wine escargots rognons aux fines herbes all accompanied by the finest wine on the côte du rhone served at the chefs table it is a great temptation i said you of course though you havent said it would greatly appreciate an introduction to a certain local brewer i mentioned he smiled your deduction though obvious is flawless and your discretion unimpeachable i walked back to him at what time shall we eat i asked later i would recognize that slight turn of the lips as a beaming smile we can begin immediately if youd like to come down to the kitchen gladly we crossed through the tables to a door that didnt leave much room to spare for us and opened it a short stairway led to the kitchen he stopped at the bottom and the introduction pardon to the brewer ah yes youve already met him he raised his eyebrows indeed i nodded a vôtre service and so it was arranged that auguste lupa come to my house the next morning at ten for beer and a light lunch espionage like any other profession has its ups and downs lately though it had taken a monotonous turn to the latter id been one of the few operatives whod dared before august to suggest that the german thrust would be through belgium this was viewed as so outrageous that those of us who believed it were transferred even after the event came to pass we were still regarded as secondclass and relegated to desks or to the country i should have been upset with the demotion but in fact id been happy id begun to feel constrained under the inflexibility of joffres ftnref commander in chief of french army yoke consequently i had spent the past autumn behind a desk doing nothing worthwhile and had finally much to my relief been called back to my hometown for this case it was to be a break in my routine a kind of forced vacation no sooner had i returned to the little white house nestled snugly amid grapevines and a small grove of oaks however than my contact had suddenly been taken deadofficially an accidental drowning the next month id busied myself with the beer and light gardening spending much time with my new chef a young swiss with extraordinary promise named fritz benet it had been a pleasant enough time or would have been without the specter of murder hanging over the house normally living in an atmosphere where people tend to die unexpectedly didnt overly disturb my peace of mind but somehow at home i found it quite annoying there were of course my friends marcel routier my closest friend and fellow agent though we rarely worked together was now in valence my other friends to whom we were traveling salesmen included henri pulis a greek shop owner in town paul anser an american poet of some small repute and georges lavoie an alsatian salesman who dealt in hospital supplies including fritz then these were the other five men who knew about the beer there was also tania i had told lupa that only five other men in town knew about the beer and taniatall and slim with long black hair and deep deep eyes and voicewas as far from being a man as any creature on earth marcel had been sent down after my original contact had drowned and had told me the problem it was believed that the man behind most of the assassinations in the past two yearsincluding francis ferdinands in sarajevo was now living and working out of valence how intelligence had come to believe that i had no idea since there wasnt a shred of evidence that pointed to the involvement of a mastermind assassin yes last spring an agent in valence had been found with a bullet in his head two days after wiring that he was onto something big but something big could mean just about anything these days what with half the nations of europe at war there was in fact only one event of importance of real significance attached to this locale and that was the arrival early the previous fall of auguste lupa obviously that wasnt his real name but no one had any idea of what it really was so it didnt matter in belgrade hed been julius adler at sarajevo he was cesar mycroft in milan but the list is immaterial though impressive always a reference to one of the caesars in one of the namesperhaps some family connection wed followed him when he broke out of jail in belgrade a year ago june lost him briefly found him again in geneva trailing him to valence when he actually took a job here id been sent lupa was the unparalleled genius among the agents of europe and he seemed to work for himself for no government acknowledged him as far as we knew hed been approached before by us as well as the british and russians and to all hed feigned an absolute innocence of any knowledge of espionage or even of the affairs of politics his loves he said included only food and beer in spite of his protestations of naivete hed been jailed for espionage in three countries and had turned over quantities of information always by leaving a bag loaded with papers in a locker somewhere the material was always typed never on the same machine never with the same paper almost never in the same language and always frighteningly exact he was the best and hed been trying to discover the brains behind europe s assassinations for two years he obviously wanted us here or he wouldnt have let himself be followed and yet hed made no overtures of any sort and had forced me to contact him it was barely possible that he didnt suspect my associations but it was probable that even as i sat down across from him he was cataloguing everything he knew about me deciding the time was right and letting me set the tone of our relationship during lunch i had asked him if hed mind if a friend of mine were present at the next days meeting and hed said no accordingly i invited marcel routier and he arrived early the next morning a little past nine oclock we sat outside in the sun for our coffee he of course knows us he said i shrugged its nearly certain but he may have been so attuned to his own inquiries that they havent crossed ours yet in any case well see before long he sipped at his coffee took a bite of fritzs blueberry muffin and looked out over the grounds his hair was the color of straw which made it look as though there was less of it than there was it was a bit too long for my taste just touching the tops of his ears which he said was to make up for the lack on top this morning he was wearing white pants and shoes and a highcollared blue shirt and except possibly for his face he looked much more the dandy than the spy a lot of women had found him attractive but i couldnt understand why tania had said he had classic features but too many of them his forehead and nose commanded his face except when he smiled at which time his teeth commanded everything he was smiling now damn he said i wish id thought of getting lupa with beer occasionally you show real genius jules perception and devotion hardly genius when fritz told me of the food at la couronne it started me thinking a man who could cook as well as he did who smuggled in spices for the integrity of his dishes and yet who spent every morning drinking swill on the sidewalk no it didnt make sense that mans taste buds were too refined for that beer but he loves beer simple actually like columbuss egg he said at first even at lupas insistence fritz would not come to the table with us but finally he overcame his prejudice against the chef dining with his patron when lupa got him engrossed in a recipe for pheasant the problem he said is that too often that delicate bird is overwhelmed by tarragon and sage when it should be coaxed into accepting their favors as a woman might accept other favors with a little wine set the spices in the wine first several hours before and leave it chilled then gentlemen i said i dont mean to interrupt but couldnt we continue this discussion at the table so the four of us sat to savor fritzs delicious sole and honey followed by a subtle tournedos béarnaise the two chefs were very close to the same age and they seemed to get along exceptionally well which made the lunch even smoother than it would have been with the fine food there was no hint of recognition between them when i introduced marcel and lupa though once during the meal they glanced at one another after a remark fritz had made about the state of cuisine in the balkans and now i said as we were finishing our coffee shall we go to the cellar fritz will you prepare the arbor he is a sensitive chef lupa said when fritz had gone has he been with you long actually no less than a year do you know where he was trained a look of annoyance crossed marcels countenance lupa must have seen it too for he held up his hand and continued quickly i only ask about his training because it is so evidently superlative the man is nearly a maître and at his age that is very rare indicative of great native skill and rigorous apprenticeship as a chef myself i would be interested to know where he studied to tell you the truth im not at all certain he arrived here on the recommendation of a mutual friend and his cooking has never given me cause to question his background my friend was living in strasbourg before the hostilities began so i gather he trained in one of the establishments there in germany then finally marcel got in a word that point is most arguable isnt it strasbourg is a german city lupa asserted strasbourg is french it will always be french regardless of who its rulers might be gentlemen please i felt i had to step in or tempers specifically marcels would flare for an instant lupa seemed inclined to glare and continue the debate but as i watched him he swiftly conquered his rising emotions he spoke contritely youre right of course monsieur routier i apologize strasbourg must once again fly the tricolor i only meant to comment favorably upon fritzs cuisine and im afraid my youth carried me into irrelevancies he is a fine fine chefand you monsieur giraud are a lucky man to have him there was an awkward moment as marcel brought himself back under control but i could see that lupas obvious sincerity had made its mark well i said clapping my hands should we begin the tour we all rose from the table and i led the two down to my cellar the left half of which was reserved for wines and the other for the beer apparatus there were five stone crocks lined against the right wall and the smell of yeast and ripening beer lent an aroma that i found pleasant to the room but i knew it might prove too strong to a novice even a beerloving novice as long as the wine isnt opened down here i said explaining it is ideal as we walked along i went over some of the steps in the brewing and seeing the two of them smile patiently i suggested we proceed to the tasting off to the side of the house i was blessed with a small arbor of trees through which ran a clear stream where fritz stored butter and beer it was perfectly chilled and id built a table of thick oak where my friends and i came to sit and relax out of the glare we walked out to that table now and silently sat while fritz brought the beer left the bottles with us and departed lupa drank his whole glass at one swill just as he had the day before at la couronne and yet conveyed the impression that he was savoring every drop marcel and i drank more slowly but with no less enjoyment lupa put down his glass and looked at me remarkable it pleases you there are certain advantages to being raised a rich man eh said marcel certain opportunities to develop talents which otherwise would be buried under the mundane cares of survival he looked at lupa smiling he constantly makes me envious such beer such a house such a chef such beer lupa repeated leaning back with his eyes closed i poured him another glass for the next quarter of an hour we sat quietly enjoying the day the beer and was it the company or the suspense it seemed to me that we were all waiting for another to be the first to speak finally i ventured cautiously monsieur lupa what brings you here to valence could you not accomplish your goals elsewhere in a larger city he looked at me quizzically the touch of a smile lifting the corners of his mouth what goals are those he asked oh the usual for a young chef apprenticeship in a large hotel assistantship to a master but he cut me off a man who follows the usual routes obtains the usual results like so many other endeavors cuisine is both an art and a skill of course the french scoff at such an ideameaning no offense to you sir too often the path to excellence at a skill is a limiting experience until the mind finally is trained to abhor innovation and beyond a certain mastery of skills innovation is what lets a chef stand alone when he finished his little speech he had none of the habits one would expect from one so young neither the slight embarrassment nor the brash defiance that often punctuates the speech of the insecure rather he reached for his beer and drank its clear said marcel that you wish to stand alone only a dullard would not there was a moment of uncomfortable silence finally marcel spoke but surely you dont mean that lupa nodded if i hadnt meant it i wouldnt have said it what of our men at the front then they dont stand alone in fact all our hope resides in their fighting together in the assumption that there are goals that must take precedence over individuality are all our soldiers dullards probably most its always rather meaningless to generalize joffre certainly is then you wouldnt fight marcel was getting angry lupa took a breath fortunately im a citizen of the united states and we are presently neutral im afforded the luxury of not fighting but would you i wouldnt like to be mere cannon fodder because you wish to stand alone exactly he drank some beer but i see youre getting upset with me i dont mean to say that i dont believe in causes or that everyone should have individuality i applaud our troops at the front i only refer to men of adequate intelligence and they are not so commonplace as is generally believed who attain eminence in a field and then prove themselves incompetent because they lack imagination individuality call it what you will joffre can execute all the textbook moves what he cannot do is adapt luckily for france the germans are even more stupid or they would have taken paris months ago he paused and drank again the key then said marcel is innovation lupa continued i dont mean to slur those who follow others examples or those who learn a trade and become proficient at a skill no we need them i simply bemoan the lack of creative leadership by people who are nominally our leaders i quite agree i put in perhaps i misunderstood said marcel then you are here as a head chef to learn to innovate lupa smiled one doesnt learn how to innovate one simply acts and learns from his actions but yes i am here to become a chef i am already a cook it seemed that marcel was on the verge of questioning him directly about his real work he leaned toward the younger man with a gleam in his eyes a slight breeze came into the arbor though and lupa rubbing his hands together stood gentlemen he said i have very much enjoyed the day but i must now attend to other matters im becoming more and more a creature of habit and my habits wont brook much flexibility im afraid i must go well if you must you must i said but would you consider coming back this evening once a week i host a gathering of the men i had earlier mentioned to you and im always happy to find another discerning beer lover he bowed slightly id be delighted though it would have to be after the dinner hour around ten then we remained seated and watched him until he entered the house he walked very lightly for a man of his size well asked my friend i shrugged what do you think of him hes very polite we laughed and i rose to get some more beer when i had come back and sat down marcel was still smiling he doesnt seem to be in as much a hurry to enlist our aid as we are to enlist his does he hardly and i must admit that after all this time im starting to wonder if ive been put out to pasture that theres nothing happening in valence and ive been sent here to sit out the war with my cook and my beer have you heard of anything at all i heard from paris late last week it must have been after last wednesdays gathering and they told us to sit tight that whatever would happen here obviously was in the planning stage and the longer the wait the greater the odds that its really something big he took a long drink of beer the damn thing is theres no one worth assassinating here and no one scheduled to come and not a clue of planning in progress he trailed off nothing is it possible i asked that this time it wont be an assassination suppose for example its sabotage or kidnapping or no i doubt it he said our man directs killers and if we could just think of my god hed put down the glass and was staring so intently into the trees behind us that i turned around what is it he is here to assassinate impossible i said theres not a man in this region of any strategic importance and no one will be theres one he said his eyes shining whos that auguste lupa we sat for a moment or two in silence while i thought of objections to what hed said in the first place lupa had arrived on the trail of our man but that of course could be a way to have lupa where he wanted him come to valence so that lupa would come here so that he could kill him here that was farfetched and i said so why valence possibly because lupa has an embarrassing connection here and killing him in sordid surroundings would not only be good propaganda but would rid germany of the agent they most feared marcel was warming now to his own suggestion but there would be no propaganda since the public has never heard of lupa since lupa wasnt even his name a few months ago finally marcel he would never have waited so long to move if he had known who lupa was and where he would find him he would have acted and cleared out months ago youre probably right he conceded but hes here for something and we dont have any idea of who he is what he wants or why hes here we must ask lupa what he has on him and tonight it will be difficult at the gathering i said then later well see but i cant shake the feeling that the man is here for sabotage to sabotage what theres nothing here in valence no not in valence itself but there is the arms factory in st etienne surely close enough to warrant investigation you know as well as i that all our major defense research is going on there our man would also know otherwise why would lupa be here its got to be something damned important if that factory is blown well itll set us back over a year he looked down at the ground and picked up his beer its guarded of course its impregnable well there you are no what bothers me is its seeming invulnerability there are enough troops guarding the place all right but in a sense that is really not the point it cant be directly assaulted which is of course why theyd have to send a man hereto break it to find a way in how is security i tell you marcel thats what puzzles me so much about it everything is as it should be it is completely impossible it cant be entered by anyone who hasnt been thoroughly checked out everyone who works inside has been cleared and cleared again there are troops all over st etienne with s ready to shoot down any aeroplanes aeroplanes probably not i agree but one cant be too careful well then it seems as if its all covered it is and thats what bothers me the level of security may have created a degree of complacency im growing more and more certain that we should direct our attentions there it would also explain why our man has stayed around so long without acting he couldnt very well break their security in too short a time if at all i looked across at my friend years of service still hadnt forced him to develop an imagination he was steady and loyal always ready for action and totally without fear but he could never foresee an event before its occurrence the times i had worked with him before hed been invaluable but as an active force rather more like another weapon and so id developed a protective attitude toward him not that he needed protection from any known dangeronce it was identified he was in his element too often however he suspected nothing and would have walked into traps totally unprepared i dont know how he was with other agents perhaps we had been friends for so long that he didnt feel with me that he had to be so much the professional that our personal relations overlapped i didnt share his feeling but he was my closest friend now as i discussed possibilities with him i couldnt get rid of the feeling that perhaps it was approaching the time for him to get out of espionage he would perhaps be more valuable as a strategist directing troops from a defensible position against a visible enemy time will tell i answered him yes we got up and started to cross over to the house a breeze was blowing steadily now and it felt as if rain was in the air i put my arm around my friends shoulder lets find something i said im getting very bored he laughed better to be bored than dead theres a lot of that going around these days yes i said keeping my thoughts to myself overhead the sky had begun to darken it had rained before the first of the guests arrived and now the clouds hung low over the land spent and yet threatening occasionally there was a low roar of thunderthe first thunderstorm of the seasonbut the clouds obscured the lightning georges lavoie and henri pulis arrived first a little after eight oclock and we sat by the front window looking out over the field that lay between my home and the road some seventyfive meters away through some fluke the oaks that surrounded the house did not mar the view out of this window though with the wind and the swirling branches the scene was neatly translated from the pastoral to the gothic from time to time one of the lower branches would sweep across the window like a hand twice the wind was strong enough to throw a hail of acorns into the glass sounding for all the world like the tapping knuckles of that passing hand it was i suppose a rather strange collection of guests that came every week to my house and shared my beer we were not confreres by occupation or age indeed we had almost nothing in common except a love of beer and companionship i was by far the eldest except for marcel and the only one of us with any wealth usually we would drink and talk often playing cards until midnight sometimes paul anser would read something hed just written horribly translated he was a great joker and kept the nights far from being dull now with the war we never ran out of news to discuss though some nights we still would just sit and read as in an english mens club with of course the notable exception of tania henri pulis looked like what he wasone of the hardworking bourgeoisie though he was some fifteen years younger than i his hair was nevertheless starting to streak with gray and his face was set in creases punctuated by a large drooping black mustache he always sat slumped over and this made him look even shorter than he was now he sat nervously yet methodically wiping the foam from his mustache with his left hand holding the beer in his right hed come to valence as a young man perhaps ten years ago after working for a time as a ships mate it was even rumored that hed deserted from the greek navy when his ship had docked at marseilles and he had moved north lying low for some months until he decided it was safe to appear after two or three years hed saved enough to open his own shop we had met because he sold the supplies i needed for the beer and though he was not as witty as the others he was no less popular he often seemed uncomfortable until hed had a few beers then he would relax and entertain us with crude jokes that we were all secretly ashamed of enjoying he had originally come when id asked him he said to get away from his wife and six children and though by now we were all friends i was still not completely convinced that he so much treasured our company as that he considered it a respite from his familys georges lavoie normally came with henri they were friends who often dined together during the weeks when both were free georges was thirtyfive or thereabouts a traveling salesman who was often on the road but who made a point of returning by wednesday when we all gathered he was kept from the service by a severe limphis right leg was shorter than his left but this didnt hamper him from somehow seeming the most urbane member of our fellowship his father had been a banker in brussels in lille even in coblentz before he finally settled in metz and undoubtedly the company of bankers had instilled in him a certain conservatism of dress and deference in mannerism nevertheless he had a ready tongue and a stock of stories which were the more amusing for their incongruity he along with tania and myself never drank to excess while the other three often left the house a bit affected when the war broke out he had left his native alsacelorraine and fled south he worked now out of valence selling and delivering his wares to factories hospitals and arsenals in the towns along the rhone he was the latest of our number except for lupa henri shuddered crossing one leg over the other and reaching for his bottle good night to get drunk he said its a good night for something georges agreed philosophically i raised my glass to something i said and we drank the toast fritz brought in three more beers and left the room shaking his head sadly he did not like beer at all by now it had gotten dark the lamps were lit and the fire stoked and we had moved to more comfortable seats we always remained in the big sitting room for these evenings with its large front window reflecting the lights back in on us the warm rug and the variety of furniture it was ideal for a small gathering of friends last spring before i was sent north wed met in the arbor several times but somehow after dark this room was much more comfortable georges and henri sat on either side of the large fireplace which commanded one corner of the room next to the entrance to the dining area and behind that the kitchen i sat on the divan under the window looking out for the others arrival in the far corner away from me were two other stuffed chairs with a coffee table in front then the door leading in from the foyer just to my left was a china closet and to my right bookshelves that lined the wall from the corner to the fireplace two other tables held our beer and some magazines one directly in front of me the other between henri and georges the house was really too large for me but this room was ideal for a time id busied myself with improvements moving the water closet indoors installing a shower but then id given up and left the other rooms vacant until fritz had moved in the year before i slept in the one upstairs room directly overhead from outside came the sound of a carriage drawing up and laughter and in a moment marcel entered with paul and tania dont bother getting up said paul just bring a beer for the hero fritz he yelled fritz tania crossed over to me and kissed me after shed sat down he really was terrific the horse bolted and was starting to run as we met paul down the road and he jumped on its back like a red indian and calmed it it was nothingreally i assure youthat any american couldnt do riding on the plains for days at a time with only stale bread and marcel was laughing sure paul sure fritz bring him his beer before he tells us about fighting the indians the beer arrived and the newcomers drank paul anser stood grinning in the middle of the room he wore his flyers jacket as he called it a leather affair with a woolen collar heavy boots pants that looked to be made out of canvas what a night he said and hello everyone your beer is getting no worse jules are we late is there time to catch up with henri henri smiled only my second he lied ah fritzhow are you fritztwo more beers please mustnt let henri get the jump on me marcel took pauls jacket and they both satmarcel on the divan with tania and me and paul next to the entrance to the kitchen there must be something in the air i said henri just said it was a fine night to get drunk well by god lets get to it paul poured his second beer hear hear said tania surprisingly and then paul can read for us alcohol cant hurt my accent when i slur i sound more french hardly more french said georges possibly less american and we all laughed i leaned back with my arm around tania and listened to the banter trying to find a good moment to tell them we would have a new guest we were so relaxed now together that i almost regretted having invited lupa but id had the same doubts about georges and theyd proven groundless i was finding it difficult to divorce business from my daytoday life when living at home the people i met socially had always been friends and though i liked lupa my motive for inviting him was certainly not friendship tania sat easily next to me sipping her beer and joining in with the others twentyone years ago shed married jean chessal one of my neighbors and over the years had borne him four children all boys jean had been in the service his entire life and it was natural for the boys to follow him especially with the war looming her husband had been killed in the first weeks of the war and now the boys were at the front all miraculously unhurtso far she was brave cheerful without any visible effort witty and very beautiful we had been lovers now for six years she was not a native of valence or even of this region and even after so many years her accent betrayed a certain foreignness which i found becoming when chessal had returned to valence with his new bride there had been rumors of royal ancestry of some distinctly romantic past i had no trouble accepting her with this touch of mystery when we first met i had been fascinated but now her antecedents meant no more to me than her accent the others had gone on for a time with paul and finally persuaded him to begin reading a new poem he wanted more beer but id given fritz a sign to hold off until everyone had arrived after token comments relating to the paucity of his hosts refreshments paul went to the center of the room and began he read in english which only two or three of us understood and it was quite modern but he read wellthe cadences were rhythmic and pleasing this was after all his only live audience of any size when hed finished i told him i found the thing incomprehensible but he didnt seem to mind he just shrugged and grinned and said something about comic relief though while he was reading he did not seem to take it lightly suddenly he turned and cried out i must must simply must have more beer henri who had sat looking utterly perplexed while paul read concurred with a shy belch georges stood and raised his empty glass id propose a toast to the poet if there were something to drink tania turned to me why are you holding the beer jules is there some surprise for us the damned woman knew me too well what makes you think im holding back the beer i asked paul spoke youll never understand women jules our most secret thoughts are the common currency of their lives maybe they dont read the thought but they sense the secret and although maybe they know less they understand more bah georges interjected i may be only a simple observer but i know when a gaffe has been committed for a man to pretend to understand women is bad manners and for him to really understand them is bad morals tania added all right assez assez ive been holding back the beer i admit it im guilty but theres a reason one would hope so said tania such a serious matter added georges its not such a great matter i said smiling were going to have another guest i looked around for reactions but there was nothing special henri looked a bit put out for a moment but i had expected that as one who cherished his nonintellectuality and tried as much as possible to keep the conversation offcolor he was not disposed to welcome a new guest who might tip the balance of the evening away from purely sensual enjoyment who is this person jules georges asked we know almost everyone in valence is he a neighbor jules hasnt said our guest is a he georges perhaps he has invited another woman marcel looked at tania and winked enough it was time to end the mystery our guest is auguste lupa i met him quite casually the other day at la couronne he is a connoisseur of good beer and a very pleasant fellow nothing more hes arrived here only recently and i thought he would enjoy a tasteshall i say of society i think hell fit in very nicely with our group the door sounded ah that would be him fritz brought lupa into the room and announced him grandly the big man stood for a moment framed in the doorway looking at the assemblage there was a moment of silence and then i jumped up and performed the introductions only henri seemed ill at ease while the others nodded cautiously and fritz went to get another round of beers lupa sat by the door and after another moment spoke please disregard my attendance here for a time since you are obviously all attuned to one another youll want to continue as before dont make allowances for me after a time the novelty will be gone and ill join in as one of you but for now let me drink quietly and not disturb you it was a strange prologue and served more to reinforce the silence than to dispel it nonsense said i why dont you tell the group about yourself it isnt every day we welcome a new member member well not really a member of anything sometimes we do refer to ourselves as a group of sorts but nothing so rigid as to demand membership do tell us about yourself said tania i saw marcel smile at me i didnt expect lupa to drop any information but having him talk for a while wouldnt hurt yeah like where are you from that was paul lupa looked at him youre american he said then continued almost as though talking to himself northwest i should say no not so far west perhaps wyoming or montana you got it mister missoula montana u s of a how bout you born pardon born in america not bred my mother traveled quite a lot with her career and fortuitously timed my birth so that i became an american citizen at the time of my first breath you dont talk like an american said henri more like a greek or or a serbian ventured georges lupa smiled exactly ive never lived in america though i would like to go there i was raised by several of my relativesin england primarily but in other parts of europe as well i was surprised to find him so conversational he sat straight in his chair genial and relaxed henri and marcel took out their pipes and lit them henri with a bit of ember from the fire lupa raised his head slightly and sniffed at the air ah the smell of pipes i love them they bring back memory of my childhood of my father you monsieur routier youre having a cavendish latakia mixture are you not and monsieur pulisa virginia tobacco perhaps even a chewing plug if im not mistaken the two men looked at each other impressed exactly marcel said not to chew but to smoke henri said his face showing a certain sullenness i interjected you know your tobaccos monsieur he nodded it was a special interest of my father once we were together in paris and oh then youre not new to france asked tania interrupting id somehow thought you were no i spent most of my summers here as a youth he stopped and looked at tania and me i should say when i was more of a youth what do you do in valence henri asked suddenly and i thought rather belligerently lupa looked carefully at him you bear me animus sir i stepped in youll have to excuse monsieur pulis he isnt happy about having a new member no matter who it might be im sure its nothing personal isnt that right henri if youd prefer that i leave no no dont be silly its i who should leave said henri im sorry sometimes i forget myself i act like the ass sometimes we all do lupa replied with a pleasant smile such is the effect that troubles sometimes have on us henri nodded taking another huge drink from his bottle then in a kind of double take he put down his glass and stared at lupa georges however was the first to speak what do you know of henris troubles the others all nodded in shared suspicion lupa aware of his faux pas was nearly successful in smiling then he spoke in a selfdeprecating tone you mustnt mind me please sometimes i get carried away by assumptions i cant help making and they lead me to conclusions that are often ridiculous i saw monsieur pulis sitting slightly slumped over and the thought entered my head that he seemed unnaturally subdued given the spirit of the occasion additionally i noticed that the second button on his shirt is missing and that he wears a wedding ring he is therefore married but on bad terms with his wife just now or she wouldnt have let him go out with his shirt unmended finally he appears to be drinking much more than the rest of us often a sign of someone trying to forget a particularly depressing or difficult situation henris hand had gone to the missing button his face clouded over then he grinned sheepishly ive got to be more careful he said somewhat enigmatically i had earlier marveled at lupas perspicacity so i was prepared to some extent for his displays the others i noticed were beginning to look as though they felt slightly apprehensive as though they were all unwittingly under some unseen magnifying glass before anyone else could comment however fritz entered with the beer walked to the various seats and deposited the new bottles setting a glass before lupa he might have simply brought the tray into the room but the pride he took in his work demanded that certain rituals be performed we looked to tania who by tradition delivered the first toast after the whole company had assembled we had not all opened the bottles yet which fritz refused to do because he said of the danger once a bottle had exploded as he was about to open it a common enough occurrence with homebrewed beer and since then hed refused to participate in any opening tania looked at lupa and then at the rest of us georges was still fiddling with his bottle but she began to our new guest m lupa and before she could say and to france there was a loud pop and georges was grabbing his right hand with his left swearing we all leapt up and crossed over to him and fritz entered silently with a cloth damn the bottles said georges and there was general agreement as tania took the cloth and wiped the blood away have you any gauze she asked and i told her there was some in the bathroom georges said hed get it himself that he was all right and he walked out to clean up lupa sat in the chair georges had vacated where hed gone to inspect the bottle while the rest of us reassembled ourselves marcel said something conciliatory to henri and they retired to what had been the american corner tania and i went back to the divan and paul stood joking with fritz about his wisdom when fritz had finished cleaning up the spilled beer he went to get another and paul turned and sat with us so much for that toast he said forgoing the next one we all reached for our beers and drank henri and lupa drained their glasses and henri had just yelled in through the kitchen for fritz to bring more than one more when marcel stood up straight grabbing his throat he croaked out i feel but before he could finish he reeled forward over the small table onto his face lupa was to him in a flash rolling him over and lifting his eyelids georges came back to the door in time to hear him say hes dead the events of the next moments were confused and rapid though they seemed to me to follow one another with agonizing slowness tania sitting next to me put down her glass and stared then covering her face with her hands cried oh god no and leaned back i was aware of georges stopping in the doorway gauze over his recent cut turning pale and being the second one to reach marcels side lupa had turned him over onto his back and undone his collar but it was too late georges slapped the corpse several times saying marcel over and over in a scolding tone then looked over to me as lupa finally stopped him what happened he asked fritz came to the door as i stood to cross the room and i told him to take the car to town and get the police paul and henri stood where they had been sitting and watched in stunned silence i walked to where marcel lay and felt for his pulse there was none get back get away i yelled at lupa and georges paul had gone out to the hall for his coat and he returned placing it over marcels head georges limped back and forth across the room hands thrust deep in his pockets tania had stopped crying and stood by the settee everything began moving at normal speed again and everyone began talking at once i went back to tania and sat next to her watching the others finally lupa who had been sitting stood again and bellowed out silence and we obeyed let us sit he said and wait for the police who are you to tell us what to do demanded henri who seemed quite shaken georges standing next to him put his arm around his shoulder paul sat alone by the fire looking at the flames i had supposed that jacques magiot an old acquaintance of mine and the chief of police would have come out for the investigation but he sent a young inspector and two gendarmes who made it clear that their chiefs appearance was by no means necessary for the gathering of evidence the flics stationed themselves by the door while the inspector walked around inspecting he leaned down and sniffed the rug where the beer had spilled prussic acid he said some form of cyanide at any rate i answered he nodded are you familiar with poisons oh come the almond smell is distinctive he noted something in his book the others stood about nervously the inspector spent a bit of time looking at a spiderweblike impression on the coffee table and after a series of ahems said that hed like to question each of us separately but before i do i will say that while you are all free to move about in town no one is to leave valence for any period of time without checking with the authorities but i dont live in valence said paul im from st etienne in that case monsieur we will escort you to your home by way of the st etienne constabulatory and you will report to them while we waited to be called to the kitchen for questioning tania and i sat without a word on the divan her arm linked into mine she seemed too calm almost to the point of breaking as though she were under some unbearable pressure undoubtedly this local tragedy had turned her thoughts to her sons at the front the inspector first called lupa then georges paul henri tania and fritz the first four were led to the back door and excused while tania and fritz waited in the kitchen after their questioning the inspector interrogated me in the front room monsieur magiot sends his compliments i nodded ive made no arrests have you any suspicions no im inclined to think of suicide he was your close friend was he not had he been unduly depressed it went on in that vein for several minutes i had no information for him and he had formed no suspicions himself he thought it odd that so few of my guests had been french and asked me about it i shrugged they are my friends finally a little after midnight they left tania and fritz came back to join me and we sat drinking brandy for a time pensive the undertaker had come earlier and my thoughts went back to marcels body being removed i closed my eyes and tried to imagine how he had been only that morning but i could not perhaps it was better that way i couldnt think of him as a dead man yet he was the friend of my childhood and he was gone tania and i went up to bed leaving the room empty save for fritz who sat at the edge of one of the coffee tables fists clenched and eyes glassy i awoke while it was still dark and silently got up the house was oppressive i needed to get away for a time two days before the rue st philip had been warming to a new day as i had walked down it to meet lupa for the first time now at four thirty in the morning with a light rain fallingstill falling i should sayit gave no hint that it could ever be a pleasant street the cobblestones were slick and too widely spaced and twice i nearly fell it wasnt cold but the wet darkness kept me shivering id taken the bottle of cognac and headed for la couronne planning to see lupa in the morning resolving to enlist his aid it was not professional it was not even that didnt matter i had to do something about my friends death at that moment i wasnt a professional and i didnt care the tables at la couronne were chained in place but the chairs had been moved inside for the night so i pulled up an empty fruit crate and sat by the restaurants front door leaning back against the building with my coat i performed the futile gesture of wiping the beaded drops from the table though it was still raining there was a small gaslight from within and its slight glare fell across the table the rain was so fine that it seemed to hang in the air there was no wind i hadnt been seated more than a minute when the door behind me opened and i found myself facing lupa monsieur giraud would you care to come inside where its dry i noticed that i was indeed very wet and got up and followed him into the bar he sat on a stool and looked at me without a word until i spoke im surprised to find you awake i said i was thinking about your friend yes i wanted to speak to you about it i dont understand he said standing and going around the bar he poured himself a beer i think you do he took a long draft come downstairs he said finally he opened the door to the kitchen and we descended may i take your coat he asked im sorry sir but i neglect my manners i am on edge come let me take your coat do sit down wed entered another room behind the kitchen it was warmly lit and pleasant three of the walls were covered with tapestries of a cheap variety and there were several bookshelves and assorted stuffed chairs i took one of them i live here he explained you are now my guest would you care for some heated milk coffee i looked carefully at this man who had been changed so completely by the act of my coming into his living quarters he went into some other rooms to deposit the coat then back to the kitchen evidently to prepare the milk for nearly a quarter of an hour i sat while he moved back and forth bringing first the milk then a pair of pajamas that he insisted i change into though they were much too large then a warm housecoat in which i wrapped myself he stoked the fire and before long we were sitting comfortably in silence now he said after a time what is it that you think i understand i smiled i am not a fool monsieur lupa i am older than you and perhaps not as naturally gifted but i have been in my businessperhaps i should say our businessfor over twenty years and i have learned a few things my efforts have been checked and checked again since coming to valence and i feel that yours have been likewise i think we should work together indeed he said i didnt know youd worked as a chef suddenly he chuckled of course i jest i thought it would be necessary that we work together but i wanted to be sure of you and certain of your superiors were less than rapturous in their recommendations i bridled somewhat and spoke in clipped tones you may be sure of me i know that i have been satisfied but have you can you be sure of me my head was swimming with cognac and fatigue and yet i immediately perceived the import of the question here indeed was a rubicon of sorts and i must either cast my die with this man or count him as an enemy there was there could be no middle ground and what in fact did i know of him beyond the briefs the hearsay the professional reports thatand no one knew this as well as ioften hid as much as they revealed he was an agent of that there was no doubt i was reasonably sure that he didnt work for the germans but could i be as certain that he was committed as i was to the interests of france before hostilities had erupted europe had been a checkerboard of conflicting states and even now with the combatants clearly defined only a fool would suppose that the goals of england for example everywhere coincided with those of france where did lupa stand i felt his eyes boring into my own as his question hung in the room and yet he didnt seem inclined to press could i be sure of him the answer of course had to be no we were both agents at war trained to trust no one hadnt lupa been sitting in marcels seat just before hed been poisoned but then another thought occurred to me it really wasnt my decision to make id been ordered to find and work with lupa i didnt have to trust or respect my superiors but as a soldier i had to obey them and there was another point i had already revealed myself to the younger man if he was not to be trusted then my usefulness here in valence was at an end now my own vulnerability here in lupas quarters could become my own best test of his credibility simply put if i were alive in the morning he would have proven himself worthy of my confidence it may not have been the most professional of solutions but in my wearied state it made a great deal of sense one final consideration even more unprofessional forced itself into my consciousness with marcel dead perhaps i simply needed to trust someone to fill the hole he had left with more instinct than reason i felt lupa to be the man for that role i have to believe in you i said at last i have no choice he sipped at his beer and stared into the fire quite some time passed i suspect everyone he said finally a wave of regret over the loss of my friend passed over me please i said i need your help he started to blur before me as fatigue set in i put my hand over my eyes and felt his come to rest on my shoulder come he said well talk in the morning he took me back to his quarters down a hall that seemed to be a dead end he put down a mattress on the floor and brought a thick blanket for it let us be careful he said almost gently we were by now speaking in the familiar were going to be needing each other i lay down and blew out the candle beside me he retreated a few steps then stopped do you mind if i call you jules no satisfactory another pause i am very sorry i slept for seven hours when i woke up my clothes had been sent out and already returned so i dressed and walked back out to the kitchen no one was there i went outside and found lupa on the sidewalk finishing his beer it was still drizzling but the awning had been pulled did you sleep well he asked i felt miserable so i merely grunted he ordered me a petite calva and i drank it off quickly have you been awake long i asked since eight oclock i must have looked at him in disbelief for he continued a schedule that may be whimsically broken is no schedule at all in the end the logical order one tries to impose on ones life is sacrificed to quotidian cares even this beer he said motioning to the brew though it doesnt compare to yours helps in its way to reestablish the order that last night destroyed i thought he was being peevish so i said nothing he looked at me and smiled emptying his glass come with me jules i have an appointment we went back down to his quarters which seemed smaller than they had been in the early morning or even a half hour before the hall id slept in was off to the left of the sitting room but we crossed over to a door at the right and into a rather large office the righthand wall was covered with pots and pans costly copper and cast iron while the left sported a picture of dreyfus and somewhat incongruously a bulls ear behind the desk was another of the cheap tapestries that he used to cover the bare rock wall his entire quarters seemed to be a type of bunkercertainly nothing like the typical cellar one finds around here he walked to the corner nearest the bulls eara memento from spain i later learnedand lifted away the tapestry showing a large hole opening into blackness into which he stepped motioning for me to follow he lit a tallow and we moved through a narrow high cave for several hundred meters so this was where he disappeared to in the afternoons i wondered where the cave would come out handy having all the limestone around here he said it took comparatively little work to finish this passage after i arrived here i found that difficult to believe though i knew that some of the natural caves in the region extended for incredible distances in the end the cave proved to be nearly a kilometer in length and i was totally unprepared for where it abutted lupa pulled aside another bit of rug and stepped into a cellar of amazing fragrance where are we i asked the smell alone had nearly driven away my headache he seemed almost playful as he leaned back against a waisthigh bench he held the candle out behind him and i could make out rows and rows of flowers he breathed deeply marvelous he said it always affects me then quickly he straightened up again and moved to a door which led to a stairway which in turn opened into a welllighted planting room there was a partition in front of the door and we waited behind it while lupa peeked out to see who was in the shop when he was satisfied we walked out a woman about thirty with dark hair and features stood talking with a man whose back was toward us as we approached lupa went up to the woman kissed her on the cheek and said something to her in a language i didnt understandand i speak five languages she disappeared to where wed been watkins hello the two men embraced and began speaking in english where have you sent anna asked the stranger she forgot to turn on the cellar lights again the plants will surely die im glad youre here weve had problems ive heard already routiers been killed no clues you were there who did it the man was in his twenties and would have looked perfectly nondescript except for the great swelling in his left cheek his hair was short and brown his suit common and he wore no tie occasionally he chewed at his cheek i havent much of an idea said lupa it could have been any of us oh excuse me this is jules giraud joseph watkins we shook hands as the woman returned look at his cheek will you she said those damned olives again watkins grinned crookedly addicted he said cant get enough of the blasted things hes been horrible all morning said the woman eating so many of them he cant talk spitting the pits wherever he happens to be i should have tossed him out long ago if he wasnt so she smiled and touched his arm he moved aside hello she said crossing to me my name is anna dubrov ive seen you before in town i nodded jules giraud lupa suggested we go to the back of the shop on the way watkins leaned over one of the potted plants and straightened up again without the swelling in his cheek he was grinning broadly anyone care for an olive he asked taking ten or fifteen from his coat pocket when no one responded he deposited the entire handful into his mouth lupa stood with an arm around anna waiting for this frivolous englishman to finish chewing when the pits had been stuffed into his cheek lupa began any news yes and specific once he started talking he was entirely businesslike perhaps he wasnt as frivolous as he seemed continue well naturally youre here on your own affairs something about assassinations and so forth but i thought you can drop that said lupa m giraud as you know is an agent of the french and he is now in our confidence he turned to me continuing i am a free operative working for the english government i know all this has been denied time and again in your inquiries about me you know how that is my uncle is a nonambulatory genius whom i detest but he is probably the most important man in england and we share some views during wartime so you work for england for the time being yes but i direct my own inquiries by the way said watkins altamont says that will do lupa said abruptly let us get on with your information yes well um he fumbled a moment then leaned over and spit out the pits weve got information that he is not here for assassination youre aware of the arms and munitions factory at st etienne lupas gaze was withering watkins pressed on its going to be blown i found myself smiling how do you know one of the boys flushed a kraut spy and persuaded him to drop a few tidbits and this was one of them unfortunately our man brought some friends they all got a bit carried away during the interrogation and the kraut died before he could be of much more use lupa looked at me and they say that we are fighting the barbarians to watkins did you get any descriptions anything definite not of your man no but there was something what was that its to be an inside job i laughed and the man looked at me angrily whats funny mate im sorry i said but it would have to be have you seen the place its guarded rather completely lupa was absently running his fingers through some dirt in a pot next to him he seemed lethargically calm until he spoke at which time he fired his questions at the other man where was he caught marseilles usual narcotics stuff he was delivering to their man in st etienne why didnt the fools let him deliver i think youve answered your own question the foolthat is our manwanted to make sure he didnt escape they knew something big was going on in this area he wanted to get a piece of it and lose the pie in the bargain lupa was annoyed and i could see why one other thing bothers me watkins said whats that i think he is here to assassinate that is patently a part of it remember we have hadwhat is it nowthree deaths of operatives in the past year its just a hypothesis but it is corroborated by the lack of any other overt activity until he moves thats all of course no clues but the man must sooner or later make a mistake he must he shrugged and reached into his pocket for some more olives someone walked into the store and anna went to the front lupa pulled up a stool and sat down he seemed completely engrossed in the plant beside him suddenly he looked up and spoke i hope youre right because if he is only here to blow the factory then when the job is done hell disappear whereas if he is here for a dual purpose one job may give us the clue to the other you think hes the man who killed routier asked watkins do you think he isnt then he must have been precisely lupa said he must have been among our gathering last night i started to object after all everyone who had been there was a friend but even as i began my defense i realized that there was no other conclusion thats good watkins said it narrows the field considerably yes lupa agreed yes it does he got up and beckoned me to follow him he paused at the screen to the back door joseph youll have to go to st etienne anna turned around to wave goodbye and we proceeded back through the cellar which was now brightly lit and stunning in color as well as fragrance another walk through the tunnel and we reappeared in lupas rooms i sat across from him the weight of my friends death had begun to settle on me again i must have looked tired what are your ideas lupa had gone to an oversize overstuffed chair id like a beer he said but he didnt get up id like some sleep i said we spoke in english id say you need it but first what do you think of st etienne and our list of suspects thats been bothering me i said i mean the fact that it looks like the man were after is a friend of mine going on that assumption everyone has a plausible opportunity but i stopped he grunted it begins to look that way more than you know i said i got up walked out to the kitchen and up the stairs ordered two beers at the bar and returned he nodded graciously when i handed him a bottle and took a long drink i detest drinking beer from a bottle but what can one do he drank again more than i know list our suspects i said paul anser lives in st etienne georges lavoie delivers there as does henri pulisi would assume even to the arsenal itself georges with his firstaid supplies and henri of course with his food its one of those newfangled buildings where the workers have their own cafeteria and medical facility ive heard tania talk about it tania thats the worst part he finished his beer and waited one of tanias oldest acquaintances through her husband who was a french officer anyway one of their friends was maurice ponty who happens to be the director of the st etienne arms factory she still sees him about once a month lupa leaned back in his chair and sighed deeply thats everyone except fritz no not except fritz you have something on him i asked some connection lupa shook his head i was loath to consider him because of his cooking he is so sympathetique still that is a flaw in my own method but you just said you have nothing on him nothing definite jules but certainly something it stretches the bounds of coincidence that every one of your guests has some foreign connection until i have satisfied myself with fritzs references in germany before the war began i have to include him among the suspects i have a man working on it now but what possible i began jules please i must suspect everyone even me he was young a look of ineffable sadness crossed his countenance im afraid my new friend even you i stood up the beer is terrible but it isnt that i must be getting on home would you like me to have fritz send up a case of my beer if it wouldnt spook you that would be excellent he said lifting the corners of his mouth in what perhaps he thought was a broad smile meanwhile ill get some sleep and then try and contact everyone and see what i can find lupa seemed to consider something then stopped me from leaving by raising his hand jules he said a small point but in english the word contact should never be used as a verb au revoir i replied with dignity then turned on my heels left him and began walking home through the gray and dismal afternoon stones crunched noisily under my feet as i trudged homeward the sound a somber coda to the theme playing over and over in my mind lupa had said i must suspect everyone and he was right i walked slowly hands deep in my pockets head down everyone i thought of the word as a sledgehammer pounding into the wall of reluctance i had built against suspicion of my friends and they had been my friends every one of them now until this was all over they would not be friends and they might never be again i remembered how it had all begun with paul anser it had been in paris around what had he been doing there ah yes publishing something he did actually publish poetry i had two or three of his bound collections and even an autographed manuscript at the house there had been a party i recall with lots of young men from london taking the grand tour as well as several charming young women i had the feeling that id been asked to chaperon but that suited me the crowd was lively and intelligent a far cry from the stultifying soirees held by the wives of military men to further their husbands careers paul had been the entertainment or part of it and he was well received afterward though when most of the younger set had paired off i had seen him standing alone looking rather at sea and i took pity on him his command of french then was not so good as it has become and we spoke english discovering to our mutual delight that we were neighbors when he had returned to valence several weeks later he had called on me while marcel had been visiting and wed had such a good time drinking beer andsignificantlytalking politics that we all decided to make a regular event of it so it had been paul marcel and me from the start seen from a certain perspective and one that i had truthfully never considered until this moment it had been or could have been a most fertile field for espionage back in the beginning wed all shared the common confidences of newfound friends had it all been masterful grilling on pauls part i thought back i had aired my disagreements over policy rather freely marcel had done the same to the extent that paul had been fascinated hanging on our words we had felt flattered viewing him with friendly condescension those naive neutral isolationist americans we had thought now i bitterly recast the litany in my mind we naive romantic gullible french dark rain clouds scudded against the overcast sky i had been wandering lost in contemplation though valence wasnt a particularly large city i found myself in an unknown neighborhood as a light drizzle began to fall ancient houses leaned threateningly over narrow stone streets i considered turning around trying to retrace my route but since id been paying no attention whatever i realized that i was truly lost turning back wouldnt help there was nothing to do but continue walking hoping i would stumble upon some familiar landmark everyone henri had been the next it had come about naturally enough since i bought my beermaking supplies from his shop i remember the first time wed gotten into a discussion of technique he had a particularly dependable supplier of excellent german hops german hops his interest was so genuine his personality so forthright that i had spontaneously decided to ask him around and he became the most regular of the guests his attendance was never in doubt which now that i thought of it was provocative with a wife and a large family as well as a prospering business he might have been expected to have the most demands on his time instead our weekly gatherings were obviously a matter of great priority to him why just the past night hed left his wife in the middle of a disagreement as lupa had pointed out were our beer meetings more important to him than his domestic harmony and if they were why again i reflected on his bluff exteriora happy lifeloving greek and the more i thought on it the more incongruous were his business successes and his easy camaraderie with our varied and rather highbrow group a deadend street brought me up short i was just as content to be lostthe physical disorientation matched my mental turmoil i was losing faith in the world i lived ina world where my friends were not as they seemed where love and trust might be bargaining chips and duplicity the coin of the realm everyone i could not have met georges more innocuously late last summer just after id come down here i was returning from a bit of business in st etienne in my motorcar when i came upon a welldressed limping figure hitchhiking on the roadway new to the area georges had miscalculated the distances between a few of his sales calls in st etienne and so had missed his train back to valence during the drive we struck up a fascinating discussion on the question of reincarnation and i sensed that he would fit in perfectly among my beer guests and so it had proved and yet there were coincidences that a mind more suspicious than my own might not have overlooked that first wednesday meeting with georges in attendance was also marcels first day back in the area in other words it was within two weeks of our first operatives death and that of course meant that georgess arrival in valence occurred within days of that accident further of all of our number he had the least history i had known of or had references to account for each of my other friends each of the other suspects finally and more subjectively i have had a great deal of experience with members of my profession and if there can be said to be a type of mind in the field georgess most neatly fit that categoryheavily reliant on facts possessed of enough originality to deduce from those facts marcels glaring flaw and lupas forte plus a certain glibness a way of getting by on the surface of events while chaos reigns on the operative level the psychological babble was fine in its place and yet the fact remained that georges had not even been in the same room when marcel had taken his last draft and no service in the world would hire a man with georgess limpit was simply unheard of a recognizable square loomed ahead of me in the drizzle and i found myself suddenly almost too dispirited to keep moving toward it what was the point of going home what indeed was home another hollow concept such as loyalty duty honorall fine words to fight and die over but nothing to take too seriously but the old discipline directed my footsteps just as my training led my thoughts back to the issue the stakes here were nothing less than survival and sentiment must be viewed only as a dangerous luxury an enemy as deadly as any i would ever face everyone how could fritz have lived in my house for a year without causing me a moment of suspicion and yet who was more ideally suited to keep tabs on my movements and report on them no one had had a better opportunity to place poison in marcels bottle except of course lupa who had been sitting in that seat but my trust in lupa had proven itself well grounded or had it perhaps hed kept me alive last night for another future purpose perhaps in some other game i was a bishop and marcel a quickly expendable pawnperhaps and maybe and again perhaps my mind was beginning to reel with uncertainties with possibilities everyone and even tania no not tania not the only woman i had ever loved it was unthinkable even if it killed me i would not suspect her i shook my head trying as best i could to purge the poisonous thought and looked up to find myself in the middle of the square still confused and lonelier than i had ever felt before the rain became fierce and again i found myself soaked in no mood to continue an already disagreeable walk i hired a carriage back to my home fritz greeted me at the door with undisguised concern tempered with reproval are you well sir damn it fritz no no im not well im drenched my clothes are ruined for the second time im tired and my oldest friend has been murdered in my house no im not well at all he stood back and silently took my clothes im sorry to snap i said but it has been a trying time monsieur lupa came by this morning and told me you were in good hands madame chessal went home after breakfast would you like some tea or brandy he handed me my robe and i went into the front room to sit before the fire where i brooded for a while about my age until fritz came back with tea laced with brandy after one cup i fell off to sleep fritz woke me again when it was already dark served me a small meal of coddled eggs with sherry and black butter and suggested i retire which i did ironically but predictably the sun blazed forth on friday morning for marcels funeral and found me well rested fritz always rose at dawn and when the weather permitted breakfasted by himself in the arbor since i was rarely awake by then he justly considered this his time and i was loath to disturb him so i poured myself a cup of espresso before walking out i was ashamed of myself for the way id acted the day before these days at home had weakened me i resolved to shake myself out of this softness i walked to the arbor in my robe and bare feet enjoying the feel of the wet grass fritz sat on a cushion that hed brought out for the stone bench eating a brioche with some ripe brie and drinking his coffee already at seven oclock the chill had gone from the air the house and arbor had a striking newly washed quality a slight mist rose from the shingles of the roof good morning fritz dont get up no muffins for me ill just be having coffee in the mornings for a while we sat for a while without speaking the stream murmured peacefully at such a time it was hard to imagine the trenches the carnage a europe perhaps soon a worldat war yet it would be fatal to be lulled to allow oneself to forget fritz pulled me from my reverie after hed drained his cup youre going to the funeral yes of course madame chessal then asks if youll pick her up on the way in a half hour i had dressed and gone to the old servants quarters where i kept my automobile a ford from america that id been allowed to keep after mobilization though thered been a substantial and very local tax for the privilege the car started without any problem and within minutes i pulled up to tanias house she sat out on the front patio of the long light blue structure nibbling halfheartedly at her croissant good morning i said she stood quickly and came over to embrace me she looked tired but you she said where did you go that monsieur lupa wound up taking care of you are you all right i patted her shoulder im fine i think i just needed to forget or perhaps to remember at any rate to lay marcel to rest im perfectly well now come are you ready you dont look as though youve had such a wonderful night yourself she took my arm leaning a fragrant head for a moment against my shoulder she sighed sometimes were so alike its frightening i couldnt stop thinking about poor marcel last night im afraid i drank rather too much wine danielle had to put me to bed fritz did the same for me we got into the car and drove to the cemetery the service wasnt due to begin until ten oclock so we had nearly two hours to walk through the surrounding countryside and compose ourselves i decided that my suspicions about tania on the day before had been ridiculous but resolved not to say anything unnecessary to anyone until this mess had been cleared up when we finally walked down to the cemetery proper georges and paul had arrived paul looked especially out of place in a dark suit in the time that id known him i couldnt ever recall having seen him dressed even semiformally before we joined them by the gate gradually some other of marcels friends and relatives began to appear and the four of us who had been in the room that night found ourselves effectively ostracized henri and his wife arrived among a small group who left them immediately after theyd passed the gate madame pulis whom id never met was weeping and tania walked over to comfort her henri joined the rest of us after a few moments of uncomfortable small talk we walked over to the grave marcels parents had died long ago and he hadnt been married i had probably been his closest friend and yet the others around the grave treated all of us as though wed been his enemies we stood in a knot while the usual forms were followed and when the body had been lowered were the first to turn and go madame pulis had been constantly crying throughout georges walked crookedly next to me rather ugly wasnt it yes i said but i dont suppose you can blame them gathered around my car we stopped to talk tania packed madame pulis into their carriage and walked pensively back i cant understand those people she said henri your wife she stopped i know i know i suppose i shouldntve brought her along shes so emotional she was fine until we met that other group they asked if id been there wednesday and acted as if well you know and shes very sensitive to that sort of thing youd think one of us killed him the way they were acting paul was seated on the running board his tie now off his coat across his legs it appears he said that one of us did well i didnt stormed henri i goddamn well didnt i didnt say you did henri calm down but it isnt unreasonable to assume that one of us planted that poison now is it you might as easily assume that i did it i looked sharply at him georges spoke up have the police mentioned to any of you their suspicions motives hints clues everyone said no the point is they mentioned to me well we shouldnt go around picking each other to pieces they mentioned that it seemed to them to be at least as good a bet that it was suicide thats absurd i said id been with him most of the day he hadnt been depressed in fact hed been looking forward to the summer well the alternative of course said paul standing up is that one of us did it again not necessarily said georges what do you mean not necessarily one of us one of us isnt here lupa said henri it does seem strange he didnt come said tania though some people simply cannot abide funerals paul laughed no one likes funerals my wife does henri shook his head and we all laughed as the tension broke speaking of he smiled at all of us and began to walk to the carriage tania called after him and asked if she might go with him since id told her that i had business in st etienne the three of us remaining watched them move off slowly and i asked paul if he needed a lift georges said he had some deliveries to make at st etienne and would i mind if he accompanied us since he had to pick up his supplies we all agreed to meet later in the afternoon and i drove off alone toward la couronne on the way i remembered the beer id promised lupa and detoured back by way of my home chez moi i changed into something more comfortable and asked fritz if hed mind arranging the delivery of several cases of the beer to lupa since it was lunchtime fritz insisted i stay and have something to eat and he quickly prepared a small plate of ham croquettes fresh bread and a delicious paté made he said from the liver of a wild hare since he didnt hunt i had reason to doubt him though one of the neighborhood boys might have come around with his catch still wild hare or not it was excellent i had one of my own beers to overcome my lurking fear about them and during the first few sips fritz looked at me with real anxiety i smiled they dont produce cyanide of themselves i said he didnt think that at all funny and crossed back into the house where he could eat in his cool and shaded kitchen washing everything down with his daily demibouteille of uncomplicated wine i decided it would be a waste of time to see lupa before id been to st etienne and so i found myself for the second time that day with some spare time on my hands i walked slowly up the stairs to my room and reached into the false bottom of my lower lefthand drawer taking out my pistol it was an older but nevertheless effective weapon excellent for close quarters and concealment i dont know why id stopped wearing it when id returned home this last time that had been foolish it was a derringer its tiny butt overlaid with carved ivory for all its beauty it was a terribly powerful weaponthe same gun though of course an earlier model had been used to assassinate the american president lincoln i carried it in a special holster that i wore under my shirt up in my room i began to clean and oil its few moving parts so that by the time i left the house i felt finally prepared for the work i might have to do it was still early for our rendezvousi was meeting my friends at the town fountain at one thirtyso i stopped by tanias house to see if shed come back yet i found her inside fuming sitting down next to her i kissed her on the cheek is something wrong that man is such a she was so angry her voice was shaking and i thought you were to be in st etienne i explained the delay though her eyes still flashed in anger its not really youits him hes so infuriating i now now i continued henris under a lot of pressure and not henri that other man the one you asked to join us the other night lupa she stood up and stalked around the room whats he done she stopped and glared across at me then suddenly her face softened and she walked back and kissed me im sorry im just very upset lets go outside and talk shall we so we walked out to where shed eaten earlier that morning she asked danielle to bring us some tea then sat down now i said whats wrong whats lupa done hes done nothing hes just so arrogant he omits doing things and so superciliously well no im being hysterical she leaned forward and clasped her hands together on the table we were coming back and as you know madame pulis was very upset by the whole thing and i was thinking of the callousness of our fellow townspeople we happened to pass la couronne on our way and we saw your monsieur lupa sitting under the awning reading a newspaper and drinking beer i wanted to scold himall right i know im too much a mother sometimesbut i did want to i asked henri to stop now she continued stopping me before i could interrupt dont think i was going to snap at him for missing the funeral after all i realized that he hardly knew marcel i was just angry i really dont know why i stopped perhaps i was being too whimsical but nevertheless i did it henri let me out and i walked over and asked if hed mind if i joined him for a moment do you know what he said i smiled id guess he said something like to be frank with you yes i would mind well of course he wasnt that rude but i certainly wasnt made to feel very welcome after id sat down he carefully ignored me while he finished the column he was reading drank off his beer called for the waiter and ordered two more finally he looked straight at me and in the sweetest voice asked if id like some refreshment i asked for a café au lait and he appeared to shudder slightly as he ordered i asked him if something was wrong if hed rather i left no he said i simply have a prejudice against milk and coffee together in the same cup two tolerable beverages by themselves but together and here he turned his mouth up the smallest degree together rather like a man and a woman who individually are pleasant but who fail as a couple so we sat in silence until the waiter returned danielle came back with the tea and we poured i still fail to see my dear i said what hes done to so upset you i grant you that hes arrogant and outspoken but not without a certain charm well hes not learned to polish his charms so they appear cheap all right now what else she sipped at her tea as soon as the waiter had gone he looked at me in all politeness and now madame what can i do for you you look a bit tired i am a bit tired i said one of my dearest friends was buried this morning yes he answered as if to say well so what by this time i was so rattled that im afraid i rather blurted we were wondering why you hadnt bothered to attend the funeral we yes we those of us whod been at juless we were all there as was proper except of course for you he picked up his beer and drank as though completely dismissing me i tell you jules i was sorely tempted to slap him finally he put his glass down told me i was upset and asked me if i would care to lunch with him then he proceeded to speak of his upcoming lunch as though it were all that mattered in the world ill try to give you some of the flavor of it as she spoke tania tried to imitate lupas deep baritone sausages i was in spain a few years ago and one day i was standing outside a tapas bar and the smell of fresh sausage pulled me inside a large smiling woman señora beran was grilling ten or more sausages behind the bar and so i sat down and began talking with her she said the sausages were prepared by her son jerome and the recipe was his special secret but i was welcome to try them as soon as id tasted them i knew them to be superb and the flavor remained with me until indeed i could think of nothing else daily i went to this same bar and im afraid badgered that poor woman to distraction i had to have that recipe finally though i had to leave and since that time have tried unsuccessfully to duplicate that flavor ive written to jerome beran personally through his mother but hes been elusive so now once each month i try again not more often because the frustration of failure is bitter indeed and i dare to call myself a chef ha she looked down into her tea the forenoon breeze whipped her shining dark hair intermittently into her eyes she reached out her hand across the table for me to take it can you imagine jules he sat and talked about that sausage as though there were no war no deaths she paused for a moment to control her voice then when the sausage arrived he took a bite and immediately removed from his pocket a small notebook and wrote something its not right he said simply i must use less brandy and more fowl thereupon he proceeded to eat every last bit of sausage pausing at regular intervals to shake his head it was not until he had finished that he addressed himself to me again now as to your question madame by the way are you enjoying the sausage excellent wine even though its spanish dont you think food food food all right the mans a chef but really jules i patted her hand why didnt i attend the funeral he finally began there are two reasons both im afraid quite selfish one i dislike funerals a man is a man until his death after which he becomes mere mineral matter if one is of a cathartic cast there may be benefit in public interment but even then the catharsis is misdirected death is not tragedy but pathos two lately ive been becoming much too flexible in my schedule and i decided to end that flexibility he looked at me as though hed explained everything he is rather intractable i offered i was so upset by this time i didnt know what to do he sat looking at me from across that small table seemingly quite pleased with himself i wanted to leave but i wanted to well to make him mad so i stood up and said if i were you id be a little more careful more than one of us believes you killed marcel and i turned to go he spoke my name then so abruptly that everyone looked up and i came back to the table lets not be ridiculous he said i am an acquaintance of monsieur giraud in fact ive spoken to him at some length for now you are upset and i suggest you go home and get some rest with that he called for a carriage and sent me on my way what should i think of him jules is he a friend of yours of course lupa had told her nothing about our real relationship leaving it to me to make that decision id tried to be honest with tania as much as possible though i hadnt told her what i really was there had been no need and now i was reluctant to tell her because i was afraid of her afraid that she might not understand or on the other hand would understand too well so i temporized i wouldnt worry about monsieur lupa dear i said i spent the night at his place on wednesday after my walking took me downtown hed come to the gathering only to try my beer and was genuinely upset at the way things turned out hed only met marcel that afternoon and they had had no disagreements they seemed to get on quite well certainly he had no reason to kill him but which of us did she asked i shrugged i really dont know i dont know i slumped and stared down at the wellkept gravel of her terrace i cant believe he killed himself maybe henri is right she said with his rumors what are those he said that hes heard for the past several months that marcel had something to do with espionage with the war a chill passed through me henri said that where did he hear that i dont know well thats absurd ive known marcel all my life and but what if he was what if he was and another of us is and we dont know and he was killed by one of his friends to keep oh jules she said im afraid i stood up and she rose to embrace me im sorry she said i shouldnt be such a baby its just with all of this and the boys away at the front i just dont know what to make of things i kissed her and suddenly she stiffened against me whats that she demanded putting her hand under my arm where i kept my gun i had to tell her a pistol just to be safe her lip quivered she was going to cry jules please dont you get mixed up in this please now now i said im not mixed up in anything i merely felt a little nervous and decided at least to be in a position to protect myself should any of my friends i trailed off she buried her face in my shoulder and cried softly any of your friends why wont they leave us alone oh poor marcel her voice broke again she looked up at me pleadingly jules really youre not involved youre not a spy no i said no im not a spy im a middleaged man whos getting old and ready to retire with his lover i dont want anything to threaten that so i carry a gun but only until we find what happened to marcel all i want to do is brew beer and tend my vineyardsi picked up her chinand love you she smiled bravely i kissed her again and stepped back i have to go georges and paul will be waiting ill pick you up on the way back well stay together tonight i watched her walk off into the house then turned and headed down the stairs to the ford the damn thing was all i really did want to do was brew beer and tend my vineyards and live with tania but then what if tania were a spy no i wouldnt let myself think that it was hot in the car as i turned into the road id have to see lupa after id been to st etienne and i found myself hoping that fritz would deliver the beer before long i was as bad as lupa with his sausages my rituals were beginning to keep me from the pain of marcels death as a kind of insulation but my friend was dead and when the rituals were over that would remain so i drove slowly thinking of my own best sausage recipe and watching out for potholes the war was everywhere if normal life can be said to continue in a town stripped of its young men then normal life went on but of course the war touched everyone you knew or met and colored the mood of the entire countryside even as the sun shone brightly down on our fountain where paul sat with his pants rolled up cooling his feet the streets were cleared for a convoy of trucks and carriages carrying supplies to the front i pulled over and parked across the square watching the vehicles roll past then walked over to join my friends paul was smoking a cigarette and talking animatedly to georges they stopped as i drew nearer and paul pulled his feet from the water and rolled down his trousers ready yes lets go then we helped georges with his packages there seemed to be enough gauze for the entire army but he explained that there was to be a huge shipment to the front with the st etienne factory as the central warehousing point it took several trips but finally we loaded all the bags and after a demi at one of the cafes bordering the square we left paul took particular delight in sitting atop the bundles of gauze id removed the top to the car and as we drove along he sang offkey but with great enthusiasm he wanted to forget the funeral as soon as possible finally when the wind kept blowing his tobacco away before he could roll it he joined us in the front seat never had that problem on a horse we rode along then quietly for a while the trees passed quickly by on either side of the road paul smoked in what he called the french manner blowing the smoke out of his mouth and up into his nose georges sat against the other door looking reflectively at the passing scenery has it occurred to anyone he asked finally how incredibly inept the police have been about this whole thing youd think that it wasnt a possible murder they were investigating but something more in the line of a petty theft oh i dont know said paul i have to register every day at st etienne to make sure i dont try to leave the country thats because youre not french here i go off on business for the next four or five days and theyve asked me to prepare an itinerary of my stops but no checkin in the towns themselves if i had killed marcel i could be beyond algeria if i decided to leave it makes no sense its the war i said even forgetting that the heart of the force is gone to fight at the front for the rest all of their routines are upset and without their routines well they might as well be at the front for all the good they do here now georges said paul i suppose theyre doing something and we just dont know about it besides if you decided to go to africa that would be punishment enough for any crime i can think of what heat we were approaching st etienne and paul asked to be let out at a crossroads on the outskirts of town i live just about a mile down the road i mean two kilometers and i feel like walking ill see you allwhen wednesday i ventured it would be good to get back to normal actually it would be good to be able to predict where everyone would be at a certain time i dont know if i want to be in that room for a time though paul said why dont we make it somewhere else next week fine ill get back to you is that all right with you georges he nodded okay then said paul see you later ciao with that he turned and started up the road georges and i decided to light up cigarettes and so had not yet driven off when paul stopped two hundred meters away a man stepped out from behind one of the trees lining the road and spoke to him at that distance i could see nothing descriptive since georges was facing me he saw nothing and so without saying anything i engaged the gears and began to move when i glanced back both men had gone we continued on to st etienne content to remain silent i was wondering about paul in fact by this time i was wondering about everyone do you have time for a drink i asked georges always we stopped at a small dark bar and each of us ordered a cognac we sat near the door watching over the car and its load whats your business here asked georges oh im supposed to see some people about a vine graft in fact with all this mess about marcel im afraid i dont feel like doing any kind of business i was wondering if i could help you in your deliveries tania has told me a lot about the factory or asenal here whatever it is her friend maurice ponty is the director and id like to see it keep my mind from from other things delighted jules i could use the company maybe ponty could show us around normally i only deliver to the gates oh youve never been inside somehow i was both relieved and disappointed no tight security and all that normally henri and i come down together and leave everything with the attendants hmm i said rather pointlessly we finished our drinks and returned to the car after a few more minutes of driving we reached our destination the st etienne arsenal and munitions factory was indeed a large and modern affair it covered several hundred square meters of land on the eastern edge of the city bounded by what must have been a tributary of the rhone that carried away much of the waste when the day was clear and the wind from the right direction you could see the smoke from the stacks as far away as valence a thick sulfurous cloud usually hung over the structure brick chimneys to a height of nearly thirty meters had been built to lift the smoke so that it wouldnt settle on the nearby houses the entire structure was surrounded by a fence of barbed wire and guarded every twentyfive meters or so by troops the building itself was made of a kind of adobe which was originally white but even in the short time since its opening had turned a sickly dirty yellow we went first to the delivery area where georges presented his papers and unloaded his supplies then we drove to the main gate parked and approached the sentry box yes what do you want said the guard wed like to visit if we may georges replied the guard laughed heartily impossible georges and i looked helplessly at one another and he began again but ive been delivering here since youve opened wed just like to look around inside the guard stopped laughing and blew on his whistle within seconds four other guards had run up weapons at the ready i decided to speak id like to see monsieur ponty at the mention of the directors name the guards looked at one another indecisively finally one of them went into the building after about ten minutes which seemed much longer because of the heat and the circumstances the guard returned with a short round cheerfullooking man you asked for me i am monsieur ponty yes i am a friend of tania chessal shes spoken so much to me about your operation here id hoped to be privileged with a look for myself jules giraud is my name there was a hint of recognition in his eyes and he nodded to the guards who started back to their posts and this man he asked indicating georges georges lavoie monsieur he has been delivering your medical supplies for some time and is a personal friend he stared for another moment come with me we crossed the wide yard of gravel and i couldnt help noticing the scrutiny with which we were observed from every direction there were sentries posted at the gates along the fence at selected bunkers in the yard and on the roof ponty seemed to notice my interest and smiled he led us through the large glass doors and down a long corridor to his office the second room on the right i was surprised to find it so well furnished there was a bright rug covering the floor and several prints on the walls including van goghs the field at arles which i thought a very strange choice for the director of an arsenal to the right behind his desk were filing cabinets of a light drab wood and to the left an elegant bar his desk itself was a flat and large slab of oak which rested on unfinished timbers although the joints were perfectly matched it was an efficient office though not without personality we were seated so you are jules giraud tania speaks of you often i inclined my head slightly shes quite impressed with you and this place you know have you known her long oh quite some time i knew her husband before they were married a fine man you knew jean yes he was my neighbor ah yes yes of course i didnt wish to speak of jean chessal especially to a friend of his my conscience was not completely clear regarding him and how is tania he asked quite well i said not entirely truthfully she sends her best he smiled do ask her to come by soon she is a welcome guest anytime she doesnt visit nearly enough i will ask her though i somehow didnt think you solicited visitors here the guards we all laughed then in a brusque but friendly way he clapped his hands together and sat up straight now what can i do for you well frankly we decided to come to see you mostly out of curiosity monsieur lavoie here had some deliveries to make and i had other business in town which i chose to put off tania had told me so much about this building and about yourself that i thought id come by to meet you and to see some of your innovations you did did you there was more than a bit of flint in the mildly humorous gaze i raised a hand please stop me if im out of line be assured that i would monsieur it is no small matter that you have been allowed to come this far youre aware of that of course it wasnt a question and he continued but then weve carried on this farce long enough it isnt every day that one meets such a serious rival facetoface is it im afraid i dont completely understand i said come come monsieur giraud surely you dont think just anyone can enter this compound and i do think im justified in calling it precisely that probably there isnt another man or menhere he motioned to georgesin france that i would have allowed within these walls without an official reason just wanted to look over your innovations indeed he chuckled at my ludicrous suggestion i admit that bringing a visitor along with you and one with actual business here is a charming touch that shows real imagination and i begin to see what tania is talking about but lets admit the facts that you came by here for the same reason that i let you inplain curiosity all rightand not about our innovations georges picked up the tenuous threads hes found you out jules no doubt of it all right i said forcing a grin i had no choice but to press on hoping that ponty would drop some further clue as to what he was talking about ill admit iti simply had to discover what it was all about the director looked suitably downcast its about love yes i answered it is about love she told you then about my proposal of course i said my stomach sinking since in fact shed told me no such thing just the other day yes i expected she would have i must admit i never entertained much hope but i had to try again georges came to my rescue she is a remarkable woman he said who could blame you ponty sighed deeply then again clapping his hands softly in what i took to be a characteristic gesture he regained his businesslike composure well i am glad to meet you after all if i have to lose her it is some comfort to meet the man and realize that he is a gentleman i accepted the compliment with a nod nearly overcome with relief that tania had turned him down then distressed anew by the secrets she kept from me but this was no time to reflect on that im sorry if my curiosity seems callous i said i had no intention please he said waving me off put the thought from your mind what could be more natural but to satisfy your curiosity about me completely i suppose i should show you our operations here after all eh how does the saying gojudge a man by his creation the st etienne arsenal is my creation monsieur giraud it is the thing of which i am most proud at that moment a guard passed in the hall and looked in prompting georges to speak up frankly im very impressed with your security yes ponty replied i doubt rather strongly that anything save a massive assault could cause us much inconvenience i might add we dont envision an assault of that kind around here still considering the kind of work were doing we cant be too careful come we rose and went back out to the corridor he turned to georges what is it that you deliver medical supplies gauze bandages no real medicine ah yes fortunately we havent had many accidents i hope we can keep your deliveries small now thenhe stopped in front of the first door wed passed coming inas you know we make most kinds of arms and munitions supplies here so really our security amounts to national security open that door monsieur giraud i stepped up to the heavy door and found it locked ponty squatted down and slid a card under the door then knocked four times the door swung open from within onto a small closetlike enclosure on either side of the space sat an armed guard the room was devoid of decoration and contained only a door against the opposite wall ponty walked across the tiny area to that door and tried it but it too was locked then he turned and walked back to us closing the first door behind him the explosives room he explained we change the guards every three hours because the anteroom is so you saw it with every shift we change the cardandknock sequence i dont mind telling you this because the guards are under orders to shoot to kill anyone who gets them to open the doors by deception only myself my immediate assistant or the guards replacements may be admitted into that room anyone else will be shot i said soberly but you had me try the door ponty laughed a perfect way to eliminate my archrival yes but you see you were in no danger only if you had had my card knocked four times and been admitted would you have been shot im sorry if i scared you i held up a hand laughing hollowly i dont scare that easily he waited for a moment at the door to the explosives room a janitor pushing a wide broom shuffled his way past us not so much as lifting his head to acknowledge us ponty seemed to be observing him carefully clearly the presence of visitors would not be viewed as an excuse to slack off on duties friendly chap i ventured ponty shrugged nervous i guess some of em are here he sighed i guess it isnt the easiest thing in the world working inside what amounts to the biggest bomb in france georges cleared his throat and ponty took that as a signal to continue our tour the next door down the hallway opened into an enormous cacophonous inferno but ponty had no hesitancy about gesturing us in four huge boilers hissed and steamed against one wall to our right while two shovelwielding stevedores fed coal to the burners under them the rooms temperature was staggering like a proud homeowner ponty walked us around the boilers were of heavily reinforced steel loaded with gauges that screamed under their internal pressures lining the back wall of the room was a small mountain of coal being slowly chipped away by the workers dozens of arteriesinsulated pipingemanated from the heart of the arsenals power plant what goes on here georges yelled over the din ponty motioned us back outside into the relative cool of the hall he was beaming impressive isnt it is every room here frightening georges asked that frightened you its a vision of hell ponty chuckled well put like that i suppose one might say it is after all it did seem awesomely powerful he nodded it has to be weve got power needs here that i cant discuss but they rival those of many small towns in effect weve got our own generator weve got to be able to control our power keep it regular allow no surges am i getting too technical not at all georges said its rather fascinating i agreed we turned a corner and entered another long and narrow hall pontys words echoed off the bare walls mingling with the memory of the other rooms straining engines i was beginning to feel the building more as a living thing and could understand pontys nearly paternal pride in its structure as well as his fear for its safety you see he said although much of the work we do here is production line stuffmaking ammunition and so onthere is also a great deal of stressrelated research and testing to say nothing of the power needed to keep a place like this heated and lit over three shifts seven days a week those boilers never shut down georges seemed to be pondering something but compared to the ammunition room they seemed poorly guarded the point seemed to come home to ponty you know they may be now that you mention it but there is so much here that must be guarded fulltimeexplosives are one example the research rooms are anotherand we do only have so many men i guess we have to draw the line somewhere it seems somehowgeorges paused looking for the right wordless thorough i suppose ponty stopped before a pair of double doors which we would soon discover led to the development rooms for armored vehicles but before we entered he wanted to close the book on this discussion it probably seemed to him as though we were calling his procedures into question and he wanted to set the record straight monsieur lavoie he said you forget that you are taking this tour with me the director the men shoveling coal in that room are soldiers as are nearly all members of the staff perhaps you didnt notice the weapons on their belts georges shook his head ah just so anyone entering any room here without authorization does so at tremendous risk to his own life i assure you and there are always soldiers there we can never let our power go down i will tell you frankly though i cant be too specific that certain researches we are undertaking certain chemicals and so on are held in an extremely precarious balance by electrical currents and constant temperatures among other things slight fluctuations can be fatal no we take extreme care im sure georges didnt mean to imply any negligence i tried to calm our host certainly not georges replied i was merely curious but ponty had one more nail to hammer home all our rooms are manned at all times even my own office now sitting empty is guarded we dont let up our vigilance ever i was glad i was with georges with his cosmopolitan air he smiled suavely including us all into his fraternity and we are most grateful for that vigilance sir the whole country is grateful ponty took obvious satisfaction in the compliment his eyes darted quickly to me and i nodded hoping my unspoken affirmation would lessen the sense of rivalry georges continued the whole thing is just so amazing to me ive come here so often to deliver and ive seen your men loading for large deliveries the logistics are just too awesome to comprehend it seems as though every man in france is out there helping load munitions for the front pontys eyes twinkled he was obviously somewhat taken with georges often in my career and in my life id noticed that once a person has tapped one emotion in another a door may be opened to other emotions georges had angered ponty and the directors response had compromised his natural reserve and professional manner once georges had cooled his anger the door was open to friendship we were all suddenly members of the same clubmen of similar natures caught up in the most serious of endeavors unable to trust or love or find release from the unbearable tensions of the times ponty smiled warmly now ill let you both in on something then since youve been so astute when we have heavy shipments everyone helps even myself for fifteen perhaps twenty minutes we are all pack mules except of course for the guards at the explosives rooms they never ever leave their posts georges returned pontys smile your secret is safe with us eh jules to our graves i responded and now ponty said opening the double doors let me show you our tour continued for the next hour or so none of the other rooms it turned out was as closely guarded as the explosives room though security everywhere was tight the factory made everything from bullets and bombs to rifles and cannons the next cavernous room was dedicated to working out the rough edges of a motorized armored car with mounted cannons which ponty thought would become a powerful new battlefield weapon the preliminary sketches and models we saw were impressive but it seemed to me that they still had a long way to go ponty hoped to complete a working model within six months though and georges after careful consideration pronounced himself in agreement with that verdict there were many other research rooms which ponty could not show us he apologized for this and we both assured him we understood completely and had very much enjoyed the look around finally mauricehe was maurice by thenshowed us to the door and bade us adieu we dont have visitors very often he said and as you said we dont want them but its been a pleasure showing you both around maurice turned to me jules im glad that you decided to satisfy your curiosity with that we shook hands and he disappeared back into the building walking back to the car georges and i were thoughtful it was now dusk the factories would be closing within the hour and i wanted to get back home life is sure full of surprises georges remarked elbowing me slightly i said nothing but thought instead of the questions i would have for tania very impressive place georges said diplomatically changing the subject i wouldnt be too worried about a breach of security if i were maurice that anteroom scared me to death to say nothing of the boilers yes i said unless the germans take st etiennein which case well have lost the war anywayid say that factory is safe awfully modern building isnt it i loved it i could have stayed all day something was bothering me so i thought id better say it yes i noticed how acute your interest was i thought youd be bored in there though i was glad you accompanied me bored not at all fascinated truly fascinated perhaps ive never mentioned it jules but my initial love was architecture i studied it for years in school and only my fathers passionate belief that all art was somewhat effetebacked by his promise to withhold any financial aid to myselfpersuaded me to enter the dynamic and exciting world of business he seemed genuinely bitter the sarcasm heavy i didnt mean i began sorry that i had touched a nerve no thats all right people in the end do what they truly want to do i suppose we talked on for a few more minutes before i dropped him off at a hotel as usual in spite of the large delivery today he had calls to make for the remainder of the week the weekend notwithstanding unfortunately the need for my products keeps increasing it may be good for business but i find it difficult to rejoice in the fact will you be able to make it by next wednesday i asked i assume so ill leave a message if im delayed fine until then the drive home was long and uneventful i usually dont like to drive at night and by the time i had reached the road to valence it was completely dark my headlights flushed a few animals along the way but otherwise i saw nothing and heard only the sound of the engine which drowned out my soft humming of the marseillaise after dinnera simple coq au vin and a bottle of beaujolaistania and i sat in the kitchen with brandy the living room still made us nervous and fritz said he didnt mind the intrusion so we sat on wooden chairs across the table from one another it was a quiet night the large stone fireplace crackled from time to time and fritz cleaning up moved easily about when hed finished he turned down the lamps and left us alone the room was a montage of pale yellow light and black shadows something probably a mouse scampered across the floor tania was wearing a light blouse with a tan wraparound skirt that came to a few inches above her ankles she was beautiful enough to get away with that kind of dress though it would properly be considered fairly risqué her long hair fell across her face and looking across at her i found it very hard to believe that she was beginning her fifth decade i got up came around the table and kissed her are you feeling better i asked yes i went to see your friend ponty today her shoulders stiffened a little what were you doing at the arms factory georges had to deliver there and i decided it would be a nice break to put off my appointment today and see this place youve talked about so much it is a very impressive sight though i wish they could do something about the smoke i know she said isnt the smell terrible horrible but i suppose when one works with sulfur thats impossible to avoid we heard fritz moving about behind us in his room he usually did exercises and then read a bit before going to bed how did you find maurice she asked i described our tour including the little episode at the door to the explosives room tania smiled and said that sounded just like maurice we sipped at our brandy and the silence came back to surround us there would never be a better time tania i began then stopped terrified to me she was the most attractive woman in the world and if i pressed on now i ran the risk of losing her but i really had no choiceif i couldnt ask i had already lost her why didnt you tell me about pontys proposal her shoulders sagged slightly as she put her snifter down oh she said he told you about that it quite hurt me i said truthfully oh jules im sorry she reached out across the table and covered my hand maurice and i are only friends obviously maurice doesnt feel the same way i know i was very surprised i dont understand why you wouldnt have told me she shrugged squeezing my hand it didnt matter it had no effect on us why did you need to know are we operating on a need to know basis now what does that mean of course not i just didnt think it was so important or appropriate and really jules it isnt a marriage proposal isnt important not unless id have said yes which i did not i covered her hand with my own and stared into her guileless and beautiful face im afraid im uncomfortable with these secrets between us she lowered her gaze and her voice her words seemed to have been wrung from her against her will as though the necessity of having to admit it belied its own truth there are no secrets between us before i could respond there was a crashing sound against the front door i bolted up and ran to see what it had been outside the night was inky black and i could barely make out even the shadows of trees faintly though i heard what i took to be several pairs of retreating feet and some highpitched giggling tania had brought up a lantern and stood behind me on the ground i could make out a large rock which i bent over to pick up there was a paper tied to it and on the paper a crude drawing of a skull i turned around and found tania crying now now i said it was simply a group of kids you know they do this kind of thing often enough and especially after word spread about marcels murder in this house if you listen you can still hear them giggling listen and over the quiet fields did come the sound of young voices muffled and diminishing but still audible we moved back inside and stood in the foyer in spite of my words to tania i was shaken this sort of thing did happen i suppose on occasion but with suspicions already so high it did my nerves no good i walked back to the kitchen for another brandy which i drank much too quickly coming back through the dark sitting room i turned into the stairway and stood transfixed by what i saw tania stood silhouetted against the top of the stairs holding the lantern in her left hand her recent tears still glistened on her face her hair hung to her shoulders and she had undone her blouse which now hung open before her very quietly she spoke jules come to bed im afraid later i could not sleep overcome by the events of the day ashamed that i had doubted tania unnerved by the childrens prank i got up and looked out the window the only sound was the gurgle of the brook as it flowed through the arbor a crescent moon had just risen and it was somehow reassuring in my mind i went over the details of the st etienne arsenal so that i could report the next morning to lupa at my desk i lit the lamp and sketched from memory the general floor plan that took my mind off my worries and by the time i finished i felt sleepy i remembered though to write fritz a note to have him wake me early then i came back to the bed where tania lay and crawled in beside her but just before i dozed off i thought i heard the sound of a car engine starting accompanied by indistinguishable voices drifting over the fields finally fading into the noise of the engine as it roared toward st etienne tania did not stir when fritz knocked once discreetly i rose immediately tapping once on my bedstead to let him know i was awake after a fast cup of coffee and several minutes of fritzs remonstrance over my sagging appetite i was on my way to lupas la couronne hadnt yet opened but charles stood behind the bar dusting and let me in after only a short wait lupa had given instructions that no one was to come to the kitchen without his approval so i sat at the bar and had another coffee while charles went to announce me he returned and i followed him down the narrow staircase to the kitchen lupa sat majestically at the table clad in a brown silk robe with a yellow monogram cleaning up the remainder of what had been his breakfast one of the problems with being ones own cook he began immediately motioning me to be seated is deciding an order of courses that provides variety yet leaves oneself free to enjoy each course without having to tend to the next these muffins jules have become too cold while waiting for the eggs to set i noticed he was having no trouble however in finishing off the cooled muffins the eggs had by the looks of the plate long since disappeared i mentioned this to him yes but its not as enjoyable as it should be as every meal should be every mans life is divided up into eating sleeping and miscellaneous omnia vita in tres partes divisa est if i might borrow from caesar of their conscious moments only in their enjoyment of food are all men brothers i could think of several other conscious moments that might qualify as universally pleasing but he was enjoying himself so i let him expound and here i am presuming to call myself a cook a chef ha jules i nearly let the coffee boil i shook my head sadly in commiseration in spite of his petulance which tania had found so objectionable i found him entertaining he knew as well as anyone possibly better than anyone the gravity of our situation but he wouldnt let himself be bogged down in depression he was a tonic to my flagging spirits did you get the beer i asked ah yes thank you consistently excellent fritz brought it around yesterday he pushed back his chair and settled himself more comfortably after offering me breakfast or coffee which i declined he picked up his cup and sipped madame chessal came by to see me yesterday yes i know she told me about it she seemed rather upset by my lack of interest in the ahem proprieties i tried to explain to her that worry merely clouds the intellect that i meant no slight to monsieur routier that i had been enthusiastic about sausage because i was talking about sausage and that enthusiasm is a state of mind i try to cultivate about many subjects im afraid my explanation fell on deaf ears she left in rather a huff she was upset about marcel i said theyd known each other a long time i understand that but you understand i didnt want to discuss marcels death with her until i was certain she was not involved are you i asked hopefully unfortunately no youre serious arent you perfectly jules perfectly how could i allay his suspicions when only yesterday i had harbored them myself still i forced a response at the risk of usurping your methods do you have anything specific or is it just a feeling lupa sipped again at his coffee smacked his lips with pleasure then looked levelly at me across his desk the questions i have regarding madame chessals involvement in our inquiries fall into both categories first i must confess to a certain feeling that in a general way she is not being completely forthright that she is hiding something it may be nothing it may be that she cultivates an aura of mystery many women do you know believing that it makes them interesting in fact it creates an impression of a fascinating personality that is all the more disappointing when the aura itself is revealed to be a sham he continued before i could remonstrate i dont say that is the case here i merely comment on my feeling specifically there are several points my operatives have stumbled on madame chessal many times in and around st etienne she certainly has ready access to the arsenal there as you yourself have pointed out she has a relationship of some sort with the director secondly poison is a classic womans weapon for murder additionally i find it worthy of note that she is the only woman in what would otherwise be a vigorously masculine grouping how is that noteworthy i had to cut in his suspicions of tania seemed to me to be no more than a general indictment of female human beings and i told him so its true i do have a prejudice there probably inherited from my father but i have verified it on my own many times but were talking specifically here about tania i understand that dont become upset jules i would expect you to defend her to be blind to the striking singularity of one woman fitting in so easily with five or six different men it is certainly odd enough to be labeled a hard fact and to warrant some explanation she has always not true i understand that she only began attending regularly within the past year or two with her husband in the area how could she he smiled his point won and finished his coffee in a gulp i merely state that it is worthy of investigation and i intend to look into it there are other issues that i would prefer for the time being to keep to myself but i assure you that i view them as significant or potentially significant but come this is a small avenue of pursuit and we have much more to discuss shall we table madame chessal for the moment reluctantly but seeing the wisdom of the suggestion i agreed and told him i had the plans for the arsenal with me he asked me to wait until hed dressed and then i could report at length excusing himself he went into his quarters almost immediately i heard two voices coming from his rooms one his the other female the woman sounded angry and became more so as they talked finally after several minutes of increasing volume came the sound of a hand slapping down violently on a table or desk and lupas voice not loud but devastatingly authoritative enough leave well discuss this later then he appeared back in the kitchen bah he said sitting down im sorry about that but that woman nags me much too often do all women insist on scheduling time for their men not to my knowledge i said well i wont have it he leaned back and closed his eyes for a moment his face clearing almost instantly he had excellent control now then those plans i took the crumpled and hastily drawn sketch from my pocket and together we looked at it i explained some of my impressions of the place pointing out that the arsenal was impossible to enter forcibly in my years as an agent ive learned to recall almost completely events conversations and impressions which was lucky since he asked me to recount everything that had happened the day before since id met tania for the funeral he leaned back with his eyes nearly closed and didnt move at all as i talked he interrupted me three times once to ask if i could identify the man id seen meet paul once to ask me to repeat everything i could remember ponty saying from the time we met him until we were shown the explosives anteroom and again to ask if i was certain that the rockthrowing incident had been a prank to which i answered no i wasnt certain of anything when id finished he said pulis as far as i know he spent the day consoling his wife he also spent the better part of the afternoon reading a newspaper at the train station he said can you think of why he might have done that i shook my head no you should call on him i suppose you havent aroused suspicion with any of them have you no ive decided to have another beer gathering next wednesday though im not sure where it ought to be that will give everyone a chance to get back together restore our confidence in one another lay some suspicion to rest most of them seem to want to believe it was suicide rubbish i know but let them think that for a time it wont make them wary of me when i ask questions or at least less wary than if they thought i suspected one of them had killed him satisfactory was all he said i asked him if hed had any trouble with the police no they havent been around i asked i didnt say that i merely said i havent had any trouble with them i wouldnt speak with them charles told them i had gone shopping and i would call them back at my convenience then they wanted to search my quarters which of course would have been intolerable so charles said he didnt know where i lived and they believed him one thing i dont need at a time like this is the police i assume theyre content to believe it was suicide also i shrugged since i really didnt know all right he said ill try to avoid being bothered by them though when they find out i live here theyll be around snooping for cyanide and whatnot they havent been much of a bother to me i said i found the police no more competent than he did but i saw no reason to antagonize them gratuitously you are a rich man jules you have standing in this area you are in short more or less above suspicion i am poor a foreigner unknownin short a perfect scapegoat of course i could demonstrate my innocence if given enough time or i could save that time by delivering the murderer and time is short so saying he took a large silver watch from his vest pocket all the times i had seen him hed been wearing suits of drab brown he never looked seedy but neither would welldressed be an adequate description today was no exception though he had slipped a vest over the pale yellow shirt he wore no coat while indoors and when he cooked he wore no tie glancing at his watch he started nearly nine oclock i must be up on the street he was peeved i supposed at me for coming down and causing him to vary his schedule when wed gotten settled outside i commented on the watch which i hadnt seen before yes it is lovely he said removing it again a gift from my parents one of my few real treasures would you like to see it he handed it across to me it was rather larger than was the fashion and seemed to be made of very pure silver judging from the weight turning it over in my hands i noticed the inscription on the back or rather the pair of initials s h i a and the date i was curious but said nothing and gave it back to him one of my fondest dreams is to someday own a house where i can keep things he began traveling has so long uprooted me that i think someday i would like a home where i could keep the things i love i could easily envision myself almost totally sedentary but now this watch is the only symbol i have of all i would like to have he sighed im surprised to find you so materialistic not at all i want nothing more than what the simplest shopkeeper has a house a sense of place a few loved possessions so often a mans surroundings become a mans background a man who runs with thieves becomes like a thief of course he went on stopping to order the first of his days beers its not absolute but id like a house made for my ideals so that i might grow into it he paused while the beermy beerarrived charles had thoughtfully brought out two bottles and we each had a glass take yourself jules you are an aristocrat no no dont objectthats not so bad you own land a house your interests are your own not dictated by the exigencies of survival and it shows the other night even drunk you paused to wipe off a table before setting anything on it even when it was a patently futile gesture no the way you live reinforces the way you act the way you act finally becomes the way you are by this time i was anxious to be off to visit henri i had probably been much like lupa when id been younger he was so enthusiastic about ideas about ideals i couldnt remember ever having known anyone so opinionated but he wasnt so much objectionable or obnoxious as timeconsuming and as hed said time was short i finished my beer and rose to leave as charles brought out another one for lupa along with a clutch of newspapers he looked up briefly will i see you i had barely nodded when he looked back down engrossed in his reading henri lived in a large apartment overlooking his shop it was a good distance from la couronne so i decided to take a hansom and enjoy the warm morning i remember not being overly concerned with whether taking a hansom was a particularly aristocratic thing to do or not it was a pleasant ride over the cobbled streets and in a quarter of an hour i found myself in front of henris door his eldest son was minding the shop which was not surprising i was a regular customer because of my beer supplies and the sons knew me slightly some flaw in my character keeps me from remembering the names of children and this boy was no exception so i entered the small and cluttered store and approached the gangling youth with a warm smile of recognition bonjour monsieur giraud likewise it seems to me that all children remember my name and glory in greeting me this way we shook hands good morning is your father here hes above thank you smiling to myself i walked over to the door that opened onto the staircase and knocked the boy had followed me over and he turned the knob for me thats all right go on up henri sat at the kitchen table leaning back in his blue work pants and apron none of the other children were about though noises behind me suggested their presence somewhere in the flat madame pulis was cutting onions and putting them in a large skillet over the fire i stood in the archway for a moment looking at the scene before knocking on the doorjamb they both turned at once madame puliss eyes were filled with tears i assumed from the onions henri seeing me immediately jumped up and put out his hand in greeting he seemed even more nervous than usual as we sat at the table we watched his wife finish cutting the onions and then he ordered her from the room my greek friend now slumping slightly over the table hands clasped tightly in front of him was a study in anxiety his hair was disheveled as though it had been combed earlier but something perhaps nervous hands had disturbed it there was an unfamiliar tic over his right eye which further enhanced his harried mien he looked a wreck when his wife had gone he looked at me heavily whats wrong henri you look terrible he got up abruptly and paced back and forth slowly across the kitchen pullingjerking reallyall the while at his mustache it all started yesterday with renee you remember at the funeral she was crying a lot well it really got to her all the folks there were treating us as if we were guilty of something and so she was crying she cries easily he stopped walking and looked at me imploringly all that was fine if you know renee youd know crying is no special event but some plainclothes flic at the funeral thought it was strange that one of the suspects wives should even bother coming much less be in tears so he thought we might know something and followed us home he sat down again you know me jules i get nervous easily and when he came around i got rattled and with renee crying all over i just walked out i know i know a mistake i snuck out really im a fool so then he started in on renee what were my feelings about marcel how well had she known him you know how insinuating they can be and he was but shed only met marcel maybe twice so what could she say finally he asks if he can look around the house and she says we have nothing to hide so he goes poking into everything and finds the supplies for robertyou know my second son anyway he finds roberts supplies for taking photographs which is his hobby and right there in a drawer is plenty of cyanide to kill marcel and a hundred other people so he says uhhuh interesting and leaves so when i got home at about six oclock theres no dinner and the house is dark and shes left a note that says shes gone to stay with her mother and taken the kids and i can come get her later not wanting to wait for her to come back i decided to go over there and find out what happened and who do i run into on the street but this same flic come to ask renee some more questions he looks at me for a minute and then says youre not a french citizen are you he paused for a moment id like a drink he rose and got two glasses filling one nearly to the top with pastis in the other glass he put a standard shot and added water he grinned nervously handing me the second glass straight its just like ouzo makes me feel at home he pulled again and again at his mustache taking slow little sips of the drink every few seconds he scratched at his head merde where was i are you a french citizen thats right french citizen well i told him that my papers were in order that he could see for himself if he came back to the house but he just started asking more questions about everybody you georges paul even tania wanted to know if i knew where that fellow lupa lived i told him i didnt know anything i didnt know lupa i hardly had known marcel then he started going on again about how well had renee and marcel known each other and it got fairly heated he said he was going to check all the other housestanias yours paulsand then get back to me so id better find my wife and be available what did you do after that he was loosening up as he always did when he drank well i went to get renee then we all came home and tried to sleep goddamn it jules cant a woman even cry at a funeral he put his hand down looking on the verge of tears i put my hand lightly on his shoulder take it easy henri its just the way of investigators they bother you they try to find breaks in stories dont worry but i was worried cyanide was not so common a poison that anyone else would likely have it where did you go yesterday afternoon i asked when you went wandering around oh i dont know just around you know when im upset i walk as if to prove his point he got up and started pacing again i didnt want to press it so i changed the subject id like to have everybody meet again next wednesday thats the real reason i had for coming up do you think you can make it i dont know he said simply at your house probably not ill send you a note i thought it would be good for us all to try and well you know he nodded will lupa be there yes do you suspect him id be lying if i said i didnt how well did he know marcel i laughed you thinking of joining the police force he smiled weakly youre right he said im sorry but its just that you get to suspecting everyone but how well do you know him fairly well all right renee he yelled suddenly the onions are burning his wife came back into the room apologetic it was the first time id seen her without tears in her eyes she was attractive in a tough sort of waythe kind of woman id expect henri to be withshort dark buxom subservient she stood silently by the stove stirring with a practiced rhythm it might do you good to go down to the store i suggested take your mind off things i hadnt touched my drink i offered it to him he drank it off in a gulp lets go he said on the staircase we stopped again if its any consolation i said no one came by to see either tania or myself last night maybe youll have no more trouble with him that seemed to make him nervous all over again he said hed be back here this morning well mornings nearly gone i said what time did you run into him last night early seven or half past what time did you get back with your wife a few hours after that he said i walked around for a while just thinking we entered the shop and he called out immediately to his son henri get those crates in line and hang that new garlic he turned quickly to me goodbye jules and thank you ill let you know about next week then another customer entered and henri brushed his hands against his apron and greeted him as though he didnt have a worry in the world outside it was bright and warm henri lived off the main route so i had to walk a while to get to a thoroughfare where i could catch a hansom back to my house id found his place stuffy with the smell of grease and onions and the walking made me decide to stop for a beer a boy went by with some late editions of the newspaper and waiting for my beer to arrive i idly read the news from the front i leaned back and relaxed reminding myself that henris eldest son shared his name and wondering if henri would be persuaded to come next wednesday but where it seemed was a problem maybe lupa would have a suggestion i turned the pages of the journal coming eventually to local news then i froze my beer halfway to my mouth i put the beer down and looked at the small heading at the bottom of the page the article read investigator killed police this morning discovered the body of special investigator j chatelet near the outskirts of valence the body lay just off the road partially concealed in a clump of bushes chatelet had been with the police for ten years the past five as an undercover plainclothes investigator he appeared to have been strangled last night after having been attacked from behind the body was still armed he had been investigating the recent murder of marcel routier a valence salesman he is survived by his wife paulette and their three children i put down the paper and stared across the street which shimmered in the heat folding the newspaper carefully i put it under my arm left some coins on the table and standing up flagged a carriage of course ive read it lupa saidi saw it only a few minutes after you left naturally its interesting that hed just been to see pulis but it proves nothing id gone back to lupas after id collected my thoughts he was not at his table on the street so i passed down under charless gaze to the kitchen and on back he was not in his apartments either so i walked into the office took a candle and entered the tunnel at the other end the lights were on and especially brilliant after the darkness lupa was leaning over staring intently at some blooming flowers seemingly lost to any intrigue that might be encircling him we greeted each other and then he said something about the peace of working with flora i had no reply rather i asked him if hed read about chatelets death one thing it proves is that tania is out of it i said he stopped fooling with the plants and straightened up sighing my dear jules i realize how much of a burden this must be for you to bear but it proves nothing of the sort didnt you tell me you got home long after dark last night yes it became dark some time after seven last night the sun set at six fiftytwo the ride from st etienne takes over an hour and it was dark when you left meaning that it must have been after eight when you got to madame chessals home chatelet left pulis at around seven unfortunately that left ample time for madame chessal to go do nearly any mischief she had to i admit it isnt the most likely explanation but it is possible but the man was strangled yes thats the official explanation pending an autopsy even so one shouldnt underestimate the strength of women its true that they often appear helpless and weak but thats often our perception either because thats what we expect to see or because thats what they allow us to see i read recently where a mother lifted a carriage that had driven over the legs of her son a carriage im sure neither you nor i could have lifted nor at any other time might she have been able to lift it for that matter stress does strange things to people as its doing now to you sit down would you i complied youre overwrought collect yourself or youll be worthless to both of us now look around you breathe deeply there is always beauty and it is always a comfort he was right in a few moments i felt calm and competent to think again in the meantime he didnt bother me but kept busy with the plants finally he walked back to me well he asked is it pulis i told him what i thoughtthat i wasnt sure that my biggest problem was motive henri couldnt very well have been a spy for several years since hed been here in valence with his growing family and business lupa seemed to agree though he said nothing when i finished reporting he suggested i walk through the plant room with him before returning through the tunnel you know that cyanide is also used to smelt gold or silver from ore its such a convenient poison because its so easily attainable legally any photographer would have it as would any geologist he shrugged no come to think of it i dont believe ill go in to see anna today ill let her stew a bit over this mornings display come theres work to do we went together back to the tunnel i noticed him reach up just inside the door of the plant room and throw a switch we can go back through now ive turned off the alarm i hadnt noticed that switch in my earlier passagesanother indication of my decreasing powers back in his office he sat behind his desk after getting out three bottles of beer two for himself and one for me after a great gulp of beer he spoke ive decided it might be wise to have everyone meet here next wednesday naturally theyll be brooding about recent events and they may resent me but i think we can come up with something to make this place acceptable what do you say im not sure i answered truthfully some of them may not come if we can think of some way to get them all here what would you say i wouldnt have any objections i suppose why here though staging if i can get them all in one place and question them i think we may get somewhere it may be easier to heighten the atmosphere of distrust here than elsewhere and animosity is a much better catalyst than cooperation i drank my beer all right ill think about a way to arrange it one other thing he said whats that id be curious to see a photograph of madame chessals family could you get your hands on one are you serious perfectly but why because jules i would like to lay to rest once and for all my suspicion of her and i have an idea you have an idea i said skeptically please he said if its a difficult request i retract it he seemed genuinely concerned for me i dont want to upset you thats all right i said im being peevish ill see what i can do thank you he said simply it might be important that night i was alone at my house saturday was fritzs night off and tania had left i imagine sometime during the day i was somewhat surprised by fritzs absencenormally he stayed at the house even on saturdaysbut of course he was perfectly free to go out perhaps hed met a girl while shopping though he was very shy with women and seemed not to like them particularly it had taken him some months to be natural with tania who was the mildest of creatures beset with a certain heaviness i wandered about the large and empty house i felt i should know more that enough had happened to form some conclusions but the problem was thatmuch as i hated to admit itthe actions of everyone involved invited suspicion i lit a cigarette and sat on the darkened stairs the house itself had an eeriness clinging to it something was making me nervous possibly a sagging belief in my own competence i felt i should file a report to paris but somehow even with marcels death there seemed nothing to report it all seemed so parochial now a personal matter having nothing to do with the war or with france i felt out of touch with any national effort and trapped in a tightening circle of local intrigue after a small supper of reheated stuffed bell peppers endive salad and several glasses of beaujolais i tried to read but found i couldnt shake this feeling of unease i checked the doors to see that they were locked and then turning off all the lights save one went upstairs to my room for the first time since id left it that morning i had nearly finished undressing before i noticed something on my desk i crossed over to it sat down lit another cigarette it was a familiar bit of folded paper probably left for fritz earlier in the day with instructions to deliver it to me opening it i saw several columns listing farm produce with asking prices in various locations wearily i pulled the tattered code book from where i had it taped under my desk smoke from my cigarette burned in my eyes and i stubbed out the butt on the desk top impatiently brushing the ashes to the floor in a few minutes i had the message entirely decoded paris had taken the initiative they were transferring me to bordeaux again for what i interpreted to be desk work since there was no active theater there i went downstairs and poured myself a cognac id been moved many times in my career but id never been dismissed from a case before it had been solved apparently paris had decided that i was useless here or that my usefulness in general was at an end i paced finally i sat down and pulled my pad in front of me beginning the even more complicated process of composing a detailed response in code i would not go to bordeaux even if it meant resigning with that thought i sat bolt upright and crossed out what i had begun to write sometimes a course of action seems impossible until it is defined once defined it becomes inevitable i leaned back in my chair and heaved a huge sigh of relief the carefully worded response was completed just as i heard the lock turn in the front door i came to the head of the stairs and saw fritz enter he took off his coat and hung it neatly on a peg in the hall i called out his name he looked up sir pleasant evening yes would you care for a cognac i believe i would thank you i came down and we went into the sitting room he naturally refilled my glass then poured his own drink i handed him the note id written and asked him to mail it for me the next day certainly he paused sipping at his drink madame chessal took me to dinner this evening perhaps its none of my affair sir but she seemed quite worried about you she said to remind you that you were picnicking tomorrow ive already planned a lunch he added yes i remember what did she say only that she was afraid you were in some special danger i assume relating to monsieur routiers death i confess that ive been concerned about your appetite recently did you read that one of the men investigating his death was killed last night yes well madame seems to think there is a kind of plot and that youre somehow deeply involved i shook my head slowly well you know women fritz they worry about little things im not sure that marcels death was not suicide and that investigator may simply have been robbed i assure you im in no plot marcels death did upset me and business has been weighing me downunnecessarily i thinkfor several weeks in fact that note you are holding is a letter of resignation ive decided to stay here in valence and live out my days in what peace i can hold on to god knows i dont need the money and i do need a rest he nodded i think thats a good idea sir well fine i said i think ill be going to bed now would you again wake me early i raised my glass to victory france and peace we drank the toast and retired the next morning i picked up tania at nine oclock and we took her carriage into town for mass it was a grand morning and when i told tania of my plans to stay in valence she threw her arms around me and laughed like a schoolgirl jules thats wonderful we sat happily through the service and i resolved to forget my business for at least a day though i had resigned i had no intention of giving up the investigation of marcels death it was a matter both of pride and survival for i entertained no doubts that all of us were indeed in some special danger i wondered whether paris would respect my reply or whether they would be difficult i had worked for them for over thirty years and undeniably knew many secrets codes and strategies the situation might become very sticky they could be most persuasive if they had to be i put the thought out of my mind i would have to deal with that later for the time being lupa might not have been convinced of tanias innocence but i was it was a good feeling we returned to my home and picked up the basket lunch fritz had prepared a cold roast chicken hardboiled eggs several bottles of beer and some dried fruits hed even managed to find a bit of brick chocolate for dessert we left the house and followed the brook across the road and down into the meadow beyond where a few field horses grazed peacefully i carried the small folding table and chairs and tania the basket about two kilometers downstream the brook widens into a placid pond dotted here and there with fowl and surrounded by a rather dense woods we picked our way into one of the several clearings and set up the table which tania covered with the plain white cloth fritz had given us then she took off her bonnet and shoes and went to wade in the pond i sat and watched her absentmindedly shelling an egg i called to her and she came back to the table we drank beer and ate slowly talking of food and books she had just finished war and peace in russian and contended that it was the greatest book ever written it says everything about everything she gushed i only wish this war would end with a spirit of rejuvenation im sure it will i said taking her hand were not so old you know thats easy for you to say a woman at forty especially if she has grown children cant expect much rejuvenation she gets older thats all i laughed heartily and a man in his midfifties what about him men are different she replied et vive la her eyes twinkled she was half teasing have you read darwin a little do you know he says that humans are the only species whose females live beyond the age of childbearing why do you suppose that is to keep old males happy i patted her hand come dear youre beautiful and spring is a time for rejuvenation pass me another bit of chicken will you she was about to answer when i saw a movement in the woods at the other side of the pond shh i whispered whats that she turned to look merde people wed almost finished eating and tania quickly gathered what food remained into the basket she told me to grab the table and chairs and follow her a bit back into the woods come come vite vite vite she spread the cloth under a large oak tree im sorry but i dont want to be bothered not today i didnt really mind but i was curious about the other party i sat with my back against the tree positioned so that i could look across the pond to where the others were moving still well back into the trees on their side tania opened me another beer and lay with her head in my lap there she sighed the others came down to a clearing on their side and i saw with some surprise that it was lupa anna and watkins somehow i had never associated them with a picnic in the woods but of course they were young and really much more likely than i to be enjoying a sunday outdoors they came into the clearing and set up chairs and a small table and the two men sat down while anna walked to the pond with a few bottles she dropped them for chilling into the water you know what i found interesting i looked down at tania whats that i found myself forgetting i was french i despised the french even though at the time i suppose i would have been as patriotic as i am now for some reason this statement made absolutely no sense to me lupa and watkins had set themselves up at their tableit looked as though they were about to play some board gamewhile anna busied herself clearing a spot near the water i took a sip of my beer and frowned when i asked the napoleonic wars you couldnt help but want the russians to win it made me slightly uncomfortable while i was reading ah war and peace the two men across the pond were becoming engrossed in their game and rarely looked up while anna was busy making a small fire once lupa called out to her loud enough so that we could hear his voice at that anna got up and fetched the men some bottles from the pond then went back to her work i suppose we were wrong then i dont believe wed have thought so at the time i said but of course there are always reasons to start a war just as there are more often than not no real reasons to end one everyone believes themselves right which is probably understandable but rather simple you dont think we were right that depends at that time i would have thought it im sure if your sons had been off fighting in russia you would never have given a thought to whether or not we were right we would have had to have been right yes i suppose so she closed her eyes and breathed deeply i thought she was going off to sleep anna had started to cook something over the fire while the two men continued their game the sun came down in patches there under the tree it was beginning to get warm tania stirred and opened her eyes but what about now she asked what do you mean are we right now or will some german tolstoy come along in fifty years and make us all appear to be beasts whatever we may appear in fifty years i said for the present time were at least justified france has to survive and now it has to fight to survive i leaned back and lit a cigarette novelists make us think war is terrible because they tend to make a personal story out of it nationally war is either desirable or necessary never right or wrong its not a personal thing any more than a storm is personal if a bolt of lightning strikes down a man no one says that theres any reason behind it some writers try to saying its an act of god or whatever but that doesnt wash it just happens like war happens but the people people dont matter in wars countries matter nations matter issues matter the last thing anyone should think about is people she closed her eyes again i think about my sons she said then added quietly all the time and we both think of marcel but we dont know marcel had anything to do with the war she looked up at me dont we i wondered how much she did know and if he did have to do with the war then he wouldnt matter because people dont matter oh jules you dont really believe that i thought of the night before and the reasons i had decided to stay on in valence i had let it become personal which was absurd france was what mattered but finally i didnt believe that and some sense of that realization had made me resign i supposed i was indeed getting old i touched tanias face gently no i said i dont really believe that we were silent across the pond nothing changed i watched for several minutes after which watkins evidently beaten in the gamei heard his damn clearlyabruptly stood up and stalked over to the fire you know who that is over there tania sat up who your friend lupa your friend lupa she said frowning im surprised he had the energy to get all the way out here its not that he lacks energyhe just chooses a bit carefully how he wants to expend it well lets not expend any of ours by calling him i had no intention of doing that my dear i leaned over and kissed her she stood up would you excuse me for a minute she asked she walked back a ways into the woods while i sat propped against the tree watching the scene across the pond anna was removing something from the fire while lupa was putting up the game pieces and clearing the table anna went back to the pond for more bottles i took a drink of my beer long and refreshing closing my eyes and letting the cold liquid run down my throat suddenly there was a loud report opening my eyes i saw lupa and watkins drop to the ground while anna screamed as she fell rolling over and over behind me i heard tania call out my name and i turned to see her running toward me there were two more shots youre all right i yelled and she said she was the shots id heard had been the loud ringing noises of a rifle rather than the soft pops of a pistol so the range could have been great i took out my pistol tania came up to me youre not going she began i cut her off go see to anna i think shes been hit but jules youre not i was already moving back toward the road where the shots had originated retired or not i was a trained operative of the french government and knew how to act around hostile elements perhaps i was curt to tania but such times call for action not sensitivity no more than a minute had passed since the third shot as i ran i saw out of the corner of my eye another figure moving through the woods to my left it was lupa outpacing me as we sprinted we broke from the woods at about the same time all the while moving rapidly toward the road where we could see a figure retreating into the trees on the other side toward my house lupa fell momentarily from my vision but seconds later he appeared at my side astride one of the dray horses get up his hand grabbed me like a vice as i bounded up behind him over there i yelled pointing to a break in the copse just beyond the road lupa holding the horses mane leaned into the untrained beast and miraculously was obeyed i still held my pistol in my hand dismally aware of its inadequacy we were closing on the roadway and within another minute might expect to come upon our assailant fleeing on foot it was not to be however as over the sound of the horses hooves we heard a motor turning over and saw not fifty meters away an automobile kicking up dust as it spun from its hiding place into the road i fired one ineffectual shotfrom that range the gesture was about the equivalent of shouting stopbut lupa didnt hesitate he spurred the horse back a bit to our right directly toward my house your car he yelled over his shoulder tout droit straight ahead i pointed to the barn the car wed seen had been covered so we had no opportunity to see the driver or even whether there had been more than one occupant still i would recognize the automobile itselfmade of a corrugated iron just becoming popular here and painted a dull green we came to the barn and dismounted roughly i stumbled and fell dismounting but lupa did not slow up at all as i picked myself up he was pulling back the buildings door grunting with the exertion i ran past him and threw myself behind the wheel it pays to keep ones machinery in top condition as i had done immediately the motor caught i slammed the gearshift into position and nearly ran over lupa as the car lurched forward he caught the windshield and leapt onto the running board barely clearing the doorway i pressed the hand throttle to its limit and before we had left my property we were closing on fifty kilometers per hour on the unpaved and pitted drive the ride shook my very bones i hoped the automobile would handle the shocks better anna i began not now lupa bellowed as soon as we hit the road however it became smoother the car skidded slightly as we turned left and i nearly lost control of the wheel but lupa grabbed it and righted me as we continued our acceleration we hadnt gone a kilometer though when the ride very nearly ended what i thought at first was a backfire or perhaps a blowout made me lean forward against the steering wheel that move may have saved my life lupa without the worry of watching the road spun and evidently made out a glint of metal in another stand of trees by the road it had been another shot keep driving he yelled as i began to slow down let watkins get him are you sure i asked our mans in the car he said drive lupa pulled a weapon from under his coat the pistol an m colt american military issue automatic boomed like a cannon as he fired off four rounds with what seemed to be impossible rapidity the smoking brass jackets flying out the side of the weapon and onto the road the fire was returned as we heard one more report from behind us damn lupa spun around grabbing his cheek a sliver of red appeared and he wiped at it with his hand you all right scratched nothing more no more than three minutes had elapsed between the enemys car breaking from the cover of the trees and our turning into the road in pursuit with the speed of my model t if the chase lasted more than fifteen kilometers i thought we had a chance of overtaking our prey i kept the accelerator jammed to the floor while lupa dabbed at the cut on his face with a handkerchief just as i turned to look his way and question him again about the initial shooting and how badly anna had been hurt we crested a small hill and i was forced to skid again braking hard as we came upon a horsedrawn produce cart from the other direction we barely missed it as we screeched to a stop the driver had leapt off the cart to the roadside and lay sprawled in the shallow grass has there been another car i asked clearly furious swearing violently he seemed inclined to rush us lupa pointed his gun at the mans head and quieted him has there been another car oui how many passengers the man shrugged i didnt notice he said i was getting out of the way in spite of lupas weapon his anger spewed over again you bastards dont own the road you know im reporting this i we couldnt stay to discuss the niceties of priorité á droit but pressed onward if we were having trouble making headway perhaps we were not alone the top was still off on the model t and the wind brought tears to my eyes slightly impairing my vision i didnt mind it pushing the car to nearly ks very few other machines could match that speed the roads surface relatively smooth nevertheless provided its share of bumps and necessitated my full attention lupa stemmed the flow of his blood then removed the clip from his weapon and refilled it to my inquiring look he answered we could have hurt him the range is close to fifty meters who do you think it might have been i asked i dont know he dabbed again at his cheek reflectively i just dont know perhaps watkins will come up with something i finally got the question out anna was all right he shook his head wonderingly again just a scratch weve been uncommonly lucky i thought of marcel our luck had its limits within moments we were on the outskirts of valence cart traffic and a few military vehicles slowed our progress as we stopped and started honking through the narrow streets the town was a maze of alleys any one of which could hide the man we sought but we had no choice other than to pursue his logical pathtoward st etienne the frustrating ride through the city streets where we were stopped time and again by carriages children geese dogs and pedestrians continued and continued our only hope was that the car we followed was experiencing similar delays finally just as we broke from the confines of the cobbled streets and onto the smoother wider thoroughfare that led to st etienne lupa grabbed my arm and cried out there it is i didnt know how he could be sure the car was a mere speck on the roadway and hed only glimpsed it before it rounded a curve and disappeared again still it was not a time to quibble and i pushed the ford to its limit we were gaining as we took the same curve wed picked up perhaps fifty meters now clearly even to my blurred vision it looked like the same car keep low lupa cautioned they might shoot i followed his instructions and we closed rapidly in another minute we were within range of lupas weapon but he held his fire it would not be wise to shoot until we had seen the occupants by the time we reached the first aqueduct crossing the rhone we had nearly come upon them and it was becoming obvious to me that something had gone wrong they were not pulling away not shooting in fact they paid us no attention whatsoever as we pulled alongside we glanced over at themtwo elderly men in officers uniforms they looked back at us with mild curiosity nothing more at the first opportunity i turned into a side road drove on for several hundred meters then pulled over what now i asked the breeze blew over us gently overhead a flock of birds chided us with their song were fools lupa said what else could we have done yes im trying to determine that now there must be a dozen lookalike cars on the road jules he explained i know the answers as well as you do we must be asking the wrong questions we continued in frustrating and desultory conversation until in the end he asked if i would drop him off at la couronne on my way back home arent you curious about anna i asked i am many things in relation to her he answered but almost never am i curious no i am sure she has gone back to be ministered to by madame chessal she was fine jules as fine as i am now i did make sure before i joined with you the drive continued in silence occasionally i would glance over at my companion he sat motionless eyes closed pursing his lips in and out finally he spoke where was madame chessal when you heard the shots with me well shed gone off into the bushes for a moment so she was not with you auguste dont be absurd she didnt even know wed be here she was nowhere near where the shots came from he looked at me in exasperation there is such a thing as a paid assassin she wouldnt have to be where the shots came from i thought he was stretching the point beyond credibility and told him so jules he said there are two kinds of women simple women accounting for ninety percent of the race and dangerous women if he was brooding id let him brood i was convinced that his line of reasoning led nowhere and nothing he said was going to shake that conviction he seemed to come to the same conclusion for suddenly he sat up straight in his seat i apologize about the way i spoke of madame chessal i still cant help but feel a great deal of mistrust but with no evidence im a fool to speak rashly forgive me he sighed back to business ive decided something rather crucial whats that what did you see exactly when you heard the shots today actually i saw nothing just at the moment i heard the shots i was tipping my head back to drink some beer i saw nothing at all just before that i saw anna crossing back to the table and you and watkinsno just youseated presumably waiting for her correct does that lead you to note any similarity between this latest incident and the successful attempt on routier i couldnt see what he was getting at let me describe to you what happened today exactly anna had been at the fire getting our food and had turned back to the table watkins stood on the far side of the table having just returned also from the fire when the shot came we were all precisely in a line from the direction of the report anna was grazed while leaning over to place the food on the table and the same bullet passed through the bottom of watkinss coat i heard the whistle of the thing as it passed my ear there what does that tell you nothing i said truthfully except perhaps that theyre both very lucky how about if they were both extremely unlucky what if the bullet hadnt been meant for either of them i smiled what if you are getting upset and nervous and losing your judgment ignoring that response he continued the most salient point of these two attempts last weeks and todays is that both attempts were on my own life of course there is a possibility that this was not the case last wednesday but only the barest possibility you seeand i dont know whether you noticed this at the timeroutier after the incident with lavoies bottle exploding went back to the seat id been occupying and drank from my already poured glass the poison had obviously been put there for me only the chance realignment of our positions saved me and resulted in your friends death again today he went on today we were all in a line and the shot chanced to miss me you heard the other two after the first we all dropped immediately to the ground the second shot landed somewhere far off but the last hit the ground not one meter from where i lay which was far from the other two no whoever the killer may be the intended victim is beyond dispute it is myself and whatever else the killer may be we may be certain that hes getting desperate all right i said after a moment it might be true and if it is what are you going to do i negotiated back onto the cobblestones in contrast to our earlier passage en ville no one seemed to be about id like you to go and find out where pulis was today then go to the police station find where lavoie is supposed to be and wire him as i said its possible that theres a hired assassin involved even though further reflection renders that rather dubious a hired assassin wouldnt have missed me and if our man was so concerned about covering up he certainly wouldnt have done anything at your house the other night no i believe hes acting alone on this i believe hes scared and a scared man makes mistakes what about paul anser youre going to see him tomorrow are you not yes well question him find out what you can watkins remember will be working in st etienne all right but you im going back to la couronne i dont intend to leave my rooms until this is cleared up a scared man as i said makes mistakes i cant be wondering about my own safety if im to be effective my cooking too is suffering as you see i should be there now charles is no chef but hes taking over when he can i try to show him a style but how do you teach a flair eh monsieur vernet la couronne s owner is very patient we are in fact distantly related he is a good man but he is also a businessman a restaurateur he needs a quality chef to survive much as i need a quality operative he glanced sideways at me would you object to filling that role i could not it was flatteringbut more necessary if lupa was right then he not i was in danger jules stop the car he said suddenly we were passing the fountain in the center of town from which side streets spread like spokes from a wheel i pulled over to the curbside and brought the car to a halt what is it come with me lupa was already out of the car his hand inside his coat near his pistol he disappeared down one of the alleys moving as quickly as i could i followed the run through the woods the horse ride my stumbling the excitement of the chaseall of that was catching up with me in the leisurely pace of the drive back to valence i had stiffened up considerably but i was not about to let myself forget that id kept up with a man not yet half my age i thought confidently that lupa could pick a worse operative than myself rounding the corner i saw what had drawn lupas attention a green automobile of corrugated iron was pulled up under an overhanging gutter the drivers window was open and lupa had already entered the car by the time i arrived anything he straightened up in the seat smiling crookedly opening his hand he displayed one spent rifle shell nothing important he said perhaps you ought to file a report on a stolen car im sure the owner of this machine is wondering where it might be he got out of the car i might as well walk from here jules thank you for your help he nodded and began down the alley then he stopped turning i suppose for forms sake i should ask watkins to question the residents of this block they may have seen then abruptly his shoulders slumped this is terrible my mind isnt functioning the police will not be able to discover who stole this car no one will have seen it arrive here our function is not pedestrian police work we cannot depend on that for if we do we shall fail mark my words we shall fail i tried to calm him to restore some of his lost selfesteem it did little good finally i assured him that i would check in on anna though he didnt even seem to think that would be necessary he said i could do as i wished as i trudged back to my car i wondered if even now our assailant was watching me from one of the narrow windows gloating over his escape whoever he was it was likely that he knew me well and thought me a bumbling adversary a foolish dilettante an aging clown all the shops had been closed on sunday and henri had bickered with his wife and gone fishing alone no one had seen him hed caught no fish though when he returned his boots had been wet tuesday tomorrow he would be making a delivery of condiments to st etienne when i saw him monday morning i learned all this he was nervous as usual but sober and i only stayed a moment on the pretext of having forgotten something i then sent a telegram to avignon where according to the list hed left with the police georges should have been staying i expected no reply until evening at the earliest it was a cool and overcast day the changes in weather had been abrupt but one expected that in the spring perhaps the clouds would burn off by the afternoon i walked from the telegraph office to lupas with my hands thrust deep into the pockets of my overcoat seeing no one on my way he sat enthroned in his office thats the only way to describe him so he had abandoned his schedule it was after ten oclock and by all rights he should have been up on the street with beer and newspaper as it was he sat behind his huge desk with the paper open before him and a glass by his left hand hello i said sitting down id asked charles for coffee on the way through the kitchen and awaited him so youve given up working altogether i beg your pardon he looked up you look so settled there its hard to imagine that youll ever move back to the world of labor cooking is not a labor but a love i intend to continue with my duties here he put the paper aside youve read that italy has joined us that at least is good news how are you today i told him about pulis and the telegram while charles was pouring my coffee he listened with his eyes closed leaning back far in his chair when i had finished he frowned it would make things much easier if we could ever eliminate someone completely you say hes going to st etienne tomorrow as i nodded there was a loud ringing alarm lupa reached to a button on his desk and pressed it shutting off the noise he calmly opened his desk and took out his pistol checking to see that it was loaded stay here he said to me and disappeared into the tunnel i sat uncomfortably for several minutes before i heard returning footsteps and voices the curtain came aside and lupa reentered with watkins so it seems possible though rather a long shot said the englishman as he came into the room ah hello i didnt realize you were here hes only just arrived said lupa would you have some coffee tea tea please fine he ordered it and we waited excuse me i said but what seems possible lupa closed his paper joseph here has just returned from st etienne where hes been trying to find some information we can use hes not working at all on the murders as you are but only on the arsenal after the attempt yesterday i thought things would start to move quickly but i was wrong nothing happened at least that we know of at st etienne joseph believes however that he was followed for quite some time even back here to valence possibly by the man who shot at us he was about to describe him watkins slouched in his chair looking rather ragged as though he hadnt slept the tea arrived and he sipped at it suddenly when he was about to speak his eyes became illuminated and he lost his vacant look it was amazing almost as though he were two different people actually i never did get a good look at his face he had brownish hair i think dressed plainly about six foot he smiled brilliant description what could as well be me im talking about then he shifted back into himself and sat as though hed been deflated sipping at his tea god im tired why dont you get yourself some sleep are you going back to st etienne right away i thought id go down a bit later say after dark lupa nodded satisfactory im getting ready to move to create something if necessary ive got a good guess who we want by the way pulis is coming down tomorrow morning to deliver watch him he turned to me how does he go down produce cart i imagine good then hell be easy to pick up catch him outside of town and follow him everywhere if he meets anyone well do what you can it would be nice if we could use the police watkins stood and moved to the door got it this trip back and forth must get tedious when you go down stay until you have something i have a feeling things are coming to a head yes sir he said and started out oh watkins he stopped and looked back in dont you think it might be better if you exited the same way you entered its just possible that someone might notice you coming out of a building youd never entered also in the future why not try coming in by way of the restaurant right right right he muttered crossing the room again the plants need watering ive turned on the lights he left no olives i asked certainly an oversight is there anything else i was wondering where anna fits in in fact ive wondered about where all of us fit in i get the distinct impression that there are things youd rather i knew nothing about and id like to know why he sighed youre right there is much you dont need to know ideally you wouldnt know watkins but theres no harm in that for the other things wait a few more days you might treat people differently if you knew their alignment with us for now you know enough to do your job well then anna at least yes id like to know if tanias in danger with her being there or if that was arranged by you oh no certainly not im concerned in fact about any danger anna may be in not that again no he said no not that again we are simply in different camps on that question and im afraid it wont be resolved until ive seen madame chessals family perhaps until the whole matter is closed but anna i dont know what to do about her is she with us not in the sense you mean ive gotten myself entangled with her she knows generally what my functions are and sometimes shes a great help but she works for no government i think when she leaves madame chessals care im going to send her away weve talked of marriage congratulations posh a man shouldnt be congratulated when he finds himself trapped i feel i owe it to her in a way shes done a lot for me but thats terrible i said dont you love her at all oh love come jules lets not be sentimental surely i care for her but i realize that these things pass im too much my own man to tolerate a woman around for very long stillhe sighedshe is a good woman i suppose theres no help for it i will send her away for a while he sat back and closed his eyes the alarm once more sounded that would be watkins again i should show him the switch well he said after a pause anything else yes there is talking of anna just reminded me im not working with the government anymore ive resigned he opened his eyes a fraction hmmm i expect therell be some trouble undoubtedly why transfer the fools dont they believe theres trouble here their own agents are dying consistently so youve quit well good ill see if ill be able to assuage some of their more retaliatory instincts dont worry i wasnt i said getting up fine wednesday night oh yes all set with henri and tania georges said anywhere would be all right with him and im going to see paul now so ill let you know oh one more thing the police want to see me theyve possibly seen me come here how well do i know you slightly good thatll be easy then ill see them this afternoon after i get back so saying i turned and left hearing him calling for charles to bring more beer id left the car parked at the telegraph office so i walked back to it in the still brisk morning trying again to piece together all id seen and heard and once again coming up with a blank since id never been to pauls house i had a little trouble getting to it and was totally unprepared for what greeted me it was set back on a small trail nearly a kilometer from any real road and looked like something from a fairy tale it was tiny and seemed to be perfectly square no more than ten meters on a side though it did have two stories id needed to ask directions before i arrived from some children who were playing nearby all of them knew the place and seemed surprised that i didnt the roof was sharpsloping of the kind you see more often in switzerland though it was shingled with the familiar red tile the house itself was white i parked to one side of the trail walked to the small door and knocked entrez un moment pauls voice came from upstairs qui est la its jules i answered sitting down no hurry the first thing i noticed about the inside was the cats there were seven different kinds of felines lounging over the sparse furniture id never supposed that paul was so fond of cats hed never mentioned them as cat lovers are generally wont to do i personally did not particularly like them the other outstanding feature of the room was the plants there were potted plants in every window and suspended from the ceiling well i said to myself after all he is a poet as though on cue paul came down the stairs jules good to see you what brings you around we shook hands his was rather clammy he was wearing american blue denims and a shirt he called his chemise de louest a white affair with sloping pockets and motherofpearl buttons im just making some lunch will you have some just coffee would be fine thanks he walked back to another room which appeared to be no bigger than a closet he called me in youve never been here before right right well it surely wont do to have you leave without the grand tour this room heres the kitchen compared to my own kitchen it didnt seem even minimally adequate for cooking there were a pair of burners set on a drain and two or three shelves with a very few condiments lying in disarray upon them the coffeepot was black with carbon and looked as though it hadnt been cleaned ever there was no sink he went outdoors to a pump for the water on the walls were faded posters of buffalo bill codys wild west show and one of ringling bros barnum bailey circus the greatest show on earth he dumped several measures of coffee into the water and set the whole thing on a burner to boil i wondered what lupa would have had to say about the operation dont worry about the grounds jules theres a filter inside the spout not clearly reassured i waited making small talk until the water was boiling he poured us two cups took himself a bit of cheese and we went back into the sitting room as soon as he was settled two cats came and sat on his lap and as we talked he broke off bits of the cheese and fed them now he said again what brings you round here i said id get back to you about wednesday night you think youll be able to make it wed like to have it at la couronne since everyone feels the way you do about my place what do you say whyd you pick that place monsieur lupa offered it i shrugged hes coming again is he yes he said we could use his kitchen which is large and private ive already sent over lots of beer he seems anxious to meet us all under better conditions and ive talked to him once or twice since since wednesday whys he so anxious to get together with us again i dont know he didnt really say that i just got the impression hmm he drank the coffee which wasnt finally as bitter as id expected seems a mite strange but then he is as you say a mite strange but then ive never been here before and i find it quite er unorthodox ive never really trusted men who liked cats if youll pardon me for saying so and i find it funny that ive known you all this while and never would have suspected that of you he smiled well do you trust me less now its really not a question of trust or mistrust i simply find it odd that your fondness for cats doesnt somehow show cats seem more of a womans pet and youre certainly not what id call effeminate shucks no he laughed out loud now nudging the cats playfully behind their heads well now you know i like cats but that doesnt show any more than if i smoked hashish or wore buffalo skin underwear which by the way i dont i sipped at my coffee well yes but no you just cant tell take all this stuff about marcel now im sorry and all to see him dead and im sorry for you because you were his friend but how much did we know about him hell i didnt even know where he lived what if for exampleand dont get madhe was having an affair with tania and you found out and killed him or if he had recently gambled everything on some adventure and lost and for that reason killed himself no way to know or if he was a spy of some kind like some of the others said and the whole thing had nothing at all to do with him personally though i myself dont credit that one much he just didnt seem the cloakanddagger type course there i go again doing what im yappin at you about he didnt seem the cloakanddagger type and i dont seem the catlover type though i am isnt that right esau this last was addressed to the large black tom seated sedately on his lap when you come down to it and be honest would i strike you as a poet i must admit no though more so here in your house than elsewhere because here im more eccentric i suppose yes but thats just another cliché you see the eccentric sensitive poet i lived just this way for years before i wrote my first poem cats plants and all you want some more coffee i shook my head no but he got up and walked to the kitchen for some of his own he yelled from there gotta brew up some more itll be a minute i saw paul walking outside toward the pump at the same time one of the small kittens jumped from a chair and scampered to the foot of the narrow staircase when i moved to see it more clearly it bolted up the stairs then turned to look back at me alarmed at the height it had attained it began whining piteously and i got up intending to hold it until pauls return but i must have spooked it again because it turned and disappeared up into a room at the top of the stairs in all innocence i followed it into pauls bedroomcumworkspace with a cluttered desk and an unmade bed over the bed were more dusty prints of american shows and the wall over the desk was covered with books along its entire length and breadth there were two large windows one just to each side of the bed and in the corner a stepladder leading to a square hole in the ceiling forgetting the cat and feeling guilty i nevertheless crossed to the desk and silently opened the top center drawer it was filled with wellnibbled pencils yellowing bits of paper with fading snatches of writing barely visiblein short exactly what should have been there glancing at the books in front of me i found the titles entirely commensurate with my expectations possibly he had a hollow book up there but suddenly that struck me as highly unlikely the room just didnt feel like a hiding place and i was beginning to feel foolish and slightly embarrassed for having invaded pauls privacy he would be returning shortly with his coffee and i resolved to get back downstairs as quickly as i could when the kitten whined again this time from the hole in the ceiling somehow it had made it up the stepladder and now was truly frightened i moved over and looked up while the crying continued come here kitty i said my foot poised on the bottom rung as ive mentioned im not much of a cat person and my technique in calling was not effective in fact the animal disappeared back into the opening come on i repeated good kitty come here i climbed the few steps and looked around as my eyes became adjusted to the darkness i was dumbfounded by what i saw the attic looked like an arsenal the walls on both sides under the pitched eaves were covered with rifles and pistols of every size and description the cat forgotten i crawled up into the small space and stared boxes of ammunition for the various guns sat open on the floor i noticed a few bullet molds near a low table what appeared to be a lead smelter cleaning rags the usual paraphernalia in my shock i must have lost track of the time pauls voice echoed faintly from below and then almost immediately i heard his bounding footsteps on the stairs i had no time to cover my indiscretion im up here paul i said feebly in the attic what the hell he began i looked down at him i was trying to rescue a cat as though on cue the kitten crawled to the opening and looked over meowing at the sight of its owner paul stood on the balls of his feet as though poised for action the coffee steaming in his right hand i watched his face carefully and even went so far as to make sure my own pistol was within easy reach but after a moment of consternation he seemed to reach some decision and smiled at me his insouciant air returning well he said i guess youve found me out i had no idea you had such an interest in guns he grinned another surprise first cats then plants now guns but so many he shrugged its a hobby youll pardon me if i say its a strange hobby especially at this time do the police know about it i doubt it he said or theyd have probably arrested me in spite of the fact that marcel was poisoned but what do you do with them i save them shoot them clean them make ammo it relaxes me takes my mind off the jungle of literary life besides guns fascinate me always have arent you worried about being discovered god you talk as though id done something no not at all i never let the kids up here of course and the few friends to whom ive shown the place can be trusted i figure if you can trust me with your beer the least i can do is reciprocate no im not worried do you shoot them often sure in fact yesterday i packed a few of em away and went off shooting got a couple of rabbits though i got the first one with a buffalo gun if there werent so many of the damn pests i suppose id feel unsportsmanlike but its good practice are you a good shot in all modesty jules i am a crack shot yet another thing id never have guessed amazing isnt it and theres probably a lot more ive got quite a few tricks up my sleeve you know i was in alaska when i was a boy looking to get rich on gold picked up a lot of useful knowledge there not to mention most of my adult interests probably thats why i like the kids here so much and take the time for them lots of old men helped me out up there and it wasnt so easy to get by he stopped abruptly remembering drinking his coffee reflectively his eyes far away but come jules take a look at what i really do i had to turn my back to him to come down the ladder and i felt a surge of trepidation as i began but it was quickly over he led me to the desk and picked up one of the stacks of paper covered with what was to me an illegible scrawl americans write in a strange hand my first retrospective he said proudly collected best poems from my other books theyre even allowing me to pick the material im a little nervous because ive decided to include twentythree new poems they asked for a collection of published stuff i picked up the bundle looks like a lot of work but its impressive paul im sure they wont mind the new work i dont really see why they would but you never know you know i said id like to read your work correctly translated someday i always enjoy it but im afraid i miss nuances in english and the poetry must be very good if they want a collection he shrugged its a living beats looking for gold he sat in the chair behind the desk and stared out the window i understand though that this will be translated into french so you may get your chance ill autograph a copy for you i thanked him and saw an opening for more questioning where do you get your ideas paul what does a poet do on an average day the subject seemed to interest him yesterday wasnt my average day what with the shooting and all and neither is today since youve come but generally i get up around dawn and drink coffee write for two hours and go after food when i get back i have lunch then go up to the studio and work on my hobbies usually the kids come by im kind of the neighborhood character they all love coming over here and we go out and fool around exploring or whatever one of the boys got a motorcycle not so long ago and weve been doing a lot of fooling with that lots of fun you ever ride one no well you wouldnt believe the speed then i generally go to town and have dinner with one of my friends then home a little more writing and bed doesnt sound eccentric does it not to me i admitted i stood up and walked over to the plants you know one of lupas fetishes is plants too see he came over to where i stood and began plucking dead leaves from some stems i never would have figured that mais cest vrai i said have you heard anything new about marcels death have they arrested someone id be happy to see that its a real pain reporting every day to the flics no one of the investigators has been found dead he went to a chair and sat down well im damned looks like a bad business very i agreed hed just been to see henri the poor bastard you think he did it ive no idea im trying to keep out of it as much as i can havent seen the police yet probably a good idea in fact thinking about it im not sure if its such a good idea meeting with everyone on wednesday why not put it off a week i should give you a reason but its really more of a personal thing with me weve most of us been friends for so long that i thought it would be good to get back together lay any suspicion to rest youre right i suppose it would be good to see everyone back to normal he stood again with his coffee cup in his hand and clapped me heartily on the back well jules rest assured i dont suspect you of anything except that i instinctively mistrust cat haters he laughed then can i expect you on wednesday sure as shootin comment that means yes count on it ah i nodded have a good day ciao paul showed me out and i walked back to the car he had raised many more questions for me than hed answered hed been out yesterday with a rifle but of course if he were a crack shot he wouldnt have missed then again possibly hell i thought possibly anything i got in the car and started off toward the road i rounded a turn and came upon a group of youths running alongside a boy on a motorbike heading back toward pauls house it was still a bit chilly and id left my windows up so that as i passed the boys their voices were muffled and indistinct though shrill and blended with the noise of the motor i had the uneasy feeling that id heard those same voices before jacques magiot and i had been acquaintances for over forty years and a mutual antipathy had developed between us over the course of time when he was beginning his career with the police i was a gadabout he was a few years older than i and before wed finished secondaire wed had many of the same friends our fathers as a matter of fact had been quite close after they had retired they spent most of their afternoons together playing boules so it was more or less assumed that we would become friends it never happened once he tried to recruit me to the force and id laughed at the notion from that time the condescension with which hed always treated mefriendly condescension to be sureturned to subtle derision i think he always considered me a donothing and it no doubt angered him when i began to increase my fathers already substantial fortune through my own resources still we would meet at parties occasionally and exchange pleasantries as a policeman he was competent for routine problems entirely without imagination and through some admixture of luck and obstinancy had arrived at the position of police chief of valence the police headquarters building was a large neoclassic monstrosity in the center of town arched and pillared it might have been made by a blind onearmed roman it was the largest building in town built sans doute on the theory that if might makes right big makes beautiful tant pis i was ushered down the hall from the front desk to the room of one of the subordinates a monsieur procunier he was a short heavy bald man with a large nose and a florid complexion he sat behind his desk and bade me sit facing him nice of you to come he began sarcastically weve been by your house several times have you received that message there have been some murders lately you realize i nodded my good man monsieur magiot knows where he can find me and no one said there was any urgency indeed there couldnt have been or youd have stationed someone at the house and brought me here as soon as i appeared now im here voluntarily to answer questions i presume and i have little use for sarcasm lets get on with it i smiled by the way will monsieur magiot be in hes in now hes to see you when im through taking your report fine im at your disposal he asked me the same questions theyd asked the previous wednesday adding only a reference or two to chatelets death did i have any suspicions had anything out of the ordinary happened to me since wednesday i didnt know what fritz might have told them so i mentioned the episode with the rock and left out yesterdays shooting incident you think it was a prank he asked without any doubt i heard childrens voices would you like a police escort good god no whatever for protection so it went how well did i know the people at the gathering what was the purpose of the meeting did i know that if more than three people met at any time it could be construed as a subversive gathering and was forbidden thank you i said is that all he directed me to magiot jacques was dealing with some of his men when i entered and i stood quietly by the door while he finished talking with them after theyd filed out he reached out his hand jules he said good to see you its been quite a while nasty business this eh im awfully sorry about routier he was a good friend of yours i understand do sit down cigarette he carried his age very well though he was not compelled to by regulations he preferred to wear his uniform while on duty and it was well tailored his dark hair was in a military cut over a disciplined and impassive face he sat gripping his pipe lightly with both hands over the bowl his elbows resting on the desk i took the cigarette and sat how are you jacques your man procunier is quite a personality he waved it off oh sorry about that ive just been so busy lately id rather have him take the routine things you made a statement oui good to tell the truth i was a little concerned about the circumstances of the death at your place several foreigners that sort of thing you know gatherings of that size are forbidden to drink beer i know i know in your case its rather silly but there are reasons as im sure youll understand there have been rumors that routier was mixed up in some international matters would you know anything about that nothing whatever wed been friends for a long time and he never mentioned anything to me also jacques between us he didnt really seem the type did he he smiled condescendingly yes well i thought id ask he shifted in his chair and looking down into the bowl of his pipe said rather softly we think we know who did it really i said who how well do you know this auguste lupa that was the first time hed been to your house wasnt it not exactly hed been there that morning as to how well i know himhardly at all i only met him last tuesday and he seemed a nice enough chap hes really an excellent chef you know so ive heard thats one of the reasons we find it strange he was there he should be working at night weve gone by la couronne several times and have failed to find him why wouldnt he be there during working hours i dont know i replied it does seem suspicious suspicious ha damned suspicious id say but jacques you havent been able to get in touch with me either in all that time and theres nothing suspicious about me is there i hate to bring it up jules but you dont work like your common man your hours are your own to order i smiled to myself probably my wealth would gall him forever so you suspect lupa look at the facts he said lupas the only new man at the party hes a foreigner from belgrade or somewhere hes an american citizen i interrupted all right america doesnt change the fact then routiers sitting in lupas seat and even drinking from his glass when he keels over lupa hadnt even taken a sip from that glass in the confusion of lavoies glass breaking lupa dumps cyanide into the glass and arranges it so that routier goes back to his seat we dont know exactly how he did that but it seems reasonable weve also got some problems with motive though this international angle might come into play there then lupa cant be found when we want him he refuses to cooperate at all andhere he paused for effectwe went to see vernet the owner of la couronne and got lupas papers and theyre forged cleverly but definitely were going to pick him up tonight i sighed well thats certainly a relief jacques im glad youve found him it does look rather bad for him forged you say without doubt what about your inspector him too we think so hes got no alibi we figure chateletthat was his namewas on to something he questioned lupa and lupa panicked with his size he could have strangled him easily and probably did he hadnt reported back to us yet but his itinerary that morning had him seeing lupa after the funeral then the others and none of the others saw him he must have seen lupa first and been killed before he could see anyone else but couldnt it have happened that when chatelet saw that lupad missed the funeral he changed his plans and took off on a new tack in that case he might have run into someone else altogether yes thats true but why would he change his plans did anything strange happen at the funeral anything to make you suspicious no i said truthfully well then just a thought i muttered you just let us handle this jules its what we do best i got up to go well good luck jacques i hope you get him and thank you he shook my hand warmly its a pleasure to set the mind of an old friend at ease dont worry about a thing well have everything straightened out and back to normal in no time i walked out into the cool evening if that was what they did best i smiled grimly to myself so no one else had seen chatelet which of course meant that henri had lied to the police understandable but certainly neither wise nor wily i decided to go to lupas to warn him he wouldnt be any good at all from inside a jail trying to convince a man like magiot of his innocence magiot thought i was supercilious i shuddered to imagine what hed think of lupa it wouldnt do to go directly to la couronne from the police station so i walked to my car and drove several blocks back toward my house checking to see that i wasnt being tailed i wasnt i parked and began walking then back in the direction of annas shop i knew it was a bit risky entering that way but it would be better than just dropping in especially if the police had already arrived the walk took me nearly a quarter of an hour and it was completely dark when i arrived the door was locked as i might have expected if id been thinking of details such as anna lying wounded at tanias house but it presented no problem once inside i crossed to the back door behind the screen and opened it the smell of the flowers rising to meet me was once again overpowering but pleasant as i picked my way back to the tunnel entrance i remembered roughly where lupa had reached to turn off the alarm and after fumbling along the darkened wall for a short while got it and clicked it to what i hoped was off the walk was becoming nearly familiar and i covered the distance to lupas room in less than five minutes magiot had said that they were picking up lupa tonight and it was now night there wasnt much time to waste i stood at the curtains and listened to see if lupa had guests there was a faint glow around one edge of the curtain so at least one of the rooms lights was on i heard no sound so i quietly pulled the curtain open and stepped in my training had not entirely deserted me and i could still move quietly and effectively if i had to lupa sat at his desk absorbed in some reading he turned a page and i cleared my throat normally a man surprised in that manner will start lupa didnt move a muscle without the merest glance at me he closed the book and stared ahead of him finally he turned his head to see me how did you get in here he snapped spontaneous generation how long have you been here under a minute now relax it was necessary youre in a lot of trouble and weve got to move right away so the tunnels been unguarded for ten minutes pfui he reached for the button on his desk and activated the alarm again you can check all that later i said get charles in here and vernet as soon as he can be reached ive just come from the police and youre to be arrested tonight for marcels murder he glared at me the fools i couldnt agree more but that doesnt matter much at this point weve got to get you out of here and covered before the police arrive the fools he repeated yes i said it seems that theyve checked your papers and discovered the forgeries and that henri has denied seeing chatelet and naturally they assume then that you killed him before he could have seen anyone else now does charles know about the tunnel yes so does vernet anyone else besides you anna watkins and myself no not that i know of all right lets get you out that way then call in your men no he said no im not leaving here simply impossible im a marked man and ive decided to stick it out here and i will do so ill call the others but how he cut me off by ignoring me and calling out into the kitchen charles appeared shortly clad in an apron and chefs cap smiling he was surprised to see me but nodded courteously lupa began talking close the front door immediately and go fetch monsieur vernet we are closed for business tonight due to the loss of our chef i beg your pardon charles but it does have nothing to do with you after youve gotten vernet here continue on out to monsieur girauds houseyou remember where it is good talk to his chef a fritz benet and tell him to stop whatever he is doing and come along here as quickly as possible tell him monsieur giraud is in trouble and we need him bring him through the back way try to do all this in under an hour and start now charles already had stripped himself of accoutrements and stood ready to go lupa turned to me you have a car nestçe pas bien give the keys to charles you can drive cant you use the car speed is everything vaten go when hed left lupa excused himself and left me sitting wondering what he planned to do i heard him moving about in the adjoining room evidently rearranging things in some way in a short while he reappeared carrying two beers in each hand he set them on his desk and opened two offering one to me without a word then he sat with his eyes closed and breathed deeply for what seemed an hour but was actually probably less than a minute finally he sat up opened his eyes and glanced at the beer glass presumably to see that the foam had settled adequately and drank when he put the glass down it was empty and he immediately reached for another beer he looked at me after pouring so if you dont mind my asking what are you planning to do you cant stay here and every minute we sit here threatens you more why dont we just go over to my place or at least through the tunnel here you are too vulnerable nonsense what i did in the outer room just then will prevent any interference from the police the huge tapestries covering the other walls well for such an eventuality as this ive another on hand ive simply covered the door to the office and the wall surrounding it no one will suspect there is a room there but if they search its transparent why would they search if theyre capable of thinking me guilty of marcels death they are no danger to me they will look in the rooms that remain which are certainly ample for one man living alone they wont suspect a hidden room why should there be one monsieur vernet will tell them he fired me because of my papers and charles will corroborate then of course there will be a new chef newly hired and living in these quarters i suppose that would be exactly fritz he drank more beer and i joined him did it occur to you that i might not approve of this that perhaps fritz is my private chef and of some worth to me both personally and professionally certainly my dear jules he smiled thats why i didnt want to discuss any of this with you before sending charles on his errand i didnt want to waste the time you see there really isnt much choice i can be very effective here and i intend to remain come it wont be for long enjoy your beer i sat and thought in silence he was right but it was aggravating what was i to do with fritz gone suddenly i realized what had begun to nag me i gather then that youve cleared fritz you might have mentioned it to me he did not respond in any way well i said he sighed there are simply some matters that i cant disclose at this time even to you jules thats ridiculous patently it is not might i ask why he searched for the least objectionable way to phrase it you are a valuable ally jules and becoming a good friend but there is a certain ingenuousness in your character that i can turn to my advantage i must ask you to trust me in this i find it highly insulting he got up from the desk and crossed over to me placing his hand on my shoulder it is not that i assure you he leaned his huge bulk back against the desk my father jules had a companion for many yearsa very good man of impeccable character and great bravery but his goodness was so ingrained his honesty so natural that he was absolutely incapable of dissembling my father knew this of course and occasionally had to leave this man in the dark or in a few cases actually mislead him so that he might not unwittingly tip a winning hand again his hand came to rest on my shoulder jules forgive me but you are not an actor you are an agent and a valuable man of action but if you were closing in on marcels murderer i doubt if you could altogether suppress your feelings until the optimum moment and that in this case is essential but fritz i began for the time being let fritz be my problem i will say this much if he is our man what better place to monitor his activities than under my own roof i was not completely happy or convinced by his rationale but i could see that his mind was made up he went back around his desk and sat and we waited for the others to return lupa opened the last beer poured it for himself and had nearly finished when vernet entered he was of average height but distinguished by a full red beard and incongruously piercing dark eyes it was an odd combination which his dress reinforced he wore an english derby hat and a large plaid overcoat which when removed gave way to more conventional attirea dark suit and tie the color scheme of his face became even more bizarre when he took off the hat revealing a head of gray hair he entered by the tunnel so of course wed been warned of his entrance see here auguste whats this about closing down the restaurant i realize that m and altamont have asked me to cooperate in every way i could but were beginning to lose customers what with charless cooking and your irregular hours whats the explanation this time perfectly unruffled lupa introduced us now sit down monsieur i am sorry but its really unavoidable we should be open for business again within the hour but in the meantime i am going to need your help will you have some beer cognac the owner sat and nodded courvoisier sil vous plait to my surprise lupa attended him when they had both been seated lupa began again we have a real problem though we could possibly have foreseen it given the way the police have handled everything so far theyve reached the inescapable conclusion that i am monsieur routiers murderer monsieur giraud has just given me that report and the police are supposedly to be here this evening to arrest me unfortunately that would be most inconvenient so ive covered over the door to the office and decided to remain here until ive settled this matter let it look to the police as if ive run thats fine in fact it suits my purposes since now the heat will be off the actual murderer theyll of course question you as to my whereabouts and you should tell them that you dismissed me immediately upon learning that my papers were forged and you havent seen me since fine said vernet with impatience pulling at his beard but whos to be the new chef how did i find him and above all can he cook on the last point you may rest assured his name is fritz benet and he would be worthy to be my own chef were i ever in a position to be able to afford one maybe after the war but thats irrelevant hes been the chef for monsieur giraud for quite some time however for these purposes giraud fired him because he suspected him of complicity with routiers death now wait a minute auguste i began but he waved me down that puts him in no danger believe me its perfectly safe the police have checked him thoroughly but why should i suspect him he poured the beer he shrugged it doesnt have to make sense to us it merely has to be plausible to the police theyve apparently settled on me that you might suspect fritz will have no bearing vernet sipped at his cognac so i will once again have a restaurant barring difficulties that seemed to palliate him his face relaxed and he looked at me i asked for this when i decided to accommodate our friend here at least its not dull lupa picked up the book hed been reading when i entered and without so much as a by your leave became engrossed again vernet and i discussed fritzs merits until the alarm sounded again lupa distractedly pushed the button and i seeing that he was taking no precautions got up and walked into the tunnel my pistol ready after a few moments i heard fritzs voice and returned to my chair when they entered fritz crossed over to me youre all right he asked perfectly whats the trouble lupa spoke hello fritz please take a seat within a quarter of an hour the thing had been settled and fritz was in the kitchen getting acquainted vernet waited for the police in the bar upstairs and charles somewhat miffed at his demotion nevertheless was assisting fritz whenever necessary lupa and i sat in the office discussing the war i still say that it will be over soon now that italy has joined us lupa shook his head jules you are deluded this war will continue for years years dont be ridiculous mark my words you talk of settling down and growing your vineyards in peace in two years youll be wondering if youll be able to hold on to your land the government will need every man every resource and it will take them your hobbies which you so treasure and rightly so will fade to insignificance there will be no good food available everyone will join in the effort watkins has brought me the news that theyll soon be hiring women at the munitions factories no yes indeed every man will be fighting factory workers sick men even older men will be forced to the front and it will be to no avail the war will drag on keep in mind jules its only been ten months theres still adventure and idealism in the thought of war give the world two or three or five years of it and youll see everything you know change after this case is over im quitting myself though my uncle will disapprove i may have to go to america to escape this war though i fear that even the americans and their pacifist wilson will have to join luckily for france theyll support her not exactly a utopian are you no a realist they dont go well together knowing that cynicism and youth were constant companions i was not unduly depressed by his opinions though it saddened me to see such an intelligent man obviously unaware of the military realities germany was strong but wed been beaten in and had learned from it the kaiser was no bismarck that was the point to remember no german army would ever march under the arch de triomphe again you french he continued with your elan vital it isnt will that wins a war its firepower this war wont be settled by men being pushed against other men on the fronts but in the countries themselveswhere every effort of the economy the government the citizenry itself will play a part and it will be at least two years before that fact is realized no jules prepare yourself for a long siege and you i said how will you avoid conscription he sat back i am willing to die i suppose for freedom and i am more than willing to devote my talents to serve the allied cause but i could never ever serve on the front as one of the thousands who are important because they are bodies my ego would never permit it and honestly jules would yours i looked down at my hands id rather not serve at the front if thats what you mean but in my case its more a question of age than conceit he shrugged call it what you will are you getting ready to go id gotten up alerted by noises upstairs he put his fingers to his lips as he crossed over to me and together we listened at the door to what sounded like magiot himself talking to vernet you expect me to believe that he left here this afternoon and left no hint of where he was going i expect nothing monsieur vernet replied i merely tell you what happened i dismissed him he left cest ça cest tout magiot asked a couple of questions about fritz and then angry but satisfied with the responses left so it had worked lupa walked back to his chair and sat satisfactory jules youre going home this evening good would you check something for me of course the table in your sitting room in front of the fireplace id like you to look at it carefully and describe it to me in detail when you return tomorrow i left him exactly as id found him sitting over a book at his desk i found my way out easily through the tunnel walked to the car and began the drive home it had been a long day only as i turned off the light near my bed to sleep did i remember that the telegram from georges hadnt arrived tuesday may the day broke cool and clear i threw the comforter off and got to my feet downstairs the kitchen was spotless as always but without fritz seemed lifeless i made my own coffee which was not good and ate one of yesterdays croissants which was worse i hadnt seen tania since sunday after the shooting and so i decided to pay her a call the walk to her house was always pleasant for me and no less so this morning the greens were vibrant and id gotten started early enough to hear the birds chirping it was not quite cold though i walked with my hands in my pockets danielle answered my knock and stood wringing her hands in the doorway is madame in i inquired she shook her head back and forth and looked at me helplessly whats the matter danielle i brushed past her and on into the foyer tania there was no answer elle est partie danielle had come up behind me wheres she gone to when did she leave the domestic only shook her head tears coming to her eyes the other woman what about her shes also gone when did they leave have you no idea they were gone when i got up this morning they were here last night oh monsieur giraud im so worried i dont know what could have happened everything was normal last night and now they are gone there is no note i heard nothing she was becoming hysterical so i walked her to a chair and we sat down i took her hand now look danielle try to remember did anyone come last night did madame act strange in any way how was the other woman last night she was walking around of course with the bandage still on her head but we talked and she seemed well the madame had dinner and went up to bed early complaining of a headache no one came to the house what time did you get up this morning at dawn monsieur comme dhabitude were there any signs of trouble struggle of any kind no all right wait here ill look around so saying i left her in the sitting room and went to tanias room the bed had been slept in her cosmetics were neatly arranged her brush had some hair in itsince danielle cleaned daily it was likely that tania had taken the time to comb out her hair everything was in order on tanias bureau there was a framed photograph of herself her husband and the four boys formally posed around their sitting room mantel the focus was clear all the likenesses visible from the age of the boys the picture had been taken within the past two years i remembered lupas directions and my hand reached out to take the thing but then i stopped could i do this to my lover were there no limits to this intelligence gathering how would tania react to the missing picture turning abruptly i left the room emptyhanded in the other rooms i looked at windows for signs of forcible entry for scuff marks in the hall which might show where a struggle had taken place but i found nothing annas bandage lay in a wastebasket near her dressing table but she may have had it changed i came back down to find danielle as id left her but now dabbing at her eyes more frequently the girl was not yet twenty and no doubt was easily upset there there i said which was patently no help she cried for another small time before i could quiet her by suggesting that she go to my house until further notice and try to keep the place in order even as i said it i cursed to myself id forgotten to look over the table near the hearth still it was no great matter i was worried about tanias disappearance if nothing else it was badly timed what would lupa say when he heard that anna had disappeared i didnt care to think about it as we were about to lock up the house i excused myself for a moment trudging wearily back up the stairs to tanias room carefully i removed the family portrait from the frame rolled it and placed it in my coat pocket if it would serve to clear her of suspicion she would have to do without it for a time on the way back down the stairs i tried to rationalize my guilt by telling myself that had she been there i would have asked to borrow the picture and she would have acceded it was small consolation we carefully locked up the house and walked together as far as the road i was in a hurry to get to valence though i couldnt have said whyperhaps i was as much concerned with getting out of danielles presence nothing upset me more than the whimpering voice of an hysterical teenager be that as it may i left her with my keys and turned to valence i found myself breathing hard and forced myself to a slow walk it would be good if as lupa said this thing was coming to a head i was afraid i wouldnt be able to stand the pace much longer i stopped at the first cafe en ville and ordered a double espresso and a newspaper by the time id finished both it was close to nine oclock and traffic had picked up on the road i felt much more relaxed and decided for the moment to put off seeing lupa shut up as he was in his hideaway at la couronne he would not be of much help in determining tanias and annas whereabouts anyway and i was still not at all sure that the ladies were at risk walking out of the cafe i glanced in the direction of st etienne and saw sulfur clouds beginning to rise so the factory was still producing things hadnt gotten out of control yet i headed toward the telegraph office to check on early telegrams perhaps they hadnt bothered to deliver georgess telegram of the night before or maybe it had only arrived this morning no such luck nothing had arrived for me at all again out on the street i turned toward the police station thinking it would seem logical to magiot if i showed an interest in whether theyd taken lupa or not the way my morning had been going magiot might even cheer me up i was ushered directly into his office he rose to greet me and we shook hands well jules what wakes you so early id play his game curiousity jacques i wanted to see if eight oclock came twice a day someone told me it appeared in the morning and i wanted to check it out for myself he smiled tolerantly but i said i really thought id drop by and see if youd picked up lupa or gotten anywhere with this thing i had a devil of a time sleeping last night what with all your talk of international affairs have you got him did he confess magiot arranged some papers on his desk taking his time he got out a cigarette offered me one which i refused and lit it no he said finally we didnt get him hed left la couronne by the time wed come to arrest him lupa left when did he go i saw him there only yesterday morning evidently vernet fired him outright when he learned of the forged papers he packed up and left immediately you know theyve hired your manfritz isnt itto take his place no no i didnt know that by the way jules why did you fire him just at this time i shrugged i found myself not trusting him it wasnt anything specific that brought it on but since hed brought in the beers that night it occurred to me that hed had as good a chance as anyone to poison one of them i kept getting more and more nervous as mealtimes approached until finally i wasnt enjoying his cooking so i let him go but i understand he brought the beers in on a tray from which everyone selected true as i said it wasnt anything specific i just cant have a man in my house whom i dont trust completely he could have arranged it possibly yes from your point of view possible i think youve been unjust though its your right i shrugged again there are other chefs but what are you doing about lupa have you any ideas none really he didnt leave by train at least no one saw him leave by train he could really be anywhere weve wired all the neighboring towns and asked for their hotel lists though of course hell change his name he may have sheafs of forged papers still i think well get him you can rest assured i hope so why though did you wait until last night to go for him surely you could have picked him up at any time wed already been by in the morning if you remember what i told you yesterdayit must have been after you had talked to him because he wasnt there we reasoned our best chance to find him was during dinner hours with the force so shorthanded we couldnt leave someone there to cover the doors at all times so we gambled and lost a shame i said sincerely damned right he agreed stubbing out his cigarette and now old friend if theres nothing else i should be getting on to routines im glad to see you showing some interest at least do drop around later if you have any more questions we should have him within the week yes well thank you for your time jacques i know the way out out in the corridor i allowed myself a smile passing through the lobby my hands in my pockets and my head down i heard a familiar voice the american accent echoed unmelodically off the marble walls i stopped and saw paul leaning over the reception desk obviously angry but ive been reporting at st etienne every day for a week now i cant be there tonight dont you understand i can report here just as well the gendarme replied in a low voice well all right then arrest me but at least let me i tapped him on the shoulder paul i said he stopped and turned jules thank god listen can you help me these people dont seem to realize that i cant report to st etienne this evening why not i received a wire from my publishers telling me to meet their representative tonight in valence so i thought it would be a simple enough matter to report here but this man here keeps telling me that its against the rules if i were told to report in st etienne then i must report in st etienne its insane whats the goddam difference why dont you just wire the representative to meet you in st etienne hes already left by now jules if im not here they wont take it lightly i imagine not all right let me talk to him i leaned over the desk and pointed out to the flic that since they already had a suspect it was rather pointless to keep hounding everyone else involved perhaps monsieur magiot would see the logic of my position at the mention of the chiefs name the desk guard looked down and mumbled that perhaps something could be done to accommodate the monsieur i told him i sincerely hoped so then i turned took pauls arm and walked out the front door out on the stoop i put my arm around him well how are you fine now thank you let me buy you a drink volontiers we settled in a cafe and i surprised both paul and myself by ordering a vichy water what were you doing in the station he asked i certainly didnt expect to run into you there oh the police chief here is an old acquaintance of mine yesterday he told me they were going to arrest lupa and so it was him im damned not necessarily the police have decided it was him and hes left town well that clinches it well yes it appears so anyway i was at the station to see if theyd got him and found all this out seems his papers were forged too he sipped at his whiskey doesnt surprise me any though no no look at it like this jules wed all been meeting there at your place for a long time and if anybody wanted to kill marcel they could have done it any old time but everybody liked marcel course theres other reasons for killing than having it be personal but anyway this lupa fellow comes in and right off marcel is killed and then lupa runs away didnt he have to register every day he was foreign too wasnt he i suppose they asked him to but no since he was in town they only requested that he not leave well there now i hope they hang the bastard we were sitting on the sidewalk and the talk turned to other matters it was a fine day and we chatted until noon and then decided to have a bite halfway through our ham sandwiches paul looked up across the street and spoke its old home week at grand central he motioned with his head to a couple walking toward us on the other side of the road as yet unaware of us it was georges and madame pulis when they were abreast of us paul called out to them the secrets out now about you two come on over and join us and maybe we wont tell henri they stopped abruptly waved and waited for the traffic to let up georges took her by the arm and limping nimbly guided her to our table they ordered drinks and while waiting for them to arrive georges continued the teasing now that its known my dear why hide it any longer he winked at us as madame pulis flushed crimson taking her hand he gave it a gallant kiss or is it to be au revoir he turned his head away in mock despair oh georges stop madame pulis was rather heavily set but not unattractive when she wasnt crying she smiled broadly and took us all in georges came by to see henri but hes off delivering somewhere so georges offered to accompany me to the market thats all there is to it whats the line about the lady protesting too much asked georges laughing she blushed again as the drinks arrived what brings you back so early georges i asked i thought you werent due in valence until tomorrow evening luck he said two appointments canceled just as well i could use the time off youve heard the news havent you paul piped in whats that last night the police went to arrest lupa for marcels death and hed left town georges sipped at his pernod so it wasnt one of us im relieved you didnt really think it was madame pulis asked he shrugged no one really knew too much about anyone else in our group when i heard the rumors about the espionage angle i must admit i became concerned i didnt suspect anyone but then i couldnt completely trust anyone either now its a relief it will make tomorrow night much more pleasant i said by the way its going to be at la couronne where lupa worked coincidentally none of you mind do you not at all paul replied at least i dont anybody else georges spoke up moi non plus but why there because the owner there monsieur vernet is a friend of mine and ive loaned him fritz until he has time to find another chef i didnt see any harm in telling them a different story from the one id told magiot in return for which i eat there gratis myself believe me id never have let fritz go if it would have meant eating my own cuisine if you could call it that paul called for the waiter and ordered another round of drinks and madame pulis said she really had to be getting on to the market shall i join you asked georges thank you no im perfectly happy to go alone good day gentlemen a charming creature said georges after shed gone whats she going to the market for doesnt henri own a store paul was relaxing with his third demi georges shrugged the company i suppose i hope we didnt embarrass her too much i said she doesnt seem to enjoy that kind of humor oh shes fine henri and i tease her like that all the time she just doesnt know you two so well he paused im afraid i have a bit of sad news however this will be my last wednesday beer party ive been transferred to algiers paul put down his beer well as you fellows would say merde you echo my sentiments but theres nothing i can do about it other than quit which i cant afford its going to be hard ive come to like this place very much not to mention mes amis he lifted his glass to us when are you going the ship sails from marseilles on sunday so i thought id take the train on thursday or friday probably friday ill have some packing its lucky the police have decided on lupa i said otherwise you might have a problem leaving here yes he said now that you mention it it is fortunate i didnt mention this matter to the company of course theyd probably object to one of their salesmen being suspected of murder he smiled feebly well at least its over not really put in paul they havent got him yet and until they do im not going to rest easy you dont know it georges but he also killed a police inspector last week have they proved that too yep strangled him right on the road mon dieu i decided to join in i feel i must apologize for inviting him possibly all this could have been avoided if oh nonsense jules how could you have known if lupa were a spy of some sortmind you im not saying he was but if he wasthered be no way any of us could have known dont blame yourself all of us only got to know you and each other as well for that matter because of your nature because you trust the people you like exactly paul said like we were sayin yesterday but do they have any evidence that lupa was a spy georges asked either no or they wont say youve got to know this man magiot the police chief to appreciate him they dont at least from my talks with him have any case to speak of against lupa of course his running wont help him any they certainly dont have a motive except this nebulous espionage thing magiot needs to solve this murder and he will even if he has to get the wrong man so you dont think it was lupa asked paul i just dont know then who do you think it was one of us no i really dont think that it was undoubtedly lupa but magiots case on him is so weak that to try and prove anything by it would be folly except that he ran offered georges except that he ran i agreed and it might be that magiot just didnt tell you everything he knows nestçe pas i also agreed with that having finished his beer paul stood up well i must be going along try to get some sleep before my meeting tonight you say fritz is cooking at la couronne maybe ill meet my publishers representative there youre not going back to st etienne no no i took a hotel room in town for today georges and i thanked paul for the drinks id stuck with vichy throughout and felt good paul was a bit tipsy and georges offered to walk him to his hotel they left saying theyd see me the following night i got up and began walking toward annas flower shop too many things were happening too quickly and i was becoming very worried about the two women it was comforting to agree with the others talking about the solution to the murders but of course lupa hadnt done it one of my friends had i felt for my pistol tucked close under my armpit i was glad i hadnt been drinking it was not yet late afternoon and i still didnt feel like seeing lupa so i walked aimlessly past the flower shop no one was inside i strolled on through the town past a group of training soldiers in their red pants and blue tunics out to where the buildings grew more sparse and the fields began under a large oak that was beginning to bud i sat and thought of tania she had gone left me without a note or a word and i could put off the inevitable thought no longer it was beginning to look as if lupa had grounds for his suspicions it was entirely possible that tania had used me used ponty used even her husband before us and now she had disappeared along with the secrets that she had said we never kept from one another i understood then the real reason i hadnt rushed to consult lupai could barely stand to confront myself with my gullibility lupas reaction to the disappearance whether it was scorn or compassion would be unbearable a great worldweariness came and settled over me i leaned back against the tree defeated and closed my eyes the sun was setting when i awoke with a start something from a dream had bothered me and realizing what it had been i woke up it had been a clear day when id begun to doze and looking in the direction of st etienne i should have seen the familiar pillars of sulfur smoke rising over the city there had been none though i moved quickly the walk back to annas shop seemed interminable dusk had settled over the town completely by now making the unfamiliar section of town even more so once again the door was locked and i quietly slipped the lock and stepped inside this time i let the alarm sound though of course i couldnt hear it lupa was behind his desk again he was as usual dressed in brown and yellow it was as though he hadnt moved since the last time i had seen him except now that he expected me he was looking at the entrance to the tunnel as i entered his office getting pretty sure of yourself arent you i said suppose that hadnt been me he smiled then i should have had to shoot you so saying he lifted his hand above the level of the desk it held his pistol thank you though for the warning i appreciate it with what seemed a great effort he pushed back the chair and standing reached out his hand it was i realized our first handshake where have you been i was beginning to get worried i wanted some time for myself i said and i ran into most of our suspects indeed paul and georges we had a fine time theyll both be coming tomorrow night but i have news he was sitting again so have i will you have a beer he reached up to his left and pulled a cord which had been newly strung along the ceiling two quick pulls i looked at him questioningly for fritz he explained weve worked out a code so that i dont starve or die of thirst two pulls for beer if anyone else is about he unlatches the bell as he finished speaking the door opened and fritz entered with a tray seeing me he smiled hello sir good to see you lupa spoke fritz monsieur giraud would also like some beer and hell be dining with us you will wont you of course when fritz had brought the other beer and gone lupa poured for both of us waited for the foam to settle in his glass took a large gulp then looked at me well theres no smoke rising over st etienne he sat immobile his face showing nothing with his left hand he drummed his fingertips on the desktop he sighed deeply so in that case we can do nothing about it watkins should be here before long with a report did you check the table no i forgot he drank hmm well i have news so you said ive gotten through to my uncle about your retirement and hes persuaded your people to accept your decision though if you were younger i nodded you neednt say it if i were younger i wouldnt have to worry very much about my future it would be very short you said you met paul and georges today i had understood that georges wouldnt be back until tomorrow and what is paul doing in valence i reported on my day from the time i reached the police station he listened without moving leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed he might have been asleep when id finished he opened his eyes and seeing his glass empty poured another beer so theyre all happy to believe me the culprit understandable i suppose anything else well i hesitated yes actually tania and anna are missing he then did something i never thought id witness his glass was on its way to his mouth when i spoke and he arrested it midway and set it back on the desk when did you find this out this morning why didnt you report it immediately what could you have done youre effectively a prisoner here i began defensively angry at myself for not having come by sooner for allowing myself to be lulled by my smaller duties my social obligations after i had run into paul and then georges id felt as though i might stumble upon some solution twice id headed to la couronne to see lupa and twice id decided against it my suffering selfesteem had neededstupidly i now realizedto present him with answers not questions i had wrongly persisted in viewing tanias and annas disappearance as my own problem not our common problem im sorry i said i retract that no need to he said its close to the truth no i should have come immediately if anything has happened to them a trace of humanity appeared in the hard eyes he too knew both sidesthe concern and the suspicion tell me about it now he said and well try to make up for the lost time i filled him in on my search of tanias house how there appeared to have been no struggle the only inexplicable thing was their failure to tell danielle dont you consider that strange yes rather everything else was in order perfectly oh and one other thing i took out the photograph and handed it to him he unrolled it and placed it flat on the top of his desk staring at it intently yes he said absently satisfactory just as i suspected so saying he rerolled the picture and placed it in his desk drawer what in good time jules in good time he ruminated for a while finally he straightened in his chair reaching for the nearly forgotten beer he drank it off in a gulp well they are women given to all sorts of odd whims and theres nothing to be done at this time lets see if they return this evening if not he was interrupted by the alarm he reached for the switch and turned off the sound and this time got up to check the tunnel himself that should be watkins he said would you ring for more beer while i did so he disappeared fritz entered almost immediately the tray laden this time how do you like it here i asked he shrugged it reminds me of my apprenticeship the orders are too large and i spend too much time catering to uneducated palates of course im excluding monsieur lupas i hope this situation wont last for too long what have you eaten today i told him and he shuddered i could arrange to have charles deliver fresh croissants and as for coffee really fritz that wont be necessary ill survive though i also hope this charade doesnt go on much longer i suppose you should know that danielle is now watching over the house a woman in my kitchen youll have to watch her sir dont let her use any of i raised a palm its all right fritz ill try to keep her under control one of the conditions id met in hiring fritz was a guarantee that i wouldnt let a woman meddle in his affairs in the kitchen but this seemed to be a special case shell be gone by the time you return lupa returned with watkins and told fritz that wed now have three for dinner watkins looked the same as when id first met him complete with swollen cheek except that he was dirtier there were smudges on his clothes and face lupa dismissed fritz and he left suppose someone sees him going out i asked he looked at me with impatience he locks the outside door before coming in ah more beer he sat and bade us do likewise after we were settled he turned to watkins well he emptied the olive pits into his hand then dumped them into the wastebasket next to the desk its blown yes we know report he looked at us surprised but how could you know there was no smoke i replied but thats the funny thing the stacks stopped smoking nearly an hour before the explosion i thought at the time enough lupa bellowed begin at the beginning yes sir this morning i got up at dawn as usual and when i got to my post there was already activity around the factory evidently today there was a big shipment scheduled by the way last night i was followed again at least back to my hotel same man lupa asked yes sir im sure of it did you get a better look at his face this time yes sir i think i could identify him satisfactory go on so i stayed my ground until nine oclock or thereabouts and a chilly ground it was though not so bad as yesterday anyway then i made it out to the road to valence and waited for pulis he showed up in about an hour by horsecart loaded with supplies i kind of expected him to dawdle around but he rode directly to the loading gate and left the cart with the guards while he crossed the street and had some coffee he never went inside the gate no they dont allow it how long did the unloading take no more than a quarter hour then they sent a man over to get him and he picked up the cart and started back out of town i followed him back to where id picked him up but he looked like he was just heading back here so i let him go i didnt like leaving the factory unwatched for so long then i got back and watched them arranging things for shipment for a time old ponty kept running in and out wiping his forehead and giving directions but otherwise nothing happened for the next hour then around noon a woman came to the gate and i recognized her as the one you uh youve been seeing tania was there i asked he nodded was she alone she came alone and went inside then a few minutes later she left with ponty they were gone maybe an hour for lunch or i suppose it was lunch how were they acting put in lupa i couldnt say sir i was too far away all right continue they returned at about one as i said and both went back inside after only a few minutes she came back out and left i was tempted to follow her but youd only said to follow pulis if it looked promising so i stayed im glad i did for about an hour it was the same story of loading and unloading with ponty running around againand then all of a sudden the stacks stopped smoking as i said everyone was so busy i doubt if they even noticed no matter i stayed put and waited good lupa said did anyone enter or leave after madame chessal yes the janitor when did he go maybe ten minutes after the smoking stopped is that his normal quitting time i cant say for sure sir the other times ive been there hes left at all different times last night he was evidently still on duty when i left and that was late maybe his schedule varies on different days all right lupa nodded and watkins continued about three oclock then ponty came out to check on something at the guards gate some of the trucks had started their motors and things appeared to be getting under way when all of a sudden the whole place just blew up from inside it was something to see id imagine so when things settled a bit i ran over as if i were a bystander to see if i could help the whole building had been leveled but outside things werent so bad not so bad as id imagined from the size of the explosion he reached into his pocketanyone care for an oliveand continued ponty was already up and around trying to help wherever he could and he did get a few of the trucks on the road but generally he was running around in circles and i cant say that i blame him there were an awful lot of dead and hurt so i moved back so as not to be in anybodys way before too long the troops came and cordoned off the area but i got friendly with one of them and found out that they thought it was the ammunition room that had blown so i came here satisfactory lupa said you did well he turned to me you told me that the ammunition room was impossible to enter it seemed to be hmm he leaned back and closed his eyes watkins and i watched him thinking for nearly a minute though it seemed much longer finally he sighed and sat up yes he said no doubt of it there was a knock at the office door and i got up to open it it was fritz announcing dinner we cleared the desk to make room for the dishes fritz brought in a bowl so that watkins could wash himself and then began bringing in the courses being in danger didnt seem to have any effect on lupas appetite i hardly touched the oyster bisque and though the shad roe was superb even for fritz i found it difficult to get it down lupa on the other hand ate with relish talking animatedly about the new book he was reading the socialist jaures larmee nouvelle i tried to steer the conversation back around to the explosion but he insisted we leave it until wed dined business during meals upsets the digestion in this case especially there is nothing more to discuss he continued unperturbed through the crème caramel and coffee while watkins and i glanced at each other from time to time shaking our heads he rang for fritz to come clear the service but there was no response evidently someone else was in the kitchen and hed unlatched the bell lupa moved everything to one side poured himself another cup of coffee and sat back in his chair i lit a cigarette and stared at him yes he said finally i was casually wondering what we should do now youre sure that everyone will be here tomorrow i nodded and he sighed contentedly then theres nothing else to be done you may as well go on home this affair will conclude tomorrow night indeed it is over nowthere only remains to wrap it up and deliver it to your friend magiot i thought he was kidding me oh fine i said should i call him now i think not it would be premature tomorrow will suffice ill take care of it i humored him why do you want magiot here at all he sipped at his coffee so that hell be convinced not to harass me he tried the bell again now i suggest that tomorrow you see no one until you arrive here and of course mention to no one that ill be present our man no doubt thinks the heat is off it would be instructive to watch him react when he discovers hes wrong yes i said and just for the record who should we be watching he looked shocked is it possible you dont know im sure it will be clear if you reflect on it ah fritz excellent you were right about the cognac in the bisquefar more delicate than the sherry i salute you fritz who had just entered with his apron bowed merci who was in the kitchen just now lupa asked monsieur anser he wanted to see where the meeting would be held tomorrow night so i showed him my quarters hes dining upstairs hes not alone is he i asked i believe so sir should i check again that wont be necessary said lupa he looked at me it makes no difference as ive said theres nothing more to be done when fritz had finished clearing i stood to go have you any ideas about the ladies yes i have an idea that they are in no danger i would not be surprised if they were back in madame chessals home this very minute well then à demain not much mollified i turned to go watkins held the tapestry aside for me as i walked through the tunnel i tried to think of what i had missed that made everything so obvious to lupa but to no avail i skirted the entrance to la couronne on the way back since lupa had asked that i avoid the principals the road was very dark and it was beginning to get brisk again so i walked quickly and was abreast of tanias house in under a quarter of an hour it was still to all appearances closed up stopping to light a cigarette i decided principal or not i wanted to see tania and so i walked up the drive to the front door it was still locked i pushed the button by the door and set off a chorus of chimes no lights no sounds i rang once more to the same effect then shrugged and went back to the road lupa had been wrong there and if he were wrong once he could be again the night seemed to get chillier the light was on in the sitting room of my own house and i entered to find danielle sitting on the settee by the front window she smiled weakly when i entered evening sir she stood looking much calmer than she had been in the morning have you heard from the madame not directly i said but one of my friends saw her today in st etienne so shes probably on her way back now i wished i could have believed what i was saying but it would do no good to upset the child im sure shell be home by tomorrow evening and wondering where you are she brought her hands to her face oh sir then i must be off the madame would be very upset to find me gone its all right dear ill take care of it she wasnt there yet when i passed just a few minutes ago shell be all right without you for one night youre sure sir i smiled if i could do without fritz yes yes im sure but for now have you eaten no sir well come that wont do i led her into the kitchen and found some eggs cheese and a few dried mushrooms remembering my promise to fritz i decided to cook her dinner myself though it scandalized her what would people say she asked monsieur giraud cooking my dinner i laughed what would people say now just sit down and relax would you care for some cognac oh no sir i couldnt au contraire you could i wish youd join me while the omelette was setting i went and poured us two snifters she took a sip and made a face i usually have spirits with water i turned the omelette not tonight i said i wanted her to go off to sleep she ate slowly and carefully i dont think she tasted a thing when she finished she was drowsy and i sent her up to my bed fritz would never approve of letting a woman into his room alone i took down a comforter tania had made for me turned out the lights and lay down on the settee to sleep just before i dozed off i became wideawake and swore after getting up and lighting a candle i walked over to the table by the hearth i set the candle down and looked carefully the only mark was the small depression that the detective had noted the previous wednesday sir i started danielle stood wrapped in a blanket in the foyer i heard you moving are you all right perfectly i said id just forgotten something she remained awkwardly shifting from foot to foot whats the matter i asked cant you go to sleep would you like some more cognac no sir only she stammered whats wrong child speak up well sir i just dont know why she wouldnt have left me a note she started to sob then turned and ran up the stairs i went back to the divan and pulled up the comforter neither do i i thought neither do i the next day i awoke early had coffee alone in the arbor then worked in the garden weeding at noon i sent danielle over to tanias to see if shed returned but she hadnt it was quite warm at about two oclock we took a sparse lunch of tomatoes pâté and bread after which i napped while she did some laundry finally when the sun had just set she helped me load three cases of beer into the ford and i drove to la couronne i entered via the front door and asked charles if hed help me unload my cargo a few of the patrons looked up as we passed it was certainly irregular to make deliveries through the dining room but no one complained i was evidently the first to arrive lupas quarters had been rearranged to accommodate a crowd with chairs brought down from above and set around the walls fritz was busy with dinners and i watched him for a short time until i became restless and moved back to the apartment for a beer generally i waited until some of the group arrived before i drank but tonight i made an exception the next to appear were georges and henritogether as they usually were henri was more relaxed than id seen him in the past week we shook hands and his grip was dry and firm georges tells me theyve arrested lupa i think not yet i said but he did it it appears so he breathed out thats a relief i was sure they were going to arrest me because i was a foreignerbut then i forgothe smiledso are lupa and paul georges walked up and laid his arm across henris shoulders i kept telling him last week not to worry if hed escaped the arrests last august the authorities didnt suspect him at all georges was referring to the carnet b arrests of suspected foreign agents which took place upon mobilization the same went for paul but lupaarent i right julescame to valence after august i nodded thats so why dont you have a beer henri and you too georges im sure its been a hard week for all of us we sat and they began to drink henri wiped the foam from his drooping mustache letting only a few drops fall onto his old faded frock georges was dapper in a blue suit and tie he drank neatly did paul make it to the hotel yesterday i asked only to make conversation oh yes georges smiled tipsy but in fine spirits speaking of which outside there was a slight hubbub and in a moment paul entered beaming a fine howdydo this is he said starting without me again he said his hellos all around and picked up a beer good news friends my book is sold heres to poetry we drank the toast he turned to me they took the new poems isnt that great we agreed it was and he insisted we all open more beer in the middle of passing them out he stopped hey wheres the lady i had been worrying about tania since id arrived but was still hoping she would appear i dont know i said but im sure shell be around we pulled our chairs into a small circle and began to talk about pauls good fortune no one seemed disposed to discuss marcels death and since i had no idea of lupas intentions i decided to wait finally there was a knock on the doorjamb and i turned to see tania am i late she asked sweetly i walked over and embraced her where have you been ive been worried sick she didnt get a chance to answer me because the other men had come over and bombarded her with their stories of lupas guilt and pauls publishing so i went and opened a beer for her while she removed her coat and made herself comfortable when the din had subsided somewhat she offered her own tidbit ive just come from st etienne the news of course had been in the paper that day and id been a bit surprised that no one had brought it up before but each had had his own personal matters which were of some importance she continued thats why i was late and im sorry but there was much to do id gone yesterday to have lunch with mauricehes so lonely i feel i owe him at least that julesand afterward planned to go shopping with a friend it was horrible really horrible id like that beer please i handed it to her do you know what happened asked henri i was there yesterday morning only what youve read i presume the ammunition room blew up the guards were killed instantly so they dont know whether someone succeeded in getting in grisly said georges very she agreed i should have been back last night she said to me but i stayed behind to help with the nursing fritz came to the door knocked and entered closing the door behind him excuse me he said but would you all mind stepping into the office for a moment monsieur giraud has arranged a surprise for you so saying he crossed to the tapestry and removed it showing the door i felt to make sure my pistol was available and reassured sat back in the chair i took tanias hand while the others watched and waited for fritz to open the door as they filed in fritz seated them and i spoke to tania where is anna she went to st etienne with me she was feeling much better well i dont understand why you didnt leave a note with danielle we were both very much concerned but jules she said i did leave a note out on the coffee table outside where she always serves me breakfast she smiled and patted my hand i know all about it when we returned and discovered the house locked up i went to your place and found danielle and she told me the whole story it had been chilly yesterday morning and she thought id rather take my coffee inside so she never went out to the table come she said standing the others are waiting whats the surprise i shrugged nonchalantly if i tell you it wont be fritz had me seated to the left of lupas desk facing the others tania sat opposite me and next to her paul then henri and georges with henri on my far right fritz exited no one spoke in another moment the door opened again and fritz asked me to help him bring in the cases of beer i went back out to the apartment and he closed the door behind me lupa came out from down the hall and motioned me quiet with his finger to his lips the table he whispered only that small depressionlooks like a spiderweb he smiled yes i thought i remembered that satisfactory it closes the circle ill be right in fritz and i took the beer inside and set it behind the desk i sat again and fritz walked out leaving the door ajar whats the surprise jules asked paul the tension is killing me tension rarely kills said lupa appearing in the doorway people kill he closed the door behind him the lock clicked into place they were all on their feet lupa ignored the commotion crossed to his desk and sat as he reached for a beer the noise died down whats the meaning of this jules asked georges but they all shared the sentiment please please lupa admonished opening his beer and pouring let us be civilized ive arranged it through monsieur giraud that all of you would be here tonight last week one of your friends was killed in our presence the police have witlessly concluded that i am the guilty party and this is not the case the purpose of this little meeting will be to expose the killer which is one of you but youre the killer henri exploded no sir lupa replied i am not most assuredly i wont stay said paul oh but you will the door is locked besides what have you to fear if you are innocent no harm will come to you if not well ill tell you what we have to fear said georges we have you to fear last week you killed marcel and that inspector tonight you might kill any one or all of us oh tut sir he looked around please all of you relax would any of you care for more beer i nearly forgot to have it brought in there were no takers he leaned back now then where to begin we may as well get at the facts he sighed then drank then began the rumors you have heard about this case being an international affair are perfectly true since i will be long gone and certainly in no danger from any of you i can afford to tell you this i am an allied spy he paused for the words to sink in now then i was sent here just after the war broke out to try and learn the identity of one of europes most dangerous minds and having done so to stop him id been having no luck until last wednesday when monsieur giraud fortuitously invited me to your weekly gathering the person i sought undoubtedly knew me since id chased him through eastern europe for several months preceding my move here to valence he kept eluding me precisely because he knew who i was though i changed my identity and papers in every location finally when i learned that hed come to valence i decided to come here as a worker find a job and stay hidden and anonymous until he acted or made a mistake however nothing happened for so long that i began to fear hed left in desperation i accepted monsieur girauds offer to be seen in public my luck was extraordinary the man i was trailing was at that first gathering of course not knowing him put me at a distinct disadvantage which he decided to capitalize on immediately he tried to kill me he paused to look at the assemblage of course youre probably wondering why he chose that drastic method when in the past hed simply run i was wondering that said paul dryly the answer is as my father would say elementary he had to remain in valence until some other job was completed last week i learned and yesterday it was verified that that job was the destruction of the st etienne arsenal so he had to stay and he had to elude me when by mistake he killed monsieur routier he put me hot on his trail again for the first time in nine months i resolved not to lose him again and i havent killing routier was an act of panic provoked by seeing me if hed kept calm and done nothing he would have succeeded in his mission at no danger to himself monsieur routier by the way since he is dead and the knowledge can do no harm was himself an agent of the french government seeking this same man a murmur ran like a current through my friendswhat marcel cest impossible lupa continued oblivious to their reactions i surmise that at the time of his death routiers cover was still intact which means that his espionage connections were still unknown even to his murderer that much by way of prologue are you sure none of you will have more beer i looked at the faces of my friends the men all were wary and tania was furious id like another beer said henri what about monsieur giraud here tania said why is he helping you is he a spy too lupa looked at me him dont be silly then why are you helping him paul asked me marcel was my best friend i answered after he was killed last week monsieur lupa took me into his confidence and i believe him i want to see marcels killer punished even if it is one of you it is interjected lupa what you dont seem to realize is that any of you could have sat in the seat i vacated last week whoever sat in that seat would have been poisoned they eyed one another a hint of suspicion finally creeping into an expression or two henri sipped his beer and wiped sweat from his brow paul leaned with his elbows on his knees and georges stiffly crossed one leg over the other tania was still angry all right lupa went on so my first problem was who to suspect and at first that too seemed simple suspect monsieur lavoie since hes the only one who was not in valence during the time i was chasing someone in the east i saw the flaw in that almost immediately and cursed myself thoroughly i assure you the murderer assassincall him what you willrarely did his own work i hadnt been chasing him all that time but rather his agents i checked with another of my contacts on that point and he agreed so i had two scores to settle with this man hed tried to kill me and hed made me look a fool then how did he recognize you right away asked paul again photographs he drank some beer youre listening carefully thats a good sign you still look a fool to me said henri lupa nodded perhaps but lets go on i was left suspecting everyone so i had to eliminate madame chessal he looked at tania and she met his gaze im sorry i suspected you for so long but it began when i entered monsieur girauds house last week im sure you didnt realize itindeed you couldnt havebut you in your close observation of me changed your position as i did all evening even after the murder if i crossed my legs you crossed your legs and so on and so you gave away your interest in me at the time i had no idea what could cause that interest except of course the obvious he opened his desk drawer and pulled from it the photograph i had delivered earlier only yesterday did i learn that i closely resemble your eldest son damn i said he does tanias son had a mustache and was much smaller than lupa but the face was very similar where did you get that picture julesshe turned to me her mouth tautdid you have anything to do with this lupa butted in before i could speak monsieur giraud is more your friend than you know madame the point is do i or do i not remind you of your son tania still fuming lowered her eyes yes she said coldly i saw it then precisely and youve been piqued at me ever since because your son is in the war at the front and im not he leaned slightly toward her be assured madame that i too am fighting this war he continued later when you came to question me about missing the funeral i was on my guard and so was perhaps unnecessarily abrupt i now apologize and i thank you for your help with annas wounds the others looked quizzically at us last sunday lupa went on another attempt was made on my life this time wounding a woman i was with and barely missing an associate i have been extremely fortunate i admit at the time i thought it possible that my pursuer had hired an assassin and wanted to be sure hed done his work shortly afterward i realized that that was folly a hired assassin would have killed me no my man was terrified and was acting as his own agent in the past hed avoided being the center of suspicion because hed avoided direct action now once hed acted the inexorable pull of events would lead to his downfall so i finally rejected you as a suspect and happily monsieur giraud was most unwilling to believe you guilty thank you for that she said to me monsieur pulis he said turning his gaze full upon henri im surprised the police havent arrested you since youve acted the most like a guilty man when the police discovered cyanide in your house you panicked and have been on edge since that time monsieur puliss son is a photographer he explained to the others and cyanideprussic acidis used in the developing process he wagged a finger at henri you should have immediately offered yourself for thorough investigation but instead you were terrified that the police would arrest you because you are not french and you tried to hide distorting some facts lying about others you should never have lied about seeing inspector chatelet for example that made me suspicious of you and it had nothing to do with your nationality last wednesday you were blatantly unhappy to see me actually that worked in your favor since the man i sought would never have shown himself so openly i finally discounted you when i couldnt see any possible way that you could bring destruction to st etienne despite your deliveries there though it wasnt crucial i also found it difficult to believe that the man i sought had a highstrung wife and six children to support that leaves the bachelors to be fair lets start with monsieur giraud he convinced me of his innocence by his actions late the night of the murder and if that wasnt enough routiers recommendation was this last of course was nonsense but i kept my silence lupa half turned in his seat and reached for another beer after opening it he stared at the two men sitting directly opposite him paul shifted nervously in his chair georges lit a cigarette mr anser i was loath to suspect you originally because you share my country of citizenship but consider these facts you were sitting next to me last week and were in the best position of anyone else in the room to simply switch glasses with me during the commotion over monsieur lavoies hand you are an amateur geologist and as such have access to or have had access to cyanide you are a crack shot by your own admission you are not french and you live in st etienne the circumstantial evidence against you is therefore impressive on the other hand last week i sent one of my own men to try and cross over with your help he was most persuasive and most subtle and came away convinced that you had no idea what he was hinting at lupa turned to me that jules was the mysterious man you saw with mr anser when you went to st etienne he went on still that you refused my man by no means completely cleared you you might have recognized my ploy and acted accordingly no it wasnt until i discovered that monsieur lavoie was the man whom i sought and that wasnt until yesterday afternoon that i listed those circumstantial facts concerning you as coincidental all eyes were on georges he sat calmly smoking i take it he said to lupa that you are accusing me yes georges chuckled mirthlessly this is rather tedious you know lupa shared the grim humor i dont really find it so but perhaps you would like another beer it may be your last for a long time still no well it was admirable the way you arranged to be out of town during most of this week it did serve to divert attention from you for a timelong enough for you to go about your special tasks lets begin with last wednesday by the way consenting to be a regular guest was an admirable choice of covers whether it had begun by design or by coincidence you wasted no time in recognizing the value of this particular group to your ends they were a singularly respectable though eccentric group of citizens your presence among them established your bona fides in an especially effective manner to the rest of the community your status as newcomerand hence a natural object of rumor and suspicionwas substantially mitigated then too among a group with so many foreign connections you stand out as passably french it was a fine decision on your part thank you said georges sarcastically dont mention it but to continue when you saw me enter monsieur girauds sitting room last wednesday you immediately recognized me as ive said perhaps my small deductions that evening were a misplaced show of bravado but in any event you wasted no time since an agent like yourself is always prepared i am too while the others were preparing for their toast you slipped from your pocket a mercury fulmonade cap which youd earlier procured no doubt by prying it from the back of a bullet much smaller than a petite pois it was an admirable weapon you placed it on the table and brought your beer bottle down on it causing it to explode and cutting yourself the explosion by the way left a small but recognizable mark on the table you then excused yourself to dress the wound and passing my seat by the door took advantage of everyones being grouped around the spilled beer as you knew we would be to drop the poisonstolen from monsieur pulis i assumeinto my glass you didnt even have to break your stride when you returned and found that routier had inadvertently returned to my seat and drunk the poison intended for me your panic increased please correct me where i may be wrong georges sat quite still every word is wrong lupa smiled of course i didnt suppose id catch you with that still there were other endeavors to which you were committed and you had a timetable to follow so the next day you had to go to st etienne and deliver an excessive amount of gauze to the arsenal that you entered and met monsieur ponty was incidental what was not incidental was his comment on learning of your trade he said i hope we can keep your deliveries small monsieur giraud here has an admirable memory and repeated back to me your conversation with ponty that comment aroused my suspicion and i fell on it like a hungry dog from that moment on you were my prime suspect but you had worked well and left few clues when chatelet was killed last friday night i was tempted to cross you off but then my associate in st etienne had reported that hed been followed back to valence and by his description i assumed it had been you the man who followed my agent by the way did not have a limp but well get to that so in fact you hadnt gone south on business but had remained here hoping to get a chance to kill me chatelet with a bit of terrible luck for both of you ran into you on the street as he interrogated pulis friday night worse yet pulis then introduced you to the inspector of course between henris being your friend and puliss deep suspicion of me it never crossed his mind that your presence was questionable henri his face red now and dripping with sweat looked wideeyed from georges to lupa again and again he seemed to be trying to swallow but the dryness of his mouth wouldnt allow it remembering his beer he sucked at it like a man dying of thirst lupa pressed on still chatelet presented you with an immediate danger he wouldnt even have to suspect you of anything merely his knowledge that you were in valence would have condemned you georges still smirked why exactly would that be because in questioning the other suspects possibly including myself that fact would have come out in other words you were not in st etienne where you were believed to be in fact you had followed my man to valence fascinating georges said not really lupa answered so chatelet presented too great a risk and you did away with him on sunday you followed me to the woods where i was to have had lunch when you saw your opportunity you fired three times but luckily for me you missed that must have been particularly galling for you when monsieur giraud and i gave chase you ran and you escaped lupa leaned back and pulled the bell for fritz that he explained was my signal for fritz to get magiot and his men thatll be the end of you then said georges levelly lupa drank his beer well see well to get on with it yesterday you succeeded in your primary mission which was to blow up the arsenal to do that you used one of your agentsid be curious to know how you recruited the janitor since all the employees there had top secret clearance but thats another question reasoning told me what he had done my man in st etienne whod been watching the place all day noted that the smokestacks had stopped functioning about an hour before the explosion shortly afterward the janitor had left the building what he had done was to enter the boiler room in the fifteen or twenty minutes when according to ponty everyone in the building including the men stoking the boilers was acting as a pack mule he opened the doors to the boilers and stuffed them with as much of your excess gauze as he could fit the boilers are located or were located directly adjacent to the ammunition room and an explosion of the boilers would of course set off the highly unstable dynamite in the next room the gauze effectively stopped up the pipes creating intolerable pressure within the boilers it also stopped their smoking for at least a half hour before the pressure became critical there was your flaw there is no other explanation for the smoke stopping just prior to the explosion you thought it would go unnoticed and for the most part it did only my agent there noticed it otherwise it was a brilliant plan you were having lunch with messieurs anser and giraud while the pressure was building in those boilers but you should have stayed with directing your agents when you act on your own you make mistakes my agent you see swears that he can identify the man who was following him he didnt know it was you but now well give him a chance to say if it was watkins watkins seemed to magically appear out of the wall as he pushed aside the tapestry and stepped out of the tunnel everyone gaped how many secret entrances does this place have tania asked none anymore youve seen them all he turned to watkins is he here yes sir kindly point him out he pointed at lavoie i reached inside my jacket to be near my pistol just in case it would be needed thats all very clever said georges its a neat little theory with the minor drawback of being completely false you cant prove a word of what youve said henri cleared his throat you were here i mean we did meet you the inspector and i georges smiled at his friend i never denied it henri the point never came up did it henri confused leaned back in his chair monsieur lavoie is right lupa said to the group i could have paid this man to come in here and identify him there is no proof and so now im going to ask him to do something which will undoubtedly demonstrate his innocence certainly georges said his smile ice id be glad to end this farce well then the man who trailed monsieur watkins here had no limp i contend that you have no limp but rather a substantial lifter in your left shoe you can easily demonstrate which of us is right by taking off your shoes this is ridiculous lupa shrugged then leaned back in his chair go on georges paul urged lets get to the bottom of this georges looked around at each of the group and the sentiment was unanimous i saw his glance at the tapestry from behind which watkins had entered and my grip tightened on my pistol finally he came to some conclusion and reached down as if to undo his shoelaces how he did it i dont know but by some sleight of hand he reached into his jacket and came out with a pistol which he trained on lupa the hammer cocked all right now he said calmly no one is to move but i had already moved my pistol was out georges drop it he turned toward me and fired at the instant i did i was hit under the left collarbone and spun backward and to the floor tania screamed and crossed over to me i felt her place my head in her lap jules are you all right jules i couldnt speak and the room began to spin before me there was a pounding from outside then the sound of a door opening and boots on a wooden floor i opened my eyes and tried to focus them it looked as though magiot and his men had entered they gathered around georges who lay prostrate on the floor lupa spoke the words coming to me as though through wads of cotton or gauze theres your man inspector hes dead i passed out it is now august and we are entering our second year of war i write in the sitting room propped on the settee with a pad before me it looks as though lupa was right the war may drag on for a long time miraculously the bullet did no major damage and the doctor estimates that ill be completely recovered in another month in all its been a pleasant recovery period ive used the time to write this report of my last case really nothing formal of course something to read in my advancing years and with which to recall the way it all had been lupa has written twice from corsica after that last wednesday meeting magiot took him in for questioning but released him after tania went in and spoke for him within twentyfour hours he was gone taking anna with him his first letter was written obviously in the first flush of relaxation he said it was his first vacation in four years the second letter however showed signs of restlessness and i wouldnt be at all surprised if he were to return to the fray before long there was no talk of marriage to anna though i gathered that they were together still watkins is back in england presumably with his olives there were several strange offshoots from the lavoie case paul and henri both decided to enlist and even though henri was rejected it brought forever to an end our beer gatherings and tania tania lost her second son three months ago and for a time she fell back into thinking herself old and useless her eldest son the one resembling lupa received a furlough and came home to comfort her after that she recovered a bit and began nursing me daily fritz complained about constantly having a woman in the house but i was happy to have her one day she entered my bedroom early in the morning and threw back the curtains letting the sun stream in she was beaming monsieur giraud oui she came and sat by the bed im afraid my fears of approaching old age have been groundless thats what ive always said my dear but more than you know love to avoid a scandal im afraid youre going to have to marry me our laughter shook the house and so six weeks ago madame chessal became madame giraud we hope our child will be a girl after tania and danielle moved in fritz eventually moved out but there were no hard feelings hed been in touch with lupa constantly and planned to go home to switzerland for a while and then on to corsica since theyd begun the rationing of food in earnest losing fritz wasnt the tragedy it might have been perhaps strangest of all magiot has been around to visit hes apologized several times for his earlier opinion of me hed no idea i was in his words such a man of action hes even gone so far as to say i deserve my retirement we had the pulises and the magiots around for dinner the other night and magiot said hed heard i was to receive the legion dhonneur though i had by now earned his respect he couldnt resist the opportunity to get in one last dig do you really think jules he asked that the medal is for your efforts in the lupa business it seems a rather grand gesture for what was really a rather insignificant episode compared to the larger war i mean my dear jacques theres no doubt in my mind that the recognition is for what i do best and that is ill tell you what that is henri said its for making the finest damned beer in france hear hear said my wife i beamed all around and raised my glass with my good arm ill drink to that i said proudly and so we all did john lescroart john
