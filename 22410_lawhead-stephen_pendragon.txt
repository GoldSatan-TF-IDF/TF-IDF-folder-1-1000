stephen r lawhead pendragon prologue what is there to say of arthur after all these years his birth you know and something of his end you know his battles and his triumphs those at least which the storymakers tell and aneirins book is open to all who care to read it poor aneirin he laboured so hard at his black book yet even aneirin caught but the slightest glimpse of the man he meant to honour it brought him misery in the end arthurs fame his very presence like bright sunlight on clear water obscured more than it revealed so you hear tales and think you know the man you hear a part and think you know the whole you hear one of a thousand speculations spun out by dim and dreary dreamers and think you have grasped the truth but do you know the highest achievement of arthurs life do you know his sorest trial when he stood alone on the battle plain and all britain hung in the balance do you know how he laboured to save the kingdom of summer from its deadliest foe no well i am not surprised in this illborn age much is forgotten that would best be remembered men always give over the best of their birthright for the small comfort of the moment the treasures of the previous age are sold cheap its wealth trampled underfoot alas this is ever the way of things and where arthur is concerned much that should be known remains hidden because arthur himself was hidden in those troubled early years but i myrddin emrys know all the lost and hidden tales for i was with him from the beginning and i stood beside him on his darkest day a day unlike any other in the long history of our race a day of deceit and dread and oh great glory yes great the glory for on that day arthur won the name he treasured above all others pendragon that is a tale worthy of its telling lost and forgotten it may be but if you would hear such a tale if you would learn the measure of a man whose name will outlast this sorry age listen then listen and remember for i tell you the truth you do not know arthur until you know the forgotten war book one hidden tales one they say merlin is a magician an enchanter a druid of dark lore if i were and if i were i would conjure better men than rule this island now i would bring back those whose very names are charms of power cai bedwyr pelleas gwalchavad llenlleawg gwalcmai bors rhys cador and others gwenhwyvar charis ygerna men and women who made this seagirt rock the island of the mighty i need no seeing bowl no black oak water or fiery embers by which to perceive them they are ever with me they are not dead they only sleep hear me i have but to speak their names aloud and they will awake and arise great light how long must i wait i climb the green hills of the glass isle alone and i wear a different name oh i have so many names myrddin emrys among the cymry and merlin embries to those in the south i am merlinus ambrosius to the latin speakers merlin the immortal i am kentigern to the small dark hill folk of the empty north but the name i wear now is a name of my own choosing a simple name of no consequence to anyone thus i guard and protect my power that is as it should be one day those who sleep will awaken and those who guard their slumbers will be revealed and on that day the pendragon will reclaim his longabandoned throne so be it oh i am impatient it is the curse of my kind but time will not be hurried i must content myself with the work given to me keeping arthurs sovereignty alive until he returns to take it up once more believe me in this day of fools and thieves that is no easy task not that it ever was from the very beginning it took my every skill to preserve the sovereignty of britain for the one whose hand was made to hold it indeed in those early years it was no small chore to preserve that small hand as well the petty kings would have roasted the lad alive and served him up on a platter if they had known why well you may ask for the thing has become muddled with time hear me then if you would know arthur was aurelius son and uthers nephew his mother ygerna was queen to both men and while britain had not yet succumbed to the practice of passing kingship fathertoson like the saecsenkind more and more men had begun to choose their lords from the kin of previous kings be they sons or nephews all the more if that lord were well liked fortunate in his dealings and favoured in battle thus aurelius and uther between them had bestowed a prodigious legacy on the babe for never was a sovereign better loved than aurelius and never one more battlelucky than uther so arthur yet a babe in arms required protection from the powermad dogs who would see in him a threat to their ambitions i did not know arthur would be pendragon then the way men tell it i knew from the beginning but no i did not fully appreciate what had been given me men seldom do i find my own deeds and doings occupied me more than his small life and that is the way of it still i recall the first faint glimmerings of the splendour that would be though it was a long time coming when it finally broke that glory blazed with a light so bright i believe it will shine forever hear me now the nobles of britain had been called to council in londinium upon uther pendragons death to decide who should be high king and there were plenty who thought to take his place when it became clear no agreement could be reached and rather than see a hissing toad like dunaut or a viper like morcant seize the throne i thrust the sword of britain into the keystone of the unfinished arch standing in the churchyard you ask for a sign i shouted my voice a roar of fury here it is whosoever raises the sword from this stone shall be the trueborn king of all britain until that day the land will endure such strife as has never been known in the island of the mighty to this time and britain shall have no king then pelleas and i fled the city in disgust i could no longer abide the scheming duplicity of the small kings so quit the council and rode with all haste to find arthur there was an urgency to my purpose certainly but even then i did not fully comprehend what drove me i did not think him the future king only a babe requiring protection all the more since the high kingship remained unresolved even so i felt an almost overpowering desire to see the child the bards awen was on me and i could but follow where it led later yes understanding would come in its own good time but when i bade faithful pelleas saddle the horses that day i simply said come pelleas i want to see the child and so we flew from londinium as if pursued by all those angry lords we had left behind it was somewhere on the road to caer myrddin that i began to wonder if there was more to our speed than a simple wish to see arthur indeed something in me had changed perhaps it was the strain of contending with the small kings or perhaps it happened when i joined the sword of britain to the stone however it was this i know the merlin who had ridden into londinium so full of hope and anticipation was not the same merlin who rode out i felt in my soul that the course of my life had taken an unexpected turn and that i must now steel myself for a far more subtle warfare than any i had known aliajacta est said old caesar a man who knew a thing or two about power and its perversities for good or ill the die was cast so be it leaving londinium and the yapping of the petty kings behind us pelleas and i rode directly to caer myrddin we travelled amicably the road was good to us and the journey pleasant it does not need saying that our arrival on that windswept wintry morning was a surprise loyal tewdrig who had faithfully shielded the child at my bidding was still at the council of kings and we were not expected upon reaching caer myrddin we were met by the spectacle of young arthur and the spitting cats i saw the child clutching those two halfgrown cats one in each fist and it seemed to me a sign behold the bear of britain i declared gazing at the chubby child a wayward cub look at him still he must be taught like any young beast our work is before us pelleas as we climbed down from our horses tewdrigs men came running to welcome us caer myrddin maridunum in an elder timeseemed bursting with wealth and i was pleased to see my old settlement so prosperous above the noise of our greeting the clang of an iron hammer reached my ears and i remarked on it lord tewdrig has found a smith explained one of the men taking the reins from my hand and all day long we are kept running for him better that than running from the sea wolves declared another with their words in my ears i stared at the child arthur and listened to the ring of newmade steel in the air i peered with my golden eyes beyond the thin veil of this worldsrealm into the otherworld and i saw the shape of a man there straight and tall a big man born to walk the earth as a king truly this was my first premonition of arthurs future believe it presently i came back to myself and turned to greet llawr eilerw battlechief and adviser to lord tewdrig who held the caer in his lords absence welcome myrddin emrys welcome pelleas llawr gripped us by the arms in greeting ah and good it is to see you both just then we heard a shriek and turned a young woman had appeared and was standing over arthur scolding him she slapped his hands to make him release the cats and the child cried outin anger not in painand reluctantly let them go the woman stooped and gathered up the child saw us watching blushed and turned hurriedly away she has the care of the child i inquired she has lord emrys what happened to enid the woman i brought llawr regarded me with a frankly puzzled look that is enidthe very same you brought here there has been no one else remarkable i confessed much surprised i would not have known her she has changed and much for the better i will summon her if you wish later perhaps i replied it is not necessary now of course said llawr forgive me you have ridden far today and you are thirsty we will raise the welcome bowl between us the beer was dark and frothy good tewdrigs hall was warm the jar went around several times and we talked idly with llawr and some of the men who had met us typically no one would ask us outright why we had come that was unthinkable although they knew we had attended the council and must have been near to bursting with curiosity who is the new high king who has been chosen what has happened nevertheless they respectfully allowed us to come to it in our own time it has been quiet all year llawr said and now that winter is here we need not worry the snow will keep the sea wolves home indeed replied the man sitting next to him we have had more snow than last year the cattle do not like it though it is not easy for them but favourable for the crops put in another if this years harvest is as plentiful as the last observed llawr we will have surplus grain to trade even with our new storehouses i noticed those i remarked four new granaries why is the caer growing so big we are growing it is true said one of the men ruel by name but lord tewdrig wants to begin storing more grain the more we save now says he the less we will want later so he tells us and i agree with him said llawr sharply times are uncertain enough we can no longer live from one harvest to the next and be content we must have a care for the future there is wisdom in it i told them in these evil days only a fool would trust past benefits to continue the men regarded me warily llawr forced a smile and attempted to lighten the mood evil days surely emrys things are not so bad as that the saecsens are gone and the irish have not raided all year we have peace and plenty enough any more and we will become soft and lazy the others nodded agreement with their chief enjoy your peace and plenty my friends it is the last you will know in this life the smile faded from llawrs face the others looked on aghast i was to have this effect on men more and more as the years went by but it is not possible for the cymry to remain downcast any great length of time the mood quickly lightened once more and i too brightened as the talk turned to other matters when the beer was gone the others took their leave and we were alone with llawr were lord tewdrig here he said no doubt he would command a feast for you buthe spread his hands helplessly i do not know when he will return this was llawr eilerws attempt at guiding the conversation towards the reason for our visit now that we were alone i was happy to oblige i think your lord will not be far behind us i told him as you have no doubt guessed we left the council before the others llawr only nodded sympathetically as if he knew all about the contrariness of kings which no doubt he did i might as well tell you i continued since you will learn of it soon enough and it is no secret in any event there will be no new high king the council was deadlocked agreement was impossible no one was chosen i feared such sighed llawr evil days you said aye you were right he considered this for a moment and then asked what will happen now that remains to be seen i replied llawr might have asked and have you seen it but if the question was in his mind he refrained well he said stolidly we have lived this long and longer without a high king we will go back to the way we were before to this i shook my head gently nothing i whispered looking past llawr and out through the doorway as if into the very heart of the future itself nothing will be as it was before that night we ate simply and went early to our beds after breaking fast the next morning i summoned enid to me we waited for her in tewdrigs chamber talking softly it is good that we have come here i told pelleas this morning i am content as i have not been for a long time i am glad to hear it pelleas replied in a moment the young woman enid appeared she had brought arthur with her and stood shyly on the threshold she held the child close as if afraid we would steal the infant away from her closer enid i coaxed her gently let me look at the two of you deerlike she moved cautiously forward but only a step or two i smiled and beckoned her i can be persuasive when i choose to be am i not of the fair folk after all enid returned my smile and i saw the line of her shoulders relax slightly when i saw you yesterday i did not recognize you you are grown a very pretty young woman enid i told her she inclined her head shyly and i am pleased to see that you have cared well for the child she nodded but did not raise her eyes what would you say if i told you he must go away enids head snapped up and her eyes sparked fierce fire no you must not he belongs here she held the child more tightly arthur struggled in her embrace i am this is his home he would not be happy somewhere else you love the child so much then this is his home enid pleaded as if this were the thing closest to her heart you must not take him away he has enemies enid i explained softly or he soon will have when they remember him and they will not now be slow in remembering he will not be safe here any longer the more cunning among them will look for me and hope to find him enid bent her head and said nothing she held arthurs cheek against her own the child tangled a small hand in her soft brown hair i did not bid you here to frighten you i said rising i only wanted to ask after the child i stepped close to her and the child reached out a hand to me taking hold of the edge of my cloak sit please we will speak no more of leaving just now we sat down together and enid placed arthur between her feet the child toddled to pelleas and stood gazing up at him pelleas smiled reached down to take his hand and on a sudden inspiration thought to test the child allowing arthur to hold two fingers of either hand pelleas slowly raised his hands pulling arthur off his feet to dangle above the floor the infant liked this game and squealed to show his pleasure holding him off the ground pelleas started to swing the boy gently from side to side arthur did not let go but started to laugh pelleas swung him faster and arthur began to giggle faster and faster and arthur roared with delight deliberately pelleas pulled one of his hands free the child held on the more tightly with his remaining hand and laughed the harder though we had seen him with the cats the day before and should have been prepared still the lads grip surprised me the strength in those pudgy little fingers was considerable at last pelleas lowered arthur to the floor to his loud protest the babe wanted to play the game again kneeling before the child i took one tiny hand in my own opened it and looked into it as if i were gazing into a seeing bowl that hand was made to hold a sword pelleas murmured i gazed long into the childs wide innocent face and merry blue eyes then turned again to my talk with enid that was all the briefest of instants but from that moment pelleas never again spoke of arthur as the child but used his proper name or some form of it i mean to discuss this with tewdrig when he comes i continued turning my attention once more to enid meanwhile do not worry over it i may be mistaken who knows as it is there is no danger at present i offered a smile by way of reassurance you may go now enid the young woman rose caught arthur up as he clung to her knees and walked to the door enid i said rising and taking a step towards her as she stood halfturned in the doorway you have nothing to fear from me i will not take arthur from you nor will i allow any harm to come to either of you enid inclined her head in solemn assent then turned and hurried away i hope tewdrig returns soon pelleas said i think he will have something to tell us you are curious to know what happened at the council after our departure i replied in truth i am he admitted with a grin but my curiosity is more than idle emrys did i suggest otherwise we did not have long to wait tewdrig arrived the next day he was pleased to find us waiting for him and wasted not a moment summoning his counsellors to his chambers i want my advisers and i want my cup i have ridden from one end of this island to the other and i am thirsty he bade me attend him and went directly to his chamber at the far end of the hall meurig who had been in londinium with his father ordered beer to be brought the young man muttered you would have thought his hall was afire we have been in the saddle since before sunrise myrddin i have eaten nothing from that time to this just then tewdrigs voice sounded from behind the curtain at the end of the hall meurig i am waiting the young man sighed again and made to hurry away pelleas will see to the beer i told him sending my companion away with a glance let us attend lord tewdrig i tell you myrddin you have stuck a sharp stick into the hive this time tewdrig said when he saw me coledac was so angry he could not speak dunauts face went black with bile and morcant well i thought the old snake would swell up and burst he laughed mirthlessly what i would have given to see that i have never seen such anger that did not find release in swordblows meurig kneaded the back of his neck with his hand but you had vanished myrddin emrys what could they do i tell you the truth said tewdrig in solemn tones had you not left when you did you would be a dead man now i swear on dafyds altar your head would be hanging above the gates of londinium dunaut would have insisted do they know where i have gone i asked tewdrig shook his head i do not see how anyone could know i did not then we still have time i replied mostly to myself for pelleas appeared just then with cups and jars meurig clapped his hands sharply ah heres the beer good fill the cups pelleas and do not stop filling them until i call enough time for what wondered tewdrig as the cups were passed for disappearing tewdrig eyed me curiously a wise plan no doubt where will you go to goddeu in celyddon arthur will be safer with custennin so replied tewdrig slowly you still believe the child a danger to himself what can custennin provide that we cannot demanded meurig wiping foam from his moustache let them come if there is any safe place in all the island of the mighty it is caer myrddin we can protect our own no i told him it cannot be that way when will you go asked tewdrig soon depending upon what took place at the council i answered tewdrig raised his cup and gazed at me in disbelief hmph he snorted that you know as well as i i mean i explained will they abide the challenge of the sword well it was difficult you did not make it easy for us the chieftain drew a hand through his hair but in the end it was agreed that we would meet your challenge tewdrig shook his head slowly oh you were shrewd myrddin i think dunaut and morcant and the others believed that they would win the sword through strength alone the fools should have known it would not be as easy as that tewdrig drank deep from his cup when he lowered it again he laughed saying you should have seen them they might sooner uproot high yr wyddfa as budge that sword it is planted fast and i know i tried my own hand twice meurig smiled ruefully and said i confess myrddin i tried mine too but had i been the giant ricca himself there was no removing that sword you said they would abide the test are you certain what else can they do said tewdrig at first they expected that one of them should obtain the sword and settle the thing for once and all by the time they realized their mistake it was too late we had all vowed to honour the decision of the sword none of them guessed it would be so difficult or they would not have sworn so to back down now would be to admit defeat men like dunaut would rather die than prove you right myrddin so the thing stands when no one succeeded put in meurig bishop urbanus declared that the jords should come together at the christ mass to try the sword again yes that was urbanus eager for whatever crust the kings would toss him well if it brought them back to the church so be it i wanted nothing more to do with them i saw a different path stretching before me now and i grew eager to see where it would lead will they go do you think asked pelleas tewdrig shrugged who can say it is a long time until next midwinter much can happen they may forget all about the sword in the stone he laughed sharply again but by the god who made me myrddin emrys they will not forget you two as it happened we stayed with tewdrig through that spring and would have stayed longer had not bleddyn ap cynfal of caer tryfan in the north come to visit the lords of rheged maintained close alliance with the lords of dyfed in the south for mutual protection tewdrig and bleddyn were kinsmen they visited one another often to trade and discuss matters between them i did not know bleddyn but he knew me greetings lord emrys bleddyn said he paid me the compliment of touching the back of his hand to his forehead out of respect i have long wanted to meet you indeed i hope one day to show you the generosity of my hearth your offer is most kind lord bleddyn i replied be assured that if i ever have need of a friend in the north i will call on you we are both kinsmen and friends tewdrig said trust bleddyn as you would trust me bleddyn accepted tewdrigs compliment with easy deference it may be lord emrys that you will require a northern friend sooner than you think i heard the subtle warning in his words how so they say dunaut and morcant are turning over every stone in their search for uthers bastard they say they are looking for the boy to protect him from all harm though if you believe that you are more fool than urbanus so it begins at last it has taken them longer than i expected to remember arthur as to that bleddyn replied uthers queen has just given birth to a daughter no doubt they merely waited to be certain which way to jump of course it is nothing to me one way or the other but if the child is uthers then it would shame us to allow either of those two to get his hands on the boy it would be i think a brief fostering too brief perhaps for your liking or the boys in those days many noble houses still observed the custom of fosterage where the young were raised in households of trusted kinsmen the benefits of this practice were many chief among them the strengthening and increase of bonds of kinship indeed bleddyn had brought his young son bedwyr a boy of four or five summers to receive his first brief fostering at caer myrddin i considered his words carefully and before i could reply he said come lord emrys return with us when we go back to our lands you will be welcome there it is long since i sojourned in the north i told him making up my mind at once very well we will return with you let morcant find us if he can thus when bleddyn returned to caer tryfan four more rode with him pelleas enid and arthur and i we made camp along the way avoiding as much as possible any contact with those whose lands we passed through especially the strongholds of lords and chieftains we might have received warmth and welcome to be sure but it was best that no one knew my movements caer tryfan proved a good place for us if i had searched every glen in the north i could not have chosen one better protected by high crags of rock sheltered both from the fierce northern winds and from the prying eyes of proud southern lords bleddyn made us welcome and showed himself the openhanded lord of a frank and generous people we settled there and made our home among them autumn winter spring summer the seasons progressed uneventfully enid continued to look after arthur and seemed wellpleased with her new home in time she even married and began another family of her own arthur grew hale and healthy going from strength to strength as he mastered the small tasks of childhood soon it seemed bleddyns youngest son returned and found a ready friend in young arthur bedwyr a slim graceful boy dark as arthur was fair bold shadow to arthurs bright sun took young arthur under his care the two became constant friends inseparable golden mead and dark wine poured into the same cup as they say it was joy itself to see them at play the fervour of their purpose was not the less for the fact that their swords were wooden oh they were ferocious as mountain cats and just as wild each day they returned from their weapons practice trailing clouds of glory on account of the boys friendship bleddyn delayed sending bedwyr to his second fostering but the day could not be held off forever sooner or later bedwyr and arthur must be separated for arthurs sake i dreaded the day then just after harvest time in arthurs seventh year we took the boys to the warriors gathering once a year the northern lords assembled their warbands for a few days to feast and hold games of skill at arms it was for sport of course but it produced a considerable benefit in allowing the younger men a chance to try their skills against more experienced warriors to test their mettle before actual battlealbeit in a sometimes painful way better a bruise from a friend however than a bloodletting at the hands of the foe and the saecsen kind were not known to leave off at a cry of i yield bedwyr and arthur had heard of the gathering and began badgering me about it please let us go emrys bedwyr pleaded we will stay out of the way you will not know we are there and neither will anyone else say yes myrddin the gathering was for warriors who had already joined a warband boys were not normally allowed to attend and they both knew this i was about to say them no on this account it would be good for us to go insisted arthur seriously it would help with our training i could not argue with this logic it was in nowise a bad notion still it was not the tradition and i was doubtful i will ask bleddyn i told them if you promise to abide by his decision bedwyrs face fell then we will be staying here another year my father will never let us go another year i asked i do not recall you asking to go last year the young prince shrugged i wanted to ask but arthur said no he said we were still too young and it would do us no good to go so we waited to ask this year i turned to arthur you have been waiting all year he nodded it seemed better to me later that night i argued their case before bleddyn such thinking shows wisdom and should be rewarded undoubtedly they would learn much i say they should be allowed to go bleddyn considered this for a moment and asked assuming i allowed it what would they do at the gathering i honestly cannot say i laughed but i do not think it would matter overmuch to them if all they did was stand aside and watch and arthur is right it would help with their training next year perhaps they may be ready for it bleddyn allowed they are too young yet so i told them but bedwyr informed me they have already waited a year bleddyn raised his eyebrows in surprise so i explained quickly it is the truth they wanted to go last year but arthur decided they would have a better chance if they put off asking until this year when they were a little older so they waited remarkable mused bleddyn such patience and forethought is indeed rare in one so young you are right myrddin it should be rewarded very well i will allow it but you and pelleas will have to look after them and keep them out of trouble i have business with the northern lords so it was that pelleas and i became shepherd to two young boys on shaggy ponies at the warriors gathering bleddyns warband the largest among the northern clans numbered over a hundred but the five lords who owed bleddyn fealty each boasted warbands almost as large thus with several hundred warriors in attendance the celyddon gathering was by no means an insignificant affair in later years the gatherings would draw whole settlements clans and chiefdoms to the spectacle but at this time it was for noblemen and their warbands alone and two young wouldbe warriors who had the kings let to attend within celyddon forest itself there was no clearing large enough to hold a gathering of any good size but north of celyddon where the forest gave way once more to high windswept moors there were many broad valleys well suited for such a venture one bright autumn day soon after the harvest was completed and secured for the winter bleddyn mounted with his warband and we started for the hills for two days we rode through the forest hunting in celyddons gametracks along the way the warriors spirits were high there was much goodnatured jostling and jesting the forest echoed with the sound of laughter and song at night the men built great fires and clamoured for a tale of valour i summoned my harp from pelleas and sang to the throng bedwyr and arthur were foremost among them of course brighteyed and eager to the last lingering note early on the fifth day we reached the forests end and by dusk arrived at the gathering place a wide valley formed at the meeting of two rivers the sun had already dropped behind the high shoulder of the hill but the sky was illumined with the soft golden light peculiar to the northern country suffused in this honeyed light we crested a long ridge and paused to look down into the valley three or four warbands were already there and the smoke from their cooking fires hung silver in the still evening air at the sight of the fires below blazing like newfallen stars the boys halted i never imagined there would be so many bedwyr gasped there must be ten thousand not as many as that i assured him but it is more than have gathered in many years why asked arthur because the lords are increasing the warbands each year we need more warriors to fight the saecsens then it is good bedwyr and i have come he replied thoughtfully bedwyr put the lash to his pony and rode ahead to join the first of the warriors making their way down to the valley arthur bedwyr shouted come on hurry the two boys slapped their horses to respectable speed and flew down the hillside whooping like the bhean sidhe i hope we have not made a mistake pelleas said watching the two boys streaking away when pelleas and i finally caught them again they were sitting by a fire listening to a harper sing the battle of the trees since there could be no stirring them until the song was over we settled down beside them crosslegged on the ground to wait the harper belonged to the household of one of bleddyns kinsmen a man with a roman name ectorius this ectorius held lands a little north and east of celyddon on the sea a difficult region to protect since the saecsens and their minions frisians angles jutes and others often sought landing there in one of the innumerable nameless rock bays coves and inlets he was a big man with a fiery red beard and a head of frizzled coppercoloured hair which he wore bound at the nape of his neck though not tall he stood on sturdy legs like oak stumps and was reputed to have once crushed a cask by squeezing it in his thickset arms if his feats of strength were storied his skill at arms was legendary one swift stroke of his sword could part the purple from the head of a thistle or as easily split a man in half ectorius was as jovial as he was fearless never a man laughed but ectorius laughed louder and longer and no man enjoyed a good song more nor beer nor meat if his taste was not particularly discriminating at least it entertained the widest possible latitude of acceptance no harper however mediocre was ever turned from ectorius hearth as long as the wretch could warble a tale to its conclusion his patron was in bliss in consequence his generosity to bards was well known and he rarely wanted for a nights entertainment the better bards vied for the opportunity of singing for him thus it was ectorius fire which had drawn the boys there they were made welcome and were not unnecessarily reminded of their youth the harper knew his tale and he sang with fervour if in a peculiarly tuneless voice still no one seemed to mind least of all arthur and bedwyr whose faces glowed with pleasure in the light of the fire when at last the tale was finished a cheer went up the harper accepted his acclaim bowing modestly to his listeners ectorius elbowed his way forward and clapped the singer on the back praising him loudly well done well done tegfan the battle of the trees splendid then the lords eye lit on the boys as we rose to return to our camp och he called hold men what have we here lord ectorius i said allow me to present king bleddyns son bedwyr and his swordbrother arthur both arthur and bedwyr saluted the lord touching the backs of their hands to their foreheads in the ageold sign of respect beaming broadly he placed a big hand on each boys shoulder and squeezed stout lads i give you good greeting may you fare well while you are among us bedwyr and arthur shared a secret glance and arthur spoke up boldly we are not to take part lord ectorius we are not deemed old enough to try our skill bedwyr explained throwing a dark look at meas if i were the cause of all his worldly problems well is that so replied ectorius beaming even more broadly then perhaps we must change that come to me tomorrow and i will see what can be done the boys thanked him and then dashed away willing to be abed now in order to awaken all the sooner next morning just before closing their eyes both boys thanked me again for letting them attend the gathering i am glad we are here yawned bedwyr happily this will be a gathering to remember you wait and see artos i am certain i shall never forget it arthur assured him solemnly to be sure i do not think he ever did three in the days that followed i saw nothing of bleddyn he was about business of his own with the other lords of the gathering as i was about mine seeing that no one took any interest in arthur to the northern chieftains he was just another young boy i left the boys in pelleas care and rode alone into the hills there i sought out those whose eyes were keener than my own and whose advice would be well worth the effort to obtain impossible for anyone else it took me several days to raise so much as a trace of the little dark ones searching among the empty windswept hills for the tracks i knew were there i came upon a faint trail at dusk the second day i made camp there so that i would not lose it again and the next day followed the nearinvisible trail along the ridgetops to a hill folk settlement the low humps of earthcovered dwellings or raths nestled in a secret fold of a secluded glen but the settlement appeared deserted the day was far spent so i made camp picketing my horse outside one of the dwellings i went for water to the nearby stream at the bottom of the glen i drank my fill and then replenished my waterskin and returned to camp to discover my mount surrounded by seven diminutive men on shaggy ponies i had neither heard nor seen them approach they might have sprung from the heather banks around us bows and arrows in hand they regarded me coldly deep distrust in their dark eyes i raised my hands in greeting samhneach bredthairi i called to them in their own tongue peace brothers i touched my fingers to the faded blue fhainmark on my cheek amsarahd fhain i told them hawk fhain they gazed at me and then at one another in amazement who was this tallfolk stranger who spoke their tongue and claimed to be a clan member one of the men no larger than a boy of twelve summers slipped from his mount and advanced to meet me vrandubh fhain he said touching his fhainmark raven fhain lughsun be good to you i responded i am myrddin his eyes went wide and he turned to his brothers kentigern he shouted kentigern has come at this the men threw themselves from their ponies and out from the raths streamed women and children in the space of three heartbeats i was surrounded by hill folk all of them reaching with eager hands touching me patting me the shechief of the clan appeared a young woman dressed in soft deerskin with raven feathers stuck in her tightly plaited black hair greetings kentigern she said smiling with pleasure her teeth were fine and white against the hue of her tawny skin i rina welcome you sit with us she invited share our meat this night i will sit with you rina i told her i will share your meat with much clamour and ceremony i was conducted to the largest of the three dwellings inside presiding over a peat fire sat an old woman with long white hair and a face so wrinkled i wondered that she could see out from among the puckers but she tilted her head and regarded me with a clear black eye as i knelt before her kentigern has come to share meat rina told the woman who nodded silently as if she knew i would one day appear at her hearth greetings gernyfhain lughsun be good to you i said and reaching into the pouch at my belt produced a small gold bracelet i had brought with me for such an occasion take this gernyfhain may it bring you good trade the wise woman smiled regally and accepted the gift with a slow bow of her head then turning to rina beside me i produced a small bronze dagger with a staghorn handle rinas eyes lit with innocent delight at the sight of the knife take this rina i said placing the prize in her outstretched palm may it serve you well rinas fingers closed over the dagger and she raised it before her sparkling eyes clearly overwhelmed by her good fortune in truth it was nothinga bit of bronze and bone a steel knife would have served her far better but the prytani fear iron and distrust steel these rust which suggests disease and decay to them gernyfhain clapped her hands twice sharply and one of the women brought a bowl filled with a pungent foaming liquid the wise woman drank and then passed the bowl to me i took the bowl between my hands and drank deeply savouring the bittersweet bite of heather beer the taste brought tears to my eyes as memory flooded through me i remembered the last time i drank that fine heady brew the night of my leavetaking from hawk fhain i drank as if partaking of my former life gulping down the rich memory and only reluctantly passed the bowl to rina when the ceremony of the welcome bowl had been properly observed the clansmen who had been crowding at the entrance came tumbling into the rath children small and brown lithe as fawns appeared in our midst young women cradling tiny fuzzyheaded babies crept in and settled behind the clan wise woman by this i understood i was being granted a glimpse of the fhains treasure their eurn their childwealth a high honour for a tallfolk stranger the men began preparing our meal cutting strips of meat from the haunch of a small deer the strips were wound on wooden skewers and the skewers stuck in the earth around the peat fire to be turned idly from time to time while the meat cooked we began talking about the year winter had been wet but not too cold they said and spring likewise summer was drier and warmer and the sheep had fattened nicely raven fhain had expected the gathering to take place and knew how many were in attendance and whence the participants had come the hill folk did not seem to mind the warriors presence they do not raid like the seaxemen rina explained those of the long knife steal our sheep and kill our children gernyfhain added bitterly soon our parents will take us home have you seen the long knife i asked the wise woman made a small motion of her head not this season she said but they will return soon one of the men spoke up we have seen picti boats flying north and east over the sea the crantara has gone out and the seaxemen will come this was said without bitterness or rancour but i could feel the weight of sorrow in the words the small dark ones could see their world changing diminishing before their eyes they believed however that their parents the earth goddess and her consort lughsun would summon them to their proper homeland a paradise in the western sea after all they were the firstborn of the mothers childwealth were they not they had a special place in her great loving heart and she had prepared a homeland for them far far away from the bedevilled tallfolk they yearned for that day which considering the everincreasing predations they endured could not be long in coming i listened to the recitation of their troubles and wished i could aid them in some way but the only thing that would help would be a long season of peace and stability in the land and that was something i had no power to give pelleas watched over arthur and bedwyr while i was gone rising early to begin the day and resisting sleep to the last possible moment to prolong their participation the two greedy cubs roamed the gathering young wolves out to devour as much of warrior life as they could clamp jaws to they watched the trials of skill and strength with great eagerness and enthusiasm mostly in the company of lord ectorius who welcomed them as lords and sword brothers their highpitched yelps of pleasure could be heard above even ectorius roar of acclaim whenever a skilful blow was struck or a fine manoeuvre accomplished they never missed an opportunity to view the trials and when there were none they practised on their own imitating all they had seen the weather held good all the while and as the gathering drew to an end i returned to camp and lingered near the boys but out of their notice what is it master are you troubled pelleas asked me once when he saw me alone the boys were watching a trial of accuracy with the spear on the back of a galloping horse my eyes never left the scene before me no i replied shaking my head slightly i am not troubled i am wishing there was a way for them to remain together i gestured towards the two boys across the way it would be well for them to remain together pelleas agreed they are very fond of one another but it is not to be no no when the gathering is over bedwyr will go to ennion in rheged and we must return to caer tryfan perhaps arthur would rather go with ectorius pelleas suggested lightly he had been thinking about this i could tell it could be arranged i mused bleddyn would have no objection i thought and judging from what i had seen of ectorius the boy arthur would be welcome at his hearth but that is not what kept you from camp these last days pelleas said turning patient eyes on me you are right pelleas i told him the picti and scoti have sent out the crantara the summons to war in the spring they will amass their forces in the camps and then turn south to raid is it something you have seen it is something the first children have seen i told him where i had been for the last few days wandering among the hollow hills in search of the little dark people i was hoping to find some of them up here this summer and i succeeded rather they allowed me to find them hawk fhain no another raven fhain but they recognized my fhainmark i touched the small blue spiral on my cheek the reminder of my time with the hill folk and could not help but smile they knew me pelleas they remembered kentigern that is how i am known among them now it means wise leader of the tallfolk they told you about the crantara it is certain their gern the mains wise woman told me we have seen the ships flying east to ierneland and west to saecsland flying like gulls like smoke disappearing over the wide water we have heard the blood oaths spoken on the wind we have seen the sun rise black in the north i paused yes it is certain but master pelleas said i do not understand why this should prevent the boys from remaining together what they must learn they will learn best alone i explained together they would only hinder one another their friendship is a high and holy thing and it must be carefully conserved britain will need its strength in the years to come pelleas accepted this he was used to my reasons would you have me tell them thank you pelleas but no i will tell them i turned but that will keep until tomorrow i think come we are to go and speak to bleddyn and his lords they are waiting bleddyn received us in his tent and offered us wine and barley cakes after exchanging observations about the gathering bleddyn introduced us to one of the lords with him a nobleman named hywel who after he had greeted us said i bring a word which may be of value to you then you have my complete attention i replied settling myself to listen hywel leaned forward we have seen barbarian encampments in druim and along the cait coast five altogether some of them large enough for three hundred men we came upon them abandoned though not long so they appear to have been in use early this summer the crantara i said nodding at this confirmation of the gernyfhains words you know this already bleddyn wondered only that the war summons has gone out it remains to be seen if any will answer it hywel regarded me for a moment i thought to be of service to you but it seems that you are better informed than i there is yet something you can do if you are willing you have only name it lord emrys set watch in the spring and bring word to caer edyn if anything follows from the crantara it will be done lord emrys why caer edyn bleddyn asked when we were alone once more because that is where i will be i replied bleddyn expressed surprise so i explained the time for bedwyrs fostering is here and arthur must begin his own i cannot praise your generosity highly enough nor properly thank you for all you have done for arthur i mean to foster the lad protested bleddyn and you would serve him well of that i have no doubt i told him these last years have been good ones but we must not grow complacent i think we must move on now bleddyn accepted this but was saddened nonetheless my loss will be ectors gain he said i feared this day would come i had hoped to hold it off a little longer i wish it could be otherwise i replied but the world will not wait we must move with it or we will be left behind i am sorry to see you go the king regarded me sadly you know the way to caer edyn i told him you have but to saddle a horse and you are there though it would be best if you forgot you ever heard of arthur at least for a while longer the next day the last day of the gathering i went to our tent at dusk as the boys sat eating their supper together before a small fire pelleas had made arthur welcomed me warmly and when i had settled down beside him on the ground he said you have been scarce as boar feathers myrddin and you have missed most of the trials i watched for you where have you been i put my arm around arthurs shoulders i have been searching here and there and learning the condition of the island of the mighty of spears and swords and mounted drills i have had enough had enough wondered bedwyr you never ride with the warriors myrddin i shook my head slowly you are right i have not ridden with the warband for many years but i did once bedwyrs look of astonishment did not go unnoticed is that so hard to believe i countered then i will tell you something more difficult still once i led the warband of dyfed i believe him said arthur staunchly well i did not come to talk about my time as a warrior but about yours the boys leaned forward in anticipation tomorrow the gathering will end and everyone will return to their homes everyone except the four of us this was news the boys glanced nervously at one another and at pelleas what is this what does it mean a prince must receive fostering in a kings house i stated the thing squarely is this not true it is replied bedwyr giving a sharp nod of assent from time past remembering brother lords have trained one anothers sons this is how it should be you two are of an age to begin your training therefore your fostering has been arranged the initial excitement created by this pronouncement faded rapidly as the implications began to sink in bedwyr voiced his apprehension we will not be together will we again i shook my head slowly no that would not be for the best how quickly the moods of the young can change black gloom settled over the boys it was as if they had been told that they must choose between them which one to sell into saecsen slavery though it hurt me to do it i let them live with their sadness for a moment before offering solace then speaking softly i said you will be great lords each of you i have seen this what is more you will live out your days in one anothers company this have i seen as well therefore take heart apply yourselves to the tasks set before you and the time will pass more quickly soon enough you will ride together true sword brothers and the world will tremble at your passing this pleased them enormously arthur jumped to his feet and lacking a sword raised his fist in the air hail brother let us go gladly to our new homes since it is for our benefit bedwyr on his feet now too echoed this sentiment remember arthur continued we will meet again at next years gathering and the next after that cried bedwyr if they were pleased before they were delighted now hail arthur they cried noisily fists in the air hail bedwyr i rose to my feet well said i told them each year at the gathering you shall come together to ride and feastuntil the day when you will no longer be separated the next morning when the arrangements were formally explained the boys accepted their elders decisions with good grace as the camp was being struck and the first warbands began their homeward journeys the boys lingered with one another pledging and repledging their friendship until bedwyr was summoned to leave i must go said bedwyr his voice trembling slightly i will miss you artos and i will miss you bedwyr lord ectorius has a good warband you will do well and lord ennions warband is second to none other take care to learn all you can arthur clapped a hand on bedwyrs back bedwyrs lower lip quivered and he threw his arms around arthur the two boys hugged one another for a moment before remembering their dignity fare well arthur bedwyr said sniffing back a tear fare well brother returned arthur until next year until next year ennion departed soon after arthur rode to the crest of the hill that he might watch them out of sight in a little while i went to fetch him and found him there watching still although ennion and his warband and bedwyr were gone it is time arthur lord ectorius is taking his leave now he made no reply the year will pass quickly i told him mistaking his silence you will see bedwyr again before you know it he turned to me his blue eyes solemn and dark as slate i did not realize until just now that you and pelleas would not be going too somehow i thought we would be together always but we will be together i replied at least much of the time he brightened at my words you mean it myrddin really what of pelleas will he join us too of course arthur became suddenly thoughtful you said we would be lords did you mean me too the uncertainty of his birth lurked behind his words he did not know his father you have been with myrddin a long time lad have you ever known me to speak a false prophecy or to jest in such matters my answer delighted him beaming he slapped the reins across his mounts withers and rode back down the hill eager to begin his new life in ectorius stronghold by the sea i rode back but more slowly ashamed of myself for dodging his innocent question as i had spoken the words they seemed true but why did i hesitate now why not tell him of my dreams for his future why not lay the vision before him and let him see the possibilities for himself the temptation was strong but no no the time was not come he was too young yet too young to shoulder such a burden once he took it up he would carry it to the grave let him live free a little longer four caer edyn sat on a bluff overlooking a broad expanse of shining water called muir guidan an eastwardlooking bay that opens onto what had come to be known as the saecsen sea lord ectorius ruled his realm with a steady hand fair generous as ready for a feast as a fight ectorius was descended from a long line of roman officers centurions mostly and a tribune or two as well who had served the coastal garrisons of the eastern shores ectorius was carrying on his familys ancestral trade watching the sea for the dark knifeshaped hulls of enemy ships bluff ector served a king however rather than a legate his service was for life not the twenty years of the roman army and instead of mithras of the legionaries he worshipped the christ of the british saints apart from these minor distinctions life for ectorius was little different from the life his roman forefathers would have known his stonewalled stronghold lay three days journey from the place of gathering it was a fine ride through the eildon hills north and east to the sea arthur stayed near me all the way not from any apprehension i think he merely seemed glad of familiar company we talked about the things we had seen at the gathering the warriors their skill with the various weapons the differences in styles of fighting arthur had an eye for subtlety a quality not usually associated with him in later times but he could tell the difference between a squared bit and a round one in a horses mouth by the way the animal behaved as its rider manoeuvred on the field or from which kind of wood a spear shaft was made by the way it sounded when struck on a shield talking to arthur was not like talking to another boy his age at eight he had already acquired a wide and practical knowledge of many subjects he could read and write good latin and speak it well enough to make himself understood by even the most demanding cleric he also knew the craft and lore of wood and field the various trees and shrubs and their uses the proper herbs for simple medicines and potions the edible wild plants and where they might be found all the birds and animals and their habits and much else besides i was responsible for this yes from our earliest days with him pelleas and i had schooled the boy in lore of every kind filling his head with the wonders of the world around him and arthur little arthur took to it as he took to everything else with a fever of passion and determination in this his breeding told he had inherited all of aurelius ardour and intensity and ygernas quick intelligence he also had a generous portion of uthers dauntless tenacity which some times showed itself as courage and otherwise as blunt bullheadedness he also possessed aurelius curious innocence in battle the fearless forgetting which led him to attempt and to achieve the impossible this would of course come to be noticed much later but even now he could be seen to exhibit a certain disregard for his own safety i recognized it well and knew its source for i had ridden with aurelius in anyone else it would have been called carelessness or foolishness more like but it was never that arthur simply did not feel afraid daring bravery boldness valour these are qualities of overcoming fear what is it then when there is no fear as i say we talked of the gathering and of the year to come i could see that arthur was determined to make the best of his necessary exile he liked ectorius and respected him as a ruler and warrior he was eager to learn the skills ectorius could teach him at dusk on the third day we came upon caer edyn approaching from the west along a wide winding glen at the end of the valley we began the ascent to the bluff the fortress stood on the bare hump of an enormous rock overlooking the better part of the bay far below rock walls topped by a timber palisade and ringed by a great deep ditch bore testimony to the fact that caer edyn had seen more than its share of saecsen fighting and survived in the golden light of a fiery northern sunset the stone and timber shone as bronze solid invincible and although the land around the fortress appeared comfortable enough sheltered as it was behind the high sea bluffs i knew the northern realm climes could be harsh and unforgiving circling seabirds and the uncluttered view of the wide empty sea made caer edyn appear a lonely place arthur felt it too withdrawing into himself as we climbed the narrow hill track leading to the stronghold but any melancholy was instantly dispelled upon reaching the summit myrddin arthur motioned me to him look i rode to him and we sat gazing over the long curving swathe of blue water that formed muir guidan across the bay wooded hills steep and dark came down to the waters edge away to the north we could see smoke from a small shoreside settlement threading into the air peanfahel one of the warriors told us he had stopped beside us to take in the view and beyond it there he said pointing farther north and west that is manau gododdin the saecsen always want to settle there we have fought in gododdin many times and will again the man continued on his way to the caer other warriors were hurrying by what do you think of your new home arthur i asked it suits me i think it is more open than caer tryfan more like caer myrddin he turned in the saddle to face me and here i am not so far from bedwyr perhaps we might see each other sometimes perhaps i allowed but travel to and from rheged is still very difficult well some time maybe he looked out across the bay and at the dark hills on the other side as if he were looking at the orcady islands and wondering how to get there presently he lifted the reins coaxing his pony forward and we continued on to the caer ectorius was waiting for us as we entered the stonepaved yard welcome my friends he called his voice ringing off the stone welcome to caer edyn the last outpost of the empire so began our long sojourn in the north that first night in caer edyn arthur missed bedwyr sorely it had been years since either of them had been without the other he slept poorly and woke early finding his way to the stables to see his pony satisfied that all was in order he returned and with slow steps made his way to the hall where ectorius waited with a surprise my son caius announced lord ectorius with noticeable pride as he presented a sturdy stocky youth a few years older than arthur the boy scowled uncertain whether to trust us this is arthur ectorius told his son he will be living here from now on make him welcome son wwelcome aaarththur muttered caius then he turned and hobbled off quickly all but dragging his right leg behind him as a babe the lad fell from a rock and broke his leg explained ectorius gently the bone set poorly so caius has limped ever since his father did not mention the stutteran affliction noticeable only when he became excited frustrated or as now anxious clearly ectorius hoped for the best between the boys it is lonely for the lad he explained they will learn a liking for one another i think yes i too wondered how arthur would get on with the surly caius but since there is no force in all the world that can make friends of two boys who do not want to be friends i let the thing rest as it happened the matter was settled quickly enough for later that same day arthur induced a most reticent caius to show him something of the land round about the caer they rode to the little shoreside settlement at peanfahel and on the way arthur learned a remarkable thing about his reluctant new friend the boy could ride like a young god or like the bhean sidhe of the hollow hills whose horses were descended from the steeds of the everliving on the glass isle in the western sea caius had more than made up for his infirmity by learning to ride with such skill and grace that once in the saddle he became a wholly different person one of those halfmanhalfhorse beings of the latin books he could coax miracles from any horse he happened to light upon even the sorriest beast somehow performed better than its best with caius on its back as the day was warm the two stopped in the settlement to water their horses at the ford above the shore some children from the place were playing nearby and when the boys rode up they gathered around and consequently noticed caius crippled leg that was all it took instantly they began to taunt and jeer cripple cripple they called mocking his halting gait they laughed loud and caius lowered his head arthur watched for a moment appalled never had he witnessed such calculated cruelty the jeering was bad enough but when the older boys began throwing rocks at caius arthur decided the thing had gone too far balling his fists he loosed a wild whoop and charged head down at the biggest ruffian striking him squarely in the stomach the startled youth fell on his back legs kicking with arthur on his chest though the boy had three years advantage arthurs size all but evened the contest it was a short scuffle all told the breath driven from his lungs and arthur sitting on his chest so that he could not draw another the youth fainting lost consciousness for a moment the mocking stopped the children looked on in astonishment arthur rose slowly to his feet and glowering with rage demanded to know if anyone else had anything to say no one did the rascal came to and ran away the rest quickly scattered caius and arthur remounted and continued along the shore by the time they returned to the caer later in the day they were the best of friends and arthur had given caius name a celtic cast he was to be cai ever after i suppose because he openly admired cais prowess as a horseman it never occurred to arthur to make fun of the way he walked or spokesomething too many others did and with disheartening regularity but never arthur and for this arthur was rewarded with cais undying loyalty and devotion cai god bless him he of the flamebright hair and redhot temper whose pale blue eyes could darken as quickly as the summer sky above caer edyn with the storms sharp fury whose rare smile when he gave it could warm the coldest heart whose brassy voice carried like a hunting horn through the glens as it would one day rally men on the field of battle cai the dauntless cai the dogged willing to strive and go on striving long after another would have given up the fight for lost we spent those first bright days of autumn discovering caer edyn and the surrounding lands arthur made a game of it seeing how far he could ride out of sight of the rock as he called it before attempting to find his way back pelleas and i rode with him sometimes more often cai went it was he quickly learned a strange land full of surprises the first was the large number of people living in the narrow creased valleys that seamed the rugged hills there were hundreds of these glens each with its own smallholding or settlement we soon came to expect them a few rockandturf houses long streamside fields for rye oats and barley a pen for cattle and sheep the round hump of a stone granary an oven or two burning wood or pungent peat little clumps of people were sown all through the land separated one from the other by the high bleak hills there were woodlands aplenty as well and the hunting was good boar and bear hart deer wild sheep and hare and various kinds of fowl some like the grouse not found in the southlands eagles and hawks abounded and there were fish of endless variety from river lake and sea in short arthur very soon came to view caer edyn and its lands as something of a paradise and certainly less a place of exile than he first expected it would have been perfect but for the unspeakable winter however we weathered it and revelled in the short brilliant spring in all caer edyn provided a splendid home for a boy at my prodding ectorius sought and secured the services of a tutor for arthur and cai one of the brothers from the newbuilt abbey at abercurnig thus the latin resumed as well as reading and writing under the indulgent rule of melumpus added to this ectorius began instructing arthur in kingcraft all the skills necessary to the sustaining of a kingdom and the effective leadership of men weapons practice continued growing ever more demanding as the lads skill increased thus life settled into an easy rhythm of leisure and learning work and play the seasons passed and arthur ceased longing for bedwyr he applied himself to his various lessons with diligence if not fervour becoming an able scholar in all it should have been a good time for me but i was not content thoughts of the crantara gnawed at me and i could not shake them as winter closed on us i began to feel trapped on the rock of caer edyn there were i imagined events taking place in the wider world events of which i knew nothing after years of activity my enforced seclusion chafed me now day by day i receded into myself keeping my own counsel and on the cold grey days of wind and rain i paced the hall before the hearth my mood i fear as cheerless as the day at last it came into my mind that the small kings led by dunaut and morcant had discovered our hiding place and were even now moving against us although i knew ector would receive ample warning of any enemy moving along the borders of his realm i worried over this and fear irrational yes but potent all the same coiled around my heart pelleas watched me and worried master what is it he asked at last unable to bear my stormy restlessness any longer will you not speak i am suffocating here pelleas i told him bluntly but ectorius is a mostgenerous lord he that is not my meaning i snapped i am troubled and can get no peace i fear pelleas we have made a mistake in coming here he did not doubt me neither did he understand we have had no word of any disturbance in the south i might have thought that would cheer you far from it i cried it has only made me suspicious make no mistake dunaut and his ilk never rest even now they are scheming how to seize the throne i can feel it i struck my chest with my fist i feel it and it fills me with fear the fire fluttered as the wind gusted under the door a hound beside the hearth lifted his head and looked around slowly then laid his muzzle back on his big paws a chance occurrence signifying nothing i do not believe in omens still i felt a chill touch my spine and it seemed as if the light in the hall dimmed what will you do pelleas asked after a moment a long silence stretched between us the wind moaned and the fire cracked but the strange feeling did not return an ocean wave flung upon a rock it had receded once more when i made no answer pelleas said what is your fear that the petty lords will find us here or that they no longer care to search staring into the fire i saw the flameshapes shifting and colliding and it seemed to me that forces were gathering power was massing somewhere and i must find it to direct it aright both pelleas and i cannot say which disturbs me more his solution was simple then we must go and see how matters stand in the south i will ready horses and provisions we will leave at daybreak i shook my head slowly and forced a smile how well you know me pelleas but i will go alone your place is here arthur needs you far less than he needs you he replied tartly ectorius is most competent and able he will discharge his duties towards arthur with all honour whether we remain or no in truth i did not actually care to spend a winter in the wild alone so i relented have it your way pelleas we go and may god go with us five we left caer edyn as soon as pelleas had satisfied himself with his preparations ector advised us to wait until the trails had thawed once more but spring always comes late to the north and i dared not wait until the snows and rains had stopped arthur asked to go but was not disappointed to stay behind the day of leaving dawned cold and grey and did not improve we camped in the lee of the hill that night rose early and continued on our way the sky did not clear and the wind grew biting but the snow held off and we were able to press on wending our slow way through the glens and over the smooth cold hills if more slowly than i would have liked prudence demanded discretion arthurs continued safety depended on my ability to keep his identity and whereabouts hidden secrecy was my most potent ally but since we could not shun every settlement and holding nor avoid every other traveller i made myself as invisible as possible thus began what was to become my custom when moving about the land i would adopt various guises to ease my passage among men now an old man now a youth now a shepherd now a beggar now a hermit i would embrace humility and wear it like a cloak among unsuspecting men i would hold commerce with the humble things of the world and so pass unseen and unmarked through the island of the mighty for men seldom heed the humble things that surround them and what they do not heed they do not hinder in this way we passed through the north country and into the southlands below the wall striking an old roman road just south of caer lial the road was still in good condition and pelleas marvelled that this should be so why i asked him did you think these paving stones would vanish with the legions or that the emperor would roll up his roads and take them back to rome hold pelleas cried raising a hand to the muchencroachedupon track stretching straight and narrow before us our path is made smooth for us the way is clear in the wilderness i smiled at his allusion this suits our purpose perfectly emrys we will travel more quickly and our passing will not be marked it was true the stonepaved track remained smooth and unbroken as ever and though shrubs small trees and thickets of all kinds now crowded so close as to hide it from view the undergrowth had not obscured the road and if other men had long ago forsaken the old roads preferring more open trails this same closegrown vegetation would allow us freedom in our movements we would travel without being seen appearing here and there when we chose or when need arose then disappearing once more only to reappear somewhere else i had to agree the old roman roads seemed heavenmade for us and i praised the great light for it often i have noticed that when a way is needed a way appears this is not to be wondered at neither is it to be ignored we journeyed then with lighter hearts though deprived of other human company for the most part since we stayed away from settlements and the hearths of men camping alone sleeping under the naked sky at night occasionally we ventured into a settlement along the way for provisions everywhere i listened to what men said and i weighed their words carefully sifting all i heard for any hint of the trouble i feared by the time we reached the southlands warmer weather betokened an early spring and soon soft air soughed in newbudded trees blossoms quickly appeared seeding the drifting currents with sweet heady fragrance water ran high river lake and stream swelled to overflowing in a little while the hillsides blushed shocking colour yellow crimson and blue the sun wheeled through dappled cloudcrowded skies and the moon steered her bright course through starfilled night peace seemed to have claimed the land but i drew no comfort from this indeed the farther south we rode the greater my anxiety grew i am yet uneasy pelleas i confessed one night over the fire i mislike what i sense here that is no surprise he told me we would not have come this far otherwise perhaps it means we are nearing the end of our search perhaps i allowed morcants lands are nearby i would give my harp to know what he is about there will be a settlement close no doubt perhaps someone will tell us something the next day we set out for the nearest settlement and found one of goodly size straddling the ford of a swiftrunning river a muddy track linked the two halves whose houses were mudandtwig thatched with reed poorly made but the two large cattle enclosures boasted goodly wealth wearing the guise of a wandering priest a long shapeless robe of undyed wool which pelleas had purchased for me at an abbey along the way my hair in disarray my face smudged with dirt and soot i surveyed the place from the side of an overlooking hill this will do the people here are trading cattle they will know what is happening in the world hereabouts as i approached the holding the skin at the nape of my neck prickled to danger i leaned close to pelleas to tell him of my fear but he waved me to silence and reined his horse to a halt rising in the saddle he called out in a loud voice is anyone here we waited no sound came from any of the dwellings presently pelleas called again we are waiting and will not leave until we have watered our horses i imagined sly whispers behind the mud walls around us insinuations quick and sharp flung like knives at our backs perhaps we should go elsewhere pelleas suggested under his breath no i replied firmly we have come here in good faith and i will not be put off we waited the horses snorted and chafed the ground impatiently at last when i thought we must move on a thicknecked man with an oaken club appeared stepping from the low doorway of the centre house he straightened and strode forth with a swagger greetings he said more threat in the word than welcome we do not see many of your kind hereabouts travel is difficult these days agreed i answered if need were not great we would not trouble you for hospitality hospitality the word obviously had no meaning for him his heavylidded eyes narrowed with suspicion pelleas feigned indifference to the mans rudeness and swung himself down from his saddle we ask a little water for the animals and for ourselves then we will continue on our way the man bristled water is all you get mind gods precious gift we ask nothing else i replied smiling loftily huh the man turned abruptly this way pelleas gave me a dark look and fell into step behind him i gathered the reins and led the horses we were shown a stone trough filled by a trickle from a hillside spring through an ancient clay conduit pelleas drank first cupping water into his hands when he finished i bent down and drank sweet the blessings of god i said drying my hands on the front of my robe thank you for your kindness the man grunted and swung the club against his leg we have been in the north i said as pelleas started watering the horses whose lands are these king madocs the man spat and is he a good king theres some as would say that though some would say otherwise and what would you say the brute before us spat again and i thought he would not answer but he was merely warming to his tale i say madoc is a fool and a coward the man who calls his brother fool stands in danger of gods wrath i reminded him surely you must have good reason for such harsh judgment good reason right enough snorted the man i call him fool who lets another steal his lands and lifts not a hand to stop the thief i call him coward who stands by and sees his son slaughtered and does not demand the blood price this is a serious matter land stolen a prince killed who has done these things the man grimaced in disgust for my ignorance who else he sneered morcant of belgarum of course two summers ago it began and since then its every holding must defend itself for we can expect no protection from madoc i shook my head sadly it grieves me to hear this ha barked the man scornfully let your grief defend you i mean to hold what i have his lips curled in an ugly sneer youve had your water now get you gone from here we have no use for priests i could give you a blessing the man hefted the club in reply so be it i shrugged and took the reins from pelleas hand we mounted and rode back the way we had come once out of sight of the place we stopped to consider what we had learned so morcant makes war on his brother kings i mused for what purpose a little land a little plunder it makes no sense will you go to madoc no i can do nothing there morcant has set strife among his neighbours and i would know why as i am a priest today we will do the priestly thing and seek guidance from a higher power the belgae are an ancient tribe whose seat is caer uintan making peace with rome allowed the belgae to establish themselves in the region old uintan caestir prospered and grew large serving the legions but the legions were long gone now and the city shrank in upon itself like an overripe apple withering where it had fallen like londinium to the southeast caer uintan maintained a wall of stone around its perimeter but caer uintans vallum was never as high as londiniums because it was never as needed it served as a reminder of the belgae strength rather than as a real defence so pelleas and i were both amazed coming upon the city at dusk the wall of caer uintan had grown tall indeed and a deep ditch had been dug below the wall to make it higher still the city of caer uintan was now a fortress the gates were already closed and barred for the night although the sky was still light we halted on the narrow causeway before the gates and called to the gatesmen we were made to wait and then answered rudely the surly gatesmen were loath to admit us but as i claimed business with the church the church aurelius had built for the city they grudgingly and with much cursing unbound the gate and let us in lest they fall foul of bishop uflwys whose sharp wit and sharper tongue was renowned in the region shall we go to the church at once pelleas asked as soon as we passed through the gate the streets of the city were dark with shadows and smoke from the hearth fires beginning to glimmer behind the thick glass of narrow windows caer uintan was a wealthy city still those of its people who could maintain life in the old roman style lived well yes i would speak with the bishop i replied uflwys may have a word for us bishop uflwys was a tall stern man of deep thoughts and hardwon convictions it was said that those who came to uflwys seeking gods forgiveness for their sins and crimes left his presence much chastened but much forgiven also as bishop he feared neither kings on earth nor demons in hell and he treated all men the same that is to say bluntly he had come to caer uintan to help build the church and stayed to guide it with a strong hand the church like its leader stood aloof from the world unadorned bespeaking a firm and steadfast faith i was interested in what he would say of morcant the bishop received us cordially he still held some small respect for me it seemed for he had loved aurelius indeed uflwys appeared genuinely glad to see us merlinus dear brother i hardly know you he rose as we were announced and came to us holding out his arms i met him and gripped his arms in the old celtic greeting come come sit with me are you hungry we will eat i have often wondered where you had gone god bless the sight of you why are you dressed like a beggar glad i am to see you uflwys in truth i did not think to come here but now that i see you i believe that my steps have been directed here from the first where the good lord leads his servants must follow eh and from the look of you i would say you were led a merry chase what are you about merlinus uflwys indicated my clothing not taken holy vows at last before i could explain uflwys held up his hands no say nothing yet we will eat first you are both tired from your journey break a crust with me yes there will be time enough for talk later bishop uflwys table was as spare as the bishop himself simple fare bread beer meat cheese but good pelleas sat with us at the board and we were served by two young monks from the nearby monastery our table talk touched on the ordinary observations of travelling the weather planting commerce news gathered along the way when we had finished the bishop rose from his chair we will take some mead in my chamber he told the monks bring a jar and cups we settled in uflwys bare chamber a whitewashed cell with one narrow unglazed window and trampedearth floor and a short ledge on which rested the pallet of clean straw that was his bed but he was accustomed to receiving guests in his cell and in deference to them the room was furnished with four big handsome chairs and boasted a small hearth no sooner were we seated than the monks appeared one of them carrying a wooden tray with jar and cups on it the other bearing a small threelegged table on which to put the tray these were placed beside bishop uflwys chair and after pouring the mead and lighting the fire the monks departed without a word uflwys handed around the cups saying gods health to you we sipped the sweet heatherscented liquid for a moment in silence well now my friends will you not tell me why i have the pleasure of your company tonight i laid aside my cup and leaned forward we have heard that morcant raises war against his neighbour madoc i would hear what you can tell me about how the matter stands the holy mans face grew grave morcant at war you must believe me when i say that until you spoke the hateful word i heard nothing of it he looked from me to pelleas and back again nothing then i will tell you what little i know i replied i related what pelleas and i had learned and explained how we had come by our information uflwys stood and paced fretfully before the fire yes he said when i had finished i am certain what you say is true for it explains much morcant has no doubt taken pains to keep this from me but no longer he turned suddenly towards the door come we will confront the king with this foul sin i will not sleep until i have laid the crime at his feet he must not think the church will remain indifferent to this outrage six an important civitas under the romans venta bulgarum had been the belgae lords stronghold before the legions came morcant never let anyone forget that his line boasted long and lucrative cooperation with caesar and that the lords of the belgae were proud of their past though the forum and basilica had been claimed for private use king morcant maintained them worthily indeed for all his talk of britain he still styled himself a provincial governor the doors were shut and bolted for the night but morcant received us bishop uflwys was too imposing a figure in caer uintan to treat lightly or disgracefully i doubt that i would have been likewise welcomed nevertheless we were conducted to a chamber hung with woven rugs on the walls and lit with rushlights it is late for a priest is it not morcant asked smiling as if receiving the bishop in the dead of night was a most natural thing to him i understood a monk rose and slept with the sun as our lord the christ is always about his business so must his servants stand ready to serve when need arises the bishop answered him whether day or night and merlin said morcant deigning to recognize me at last though i had put off my priestly garb i was still dressed humbly i am surprised to see you i had thought you dead no doubt that was his dearest hope lord morcant i replied coolly you cannot think i would leave britain without a word of farewell when i go the whole world will know it the answer was given lightly enough but the words held an ominous cast and they were received with awkward silence well offered morcant allowing himself a sly satisfied smile at least we may presume to enjoy your presence a goodly time yet now then will you take some wine with me or does your lords business require more sober attention the king folded his hands and made no move to summon the wine rather eyeing each of us in turn he returned to his chair and sat awaiting whatever should happen next bishop uflwys lost no time save your refreshment he said flatly it would be a waste to pour good wine tonight merlinus brings me word of this war you pursue what is the truth of it morcant stared innocently at us oh he had studied his reactions carefully war he said as if uttering an unknown word there must be some error here i know nothing of any war why we are at peace the saecsen devils have spare me talk of saecsens snapped uflwys it is being voiced in the settlements hereabouts that you have attacked king madoc taken some of his lands and killed his son is this true morcant contrived a pained expression did madoc set you to this he sighed and slapped the arms of his chair with his hands in apparent exasperation why is he saying these things against me but bishop uflwys was not deterred so easily i ask you again and demand an answer morcant is the accusation true i would caution you to bethink yourself before answering for you put your soul in peril with a lie if this worried morcant he did not show it he arranged his features in a grave hurt expression you cannot believe i would do these things that is the trouble morcant i do believe it uflwys insisted and i have yet to hear you say otherwise feeling the impossibility of his position morcant attacked you he bounded from his chair and thrust a finger in my face this is your doing you have inspired madoc to contrive these rumours against me but i answered him firmly no morcant i did not then it is all madocs doing morcant replied petulantly oh i see it clearly now you have not answered the accusation morcant declared the bishop rising from his chair i take your silence as proof of your guilt i will remain here no longer lest you do further violence to your soul he stepped towards the door where he paused and turned i will pray for you false lord that you quickly come to your senses and repent before it is too late morcant made no move to stop him but stood firm glowering belligerently the good bishop had him trussed and tied there was nothing he could do but worry the knots and tighten them at every twist pelleas and i followed uflwys from the palace and across the yard i had hoped better from him sighed the bishop but you are not surprised no i know morcant too well for that i am not surprised still i hope always for the best as i said his silence damns him he did the deed uflwys stopped and turned to me what is to be done now that we will see if madoc will suffer his hurt in silence it may end there if not i raised my eyes to the nightdark sky the war will continue and others will be pulled into it which i suppose is morcants intent we made our way back to the church but no more was said until the next morning when we came before the bishop to take our leave will you try to stop the war from going any further asked uflwys hopefully yes they must be made to see that when it comes to fighting among ourselves no one can win but the saecsens they will stand aside and watch while we slaughter one another and then swoop in to carve up the leavings then i commend you to your task bishop uflwys said i will do what i can here of course and i will pray for a swift and satisfactory resolution he raised his right hand in blessing go with god my friends and may our lord uphold you in all grace to the west of caer uintan the land is all bold hills and hidden valleys the woodlands are less dense the settlements more numerous and more prosperous than in the north the summerlands lie to the west and but a little farther ynys witrin the glass isle of old now called ynys avallach home of avallach the fisher king and his daughter charis my mother taliesins people were gone from the summerlands as the region between belgarum and ynys avallach was knownand the realm was held by a man named bedegran as a young man bedegran had fought alongside aurelius and i remembered him as a fair and forthright lord the next day we came to bedegrans stronghold at sorvym his was a large realm and as it was open to the sea by way of the afen riverwhereby the sea wolves often sought landfall he had learned the value of vigilance bedegran was out with part of his warband when we arrived his steward assured us of our welcome and bade us stay until his master returned being so close to ynys avallach i was of half a mind to continue on but agreed to wait if there was a chance of learning anything from bedegran we were given a meal while we waited and i slept a little pelleas meanwhile passed the time with bedegrans steward who said much that his master later confirmed morcant had been threatening their lands for some time trying to provoke a war between them as yet it was nothing but nuisance and vexation a few cattle missing fields trampled and other such like bedegran had thus far succeeded in keeping his head and avoiding open confrontation which was i reckoned morcants desire still this uneasy peace could not survive much longer for when bedegran returned at dusk he wore his rage like a cloak aflame i tell you i have suffered morcants insults long enough bedegran complained as he stormed into his chamber i have avoided bloodshed and battle by turning a blind eye but when he begins forcing my people from their settlements i can no longer look away he stopped fuming long enough to acknowledge our presence greetings merlin embries pelleas greetings and welcome it is good to see you again forgive my anger just now i did not know i entertained guests at my hearth i dismissed the apology with a flick of my hand we are aware of morcants treachery i told him your anger is justified he wants war bedegran explained flatly i have held it off this long but keeping the peace needs two if it is war then i will fight though loath am i to say it he began pacing back and forth before us but this this outrage merlin i cannot stand aside my people must be protected do not think to persuade me otherwise protect them as you see fit i replied i have not come to teach you your affairs listen to me rant such tutelage as yours i would endure you are the one man above all others i would heed bedegran smiled for the first time since entering so i am listening speak i have little enough to say nevertheless i will tell you what i know morcant is raiding in dubuni some of madocs lands have been seized and madocs son has been killed they say but as yet madoc has refused to fight madoc is getting old he knows he cannot win against morcant all the more since dunaut is hard by his other flank ach worse than vipers the two of them are they together in this bedegran shook his head if they are i have not heard of it but then i had not heard about madoc until now he paused i am sorry about his son a hateful waste i mused and it seemed that a young mans form instantly appeared before me stretching out a hand as if beseeching aid but it was not madocs son this boy was youngerarthurs age no more the son the son i had not considered the son bedegran raised his eyebrows merlin does morcant have a son he does bedegran replied a young lad i think his name is cerdic yes cerdic why understanding broke over me i knew what madocs herdsmen meant by collecting the blood debt how stupid of me morcant was actively ridding himself of rivals and making the path clear for his son at least arthur was safely out of sight in the north i had been right to move him we talked of other matters then and soon it was time for supper over meat bedegran asked what will you do merlin embries whatever i can for now i mean to prevent war from devouring the south have i your pledge to keep the peace that you have merlin bedegran answered but added if you can but keep morcant and that snake dunaut on their own lands all will be well later when we were alone in our chamber i told pelleas this is as bad as i feared fortunately however we have not come too late this is for me alone pelleas who else can move with impunity from king to king i stand between britain and disaster oh i was drunk with it and i believed what i said just as i believed that peace could be mediated between these yapping hounds who called themselves noblemen i rested well that night and the next day rode out full of confidence and highminded intentions to save britain from becoming enmired in a war which would benefit only the saecsen in the end madocsullen frightened and griefstricken over the loss of his son received us with as good a grace as he could command in the circumstances he was in pain and i hoped i might speak some consolation well he demanded when the formalities of the greeting had been observed what does the exalted ambrosius of britain require of this old man since he was prepared to be blunt i answered him in kind do not allow morcant to draw you into war his chin came up sharply draw me into war i have no intention of going to war with him but if you think to talk me out of collecting the blood debt he owes me save your breath i mean to have satisfaction that is precisely what morcant is counting on he only waits for you to give him reason enough to strike openly what is that to you great ambrosius eh the ageing king growled what makes this affair your concern the safety of britain is the concern of all rightthinking men i mean to do what i can to preserve the peace then take yourself away to the saecsenbrood he shouted go talk to them of peace leave me alone there was no reasoning with him so i departed saying you cannot win against morcant and dunaut is likely with him in this do not think to make bedegran your ally i have spoken to him already and he will not support you i need no help from anyone do you hear pelleas and i rode next to dunaut to tax him with his duplicity like morcant he proffered a cordial if false welcome he sat in his big chair and smiled like a creamstealing cat but would answer none of my questions seriously finally i lost all patience deny that you and morcant are riding together i challenged deny that you are raising war against your neighbour kings shrewd dunaut pursed his lips and appeared distracted i do not understand you merlin he answered we have these past years upheld your absurd trial even now the sword of britain stands in the stone waiting to be claimed are you content with that no you attack us with accusations of war you flit here and there raising suspicion and anger he paused appearing hurt and distressed go back to your glass isle go back to celyddon or wherever you abide we do not need you here meddler since i could get no more from him i shook the dust from my feet and left the viper in his nest morcant and dunaut were intent on war that much was plain to me blind with ambition and stupid with greed they would conspire to britains fall god help us it is ever the same with the small kings as soon as the saecsens give them breathing space they begin hacking one another to pieces the hopelessness of it it grieves me pelleas i am sick at heart i confessed to him once we were away we rode on turning the matter over in our minds what of tewdrig pelleas wondered after a while surely he is more than a match for the likes of morcant perhaps he suggested you should let tewdrig settle it for once and all i considered this but only for a moment no the cost is too great we are not strong enough to war among ourselves and fend off the saecsen as well that much was obvious to me less evident was how to bring about peace and enforce it among those who did not desire it for themselves we must make them understand pelleas we spent the whole summer in a desperate attempt to make the petty lords of the south understand that warring among themselves weakened britain and doomed us all how long do you think the saecsens will wait to seize the land you leave unprotected how long do you think they will strive with the lords of the north when a weakened south beckons them my questions like my accusations went unheeded and unanswered i spoke words of truth and received lies in return i persuaded and cajoled threatened and charmed pleaded begged coaxed and prodded morganwg snubbed me coledac grew haughty and the others madoc ogrvan rhain owen vinddu and all the rest feigned innocence or indifference and plotted treachery in their hearts all my efforts came to nothing exhausted in body and spirit i turned at last to ynys avallach it had been too long since i sojourned in that blessed realm i ached to see avallach and charis again and hoped to find solace and sympathy in truth i desperately needed a balm to heal my troubled spirit the fisher kings palace remained unchanged as ever the green mound of the tor rose above the quiet lake its image reflected in the still waters apple trees graced the steep slopes rising to the high graceful walls peace and calm wreathed the isle like the mist upon the reedfringed lake and breathed an air of tranquillity soft as the light upon its shaded paths westering sun struck the soaring ramparts and towers causing the pale stone to blush like fireshot gold the quality of this radiance suffused the very air so that it seemed to tingle on the skin living light transmuting all baser elements to finer purer stuff avallach regal and dark his beard curled and oiled welcomed pelleas and me gladly and made much of us charis lady of the lake fairly glowed with love for me her green eyes shone and her long golden hair gleamed as she led me arm in arm among the apple trees she tended with such care we strolled the deepshaded groves or rowed the boat on the glassy lake in the evenings and went to our sleep with the song of nightingales on the night air still and all i ate and slept ill i fretted even fishing in the lake below the tor with the fisher king i could not rest nor could i unburden myself to my mother charis whose sympathy knew no restraint comforted me as best she could but i would not be comforted in truth it was not succour i needed but a vision and that i lacked i ask you o soul of wisdom tell me if you can what remedy for the lack of a vision day by day my spirit grew colder i felt as if i were freezing from the inside as if my heart were hardening within me i felt my very soul growing numb and heavy like a dead limb charis saw it how could i hide it from the one who knew me better than any other one night i sat at the table with my plate untouched before me and listened to charis explaining the work of the good brothers in the nearby abbey there were she told me plans for a place of healing it is only fitting she said taliesin saw the summer realm as a place where disease and infirmity were banished forever and many come here seeking aid for their afflictions the abbot has brought monks from gaul and elsewhere men who know much of healing and medicines i was only half listening to her of course she stopped put her hand on my arm merlin what is wrong it is nothing i sighed i tried to smile but found even that small effort too much i am sorry the abbey you were saying only that the healing work continues to flourish hereabout she replied quickly but we are talking about you now you are unhappy i think it was a mistake for you to come here a sojourn in the summer kingdom is never a mistake i replied i am simply overtired god knows i have reason enough what with riding on one errand after another all summer she leaned forward and took my hand in hers it may be that you are needed elsewhere she continued brushing aside my objection i am not needed at all i shouted and regretted it at once i am sorry mother forgive me she pressed my hand more tightly arthur needs you charis said simply go back to celyddon if all you say is true that is where the future lies unless the southern lords turn from their warring ways there is no future i concluded gloomily i paused remembering uthers fiery temper we need another pendragon go my hawk she said return when you have found him i slept poorly that night and woke before dawn restless ready the horses pelleas i told him curtly we will leave as soon as we have broken fast are we going to londinium no we have finished here the south must fend for itself we are going home seven it is a long way to caer edyn and a long time in which to contemplate the folly of selfimportant men despair embraced me to its bony breast misery settled in my soul the road took us east before turning north passing close to the old cantii lands of the coast this southeastern region is the saecsen shore so called by the romans for the linked system of beacons and outposts erected against the fierce seaborne invader a tribe of sea wolves under a war leader named aelle had taken over several of the abandoned fortresses on the southeast coast between the wash and the thamesis it was along this same stretch of southern coast that vortigern settled hengist and horsa and their tribes in the vain hope of ending the incessant raiding that was slowly bleeding britain dry and it was from this coast that the barbarians spilled out to flood the surrounding land until aurelius contained and then defeated and banished them now they were back taking once more the land hengist had overrun the saecsen shore its name would remain but for a different reason unlike their fathers these invaders meant to stay i thought of this and felt the sudden rush of the awen as it passed through me i stopped and turned my horse to look back at the lands sloping away behind us i saw the land fading as into a twilight haze and it came into my mind that despite my best efforts the night had already claimed the south now would begin a dark time this i saw most clearly despite ravenous sea wolves crowding his borders morcant would continue to press his idiotic war madoc bedegran and others would be forced to increase their warbands and there would be much senseless bloodshed i had cried for a vision and now i had one oh but it was bleak indeed great light have mercy on your servant turning away from that grim prospect i proceeded once more along the bramblechoked path as if along the futures tangled pathways there was little hope in what i saw little comfort to hold against the gathering gloom the darkness must have its season and the land must endure its travail that is the way of it putting the south to our backs at last pelleas and i pressed on our way through the long wide valleys which gave way eventually to deep green glens and coldrunning streams and wild windmumbled heights the world was growing colder i thought and it was more than idle speculation for we woke several times to snow in the night though samhain had not yet passed at length we arrived at ectors rock weary and disheartened the futility of our long sojourn clinging to us like our own sodden cloaks ector who had been riding the circuit of his lands with cai and arthur found us a little way from caer edyn arthur gave a loud whoop and raced to meet me myrddin pelleas you have returned he threw himself from his horse and ran to me i thought you would never come back i am glad to see you i missed you both before i could reply ectorius rode up shouting hail emrys hail pelleas if you had sent word we would have met you on the road welcome hail ector i give you good greeting i replied my gaze fell upon young arthur standing at the head of my horse he fairly danced in place hopping first on one foot then the other as he held the reins of our horses i have missed you lad i told him things are well in the south ector asked the south is lost i answered folly reigns all day long the petty kings give themselves to treachery and war what they do not destroy the saecsen stand ready to steal ectorius the smile still playing on his face glanced from one to the other of us as if struggling to believe indeed the rain had ended the sun shone brightly and hopeless words held no force against it he cocked an eye towards the dazzling sky well ector shrugged his shoulders lightly you have had a long and difficult journey to be sure perhaps you will find yourselves in a different mind after you have washed the road from your throats come there is ale aplenty for that purpose he turned and called to cai and arthur what do you still linger here young sluggards get you into your saddles and take the news home our friends have found their way back to us we must celebrate their return tell the kitchens to prepare the best we have at hand ectorius demands a feast tell them hie away arthur was in the saddle and off before lord ectorius had finished speaking and he was waiting at the gate when we arrived at the fortress grinning calling out our names myrddin pelleas here i am just seeing the enthusiasm burning bright in the boys face made me laugh and i had not laughed in a very long time in this way arthur just being arthur cheered the soul of britain a deed unsung yet no less worthy than any lauded by the bards yet the trouble i sensed was not in the imagining only the oppression the darkness was real enough and as cogent as i believed it to be did i not intimately know its source that day of homecoming it was only the boy arthur lifting our hearts with his boundless joy at our return i was wrong to leave him pelleas i confessed all our roaming accomplished nothing instead i have no doubt made matters worse for my illconceived interference i paused watching arthur run towards us myrddin pelleas you were gone so longalmost a year i missed you do you want to see me throw a spear he had spent the long summer hours perfecting his throwing arm and was proud of his growing proficiency i quickly dismounted i have missed you too arthur i said pulling him to me it is earth and sky to see you oh myrddin i am so happy you have returned he threw his arms around my waist and it is joy itself to see you arthur i whispered i am sorry to have been gone so long it could not be helped you missed lugnasadh arthur said pulling away still you are just in time for the autumn hunt i was afraid you would miss it lord ector says cai and i can ride this year i want to ride with you myrddin so you can watch me some of the northern lords are coming and lord ector says that we can peace arthur what of the gathering i asked had we missed that too arthurs fleeting frown gave the answer there was no gathering this year he replied because of some trouble somewhere custennin said the gathering could not take place oh i said nodding that is too bad but continued arthur brightening immediately ectorius says that next year we will have an even bigger gathering twice as big that makes it almost worth the wait he turned and darted off come on i will show you how well i throw a spear i have been practising all summer he was gone in an instant well i turned to pelleas it appears that we are to witness a throwing trial ectorius good ale must wait a little i think this is more important send the lord our regrets tell him a matter of some urgency has arisen and that we will join him as soon as may be pelleas hastened to do as i bade him and returned to find arthur and me on the field behind the boys house there we watched arthur display his considerable ability as time after time he struck the mark a feat made more remarkable by the fact that he threw the longer warriorsized shaft and not the shorter practice length used by the boys the dying day stretched our shadows long on the field and we stood together watching arthur tirelessly throwing and retrieving his spear his face ruddy with the flush of pride in his newmastered skill we cheered his successes and praised his prowess while the flamestruck sun sank lower behind us a last well done and i gathered the boy beneath my arm we started back to the hall where the feast was being prepared you have a champions touch do you think so i can do better i know i can i believe you i stopped and placed both hands on arthurs shoulders i will make a king of you arthur the boy shrugged off the promise so you say i just want to fight saecsens oh you will fight the saecsen son i assured him you will be a warriorthe greatest warrior the world has seen and much else besides arthur was happy with this prophecy but then he would have been just as pleased with a new spear or a sword of his own he hurried off to return his spear to the armoury and came back on the run a few moments later i waited for him and watched as he ran look at him pelleas he knows nothing of the powers arrayed against us and even if he knew i think it would matter as little to him as the dust beneath his feet it is a strange and subtle thing but i believe now that i had to fail to understand that all my pains at peacemaking amounted to nothing before i could recognize the reality standing bold as life before me in order to welcome redemption one must first embrace the utter hopelessness of failure for how can a man look for rescue unless he knows he is truly lost it was there before it was there all along but i could not see it i saw it now for what it was and oh for all it would become yes i remember the moment well truly that golden afternoon with arthur so happy beside me remains one of the most glorious of my memory for in that brief time i beheld the shape of our salvation great light to think i might have missed it sadly its glory proved shortlived bad news awaited us ector glanced up frowning as we entered his chamber he was sitting in his favourite placea chair made from the interlaced antlers of red deer and boar tusks here you are he snapped and thrust a parchment roll into our faces as we came to stand before him read it out he spoke as if whatever was written there was all my doing i took the roll and opened it scanning the cramped script slowly before passing the parchment to pelleas he read quickly and handed it back to ector that ectorius growled was waiting for me when i returned from lot saecsen warbands have been seen in the north there are women and children with them each word carried a weight of dread they are settling the picti have welcomed them lot believes they have formed an alliance and so it appears where is the man who brought the letter i asked gone answered ectorius he and the men with him rested but a day before returning we missed them by that much he held up his thumb and forefinger to show how narrowly saecsens settling in the north i muttered darkly so it begins again the turmoil we have feared is upon us ectorius hoping for some solace from me now sought to soften the blow himself well things might be worse a few settlers that is all surely they can do no he began halfheartedly but i cut him off it is not just a few settlers as you well know ectorius glowered his jaw bulged dangerously but he held his tongue think man as in the north so in the south the first of the mighty waves that henceforth shall wash over this island have broken on our shores and with them the first of the great battlelords who will lay claim to britain you are mad to speak so ectorius leaped from his chair you do not know this it is true ector the saecsen shore has fallen the barbarians even now establish strongholds in which to gather their warbands and from these they will spread like plague to ravage the land and then i concluded grimly when they have stolen enough to sustain them they will seek to put all britain beneath their heathen rule ectorius his worst fears confirmed scowled at the parchment for a moment and then threw it to the floor you do not leave a man much for courage he said gruffly yet it is no less than my own heart has been telling me though i had hoped aurelius and uther had taken the fight out of them they did but only a fool would think it could last forever as it is we have had some measure of peace these last years still if we are very fortunate they may content themselves with establishing their settlements for a time before the raiding commences let them begin when they will lord ectorius declared by the god who made me emrys i mean to hold my own i will not be driven from my land bravely said i replied but strength alone will not prevail this time how then what else can we do tray good ector i intoned softly pray god is for us pray for the strength of right and the valour of justice for i tell you plainly without these we will not hold britain even a day longer than is granted ectorius grimfaced shook his head slowly as the truth of these words found their mark within him this is a bitter draught emrys i do say it and it cheers me not at all let this be your hope then my friend there is one under your care even now who carries within him all that will be required in the day of travail one whose life was kindled in this worldsrealm for no other purpose ectorius stared he is but a boy this very day i have seen the future ector i assured him and it shone in the glad welcome on that boys face eight the next days were given to preparation for the autumn hunt horses were reshod spears sharpened dogs groomed everyone in the stronghold was busy from early morning to far into the night caer edyn resounded with shouts songs and laughter it was a celebration of sorts though a most serious celebration with a starkly earnest purpose we hunted for the smokehouse and the winter table we needed the meat to see us through the cold days and nights ahead every detail was seen to with most exacting care for a spoiled hunt made a lean winter above the wall a lean winter is a killing winter the morning of the hunt arthur rose before daylight and made certain that pelleas and i were awake too we washed and dressed and hurried to the hall where some of ectorius guests and men were already gathered waiting for the food to be served this morning we would break fast on hot pork stew black barley bread and beer for we would be in the saddle all day arthur scarcely touched a bite he kept leaping up from his place beside me on the bench wanting to dash off to see to his horse or his tack or his spears eat lad pelleas told him once and again there will be nothing more for you until supper i cannot eat pelleas arthur complained i must see to my horse your horse can wait now eat what is before you look there is cai i must speak to him he was up and away before either of us could stop him let him go pelleas i advised you are trying to hold back the tide with a broom after eating we assembled in the foreyard where the horses were ready and waiting the day had dawned grey and chill the mist thick and damp a raw foretaste of the long bleak winter ahead the hound handlers six men each with four dogs straining to the leash strove to calm their animals and keep them from getting tangled with the others the yard stank of wet dog and horse everything boiled in a fine convivial confusion excitement heightened by keen anticipation the horses stamped and snorted impatiently as the hunters lashed their spears into place the younger boys darted here and there teasing the dogs and setting them barking and the women who had come to see husbands and sweethearts away challenged their menfolk with goodnatured taunts to bring home the biggest boar or stag or failing that a hare for the pot pelleas and i were to ride with ectorius and we found him near the gate conferring with his master huntsman a bald crag of a man called ruddlyn who it was said could scent a stag before the stag could scent himno mean feat surely for even i could smell him quite plainly the huntsman wore a coarse leather tunic through which two great bare hairy arms were thrust his legs were stout as stumps in tall haircovered boots ruddlyn and ectorius were talking about the weather na na ruddlyn was saying this liath will clear before long this be just a piddling pay it no mind the valley runs will be clearing by the time we reach them the mist will not last i tell ye then sound the horn man ectorius told him making up his mind at once it is a sin to keep the hounds back any longer aye agreed ruddlyn who lumbered off unslinging the horn from around his neck our horses were before us so up we mounted ectorius grinning his face wet from the misting rain saluted the eager hunters my friends we are assured of a fine day we have had a good summer so the runs are full of game the day is before you i give you a good hunt just then the master huntsman sounded his horn a long low braying note that set the hounds bawling in reply the gate swung open and we all surged out onto the track lord ectorius hunting runs lay hard by caer edyn to the northwest for there the forest crowded close beginning in the glen of the carun river the runs followed the stream into the forest for a goodly way before dividing on the right hand the trails continued a slow easy ascent into the hills and bluffs above the fiorthe and muir guidan to the east the lefthand trails bent westward rising sharply to meet a steep and treacherous rock ridge that marked the beginning of the harsh and lonely region known as manau gododdin the deepfolded land was dense with oak and ash the undergrowth thorny briar the uplands and hilltops were gorse and heather clinging to bare stone a rough land but the hunting was unmatched we rode to the glen allowing the more eager parties to speed on ahead at the entrance to the run the first pack was loosed and the baying hounds dashed away slavering the scent already burning in their nostrils the first group of hunters raced after them let them fly let them fly shouted ectorius myrddin pelleas stay close to ruddlyn and he will find us a rare prize you have my word on it we continued on the glen ringing with the sound of hounds and hunters cai and arthur passed us whooping like the bhean sidhe as they plunged headlong through the carun and gallopped into the forest i used to ride like that remarked ectorius shaking his head and laughing but stare at an empty board once or twice and you soon learn to rein in your high spirits oh he chuckled again but it was great fun ruddlyn arrived just then dismounted and taking the leashes of the five dogs he had with him big black squaremuzzled brutes all he wrapped all five leather straps around his hand saying i have seen a fairsized stag further on it would be worth saving the hounds for him with that he was off running with the dogs his stout legs carrying him with surprising speed through the brushchoked trails curiously the dogs did not yelp but trotted stiffly heads down tails straight ectorius saw my wondering glance and explained he has them trained to silence they never give voice until the animal is sighted we get much closer that way he lashed his horse and started after the huntsman and his hounds pelleas followed and i came after leaning close to our mounts necks and shoulders to avoid lowhanging branches the trail was dark and damp mist seeped along the still air gradually the sound of the other hunting parties receded muffled and muted by the dense forest growth ruddlyn moving with the quickness of his dogs soon disappeared into the murk of the dim tunnellike trail ahead we rode after him slashing through the pungent bracken that clung to us as if to hold us back in no time our horses were streaming water from the withers down and our clothing was soaked through the trail veered always to the left and i soon understood that we were following one of the western runs into the craggy hills of manau gododdin on we chased the sound of our passing muted by the heavy damp air we caught ruddlyn in a clearing where he had halted to wait for us hardly winded he stood with his dogs around him face to the low leaden clouds above it will clear he announced what have you found asked ectorius is it the stag aye will we see it soon right soon lord with that he turned and strode away once more the ground i noticed began to rise and in a little while the forest began to thin somewhat we were beginning the climb to higher ground the trail became more uneven the pace was not fast but i kept my eyes on the trail alert to any obstacle there in the chase even small dangers a jagged stone a fallen branch a hole in the ground can mean disaster if unheeded i had been lulled by the running rhythm of ruddlyns groundeating pace when i was jolted by the sudden sharp sounding of the hounds i jerked my head up and just ahead saw ruddlyn pointing into the brush the dogs straining at the leather snouts raised to heaven i looked where he pointed and saw the reddish blur of a disappearing deer an instant later the dogs were loosed and flying to the chase ruddlyn with them hie cried ectorius god bless us we have a fight on our hands did you see him a very lord of his kind shouted pelleas snapping the reins his horse leaped after the dogs i followed exulting in the chase the wet wind on my face the spirited baying of the hounds in my ears the forest thinned trees flashed by the horse and i moved as one leaping felled logs and rocks surging through the brake once and again i glimpsed one or another ahead now pelleas now ectorius as the forest sped by in a grey mottled haze the trail rose more steeply now there were stones and turfcovered hillocks all around we fairly flew over these rising all the while all at once we broke cover the forest fell away behind us ahead rose the steep manyshadowed slopes of the rock ridge in the selfsame moment the clouds shifted and standing in the centre of a single shaft of shimmering light head high regarding us casually a magnificent stag enormous perhaps the largest i have ever seen a dozen or more points on his antlers his mane thick and dark across heavy shoulders his sides solid and his hindquarters well muscled a true forest lord ectorius gave a shout pelleas hailed the creature with an exclamation of delight the hounds seeing their quarry near howled with renewed vigour ruddlyn raised the horn to his lips and sounded a long rising note the stag swung his head around lifted his legs and leaped away floating up the slope as lightly as the shadow of a cloud the hounds ears flat to their heads dashed after the wonderful beast their master right behind we gallopped straight up the slope upon gaining the crest i discovered it to be but a shoulder of a higher hill the upper portions of which were still mistwrapped and obscure the stag turned and began running easily along this wide grassy shoulder which itself rose as it climbed to meet the ridge to the west as i wheeled my mount to follow the others i saw a movement at the forests edge below i glanced back to the lowlands we had just quitted two figures on horseback and a dog had cleared the trees and were driving up the slope for all they were worth i had no need to look a second time i knew them for arthur and cai a single hound between them i paused to allow them to join us he is ours cried arthur when he caught me up we saw him first cai informed me we have been on the scent since fording the river both boys glared at me as if i had conspired to steal their manhood the dog circled us yapping impatient the scent of the stag rich and heavy in his nostrils peace brothers i told them no doubt you crossed his scent some way back but it appears we have sighted him before you unfair hollered cai he is ours as to that i told him the prize belongs to the man who makes the kill and that prize is making good his escape while we stand here flapping our tongues at one another truly cried arthur whirling in the saddle to view the track ahead his eyes followed the shoulder of the slope then travelled up the screestrewn rise on the right this way he shouted lashing his horse to speed once more cai threw a menacing glance at me and bounded after arthur wrong way i called after them but they were already beyond hearing i watched them for a moment and then set about catching pelleas and ectorius i found them a short while later in a sheltered upland cove filled with gorse and briar i could not see ruddlyn although i could hear the dogs baying close by the beast has vanished declared ectorius as i reined in took my eyes from him for a blink and he is gone the hounds will raise the scent again pelleas offered he cannot have gone far na we cannot have lost him ectorius said we will have the kill not if arthur and cai have their way i replied how so ectorius wondered in surprise i met them on the trail back there they have been tracking the stag as well they claim they saw him first ectorius laughed and shook his head god love them the whole forest to hunt and they strike upon our beast well they will have to kill it if they hope to claim it that is what i told them i replied where have they gone asked pelleas looking behind me arthur led them up the slope to higher ground it is all rocks and brambles ectorius pointed out there is no cover at all up there the rascals should know better ruddlyn returned to us on the run his broad face sweaty he had leashed the dogs once more and they pulled at the closeheld traces stag was not in there he puffed indicating the gorsefilled hollow behind though he has been there is scent everywhere we could get no clear mark he must have jumped off the track at the bend said ectorius oh aye could be that agreed the huntsman a canny creature he is we must backtrack as we can go no farther from here we rode back along the trail keeping the dogs on a short leash until they could raise a fresh scent and at the place ectorius suggested we crossed the stags path once more the dogs began howling and strained to the trail it was all ruddlyn could do to keep them from scrambling up the sheer sides of the hill is this the way arthur and cai went asked ectorius yes i told him but i met them back there a little where it is not so steep that makes three canny creatures observed pelleas it seems we will have to follow the lads replied ectorius god knows we cannot climb this we will but break our bones in trying show us the place ruddlyn called already retreating down the shoulder trail i wheeled my horse and rode to the spot where i had last seen arthur and cai they started the climb here i called and turning my mount off the trail began the ascent it was hard riding to gain the top and once up the way did not become easier it was as ectorius had said all rock and briar thickets the sheer stone cliffs of the ridge loomed above and loose scree lay all around making riding difficult i dismounted and waited for the others we will have to go on foot from here ectorius observed swinging down from the saddle we dare not risk the horses which way did they go wondered pelleas he scanned the high crags above us all black and shining slick with the mist that seeped and spread around them there was no sign of the boys just then one of the dogs gave voice and started jerking on its lead haunches straining head low over the track this way shouted ruddlyn with a sharp whistle he gathered the hounds before him and they trotted away once more we each snatched two spears from behind our saddles and hurried away the ground was indeed rough with rock the rubble made slippery by the mist and rain i tucked the spears under my arm and jogged along as quickly as possible over the treacherous terrain the hounds led us into a narrow defile leading between two humps of stone like misshapen pillars this passage opened onto a narrow gorge that rose at its end to meet the ridge above i glanced towards the far end of the gorge and saw galloping up the screecovered slope cai and arthurthe stag in full flight just ahead even as i watched the stag cleared the crest and disappeared from view over the top ectorius and ruddlyn saw them in the same instant ectorius shouted for the boys to wait for us but they were too far away and could not hear him the young fools will kill themselves shouted ectorius and the horses too there was nothing to be done but press on as quickly as possible and that we did the slope at the end of the gorge was much steeper than it appeared from a distance climbing it on foot was difficult enough i do not know how arthur and cai managed it on horseback the ridge formed a natural causeway between the steep rock slopes falling away on either hand running east to west in the lowlands behind us the forest appeared a dark rumpled pelt with caer edyn rising a little above it some distance away the mist was heavier here the clouds more dense water formed on my brow and ran down the sides of my neck despite the chill air of the heights i was sweating and my clothes were wet only my feet were dry the hounds led us east along the ridgeway and we followed our pace slower now as fatigue began to gnaw at us even ruddlyns groundeating strides became slower though he pushed on relentlessly the ridgeway snaked along as uneven and perilous a killing field as i have seen we ran the track lifted slightly beneath our feet and ahead loomed a bare granite mound lifting like a shattered head blocking the ridgeway to the right rose a cracked and fissured curtain of stone to the left a sheer plunge to a broken ledge below directly ahead were arthur and cai and the stag this is what i saw arthur sits tense in the saddle head down shoulders square spine rigid the spear is gripped in his right hand well i know the strength of that grip cai is beside him a few paces away spear levelled both are staring at the stag breathing hard the stag what a champion he is even larger than i first thought fully as large as a horse cornered he has turned at last to meet his pursuers and stands facing them head erect his sleek sides heaving bloodflecked foam streams from his muzzle the rack of his antlers spreads like the branches of a weathered oak eighteen points if one oh he is a prize cais black hound is circling barking savagely the dog seizes an opening and attacks the stag wheels and lowers its head the dog yelps and tries to jump away but is caught and speared by the antlers and is tossed lightly aside to die on the rocks at this we begin running forward we approach but ruddlyn halts us stop he calls let the hounds do their work he is thinking that it is too dangerous if we rush in the stag may charge one or the other of the boys and they could be killed instead he will loose the hounds and they will surround the stag harry it and wear down its strength then when they have wearied the beast and taken some of the fight out of him we will close in with our spears to make the kill it is brutal yes but this is how it is done with a cornered beast any other way is deadly dangerous loosed the dogs raise a rattling yelp as they fly but the stag is an old warrior the wily creature does not wait to be set upon by hounds he lowers his head and charges i see the head tilt down the feet planted shoulders bunching flanks tightening hindquarters lowering as the back legs begin churning driving the animal forward the lethal rack slices the air as it sweeps towards arthur cai shouts and arthur arthur cradles the spear he holds it like a fragile reed now his eyes are hard and level he is as unflinching as the death hurtling towards him but his mount is not the animal shies wheeling at the last instant arthur jerks the reins hard to bring the animal round but it is too late the stag throws his head low the points of the antlers rake the ground then up up like a saecsen blade thrust deep into the horses belly the wounded animal screams in agony and terror the stag is shaking his head his antlers are caught the horse is scrambling to keep its legs arthurs knee is pinned against the side of his mount he cannot leap free of the saddle blood is everywhere the dogs race to the kill but they are too far away they will not come in time the horse falls it is rolling over its eyes wide and nostrils flared its legs churning hoofs lashing wildly at the air oh arthur arthur is stuck there help him the stag pulls free he rears back forehoofs raking in the air the head angles down to plunge those deadly tines into the enemy struggling on the ground arthurs spear is wedged beneath the horses flank i am running to him i gasp for breath i cry out because i cannot run fast enough to save him the stag towers over arthur seems to hang there poised the stag lunges the sky cracks wide open and sunlight suddenly spills onto the causeway in a brilliant flood the light is dazzling i blink i look again to see arthurs body pierced by the stags antlers but no his arm flashes up he has a knife the sunlight strikes the blade and it flares like a firebrand in his hand the stag veers plunging its rack into the hindquarters of the helpless horse arthur swings his arm aiming for the stags throat he cannot reach it the blow goes wide and strikes the beasts shoulder as it worries the wound deeper into the feebly thrashing horse the stag pulls back to strike the killing blow cai heaves his spear but it falls short and glances off the deers rump arthur twists on the ground and kicks free of his helpless mount we are screaming now to distract the stag we are shouting to burst our lungs the first of the dogs reaches the stag the stag turns on the hounds scattering them arthur struggles to his knees cais spear in his hand the stag turns on arthur i see them stag and boy regarding one another across the distance of a few paces a short spear throw separates them no more the dogs nip at the stags flanks he turns and catches one of the hounds and flings it aside then gathers himself for the last attack arthur braces himself his spear does not waver desperate ectorius launches a spear it falls heartbreakingly short iron tip striking sparks as it skids away across the rocks he readies another we are almost within range the dogs surround the stag but the forest lord has fixed his eye on arthur run pelleas cries arthur run the stag gathers his legs beneath him and charges the powerful hind legs churning driving towards arthur run we shout but it is too late the stag is already hurtling straight at arthur once again the boy cannot turn to run or he will be impaled upon the antlers arthur stands his ground crouching fearless spear ready the stag closes swiftly he is so fast now i throw my spear with all my strength and watch it slide uselessly under the legs of the onrushing deer ectorius lofts his one remaining spear in the same moment the stag simply lifts his hoofs and sails lightly over the crouching arthur and runs to the edge of the cliff arthur is already racing after the beast the forest lord pauses on the edge of the precipice gathers its legs and leaps what a wonder it leaps over the cliff and we all dart to the place thinking to see the proud animal battered as it plunges to its death on the rocks below arthur turns wide eyes towards us as we run to him he thrusts out a finger and i look where he is pointing i see the stag sliding leaping running flying down the cliff face to the ledge below the beast tumbles sprawling onto the ledge rolls to his feet and then head held high trots away to safety without so much as a backward glance he is free it comes to us slowly what has happened arthur are you hurt i demand taking the boy by the shoulders and gazing at him intently arthur shakes his head he is disappointed rather than frightened i could have taken him he says i was ready son he would have killed you ectorius says in a small awed voice it is a true miracle that you are alive he shakes his head in amazement at arthurs stillunshaken courage cai frowns he is angry that the stag has escaped the dogs ruined it we had him ruddlyn has gathered the dogs and is hurrying to us he had ye young buck the huntsman snorts showing his contempt for cais assessment never think otherwise that king o the glen was your master from the start it is a wonder the both of you still tread the land of the living at this arthur bows his head is he crying no when he raises his eyes once more they are clear and dry i am sorry lord ectorius i have lost the horse you gave me fret not the loss of the horse lad it is only a horse god love you ectorius shakes his head again i will do better next time vows arthur the steel in his voice could shear hard leather you will i promise him but not this day the hunt is over for you arthur opens his mouth to protest but i will not hear it return to the caer and contemplate the gift you have been given this day go now you and cai together they do not like it but they do as they are told they mount cais horse and ride off while ruddlyn buries the two dead dogs we unsaddle arthurs dead mount and lugging the extra tack return to our horses no one says a word even the dogs are quiet none of us not even ruddlyn is certain what to make of what we have witnessed it seems best not to speak so we hold our tongues but there is wonder in our souls there is no doubt that we have seen a marvel more perhaps a sign its fulfilling would follow in due season i did not know what it meant at the time but i know now it was gods saining witness to arthurs sovereignty and a portent of the trial to come for one day i would see that same young man make the same desperate stand against a great and terrible adversary wielding swift and certain death and on that day arthur would become immortal book two the black boar one the days draw down they dwindle and run away see how swiftly they scatter but not a single day passes that i do not recall with pleasure the kingmaking of arthur ap aurelius and because he was aurelius son despite whatever ignorant slanderers may say i strove to give him the same crowntaking as his father you will excuse me if i say nothing of that long season of strife we endured at the hands of certain southern lords and lordlings or the fierce battles with the saecsen that followed more than enough has been written about those warwasted years even small children know the tales by heart i will say only that after seven years of incessant fighting arthur broke the back of the barbarian host at baedun hill a fearsome battle lasting three days and costing lives in the very thousands this and arthur not yet king i was there yes i saw it all and still i saw nothing i was blind from my encounter with morgian some little time before baedun you will recall i had left the war host and travelled south determined to break the power of the queen of air and darkness for once and all dread morgian was at that time beginning to take an interest in arthurs deeds and i could not stand by and watch her spinning her evil schemes around the future high king of britain i went alone telling no one pelleas following me was lost and never returned may the gifting god grant him mercy i know morgian killed him she all but killed me as well bedwyr and gwalcmai found me in llyonesse and brought me back blind but unbeaten having cleared the way for arthurs sovereignty and that day was not far off after the bloodbath of baedun as terrible in necessity as in execution we retreated to nearby mailros abbey to rest and give thanks for the victory we had won though the abbey was yet little more than a ruin the good brothers had returned and were even then beginning repairs as it was nearest baedun indeed within sight of that blooddrenched doublehumped hill arthur chose it as the place to offer his prayers of thanksgiving we stayed two days and then having bound our wounds continued up the vale of twide to caer edyn where lord ectorius his great heart bursting with pride hosted a feast such as few men ever enjoy for three days and three nights we sat at table eating and drinking healing our battlebruised hearts and souls in the company of true men good ector last of his noble breed lavished his best on us giving all without stint of good bread and roast meat there was no end freely flowed the ale and rich honey mead no sooner was one bowl emptied than another appeared filled from the huge ale tub ector had established in his hall white foam and sparkling amber filling the cups and bowls of the lords of britain sweet as the kiss of a maiden sweet as peace between noble men i do not understand it myrddin ector whispered pulling me aside the evening of the third day the ale vats are not empty no well it is not for lack of exertion i assure you i replied but that is what i am saying he insisted you are saying nothing my friend i chided gently speak plainly ector the ale should have run out by now i had not so much in store you must have mistaken yourself and a happy mistake too but the ale does not diminish he insisted as many times as i send to it the vat remains full no doubt in all this merrymaking the servants have become confused or maybe we have not drunk as much as you think do i not know my own brewhouse man ectorius countered look at them wise emrys and tell me again i am mistaken it is for you to look ector i replied touching the bandage on my eyes tell me what you see i did not mean he blustered oh you know what i mean be easy ector i soothed i believe you i know i will tell dyfrig he will know what to do yes i agreed send for the good bishop he will be my eyes ectorius departed at once meanwhile the feasting continued unabated the circling of the cups did not cease soon the bottom of the tub began showing through the foam once more and a cry went up for the serving lads to fill it again this time i went with them lead me to the alehouse i ordered the oldest boy placing my hand on his shoulder he led me out from the hall and across the foreyard to one of the stout outbuildings of ectors holding inside were three great oaken barrels two for ale and one for mead bring the brewmaster i told my guide as the other boys set about replenishing their buckets i will speak to him here making my way to the nearest container i put my hands on it and felt the wooden staves i rapped the side with my knuckles and heard the frothy slosh as the boys plunged their buckets as big around as a wagon wheel and nearly manheight it would hold a fair amount two such together as ector had might supply a celebration such as ours for a day and a night perhaps two even but never three days and three nights how much is in the vat i asked the nearest boy why it is nearly full emrys the boy replied and the other empty or full it is full lord the boy replied when last did you fill from it the lad i imagined him ten or twelve summers judging from his voice hesitated lord the question is simple enough boy i said when did you last fill from the second vat but we have not touched it lord he answered this is the only one we are allowed to breach that is true confirmed an adult voice from the doorway behind me wise emrys the man said i am dervag brewmaster to lord ector is there something wrong with the ale i remember you dervag your ale is excellent never fear i assured him even so it is suspiciously plentiful this has pricked my interest my lord ector keeps three casks dervag explained coming to stand with me these three two ale and one mead the boys fill from the standing vat and only when the last drop is drained from the first will i allow anyone to open the next then perhaps you could look for me and see that all is as it should be the amiable man stepped up on the stone beside the vat it is above twothirds full yet he announced growing puzzled he hurried to the second barrel i heard a wooden cover lifted and quickly dropped back into place this vat has not been touched the brewmasters tone had become wary and slightly accusatory what is happening here an apt question dervag i replied lightly how is it that men feast three days and nights and the ale vat shows less sign of ebbing than yonder lake answer me if you can but lord emrys i cannot answer since the warbands return i have been day and night in the brewing house preparing to refresh these vats when they are empty i bethought myself that when the lad came to fetch me it was to open the second vat but this he struggled to make sense of it this is most unchancy nonsense declared the cleric arriving with ector just then dyfrig bishop of mailros though a bighearted cheerful man maintained a precise and particular mind worthy of any scholar he went to the cask peered in and declared that to his eye the vat appeared full yet this single observation is no true test he stated but we have drunk from this selfsame ale vat for three days ector insisted and it is no less full than when we first began be that as it may dyfrig allowed i was not here to see it turning to the boys standing by with their buckets and cannikins he commanded fill the lot lads dervag himself filled two buckets and when the last one was full the bishop again mounted the stone step you will all mark his voice echoed from inside the great cask that i am reaching inside the vat and pressing my thumbnail into the wax i have scratched a line at the level of the remaining ale he turned to us and stepped down now then my friends we will watch and i will look inside again when the cannikins have been refreshed for the third time go lads ector ordered do your work we waited in the brewhouse dervag ector dyfrig and i passing the time cordially after a time the serving boys returned the buckets were replenished and we waited again after filling the buckets the second time ector ordered torches to be lit because it was growing too dim for them to see properly we talked of the feast and of the splendid victory at baedun in a little while the lads returned for the third time and as before dervag refreshed their cannikins from the vat will you look now dyfrig ector said dyfrig mounted to the stone give me a torch a moments silence and then a sharp intake of breath upon my vow do you see your mark dervag asked i do not see it the bishop replied quickly by reason of the fact that the level of the liquid is now higher than when i made the mark let me see i heard a scuffling sound as the brewmaster joined the bishop on the step almost toppling him from the stone in his excitement it is as he has said confirmed dervag bring the jars the boys rushed forward and the jars were filled yet once more then the two of them looked again i see the mark the brewer shouted there it is bishop dyfrig descended the step and stood once more before us it is a wonder he said i am satisfied what does it mean said ector demanding an explanation rejoice ectorius the bishop told him for even as our lord jesu at the marriage feast turned water into wine and transformed five loaves and two fishes into a feast for five thousand so has the blessed christ honoured your feast with a rare and precious gift rejoice come we must share the glad news share it he did word of this wonder carried everywhere in time the story of ectors excellent ale vat took its place beside the tale of brans platter of plenty and gwyddnos enchanted hamper but on that night when the good bishop finished telling the assembled warriors what he himself had witnessed the gathering sat silent pondering then up jumped bors he stepped from bench to table and stood in the midst of the gathering with his arms outspread brothers he shouted his voice loud in the hall is there now any doubt what is required of us tell us someone cried it might have been gwalchavad here is arthur he thrust his hand to the bemused arthur victorious battle chief conquering war leader acclaimed of men and favoured of the great god it is time we made our duke of britain a king the warriors lauded the suggestion well spoken some shouted so be it bors fists on hips challenged them then why do you yet sit here when there is kingmaking to be done up stand on your feet brothers i tell you not another night shall pass before i see the kingly tore on arthurs throat at these words those closest to arthur leapt to their feet and pulled him from his chair they hoisted him to their shoulders and carried him from the hall i think they mean to do it observed dyfrig is there anything to prevent them ector laughed if all the battle host of saecsland could not prevail against them he said i do not think anything in this worldsrealm can prevent them now it comes to this dyfrig i told him will you make arthur king or will i by your leave merlinus the bishop said i will do the deed and gladly come then ector said we stand here flapping the tongue and we will be left behind out from the hall and through the yard down from edyns rock and through the glen the war host of britain bore arthur the warriors carried him to mons agned also called cathir righ for the number of sovereign lords who had taken their kingship on its throneshaped summit and there in the cool blue dusk of a long summer day a scattering of stars alight in a high bright northern sky arthur was made king placing arthur in the great rock chair the warriors gathered at the base of the seat bors approached and drawing the sword from the scabbard at his side placed the blade at arthurs feet as i lay my sword i lay my life and hold myself under your authority so saying he stretched himself face down on the ground whereupon arthur placed his foot upon bors neck then arthur bade bors rise and cador also came and stretched himself upon the ground at arthurs feet owain came next and then maelgwn and idris and ector all of them hugged the earth and stretched the neck before arthur in full sight of the war host and their own kinsmen if you have never seen this i tell you it is a powerful thing to witness proud lords humbling themselves before a heavenblessed king the cymbrogi companions of the heart passed before arthur then and laying aside their spears they knelt and stretched forth their hands to touch his feet cai bedwyr rhys bors gwalchavad llenlleawg and all the rest each swore faith to arthur and pledged him life for life and owned him king when all had been observed as it should be i came before the bear of britain arise arthur i declared raising my rowan rod over him by the witness of those who have pledged fealty to you lords and kinsmen i do proclaim you king of all britain the warriors extolled this with jubilant shouts and wild cries of acclamation oh it was good to hear their strong voices ringing out as if to fill the island of the mighty with a glad and happy sound when the cheering had abated somewhat i said all praise and worship to the high king of heaven who has raised up a king to be pendragon over us all saints and angels bear witness this day is arthur ap aurelius made king of all britons turning to the gathered warriors i raised the rowan and in the bards voice of command i called kneel before him cymbrogi fellow countrymen stretch forth your hands and swear binding oaths of fealty to your lord and king on earth even as you swear life and honour to the lord of all creation they knelt as one and as one plighted troth with arthur when this was done i turned again to arthur you have heard your sword brothers pledge life to life with you arthur is it your will to receive these oaths i do receive the oaths plighted me he answered upon receiving this assurance i summoned the waiting dyfrig come here friend consecrate this lord to his sacred duty and make him king indeed the bishop of mailros stepped to the rock seat in his hands he held a tore of gold which he raised and in a loud voice charged arthur declare this day before your people the god you will serve up spoke arthur i will serve the christ who is called jesu i will serve the god who is called the father i will serve the nameless one who is called the holy spirit i will serve the holy trinity to this dyfrig demanded and will you observe justice perform righteousness and love mercy with blessed jesu as my witness i will observe justice i will perform righteousness i will love mercy and will you lead this realm in the true faith of christ so long as you shall live to the end of my strength and the last breath of my mouth i will lead this worldsrealm in the true faith of christ then bishop dyfrig declared by the power of the three in one i raise you arthur ap aurelius hail arthur protector of britain hail arthur shouted the warrior host in reply their voices resounding in the twilight hail protector and pendragon of britain i thought that the bishop would place the tore of kingship on arthurs throat then but he gave it to me instead i felt the cool solid heaviness of the golden ornament between my hands as i stepped once more to the stony seat arthurs touch light but steady directed me to the mark i spread the ends of the tore and slipped it around his neck feeling the warm pulse of blood flutter beneath my touch then pressing the soft yellow metal carefully i closed the circle once more and stepped away leaving arthur to glory in the loud acclaim of lords and men the long dusk had given way to a clear bright twilight and the glad cries shook the very hills as arthur took up his longdenied sovereignty in the region of the summer stars two if they had been jubilant before the warrior host became ecstatic they embraced their new king with such zeal and enthusiasm i began to think he would not survive their adulation they seized him and up up they raised him high upon their shoulders down from the rock they carried him and through the glen singing all the way upon returning to caer edyn arthur bestowed gifts on his lords and men gold and silver rings and brooches he gave knives and swords cups bowls armbands and precious stones i would honour my crowntaking with gifts he explained to dyfrig but i think you would not esteem gold rings or silver cups i am thinking a strong roof over those ruins of yours would please you more god bless you arthur replied the bishop gold rings are little use to a monk especially when wind blows and rain falls therefore i return to you all that the picti and saecsen have taken and i entreat you to take from the battle spoils as much as you require to rebuild your abbey and not only mailros but abercurnig church as well for i am persuaded that winds blow and rains fall at abercurnig ever as much as anywhere else in christs name i do accept your gift arthur replied dyfrig well pleased then i would ask a gift of you in return the newmade king continued ask lord dyfrig said expansively and if it is in my power to grant be assured i will give it i would ask you to take as much more from the spoils to cause a chapel to be built at baedun a chapel wondered the bishop but we have an entire abbey nearby what do you want with a chapel i would have the monks of mailros employed there to sing the psalms and offer prayers for our brothers who now sleep on baeduns slopes i would have good prayers made for britain perpetually this request delighted the bishop it shall be done lord replied dyfrig let there be psalms and prayers day and night perpetually until the lord christ returns to claim his own nor was arthur content to allow his honour to rest there early the next morning he rode out to the settlements surrounding caer edyn to offer gifts to the widows wives of men killed defending their homes or fallen to the sea wolves in battle he gave gold and silver from his battle chest and also sheep and cattle so they should not suffer want in addition to their grief only then did arthur return to caer edyn to celebrate his kingmaking i let him enjoy himself for a time and when i judged the moment most propitious i gathered my cloak around me and took up my rowan staff and tapped my way to the centre of the hall in the manner of a druid bard i approached the place where he sat at table with cai and bedwyr bors and cador and the cymbrogi pendragon of britain i called aloud some of those looking on thought i meant to offer a song the emrys is going to sing they said to one another and hushed their talk to hear me quickly the hall fell silent it was not a song i intended however but a challenge may your glory outlast your name which will last forever it is right to enjoy the fruit of your labour god knows but you would find me a lax and stupid counsellor if i did not warn you that away in the south part of this island there are men who have not yet heard of baedun and know nothing of your kingmaking arthur received this with puzzled amusement peace myrddin he laughed i have only just received my tore word will reach them soon enough i was prepared for this reply blind i may be but i was not always so and i am persuaded that men believe their eyes more readily than their ears this observation met with general approval true true hear him bear bedwyr said cai and cador and others slapped the board with their hands so it is said agreed arthur growing slightly suspicious what is your meaning i held out my hand to those gathered in the hall fortunate are the men of the north i told him for they have ridden beside you in battle and they know your glory full well but it is in my mind that the men of the south will not be won with such news as conies to them in time there is little i can do about that arthur observed a man may be made king but once that is where you are wrong o king i told him flatly you are pendragon of britain nowit is for you to order what will be but i have already taken the crown here he said what need have i of another kingmaking i answered what need have you of two eyes if one sees clearly enough what need have you of two hands if one grips the sword tightly enough what need have you of two ears enough cried arthur i understand but it is not enough i replied that is what i am telling you then also tell me what must be done to quiet you and you may be certain that i will do it at once well said bear cheered cai and many laughed with him hear your wise bard bedwyr called myrddin speaks the simple truth very well arthur said what would you have me do send the dragon flight to summon the lords of the south to attend you in londinium where they shall witness your crowntaking only then will they believe and follow you gladly arthur liked this as ever your words are wise myrddin he exclaimed for i will be king of all or king of none let us go to caer londinium and take the crown north and south have been divided far too long in me they shall be united truly the south had ever given arthur trouble those proud princelings could not imagine anything of import happening beyond the cramped borders of their narrow horizons the nobles of the western realms men like meurig and tewdrig knew differently of course they understood the value of the north as well as its vital strategic significance but from the times of the romans most southern lords held the north in lowest esteem and deemed the people there beneath their regard that is why if arthur was to be high king in more than title only he must make good his claim in the south as laudable and necessary as his kingmaking at caer edyn more so was his crowntaking at londinium this was where his father took the crown this was the kingmaking i wanted for him the same ceremony aurelius enjoyed for men had become confused many did not even remember aurelius anymore alas his reign was too short most remembered uther and imagined arthur was uthers bastard boy therefore i was keen to proclaim arthurs true lineage and demonstrate his true nobility i mean uther no disrespect god love him he was all the king we needed at the time and better than we deserved still he was but half the man his brother was for this reason i was eager to establish arthur firmly in his fathers light especially where the lords of the south were concerned arthur had amply demonstrated his uncles courage and cunning if he could achieve his fathers skill at kingcraft britain might yet elude the darkness even now engulfing the world that is what i thought and that is what i believed if you o great of wisdom secure in your toplofty perch think otherwise then look around how much of what you see now would exist if not for arthur meditate on that so the next day we rode to the shipyards at muir guidan to board ships and sail south along the coast and up the turgid thamesis to londinium like his father before him arthur found little to love in the tangled sprawl of dwellings and footpaths of this muchvaunted civitas on his first visit when coming for the sword of britainhe told me it appeared nothing more than a midden heap floating on an uneasy morass of bogland the stink filling my nostrils gave me to know that the place had not improved oh there were a few fine buildings of stone still standing a basilica the governors palace a wall or two and such truth be told however the church alone was worthy of its place it was to urbanus church that we proceeded the messengers who had raced ahead to inform the settlements along the way were waiting for us also waiting was aelle war leader of the south saecsens those of the saecsen shore who had kept faith with arthur with the bretwalda were his entire retinue of house carles and all their wives and children i believe they would have brought their cattle too they were that eager to honour the new british king and renew their vows of fealty in this these rude barbarians showed themselves more noble than many who esteemed themselves the highest of our wayward island brood for his part arthur greeted the saecsen war leader like one of his own cymbrogi and gave aelle and the battlechiefs with him such gifts as they prized horses dogs and objects of yellow gold we then formed ranks and passed through the gates and into the tightcrowded streets of die decrepit fortress our arrival occasioned considerable interest once the people of caer londinium glimpsed the young king with his subject lords before him they understood that someone of consequence had appeared in their midst but who who was this brash young man look at him look at the way he is dressed look at his retinue certainly these are not civilized men is he a pict a saecsen perhaps more likely he is some fool of a northern nobleman parading his rustic vanity in the capital thronging the way the jaded folk of londinium shouted from the rooftops who do you think you are stranger they called are you emperor maximus do you think this is rome some laughed at him others jeered aloud calling him arrogant and a fool flinging abuse in half a dozen languages they are the fools cador grumbled do not listen to them i see londinium has learned no love for me arthur replied unhappily nor i for them bedwyr answered take the crown bear and let us be gone from this miserable dung heap how long do they think their precious walls would stand if not for you artos grumbled cai let the barbarians have it and be done thus we made our sullen way through the noise and stench of the city the messengers had done their work and had informed the southern lords and archbishop urbanus of arthurs imminent arrival and kingmaking both paulus who styled himself governor of londinium and his legate were waiting on the steps together as we turned into the long street leading to the governors palace i had met this governor before a bandylegged sybarite with a wide selfsatisfied smile and small pig eyes behind which twitched a rancourous and devious mind paulus by name he was a cunning and oily adversary and he did not take arthurs arrival kindly there was no welcome cup nor did the fat governor invite us into his house to refresh ourselves from our journey greetings artorius he chortled the unpleasant sound brought his round fleshy face before my minds eye on behalf of the citizens of this great civitas i welcome you it is an especial honour for me to meet the famed dux britanniarum at last arthur is the high king and pendragon the legate corrected gently and i too welcome you artorius and welcome merlinus i trust your voyage was agreeable artorius rex is it mused paulus in feigned surprise oh then i am honoured indeed i hope you will allow me to introduce you to some of londiniums fair daughters we have many women who would like to meet the illustrious northerner turning to me paulus said merlinus certainly not the merlinus ambrosius of whom so much is storied and so little known clearly he did not remember me the same i answered bedwyr cai and cador stood nearby looking on each of them worth any hundred of londiniums selfflattering citizens but governor paulus did not deign to notice them i am delighted paulus said now then when is this ceremony of yours to take place on the coming sabbath the legate said quickly merlinus since receiving word i have been extraordinarily busy on your behalf i have spoken to the churchmen who assure me that everything will be ready according to your instruction splendid enthused paulus it does not appear you will require the aid of the governor he was so anxious to distance himself from the proceedings that i thought he might do himself an injury no arthur replied his voice hard it seems i do not require the assistance of the governor though i thank you for the thought yes well paulus hesitated trying to make up his mind about the unusual young man before him if you find you should welcome my aid i will of course be only too pleased to assist you in every way again arthur said i thank you but i cannot think of any possible help you might be to me still i will bear it in mind oh arthur had the measure of governor paulus and was not deceived the legate embarrassed by paulus obvious slight begged the governors leave to withdraw claiming the pressure of duties if you wish i will conduct our visitors to the church he offered and place them in the archbishops care i think we can find our own way to the church i volunteered blind as i was i would still rather flounder through the streets alone than be seen in the company of paulus toad of course of course by all means go if you must said governor paulus but return this evening artorius you and one or two of your men we will sup together i have some excellent wine from the provinces of southern gaul you must come and drink with me at arthurs hazy promise to give the invitation careful consideration we departed continuing on our way to the church that man is a poisonous lizard artos bedwyr muttered sourly and i would not drink a single drop of his gaulish wine if i were you not even if i were dying of thirst patience arthur advised we satisfy the law in coming here nothing more law cai demanded what law is that great caesars law arthur informed them established when he first set foot in ynys prydein yes inquired bedwyr what is it every ruler must conquer londinium if he is to hold britain the king explained i smiled to hear my thoughts echoed in arthurs words i know of no such law cador muttered what is so exalted about this crumbling cow byre gwalchavad who had been following this exchange closely added londinium stinks of slops and urine and from what i have seen the people here are more kin to barbarians than to britons peace brothers we will not stay here one moment longer than necessary arthur assured them when i have achieved what i came here to do we are away to caer melyn he stopped and smiled to himself did you see how relieved paulus was when we declined his invitation perhaps we should sup with him anyway that would make the old toad squirm i say we should do it cador urged and let us bring all the cymbrogi with us and let them drain his precious wine to the dregs they talked like this until we reached the church where we were met by archbishop urbanus and uflwys who was now bishop of londinium hail arthur hail merlinus greetings good friends in the name of our lord the christ we do welcome you said urbanus may gods holy blessing be upon you how have you fared asked uflwys if you are hungry we have bread and ale we can do better than that for the high king of britain uflwys the archbishop said you will find that we have not been idle since receiving word of your arrival arthur thanked the archbishop and suggested to uflwys that the cymbrogi stood ready to serve we are well used to making our own preparations he said while in londinium archbishop urbanus replied you must allow us to serve you after all you have done for dyfrig at mailros it is the least kindness we can perform by this the archbishop revealed his affliction he suffered the same peculiar blindness as the southern noblemen the cymbrogi war host under arthurs command had at hideous cost saved britain from its deadliest danger and all urbanus could see was that an obscure northern abbey would receive a new roof and altar oh but they are an ignorant fetch these haughty southern patricians nevertheless we stayed in the precinct of the church and in the next days it hummed like a bee tree in high summer riders came and went with messages both to and from various lords and noblemen even before entering the city i had sent word to dyfed in the west as it was in my mind to have bishop teilo and dubricius the wise perform the crowntaking ceremony for despite the archbishops apparent blessing i knew that he was not the man to bestow the sovereignty of britain it was not a question of his esteem for arthur he did honour arthur in his own way but urbanus had lived too long in the city too long had he feasted at the tables of rich and powerful men their thoughts had become his thoughts rather than the other way in short the archbishop cared more for the friendship and good opinion of men like paulus than for that of god that is the sad truth of it the kingdom of summer required pure hearts and hands to guide it in arthur the summer realm had found its lord and in arthurs kingship a new age was being born i did not care to allow a powerworshipping sycophant like urbanus to midwife such an important birth therefore i sent to those whom i knew to be holy men as pure and undefiled in their faith as they were fierce in its protection when urbanus heard what i had done he reckoned it a slight but i told him as arthur is a man of the west and north and will return there to establish his reign i think you will agree it is only fitting that those who must serve with him also commission him to his rule ah yes of course replied urbanus even as he struggled to calculate the degree of affront offered him when you put it in that light i do agree with you merlinus i will leave it in your hands and in gods within a few days the first visitors began arriving in londinium a trickle to begin the arrivals rapidly swelled to flood stage from the three fair realms of lloegres prydein and celyddon they came from gwynedd rheged and dyfed mon and ierne and dal riata from derei and bernicia aelle and his kinsmen were already there but the presence of the bretwalda caused other lords of the saecsen kind to appear cynric cymen and cissa with their carles and kith ban of benowyc in armorica who had supported arthur as he had aurelius arrived with two ships full of noblemen and servants meurig ap tewdrig king of dyfed idris of the brigantes cunomor of celyddon brastias of the belgae and ulfias of the dubuni king fergus of ierne who owed arthur tribute received the summons and obeyed each and every lord among them brought gifts for the new high king the dragon flight the cymbrogi elite were charged with assembling and guarding the tribute which flowed like a river of wealth into the church gold and silver objects of all kinds beakers bowls bracelets and brooches many of them set with jewels and gemstones there were swords and spears and shields and knives and handsome carvedwood chests and chairs there were bows of horn with silvertipped arrows and gifts of mead and ale as well as grain and smoked meatwhole halves and haunches of pork and beef and venison there were horses and hunting hounds by the score the tribute of kings brought to seal the bond of fealty and when at last the day came to assemble in the church for the kingmaking there was not enough room for everyone beneath that holy roof the yard outside the church was scarcely less crowded than the sanctuary inside and still there were those who were forced to stand in the street with the citizens of londinium who had lately become very impressed with this northern upstart and wanted to attend his crowntaking out of curiosity if not homage even so many who came simply to gawk stayed to venerate the new high king and this is the way of it we awakened before dawn on the appointed day to pray and break fast then taking up my rowan rod my hand on bedwyrs shoulder to guide me i led arthur who was flanked by cai and cador across the crowded churchyard and into the church directly behind arthur came young illryd dubricius aide who held a golden circlet in his hands bishop teilo and dubricius followed in their long cleric robes each clasping a holy book the church was already full to overflowing and at our appearance the throng gasped arthur arrayed like a celtic prince seemed a creature conjured from the strange shifty light of the west or the enchanted mists of the north he wore a pure white tunic and green trousers with a belt made of overlapping disks of finest red gold his golden tore gleamed at his throat and on his shoulders hung a fine red cloak looking neither right nor left he approached the altar to the chants of the assembled monks gloria gloria gloria in excehis deaf they sang filling the church with praise for the high king of heaven as at the altar arthur knelt dubricius and teilo took their places before him placing their right hands upon his shoulders raising my hands i called out making my voice resound within those walls great of might high king of heaven lord of the high realms maker redeemer friend of man we worship and honour you like a bard of old i turned to the four quarters and offered up the prayer blessed dafyd had offered for aurelius on his crowntaking we pray this day for arthur our king light of sun radiance of moon splendour of fire speed of lightning swiftness of wind depth of sea stability of earth firmness of rock bear witness we pray this day for arthur our king for gods strength to steady him gods might to uphold him gods eye to look before him gods ear to hear him gods word to speak for him gods hand to guard him gods shield to protect him we do summon all these powers between him and these evils gods host to save him from the snares of devils from temptation of vices from everyone who shall wish him ill we do summon all these powers between him and these evils against every cruel power that may oppose him against incantations of false druids against black arts of barbarians against wiles of idolkeepers against enchantments great and small against every foul thing that corrupts body and soul jesu with him before him behind him jesu in him beneath him above him jesu on his right jesu on his left jesu when he sleeps jesu when he wakes jesu in the heart of everyone who thinks of him jesu in the mouth of everyone who speaks of him jesu in the eye of everyone who sees him we uphold him today through a mighty strength the invocation of the three in one through belief in god through confession of the holy spirit through trust in the christ creator of all creation then coming once more before arthur i said bow before the lord of all and swear your fealty to the high king you will serve arthur prostrated himself face down before the altar stretching out his hands to either side in the manner of a vanquished battlechief before his conqueror teilo and dubricius stood at either hand with illtyd at arthurs head dubricius at arthurs right hand said with this hand you will wield the sword of britain what is your vow arthur answered with this hand i will wield the sword of britain in righteousness and fair judgment by the power of gods might i will use it to conquer injustice and punish those who practise harm i will hold this hand obedient to my lord god used of him to do his work in this worldsrealm teilo standing at arthurs left hand said with this hand you will hold the shield of britain what is your vow with this hand i will hold tight to the shield of britain in hope and compassion through gods will i will protect the people who keep faith with me i will hold this hand obedient to my lord jesu used of him to do his work in this worldsrealm and then illtyd standing at arthurs head said upon your brow you will wear the crown of britain what is your vow upon my brow i will wear the crown of britain in all honour and meekness by the power of gods might and through his will i will lead the kingdom through all things whatever shall befall me with courage with dignity and with faith in the christ who shall guide me while my body holds breath at this the good priests replied rise in faith arthur ap aurelius taking the christ to be your lord and saviour honouring him above all earthly lords arthur rose and illtyd placed the slender golden circlet upon his head dubricius turned to the altar and took up caliburnus that is caledvwlch or cut steel arthurs great battle sword and placed it in the kings right hand teilo took up arthurs great battle shield prydwen washed white and painted anew with the cross of jesu and placed it in his left hand i stepped close and finding the brooch by touch unfastened the cloak from arthurs shoulders teilo and dubricius brought forth a fine new cloak of imperial purple with gold edging an emperors cloak and its significance would not be lost on men like paulus and urbanus this cloak the blessed priests fastened at arthurs shoulder with the silver staghead brooch of aurelius raising my staff once more i cried go forth arthur pendragon to all righteousness and good works rule justly and live honourably be to your people a ready light and sure guide through all things whatever may befall this worldsrealm gripping the sword and shield the new purple cloak around his shoulders arthur turned to gaze upon his subject lords people of britain i called here is your high king i charge you to love him honour him serve him follow him and pledge your lives to him even as he has pledged his life to the high king of heaven as if awaiting these words the great doors of the church burst open with a tremendous crash cai and cador somewhere below the altar shouted to the cymbrogi the crowd roiled with alarm and confusion i heard steel sing out as weapons were drawn do not move myrddin arthur shouted dashing away what is it arthur i demanded what is happening just then dubricius cried hold men there will be no bloodshed on this holy day put up your weapons i heard the sound of their footfall on stone as the intruders advanced i gripped my rowan staff tightly bedwyr called arthur stay with myrddin in the next heartbeat i felt bedwyrs hand tight on my arm pulling me aside stay back myrddin bedwyr said i will protect you who are they bedwyr do you know them i have never seen them before answered bedwyr his voice tight there are twelve they carry spears and he paused wonderingly these strangers they all look like llenlleawg and there are he halted again what tell me bedwyr what do you see i do not believe what i am seeing nor will i unless you tell me i cannot see bedwyr i reminded him hopelessly maidens emrys he replied twelve no sixteen of them i think all wear mantles of white and what is this each maiden holds a white dove between her hands they enter the church behind the warriors and advance to the altar they are coming towards us myrddin he halted again and i heard the sharp crack of the butts of spears upon the stones there was silence for a moment and then the crowd gasped i could tell someone had entered the church bedwyr i demanded harshly what is happening tell me man why it is gwenhwyvar he answered mystified i think she has come to honour arthur stupid man i thought divining at last the significance of the maidens and doves honour him i snapped bedwyr she has come to claim him three ah gwenhwyvar white goddess of dedannans enigmatic tribe deeply did i resent you on that day and deeply deeply did i fear you perhaps i may be forgiven my rancour and alarm dearest of hearts i did not know you let it be said that you never repaid my resentment with spite nor held my fear against me less yet gave either of them justification in those next years you proved your nobility a thousand times over gwenhwyvar you were never less than a queen i saw arthur as the lord of the summer realm and that vision cast all else in unreckoning shadow but you saw arthur as a man he needed that and you knew it gwenhwyvar in the wisdom of your sex you were a very druid and more it made my heart soar to see how you and arthur grew to one in honour and courage i do not wonder that god himself formed you for arthur let it also be known that never did you deserve the slanders that gathered thick about your name it is ever the way of smallsouled creatures to pull down the giants in their midst strangers to virtue they cannot abide such nobility lacking it in themselves they will not tolerate it in others so they gnaw away at it as the insect gnaws at the root of the oak until the mighty forest lord falls christ knows they have their reward still on your marriage day i was no friend to you for as arthur was king of all britons it was in my mind to get for him a british wife most canny of your kind you knew better arthur like the summer kingdom was larger than britain only you taught me that gwenhwyvarthough i was long in the learning bending low before arthur as bedwyr described it the irish queen placed her white spear crosswise on the floor gwenhwyvar then stood and pressed the white dove she held into arthurs hands seizing caledvwlch from arthurs side she raised the naked blade to her lips kissed the crosspiece of the hilt and cradled the sword of britain to her breast swords and doves bedwyr i said think what it means am i a bard growled bedwyr tell me myrddin it means she has claimed him for her husband i told him does arthur accept the dove he does bedwyr replied he holds it in his hand then he has accepted the match i told him realizing the ruin of the day it was over before i could make a move to prevent it in truth i should have known it was finished the day fergus brought the treasures of his tribe to arthur as tribute placing his daughter and his champion in arthurs care in accepting fergus tribute he tacitly accepted the proposed match from the moment gwenhwyvar set eyes on arthur she had chosen him for her mate that is the way it is done among iernes royalty for the sovereignty of the eireann island race runs through its women that is to say a man derives his kingship through his wife among the children of danna kings enjoy their season but the queen is queen forever and arthur innocent of the significance made no complaint why would he she was beautiful hair black as a ravens breast plaited in hundreds of tiny braids each one bound with a golden thread and gathered to fall around her shoulders and neck blackest jet against pale white skin her eyes were grey as mountain mist her brow was high and smooth and her lips cherry red never forget she was a warrior queen she carried a spear a sword and a small round shield of bronze her fair form she clothed in silver mail of rings so small and bright they rippled like water when she moved and llwch llenlleawg her champion and battlechief served arthur well and took his rightful place among the cymbrogi but the tall irishman was the queens guardian first last and always it was true that the kings and lords of britain would never have tolerated a high king whose wife was not a briton born but gwenhwyvar shrewd and subtle had already triumphed before anyone knew it had begun the contest was over she simply waited until arthur had claimed the kingship then she claimed him true she waited not one moment longer than necessary lest any rival enjoy even the slightest chance on the day that arthur took the crown for the second time that day was arthur also wed we stayed in londinium six days in all feasting the kings and lords who had come to pay homage and tribute to the new high king the feast became arthur and gwenhwyvars marriage repast as well and no one enjoyed the celebration more than fergus of ierne gwenhwyvars father i do not think i ever knew a happier man arthur was pleased as well he might be he admired gwenhwyvar for her boldness and stood in awe almost everyone did of her beauty still he did not love her at least not yet that would come in time they would learn a love which bards would celebrate a thousand years hence but as is so often the way with two such strongwilled mates their first days of marriage chafed them both when the last lord had departed to his hearth we also departed the cymbrogi with cador and bors to caer melyn and the rest of us cai bedwyr llenlleawg myself and arthur to ierne with gwenhwyvar it is a short voyage and the weather stayed fair i remembered ierne as a green gem set in a silver sea it is a shallow bowl of an island lacking prydeins rough crags what hills ierne boasts are gentle and wooded and its few mountains are not high expansive and numerous are its plains which grow good grain in plenty if the islands contentious kings ever stopped slaughtering one another they might find themselves possessing grainwealth enough to attract trade from the east for the upbuilding of their people it is a damp land alas suffering almost continual inundation by both sea and sky even so the rain is soft filling the rivers and streams with sweet water the ale of the irish is surprisingly good for all they make it with scorched grain yet another mystery concerning this baffling race we sailed into a bay on the northeastern coast i heard a loud whoop and cai standing beside me at the rail said it is fergus bless him he is wading out to welcome us even as he spoke i heard the splash of someone striding through the tidewash fergus shouted something which i did not catch and a moment later a strange shrill wail sounded from the beach what is happening cai fergus bards i think he has his retinue with him and the bards are making a sort of music for us with pig bladders he paused most peculiar i had encountered the instrument before an odd conflux of pipes which in their hands produce a laudable variety of sounds now crooning now crying now piercing as a scream now sighing and low when played with the harp which they often did this piping made a most enjoyable music and the voices of eires bards are almost as good as those of the cymry many among the learned brotherhood hold that the men of green ierne and the black hills of prydein were brothers before manawyddans waters divided them perhaps that is the way of it the people are dark for the most part like the mountain cymry and they are keenwitted and as ready for laughter as a fight like the celts of elder times they are generous in all things especially song and celebration they love dancing and think themselves illtreated if they are not allowed to move their feet when their filidh play the harp and pipe fergus was lord of a small realm on the northern coast in dal riata his principal stronghold was called muirbolc after one of his noble kinsmen his hall and holding as cai described it to me was fashioned on the old style a number of small round houses dwellings grain stores craftsmens huts cookhouses surrounded a great timber hall with a highpitched roof of thatch an earthen wall topped by a palisade of sharpened timber had been flung around the whole beyond the wall were fields and cattle pens and forest inside the hall which served as the kings house as well as the gathering place for all his folk the great stone hearth blazed both day and night along the walls on either side of the hearth were booths with wickerwork walls where people could rest or withdraw more privately and at the head of the hearth stood an enormous table the kings table fixed to the rooftrees on either side fergus led us to his stronghold and stood before the gate you are welcome in fergus dwelling my friends enter and take your ease let your cares be as the mist that melts at mornings touch come let us eat and drink and celebrate the union of our noble tribes together he greatly prized the marriage of his daughter and regarded arthur as both kinsman and dearest friend never have i seen a lord so desirous of pleasing his guests as fergus mac guillomar his good humour never flagged and bounty such as he could command flowed from him like the waters of the silver siannon fergus fortunes while still scant had nevertheless improved since allying himself with arthur he possessed a fine herd of horses and bred hounds second to none he gave gifts to us all and to arthur he also gave a hound pup which would be trained to battle and the hunt fergus daughter too was desirous of securing our good favour gwenhwyvar had brought arthur to muirbolc to deliver her dower to him and a most unusual gift it was but before i tell of it i must first tell of the miracle that took place while we sojourned in eire there were priests in the region who constantly sought to persuade fergus to grant them lands on which to build a church and community for themselves they also wished the king to join the christianogi of course though they would settle for land fergus did not trust them he had got it into his head that once a king bent the knee to the lord christ he became impotent as fergus was a man who greatly enjoyed the company of beautiful women in which his realm abounded it was a difficult thing for him to look favourably on any belief which threatened his pleasure that is absurd i told him upon discovering the source of his reluctance do not the priests take wives like other men i tell you they do and children are born to them their faith does not make them less potent than other men god knows you have swallowed a lie fergus oh i am certain these priests are excellent in every way i hold no enmity for them he agreed lightly but why tempt calamity i am happy never more so than now that my daughter is wed to the high king of britain but arthur himself is beholden to christ bedwyr informed him joining the discussion faith has not made him impotent look at the two of them together reclining together in their nook drinking from the same cup ask arthur if his faith has stolen his manhood better yet ask gwenhwyvar she will tell you it is the way of the britons the irish king allowed to hold strange gods and stranger practices we all know this but it is not our way it is the way of many of your kinsmen fergus i countered many now embrace the lord christ who formerly held to crom cruach i ask you again where is the harm well fergus said they have grown accustomed to it i expect and it does them no harm but i am not so accustomed i fear it would go ill with me nothing anyone could say would convince him but several days later a group of monks arrived and sought audience with the king as always fergus welcomed them and gave them gifts of food and drink for they would not accept his gold curious i went to the hall to hear their appeal the leader of this group of wandering brothers was a priest named ciaran though yet a young man he was already strong in the faith and very wise learned in greek and latin articulate and wellspoken his renown was such that many fellow monks both british and irish had pledged themselves to his service to aid him in his work among the heathen clans of eire we heard that the great war leader of the britons is here ciaran declared we have come to pay homage to him this impressed and pleased arthur he did not imagine that his name was known outside britain you are welcome at my hearth fergus told the priest for arthurs sake i give you good greeting may heavens king richly bless you fergus ciaran replied and may the high king of heaven honour his high king on earth i give you good greeting arthur ap aurelius arthur thanked the priest for his blessing whereupon ciaran addressed himself to me and you are surely the wise emrys of whom so many wonderful tales are told i am myrddin i answered simply and i stand ready to serve you brother priest i do thank you wise emrys he replied this day however it is for me to serve you i sensed movement before me as he stepped closer we heard that you were blind and now i see for myself that this is so it is but a minor annoyance i answered i am content a man of your eminence would bear any hardship lightly and i expected no less observed ciaran and those with him murmured approvingly perhaps it is as our lord jesu has said this affliction has been given so that the glory of the father may be revealed if that is the way of it then perhaps i may be the instrument of that unveiling will you allow me the hall hushed to hear what i would say the audacious priest was offering to heal me well what could i say i had been telling fergus of the power of the risen one if i refused ciarans gentle challenge then i would be shown a liar if on the other hand i accepted his offer and he failed i would be shown a fool better a fool than a liar i thought and answered as for myself i am content but if the ancient of days desires my healing for his benefit i stand ready to oblige then so be it stepping close ciaran unwound the bandage and raised his hands before me i could feel the heat from his palms on my skin as if i had raised my face to the sun god of creation the priest said i call upon your divine spirit to honour your name and demonstrate your power before unbelieving men so saying ciaran touched my eyes and the heat of his hands flowed out from his fingertips it felt as if my eyes were bathed in burning white light there was some discomfort a little pain but mostly surprise and i flinched away but ciaran held me his fingers pressing into my eyes the unnatural heat increased burning into my flesh it felt as if my eyes were on fire i squeezed them shut and clenched my teeth to keep from crying out ciaran took his hands away then and said open your eyes blinking away the tears i saw a throng of people looking at me in blank astonishment their faces glowing like small hazy suns arthur gazed at me in wonder myrddin are you well he asked can you see me i raised my hands before my face they shimmered and shone like firebrands each finger a tongue of flame i see you arthur i answered looking at him i am healed this happy event caused a tremendous sensation in fergus house they talked of nothing else for days even bedwyr and cai who had seen wonders enough in their time with me confessed amazement blindness is a wearisome nuisance and i was greatly relieved to be quit of it i felt suddenly lighter as if i had shed a weighty and unwieldy burden the hazy glow gradually faded and my sight became keen once more my heart soared but what if you had not been healed bedwyr asked me later what if this priest had failed my only worry i told him was what doubters like fergus would think if i refused since i could do nothing about the healing in any event i agreed but did you doubt he persisted he meant no disrespect he genuinely wanted to know did i doubt no i did not hear me bedwyr i told him i believed the one who made mens eyes could restore my sight after all is that any more difficult than filling ectors ale vats a miracle is a miracle even so i have lived long enough in the great kings care to know that whether i am blind as a bump or own the eyes of an eagle is a matter of such small regard it does not bear thinking about much less worrying over in truth i was powerfully grateful to have my sight returned to me yet lest men think that i cared only for the gifting god in what i could get from him i kept my joy to myself fergus however was much excited by this show of power he took it as a sign of great import and significance that this wonder should have taken place beneath his roof he leaped from his chair and seized ciaran by the arms earth and sky bear witness you are a holy man and the god you serve is a remarkable god from this day you shall have all that you ask of me even to the half of my kingdom fergus mac guillomar mac eire replied ciaran i will not take one thing from you unless you give your heart into the bargain tell me what i must do fergus answered and be assured the sun will not set before it is accomplished only this the priest answered swear fealty to the high king of heaven and take him for your lord that very day fergus pledged life and faith to the true god and all the members of his clan with him they embraced their new faith with much devotion and even more zeal fergus granted the good brothers leave to sojourn in his realm he charged them also with the teaching of his household the kings bards were far from pleased with this development they grumbled against the kings new allegiance but when i related what taliesin had told hafgan about the faith of christ they allowed themselves to be persuaded it need not mean the end for you i assured them if you who seek the truth of all things would embrace a higher truth you will find your rank is not diminished but increased a new day is dawning in the west the old ways are passing as you must know the man who will not bend the knee to christ will find his place given to another gwenhwyvar who had learned the faith from charis during her sojourn in ynys avallach praised her fathers courage fergus embraced his daughter it is not courage my soul he said it is simple prudence for if i did not acknowledge what i have seen this day then i would be more blind than myrddin ever was i would that more british kings displayed such prudence observed arthur in all we spent a fine time with fergus and his people no doubt we might have stayed with them a goodly while but as the days passed arthur began looking more and more across the sea towards britain i knew he was thinking of his cymbrogi and the day of leaving was close at hand one night as we sat at the hearth with our long fleshforks in our hands spearing tender morsels of savoury pork from the cauldron while the bards sang gwenhwyvar approached with a bundle in her arms the bundle was wrapped in soft leather bound with cords she held it as if it were a child and i thought at first that it was husband she said cradling the bundle in respect of our marriage i would bestow a gift she advanced to where he sat arthur lay aside his fork and stood watching her intently holding her with his eyes as he would clasp her in his arms extending the leather bundle to him gwenhwyvar placed it in his hands and then proceeded to loose the bindings layer upon layer of leather fell away to reveal a vellum scroll i had heard of such before they had been common in the days when the eagles ruled in britain but i had never before seen one arthur regarded the object with bemused pleasure so far was it from anything he might have expected he did not know what to make of it he looked to his wife for explanation and wisely held his tongue bedwyr and cai exchanged bewildered glances and fergus beamed with magnanimous pride taking the scroll gwenhwyvar carefully unrolled it i could tell by the way she touched it gently and with utmost reverence that it was of immense age and priceless in her eyes this intrigued me what written there could be so valuable she spread the scroll before arthurs eyes and he bent his head over it i watched his face intently but his bewilderment did not abate if anything it increased indeed the more he studied the scroll the more perplexed he became gwenhwyvar watched him with a wary yet knowing air grey eyes alert dark brows slightly arched she was waiting for his reaction and testing him by it was he worthy of this gift she was thinking was arthur the man she took him to be was the gift of her life entrusted to one who could respect its value and arthur bless him knew himself entangled in a decisive trial he studied the scroll for a time and then raising his head smiled confidently and cried come here myrddin and behold see what my queen has given me it was a canny remark gwenhwyvar was well pleased for she heard in it what she wanted to hear and arthur seeing her reaction to his words beamed his pleasure for he had extricated himself most shrewdly fergus smiled happily knowing the treasure of his tribe had found a worthy protector only i was unhappy now for arthur had cleverly shifted the burden to my shoulders it depended on me to appraise the gift and offer an opinion of its value i hesitated curiosity and reluctance warring within me i could decline arthurs offer and force him to declare his ignorance or i could go to his aid arthur was waiting curiosity won over reluctance and i rose and went to where arthur and gwenhwyvar held the scroll stretched between them they turned the scroll towards me i looked at the pale vellum expecting to see a picture rendered there or words of one kind or another there was a picture yes and words too but in all it was like nothing i had ever seen four i now appreciated arthurs discomfort and why he had called upon me as he did i stared at the proffered scroll and the strange markings on it i opened my mouth to speak thought better of it and studied the scroll once more there were several long columns of words scratched out in a language i did not know neither latin nor greek which i can if pressed to it make out and there was a picture not one only but several one large drawing flanked by three smaller ones the drawings were almost as inscrutable as the words for they showed a strange hiveshaped object resting on a short stack of thin disks and floating in a blue firmament water perhaps but it was not a boat for there was an entrance or at least a hole in the side which would let the water in the smaller pictures showed the same object or similar objects from different views the thing was without markings of any kind so i could get no hint of its function i knew gwenhwyvar was awaiting my appraisal this is indeed remarkable i perceive you have treasured it long in your clan the vellum scroll before you has been given hand to hand from the first days to this gwenhwyvar explained it is said that brigid queen of the tuatha dedannan brought it to eire that i can well believe i told her and can you yet read the words written here i indicated the delicate tracery of symbols gwenhwyvars face fell slightly alas i cannot that art is long vanished from our kin if indeed any ever possessed it she replied it was my hope that you wise emrys might read them out for me i wish i could i told her but i am unused to studying script and would no doubt make a poor assessment then with sudden inspiration i said still it may be that the priest ciaran knows this script and can tell us what it means if you agree we might take it to him tomorrow your counsel is good replied gwenhwyvar but let ciaran be summoned here it is not right that our treasure should be carried through the realm as if it were a thing of little value fergus agreed with his daughter and dispatched a messenger at dawn to bring the priest to muirbolc to view the scroll what do you think it pictures myrddin wondered arthur the next morning while we waited for the monk to arrive we were sitting on the rocks above the shore the day was bright and the sea calm as it washed back and forth over the rocky shore below it would appear to be a dwelling of some kind i replied more than that i cannot say he fell silent listening to the seabirds and feeling the suns warm rays on his face a man could grow to love it here he murmured after a while cai and bedwyr who were beginning to look longingly towards home approached then they settled themselves on either side of us we thought you were readying die ship bedwyr said we did not want you to forget us here arthur was just saying he did not wish to leave at all i told them not return to britain cai exclaimed artos have a care if we must endure any more of their piping we will certainly go mad peace brother arthur soothed myrddin is jesting we leave tomorrow as planned even now the ship is being readied he opened his eyes and pointed down the beach a short distance to where our boat was drawn up several of fergus men and our own pilot were shaking out the sails we came to tell you that ciaran has arrived bedwyr informed us fergus is waiting for you and myrddin to join them arthur jumped to his feet then let us attend him i am determined to solve at least one riddle before i leave this place ciaran greeted us happily you will have good weather for tomorrows sailing he told us i will come to see you away oh do not talk of leaving fergus cried it is my heart you are taking from me when you go your place is assured with me arthur told him come visit us when you will gwenhwyvar approached with the scroll and proceeded to unwrap it the priest was eager to see it and pronounced it a prize beyond price i have seen such before he said bending his head over the closeworked script when i was pupil to the sainted thomas of narbonne i attended him on a journey to constantinople the priests of that great city preserve the worlds wisdom on scrolls of this kind it is said that the oldest come from great alexandria and carthage fergus smiled well pleased with this assessment can you tell out the marks he asked ciaran bent his head still lower pulled on his lip and then said no i cannot it is not greek or latin or any other tongue i know but he continued brightening that is of little consequence for i know well the object represented here then tell us urged arthur it is called a martyrion explained ciaran there are many kinds and this is seeing our confusion he halted if you please i said our learning in these matters is not as great as yours good monk is this martyrion a building to the memory of the illustrious dead a house of honour gwenhwyvar affirmed that is what the old ones called it yes of course ciaran agreed eagerly forgive my presumption what you are seeing here he lightly traced the painted picture with a fingertip is indeed a house of honour of the kind called rotonda for its round shape and you see it is tabled for it is raised on many mensi he traced the round stone tables which formed both the foundation and steps leading to the entrance these are known in rome wondered arthur cai and bedwyr still appeared perplexed not even rome boasts such constructions ciaran informed him the art of their making is lost to rome now and there is but one in the city of constantine and it is a very marvel i know because i saw it can this house of honour be made from the drawing here arthur asked turning his eyes from the priest to me as he spoke it is possible i allowed cautiously taking the drawing as a guide but that is the purpose of this scroll cried ciaran it is meant to guide the builder you see he indicated a row of numbers in one line of the script these are the very measurements and ratios the builder must use as he assays his work the martyrion is meant to be built then i will build it arthur declared i will raise this tabled rotonda to the memory of the cymbrogi who died on baedun and they will have a house of honour such as cannot be boasted even in rome that night we drank the kings good ale and vowed to visit one another often arthur had found in fergus a boon companion a king whose loyalty was secured through mutual respect and strengthened through marriage god knows the lords of britain had caused arthur enough heartache and trouble ierne allowed arthur to escape the petty kings and the clamour of their incessant demands thus when we put to sea the next morning it was with renewed vigour for the rest we had enjoyed but with some small reluctance as well fergus promised to attend arthur at caer lial where we would observe the christ mass together even so arthur and gwenhwyvar stood long at the rail watching the green banks of the island disappear into the sea mist they looked like exiles cast adrift on the fickle tide we sailed along the northern coast intending to follow the channel and cross over to rheged where the sea is narrowest as the boat passed the last headland and came into the narrows we saw the black sails of strange ships they were yet some way off to the south but were drawing swiftly nearer i make it seven of them said bedwyr scanning the glittering sea the day was clear and the sun shone bright on the water making it difficult to see no ten who are they wondered arthur aloud do you know them cai the picti and others like the jutes and danes will fly blue cai replied eyes narrowed but i know of no tribe that flies black sails arthur thought for a moment and then said i want to see them we must get closer he turned and called the order to the pilot barinthus who dutifully swung the boat onto a new course we watched standing at the prow shading our eyes with our hands as we stared into the white sunglare i count thirteen now bedwyr said after a moment the ships are large observed cai larger than any we have who can they be more sails appeared twenty bedwyr informed us straining forward to count the sails yes twenty myrddin and they are coming towards i see them i reminded him gazing at the black ships hastening across the water and i like not what i see i cannot see anyone aboard remarked gwenhwyvar they hide themselves from us why closer more sails were becoming visible as still more ships sailed into view twentyeight called bedwyr no thirty arthur who besides the emperor has a fleet so large asked cai rome perhaps though the romans would be reluctant to launch such a fleet in northern waters i think we allowed the nearest vessel to come within spearthrow and then steered onto a parallel course huge round leathercovered shields hung from the rails below a rank of raised oars ten on either side and spears jutted out from between the shields long wooden bankers formed a narrow roof over the rowing benches and provided a platform for the warriors the square sail bore the image of an animal crudely outlined in white against the black what is that wondered cai squinting at it a bear no i answered not a bear a pig it is a boar the two ships held their courses for a time and then the black ship veered suddenly towards us in the same instant strange warriors leapt onto the platform big men wideshouldered with black hair and pale skin screaming jeering brandishing spears they are attacking shouted bedwyr leaping for his spear and shield a heartbeat later the first enemy spears flashed up into the air all fell short save twoone spear glanced off the side and the second struck the rail llenlleawg leaped to the rail and snatched up the spear before it fell into the sea it was a thick ungainly thing of scraped wood fixed to a heavy iron head more suited to thrusting than throwing gwenhwyvar took up her shield and cai likewise only arthur remained unmoved he stood staring at the oncoming craft while those around him armed themselves the enemy keel slashed the waves driving nearer spears flew arcing up and falling fewer fell short this time several struck the sides and one snagged the sail arthur i said do you mean to fight them he did not reply but stood looking at the oncoming ship eyes narrowed against the seaglare bedwyr holding out prydwen urged arthur to take it but arthur made no move what would you have us do bear receiving no answer bedwyr glanced quickly at me arthur i asked turning from the rail at last arthur called to the pilot turn aside he ordered back to ierne fly we must warn fergus the ship veered away from the oncoming enemy ship the enemy gave chase but our smaller lighter vessel steadily pulled away increasing the distance between us we were soon beyond spearthrow and seeing they could not catch us the enemy fell back and returned to their previous course flying before the wind we made for the irish coast faster arthur yelled though we would make landfall well ahead of the enemy there was not an instant to spare soon the coastal hills loomed before us and we came in sight of the bay from which we had put forth saddle the horses arthur commanded let us get them on land first bedwyr suggested do it now arthur turned to the pilot barinthus you know the bay run the ship aground cai bedwyr and llenlleawg saddled the horses and they were ready to ride as we came into the bay barinthus did not strike the sails but steered the craft straight towards land i watched the shore sweeping nearer and braced myself for the collision not arthur as the keel drove into the hard shingle arthur swung himself into the saddle we struck the shingle with a tremendous crack the rudder splintered and the mast burst its bindings even as the ship lurched and shuddered to a halt beneath him arthur lashed his mount forward hie hie he cried the horse lifted its forehooves and leapt over the side plunging to the hocks in seawater another leap and arthur was clattering away up the beach gwenhwyvar followed arthurs example with llenlleawg close behind still clutching the enemy spear look at them muttered cai shaking his head they will break their necks riding like that they should have a care for the horses if they have none for themselves bedwyr replied from the saddle tell that to the barbarian battlechief when his spear pricks your backside he lashed his mount and leaped overboard with a shout hie yah cai followed and i gathered my reins as i swung into the saddle i called to the pilot i will wait for you barinthus nay lord do not wait for me the seaman replied working to secure the loosened mast i am soon finished here and will follow make fast the boat then but do not linger i urged my mount over the side the horse reared and plunged splashing seawater over me and then i was pounding over the beach cai had reached the clifftrack leading to fergus stronghold and bedwyr was labouring up the steep track arthur and the others had already disappeared upon reaching the track i paused to look back the bay was yet empty the enemy had not followed us to shore likely as we had outraced them they would wait to make landfall when they had the support of numbers by the time i reached muirbolc the alarm had already sounded everyone was rushing around men to secure the fortress women and children to hiding warriors to their weapons herdsmen to gather their cattle and bring them within the protection of the caer fergus and his battlechief stood in the centre of the yard with arthur and gwenhwyvar before him gwenhwyvar at arthurs side was saying listen to him father there are too many we cannot fight them here ten shields on each sidethat is at least twenty warriors in each ship maybe more arthur told him bluntly and there are thirty shipsmaybe more if they make landfall here they will be sitting in your hall before the sun sets our only hope is to flee the caer and rally the clans gwenhwyvar insisted at least that way we might have a chance we know the land and they do not we will rally conaire and the men of uladh when they learn the danger they will not turn us away fergus pulled on his chin and frowned as he turned the matter over fergus arthur said gently we cannot save muirbolc but we can save our lives if we stay here we will lose both very well fergus agreed reluctantly i will do as you say he turned to his battlechief and with a word sent the man away we must gather provisions the king said turning back it will take time there is no time said arthur we must leave at once bad enough to abandon my stronghold fergus replied skin me alive if i also abandon the treasure of our clan arthur relented then make haste i will ride with cai and bedwyr to the headland to see where the enemy makes landfall i will ride with you gwenhwyvar said stay here lady arthur told her we will return soon gwenhwyvar made to protest but thought better of contending the matter and held her tongue to me arthur said you will come with me myrddin bedwyr cai and i rode out with arthur and met barinthus at the gate as he arrived they did not follow us lord he said remain here and keep watch arthur commanded him alert fergus if you see anything we ride to the headland we galloped along the coastal path searching the sea below for any sign of the black ships but we saw nothing until reaching the high bluffs of the headland and then as we crested the hill and the broad expanse of the sea to the north and west came into view our hearts sank for spread out upon the water all along the northern coast were forty or more black sails clustered thick like carrion birds on a glassy plain five god help us said bedwyr gazing upon the enemy fleet they are making to come ashore there replied arthur pointing to the bay farther along the coast likely they will be on foot i saw no horses so it will take them some little time to march inland he glanced at the sky the sun will set before they can form a raiding party then we have one night at least to prepare cai said this night only arthur confirmed wheeling his horse he started back down the track cai followed but bedwyr and i sat looking at the enemy ships for a moment longer there must be a thousand warriors or more bedwyr mused i wonder how many these kings of uladh can command that i very much fear we will soon discover i replied gloomily we returned with haste to muirbolc where the people had begun leaving the caer the first groups were already melting into the forest fergus stood at the gate as his people passed before him urging them to courage and speed arthur gwenhwyvar and llenlleawg stood together in deliberation cai was nowhere to be seen arthur raised his head and waved us to join him at our arrival he said bedwyr you and cai will stay to aid fergus and his battlechiefs gwenhwyvar llenlleawg and i will raise the uladh lords someone should warn ciaran and his brother monks i pointed out i will go to them if we have difficulty with the lords i want you with me arthur insisted the good brothers are not far gwenhwyvar said we can take word to them on the way so be it to bedwyr arthur said when cai returns from the bay tell him what we have done if all goes well gwenhwyvar added we should return here before sunrise with help we remounted and bidding fergus farewell rode out at once llenlleawg led the way we passed through a wood and crossed a stream then reached a broad gently sloping lea where we turned south and came after a short ride to a rough holding little more than a field camp where the monks had settled ciaran greeted us and offered food and drink god be good to you he said we would be honoured if you will stay to sup with us nothing would please us more gwenhwyvar told him but we cannot stay we have come to warn you there is trouble coming invaders have been seen even now they are making landfall along the northern shore not far from here invaders the priest mouthed the word but showed no fear who are they do you know they are a tribe i have never seen before arthur told him but i can tell you this they have a fleet as large as the emperors and their ships and sails are black vandali said ciaran do you know them i asked i know of no other barbarian host to own a fleet the priest replied they are known in constantinople that is where i heard about them and their blacksailed ships and did you also hear how they may be defeated inquired arthur ciaran shook his head slowly sadly no in truth i heard that they cannot be defeated of all barbarians the vandali are the most fierce and cruel they kill for pleasure and possess no respect for life neither their own nor anyone elses they hold no thing as sacred save their own valour and they live only for the sport of killing and the plunder to be won with the points of their spears the priest paused measuring the effect of his words i would be lying if i told you that anyone could stand against them the vandali are feared by all who know them even the goths flee them on sight ciaran paused then added that is all i know i wish i could tell you more and i would hear more but i am grateful for this little arthur replied fergus and his people are leaving the caer if you go at once you can join them in hiding we are going to rally the kings gwenhwyvar said we ride first to conaire at rath mor may god go with you my friends ciaran said raising his hands he blessed us with a prayer as we continued quickly on our way the stronghold of conaire crobh rua or red hand was much the same as that of fergus only larger and a great ogamcarved pillar stone stood at the entrance to the caer his warband was accordingly larger too boasting five warriors to every one of fergus men and no fewer than four tributary kings supported him as well each of these small kings maintained warriors at his own expense which conaire could command at need he would be a powerful ally consequently winning him was crucial to iernes survival gwenhwyvar understood this necessity and the terrible urgency of raising a host swiftly upon reaching rath mor and finding the gate open she rode into the caer ignoring the shouts of the lax gatemen to stop and be recognized she rode straight to the hall and shouted conaire come out conaire we must talk you and i the people heard and began hastening to us the door to the hall was a simple white ox hide with a hand painted on it in red the head of a man appeared from behind the skin and declared the king is deaf to all demands but his own just you tell your deaf king that he is a fool to sleep within his hall while his realm suffers invasion she snapped her dark brows lowered the head promptly disappeared did you hear that conaire she shouted a moment later the ox hide was thrown aside and a tall man with fair hair and a redbrown beard stalked out a fine handsome man he folded his bare arms across his chest ah gwenhwyvar he said upon seeing her i should have known it was you making all this tumult he glanced quickly at those of us accompanying the queen i thought you were in ynys prydein is it to marry me that you have come here gwenhwyvar favoured him with a disdainful smile conaire crobh rua i will never marry you the man you see beside me is my husband then you can say nothing i care to hear the uladh king started back to his hall my husband gwenhwyvar continued arthur high king of the britons conaire stopped and turned indeed he looked arthur up and down and then as if deciding he had seen nothing worth troubling himself over dismissed arthur with a sneer i did not know the britons had got themselves another new king he said now that i see him i wonder why they bothered arthur regarded the irish lord coolly but without rancour he said nothing gwenhwyvar however stiffened in the saddle her face flushed red with anger yet it was the silent llenlleawg who answered conaires insult your ignorance is exceeded only by your arrogance conaire he said this night you must decide whether you will live or die the irish lord glared lethally at llenlleawg it seems he said his voice tight with loathing that i will not be alone in making that decision it will not be llenlleawgs spear that steals the breath from your body gwenhwyvar said while we stand here bartering insults the enemy invader claims our land we have one night to make good our defence or our realm is surely lost conaires eyes swung slowly from llenlleawg to gwenhwyvar what invader he demanded dully they are of a tribe called vandali gwenhwyvar told him and they have come in force to plunder ierne the irish king drew himself full height this danger can be but small or i would have heard of it still i am not surprised that fergus has sent you to plead for him the least sign of trouble and he comes begging my protection tell him i will consider the matter and reply when it suits me he made to dismiss us and turn away stay i roared holding him with the bardic voice of command i said hear me lord conaire i have known many kings some have been fools and others haughty but few have been both and outlived their imprudence the proud king bristled at this his eyes flashed quick anger but i did not give him opportunity to speak know this we have come here to warn you and seek your aid you know nothing of the force arrayed against us i tell you the truth unless we stand together when the battle begins not one of us will survive the onslaught conaire frowned he fairly squirmed under my authority but i held him with my voice this is the way of it if you doubt me why not ride with us to the coast and see for yourself that what you have heard is no mere fancy of the fainthearted the irish lord glared murderously at me but kept his mouth firmly shut well asked gwenhwyvar what say you conaire he turned to one of those who stood looking on bring my horse he barked angrily to gwenhwyvar he said i will ride with you and see for myself if it is as you say i will protect you he allowed himself a sly sneering smile but if it is otherwise you must deliver to me the thing that i shall demand of you conaire stared at gwenhwyvar as he said this and it was not difficult to guess what was in his mind as he spoke arthurs face darkened at the mindless provocation nor did i fault him had i been arthur i would have split him crown to crotch at a single stroke but gwenhwyvar intervened make no demands you would not wish yourself to fulfil conaire without a word conaire turned on his heel and disappeared into the hall gwenhwyvar allowed herself a selfsatisfied smile well she said that was better than i hoped is this red hand always so agreeable arthur asked gwenhwyvar answered it was ever in his mind to have me for his wife he has a wife of course and two cumalwives also but he contrives to make himself a king after the manner of rory and conor mac nessa that is why he has ever sought me to agree to marry him if his courage is half as great as his vanity arthur remarked then the blacksailed vandali will soon be fleeing back over the waves as fast as the wind can carry them when the time comes for spearplay you will not be disappointed llenlleawg suggested a bard with a harp does not make sweeter music this i want to see replied arthur conaire reappeared and his horse having been brought he mounted at once and led us out from the caer and along a wellworn trail through a wood we came eventually to a low treeless rise giving way to a series of downwardsloping ridges which ended in sharp cliffs overlooking the northwestern coast even before reaching the cliffside we could see the thicksown black sails closeclustered on the sea many ships had already made landfall and more were coming in with every wave but we saw no one on shore and no sign of horses aboard any of the boats forty ships observed bedwyr no more have joined them that means they have all arrived unless this is merely the advance force sent to spy out the land cai pointed out both men lapsed into silence at that unsettling thought the irish king stared at the spectacle before him for a long time never have i seen such an audacious invader he said at last such insolence incurs a heavy debt and i mean to collect my share well said conaire arthur told him together we will drive these barbarians into the sea conaire the westering light in his eyes turned to arthur and looked him full in the face lord i am a man of impulse and quick temper as you have seen he said i spoke without due consideration and my words were not worthy and now i am sorry for i think you are a very king among your kind and it is not meet for two such noble allies to enter battle with malice between them i agree replied arthur nicely i think it will be toil enough to fight the vandal horde without also bearing a heavy dislike for one another so saying the high king of britain held out his arm to the irish king conaire clasped his arm and the two embraced like kinsmen animosity forgotten but conaire was not finished he turned next to gwenhwyvar and said lady you know i have always held you in highest esteem that is why i deeply regretted your leaving eirinn to take a husband of british blood and though i bear the loss i understand your choice and even find it in my heart to approve you have made a laudable match and found a man above all worthy of you lady i commend you and i offer you my hand as i would gladly have offered you my life i will take your hand conaire gwenhwyvar answered leaning close but i will have your cheek as well taking his hand she pulled him to her put her lips to his cheek and kissed him six the irish king grinned broadly and lifting the reins urged his horse forward we raced to rath mor and had almost reached the shelter of the wood when with a sudden cry an enemy warband burst out from among the trees within two heartbeats we were confronted by fifty warriors large men fierce pitiless eyes glittering like chips of jet in their sallow faces they advanced on foot warily and carried no swords only the thick black spear and heavy wooden shield we had seen on the ships they hesitated only a moment then the enemy battlechief gave a shout and they rushed upon us black spears levelled screaming as they ran arthur lashed his mount to speed and raced to meet the charge headon follow me he called setting his shield as he flew towards the enemy llenlleawg was first to react to arthurs lead he blew past me and took up position to the left and just behind arthur so that the barbarians could not come at the king from his blind side conaire was suddenly beside me holding out his spear you have no spear he said take mine keep it i told him i prefer the sword gwenhwyvar lashed her mount to speed unslinging her shield and drawing her sword at full gallop oh heart of my heart said conaire watching her go is that not a sweet sight come irishman i called they are leaving us behind arthur reached the enemy line and hurtled through scattering foemen in all directions llenlleawg right behind did not give them a chance to regroup he ran down three or four as they fled and slashed two more the line gaped wide allowing gwenhwyvar to ride through unopposed she gained the edge of the wood and then turned back charging again into the reforming rank i saw where she intended to strike and swerved to join her attack conaire on my right loosed a wild joyous whoop and rode straight to the centre of the line spear high shield outflung and reins flying loose one glimpse of the three of us sweeping down upon them and mouths gaping in unintelligible shouts shields thrown high the strangers scrambled for the cover of the wood arthur and llenlleawg met them however swinging up from behind the vandal warband was neatly sliced in two those closest to the trees made good their escape but the rest found themselves the centre of an attack by five swiftly converging horsemen the disordered rank folded inward upon itself to become a confused knot gwenhwyvar and i reached this knot first and stabbed into it conaire slashed in from the side and arthur and llenlleawg charged in from the rear they fell before us confused crying out in panic and rage lunging desperately with their short clumsy spears they threw themselves at us and we trampled them down the soft green turf blushed bright crimson in the lowering sun and the shadows stretched long the enemy warriors fled the fight leaving their dead and wounded on the ground as they disappeared into the shelter of the wood llenlleawg would have pursued them but arthur called him back warriors conaire hooted in derision i have never seen such hopeless warriors if that is the best they can do give me a gang of boys with sharp sticks and i will conquer the world they were a scouting party only replied arthur our horses scared them but they attacked us argued conaire they wanted to fight fifty against five and we routed them without breaking a sweat arthur is right i remarked they were only searching out the land and we surprised them and now that we have shown them what manner of men inhabit this place we should not expect them to make the same mistake again bah conaire growled what do i care what you call it we beat the thieving barbarians let them try again and we will give them the same arthur shook his head gravely speed and courage saved us today conaire we should count ourselves fortunate to have escaped with our lives he swung himself from the saddle and walked to where the enemy warriors lay on the ground he stooped briefly over two or three of them and then called this one is still alive i will soon put that right conaire answered quickly jumping down from his horse no arthur said halting the irish lord let us take him back to the caer and see what we can learn from him conaire frowned we will get nothing from him let us kill him now and save ourselves the trouble of carrying him back however much i agreed with arthur i strongly suspected conaire was right one look at the strange features high cheekbones and narrow almost slanted eyes above a long thin nose and skin the colour of old ivory he seemed to have come from another world and i concluded that we would learn nothing of value from the injured man nevertheless we picked him up and slung his unconscious body across llenlleawgs saddle the irish champion shared gwenhwyvars horse and we made our way quickly back to rath mor where conaire summoned his druids informed them of the danger and then dispatched messengers to rally his lords and chieftains the barbarian was taken to one of the nearby round houses to be guarded until he awakened i have sent word to fergus to join us here conaire explained he and his folk will be safer in this stronghold than wandering around in the forest where the barbarians can get at them i do thank you conaire gwenhwyvar said your consideration will not be forgotten i do it for you lady he answered and for this husband of yours i tell you i like him well and mean to account myself worthy in his eyes that you have done already arthur told him which pleased conaire immensely then come into my hall the irishman said we will lift cups together and drink our fill my alemakers are champions of their craft and tonight may be the last chance we have to savour their subtle art come arthur come gwenhwyvar come myrddin emrys and llenlleawg let us drink to the health of our enemys enemies arthur took two steps towards the hall and stopped i would enjoy nothing more than to drink with you conaire he said but i think the enemy will not be celebrating tonight therefore i suggest we look rather to the defence of the people the irish kings face clouded we have done all we can conaire said stiffly what more would you have us do the enemy have yet to assemble their war host we will never have a better opportunity to attack but it will be dark before we can assemble our own battle host conaire pointed out better still replied arthur with a grin let darkness hide our numbers and let us strike them before they strike us come conaire we will carry the battle to them on the shore even while their ships are making landfall conaire hesitated he was not inclined to such tactics and distrusted them arthur understood his reluctance conaires experience of warfare was that of an elder time when kings met to wage combat in the morning and then rested and refreshed themselves to fight again in the evening breaking off at dusk to return to their strongholds arthur nurtured on ruthless necessity and desperate cunning had learned a keen and lethal shrewdness he never considered the battle without also assessing the shape of the war i never knew him to take the field without a thought to the next days battle and that was what lay behind his thinking now anything we could do to harry the enemy on this night would be to our advantage next time and as arthur knew we would need every benefit we could command i believe conaire sensed the wisdom of acting on arthurs counsel even if he did not fully perceive its source even so arthur did not coerce the irish king he coaxed he cajoled ah the sky is clear and the moon will shine bright it is a good night for a ride along the sea gwenhwyvar has told me of the beauty of the eireann coast i think i would like to see it by moonlight what say you conaire asked arthur will you ride with us by my fathers head lord arthur conaire replied you are a very man well then since we are going let us at least lift a cup while we wait for our companions to join us gwenhwyvar stepped between the two men and taking each by the arm turned them towards the hall well said conaire we will drink to the friendship of kings and then we will show this briton the delights of these favoured shores by moonlight by the time the sun set the first of conaires warbands had arrived the chieftains strode noisily into the hall to conaires acclaim he pressed cups into their hands drank with them and made much over our first skirmish with the vandal foe fergus and his people arrived last and cai and bedwyr with him arthur quickly explained what he had seen and described the encounter with the enemy where is this captured foeman asked bedwyr when he had heard the tale perhaps we should see if he is of a temper to speak to us as conaire was occupied with his lords arthur and i cai and bedwyr left the hall and went to the round house where the barbarian had been taken he lay on his side on the dirt floor of the house his hands and feet had been bound with a rope of braided leather he sat up and scowled defiantly at us as we entered the warrior guarding him acknowledged us and said he has made no sound since waking he just sits and glares like a sunsick lizard we will watch him now said arthur you may join your kinsmen in the hall the warrior departed eagerly and we stood for a moment looking at the captive tall nearly as tall as arthur he was thicklimbed and brawny his arms and legs were covered with small evenspaced scars his hair and eyes were black and he wore no beard or moustache indeed save for his head all the hair had been scraped from his body his thin faintly slanted eyes watched us sourly without interest arthur nodded to bedwyr who stepped before him questioning who are you vandal what is your name the captive merely curled his lip answer me and it will go well with you bedwyr said speaking slowly do you hear me the barbarian offered no reply neither did he give the slightest indication that he understood bedwyrs speech that is not the way to do it grumbled cai he stepped before the captive and thumping himself on the chest said cai i am cai he pointed a finger at the barbarians chest you he made the word a question and to my surprise the barbarian answered hussa he growled in a low voice hussa the groz you see said cai turning his head that is how but at that moment the barbarian pitched forward and rolled into cais legs knocking him to the ground bedwyr who was nearest leaped to cais aid pulling the captive off as cai kicked himself free bedwyr helped cai to his feet and the barbarian lunged away that was foolish cai said i will not make that mistake again what is he doing arthur said pushing past them he rushed to the captive and rolled him onto his back the barbarian clutched cais dagger in his bound hands he grinned viciously and spat in arthurs face you filthy cried cai diving towards him before cai could lay hand to him the barbarian turned the knife and plunged the blade into his own gut his eyes bulged with the sudden shock and then hands and arms shaking with the effort he forced the blade up under his own ribs and into his heart the savage smile became a rictus a tremor shook the body and the barbarian slumped back blood bubbling suddenly from his mouth his legs twitched and he lay still so observed bedwyr we will get no more from him now we learned his name at least cai said feeling the place at his belt why did he have to use my knife was it his name i mused looking at the strangers corpse i wonder we returned to the hall and told conaire what had happened it is for the best the irishman reflected he would no doubt have been unhappy to remain here any longer the first stars were shining in a skybowl of deep blue as we rode out from rath mor to meet the enemy host encamped on the shore we lay on our stomachs and gazed down upon the nightdark shore by the light of a bright half moon the easy roll of the sea upon the strand sounded like the breathing of an enormous beast and the campfires strung along the coast glinted and glimmered in a shimmering line into the seamisted distance other lights shone across the water where enemy ships rode at anchor still but forty ships and only half have come ashore observed bedwyr that is good oh that is very good muttered conaire i make it between four and six hundred warriors bedwyr continued less than a thousand anyway with as many more to follow said arthur why have they come here wondered cai be grateful that they are here i said grateful bedwyr scoffed would you rather they were in britain i asked bedwyr looked at me for a moment i did not think of that conaire rose to his feet i have seen enough let us begin we will strike the first camp said arthur pointing to the nearest of the campfires and you conaire will strike to the south there he pointed to the next cluster of fires up the coast create as much havoc as possible and retreat arthur said then we will assemble once more and strike again moving south down the coast fergus sat his horse at the head of his warband and waited holding the reins of our horses it is a good night for a battle he said drawing the air deep into his lungs i wish i were riding with you there will be opportunity enough for that in the days to come arthur told him the men of uladh numbered three hundred and thirty along with their five lords and all were mounted one hundred and fifty horsemen were placed under arthurs command and the same number under conaires it had been decided that a smaller warband of thirty would remain behind to maintain a rear guard and prevent an enemy force from circling round behind us that task had fallen to fergus gwenhwyvar and me the two warbands departed leading their horses silently down the cliff track to the strand below there they would remount and take up their attack positions once they had reached the strand and moved off we were to follow and guard our retreat arthur was determined that there should be no chance for the enemy to sound the alarm so he and conaire would attack at will and without warning when the last of the warriors had descended the cliff track we started down although the trail was steep and rough the moonlit path was easy to see and we had no difficulty making our way down the others had already vanished by the time we reached the strand i wondered that so many warriors could melt so quickly and quietly into the darkness we remounted and established a guard on the cliff trail and another a short distance along the shore then we settled ourselves to watch and wait our weapons in our hands i could see the enemy campfires stretching into the distance the nearest lay only a few thousand paces from where we waited and although i could not see any of the vandali in the darkness i could hear their voices the sound carried inland on the sea breeze a coarse broken speech harshly uttered and with this the clink and clatter of men making rough camp all at once there came a shout from up the beach brutally truncated in midcry a heartbeat later the invader camp was in turmoil shouts echoed along the cliffside i glimpsed the forms of horses moving against the firelight and the swift flashing glint of weapons as they rose and fell the darkness itself seemed to swirl and swarm as abruptly as it had begun the attack was over almost before the enemy could arm themselves the defenders had struck and vanished and before the alarm could spread to the next camp that camp too was under attack in this way the assault travelled up the coast away from us and we gradually lost sight of our warriors although the sound of the havoc they created continued long after they had gone still we watched and waited the night passed in a tense but idle vigil gwenhwyvar dismounted and walked a little way along the strand i joined her we walked a short while in silence eyes and ears straining into the darkness do not fret for him i told her he will be well fret for arthur i wish i were with him the sky was growing grey in the east when a call came from the clifftop above we turned to see a dark figure making its way down the cliff track lord fergus said the man running to meet us conaire has returned he is waiting for you and arthur asked gwenhwyvar betraying a shred of concern after all he has not yet returned the messenger replied you go myrddin fergus said i will wait here a little longer for arthur gwenhwyvar and i left fergus and ascended to the clifftop where conaire and his warriors were waiting exhausted and bruised from their nights work but jubilant i regret you were not there to see us the king said when you hear the tale you will rue your misfortune that you missed it oh it was a beautiful fight i tell you his battlechiefs agreed loudly the enemy runs away at the first sight of a horse some said and their leaders cannot command them others offered they hardly know how to use their own weapons the irish were ecstatic at their easy mastery of a much more numerous foe in this i saw arthurs genius at work he had designed this exercise not only to harass the enemy but to inspire the irish at the same time they had gained confidence in their ability to attack and rout the invader with small risk to themselves thus when next the two forces met the irish would hold themselves superior no matter how many foemen faced them across the line a pale white sun was showing above the eastern rim when arthur finally returned like conaire he had suffered no loss greater than his nights sleep unlike conaire he was far from jubilant he kept his distress to himself however until we were alone at rath mor what is troubling you arthur i asked as he had seemed illdisposed to talk on the way back i waited until gwenhwyvar had gone to bed before challenging him outright i do not like these vandali he said darkly conaire is very well pleased with them i remarked we sat at the far end of the hut the irish king had provided for their quarters gwenhwyvar slept in the bedplace behind the wattle wall yes granted arthur but the irish have little experience dealing with barbarians they think that because the enemy fears our horses he can be easily beaten what do you think i think they are waiting for their lord he has yet to come ashore when he does it will begin indeed but why would he wait arthur shrugged heavily who knows why the barbarians do anything their ways are past reckoning that is true i paused then asked the question foremost in my mind can the irish defeat them the high king of britain considered this for a long time before answering no he said at last shaking his head they are skilled horsemen and warriors he allowed but their courage is brittle and they are easily given to despair also they are wayward and contrary myrddin i swear it tell them one thing and they do another he paused but that is not what disturbs me most what then we cannot drive these invaders away without the aid of the british kings he said gloomily i finished his thought and british kings will never risk their lives and kingdoms to aid the irish they will sooner cut off their own arms than lift sword to defend ierne he muttered even so how long do you think the barbarian will content himself with this scrag of turf and rock when britain stands ripe for the plucking even the irish do not content themselves with raiding one another but ever and always leap across the sea to our fair shores when seeking easy plunder he had read the situation aright and i told him so aye he agreed grimly when the barbarian has plundered here he will turn greedy eyes towards ynys prydein pray that does not happen myrddin we have just put down the saecsens britain cannot survive another war seven wayward and contrary gwenhwyvar cried easily given to despair she charged into the room and planted herself before us fists on hips gwenhwyvar arthur said somewhat startled i thought you were asleep listen to the both of you she scolded i will tell you what troubles me shall i you haughty britons think you are the only men alive who know how to throw a spear calm yourself i did not mean began arthur you think you are the only men under gods blue heaven who know how to defend your land and people from enemy invaders you think enough woman arthur said rising to his feet i am sorry i did not mean for you to hear sorry gwenhwyvar stepped nearer her nose almost touching his chin sorry that i heard your scurrilous talk or sorry for what you said i feel the way i feel arthur told her growing angry i cannot change that what do you know you big stump gwenhwyvar pushed her face into his though she had to stand on toe tip to do it arthurs jaw bulged dangerously i know what i see with my own eyes are you blind then gwenhwyvar scoffed for a truth you know nothing of iernes people you know nothing of our courage you know nothing taken by fury she leaned too far and fell forward arthur redfaced and furious without a thought reached out took her elbow and steadied her quick as a flash gwenhwyvar snapped take your hand from me briton placed both hands against his chest and shoved him backwards caught offbalance arthur went down and gwenhwyvar supremely triumphant stormed out of the house arthur sat astonished for a moment then it is as i told you myrddin they are a contrary race and hasty and that is the end of it i put out a hand to help him up what will you do now i said ignoring the squabble we must return at once to britain he said we must raise the support of britains kings and persuade them to pledge warriors to the fight easier to persuade the invaders to turn their ships and sail away i replied you know them too well arthur agreed yet i see no better hope for ierne indeed it is britains best hope as well for if we can defeat the vandali here britain will remain unscathed i left arthur to his rest then and went in search of a place where i might sit alone with my thoughts i found a sheltered nook in the shadow of the wall wrapped myself in my cloak and settled down to contemplate the magnitude of the disaster that had befallen us oh it was a calamity and i knew it britain was newly united the alliance still soft it would harden in time given the chance but the british kings had suffered at baedun and they needed time to heal their wounds and rebuild their warbands even arthurs most loyal lords would view a war across muir eireann with cold eyes the irish had long been a thorn in the british flesh with their incessant raiding few britons would see the prudence of arthurs summons much less understand it and none would welcome it at the very least they would resist worse i feared they would turn against him and should worse come to worst the fragile alliance would shatter our hardwon peace would be but a memory and the kingdom of summer would die in its infancy it had long been all my care to aid that birth and the last thing i desired was to see that long and arduous and lifecostly work undone great light i would do anything anything to prevent that i thought long and hard and was drawn from my contemplation at last by the jangling clang of the alarm conaire like the chieftains of old had a strip of iron hung from a post outside his hall when need arose the iron was struck with a hammer and the people ran to answer the alarm stirring myself i rose and made my way to the hall among the scurrying uladh folk i saw cai with his distinctive hobbling gait hurrying across the yard and called to him he joined me and we walked together to the assembly place conaire stood with the hammer in his hands and a fierce look on his face the enemy approaches he shouted and began ordering the defence of rath mor where is arthur cai wondered looking around the crowd asleep i suppose youd best go wake him cai hastened away warriors were already rushing to arm themselves and take up defensive positions on the wall bedwyr and llenlleawg appeared what is happening bedwyr yawned trouble we are being attacked i answered reprisal for last nights raid no doubt where is arthur cai has gone to rouse him did he need rousing wondered bedwyr my eyes flicked to his face and then to where he was looking i saw arthur emerging from the round house doing up his belt and then i saw what bedwyr had seen gwenhwyvar face flushed emerging behind him her hair awry and her laces undone perhaps not i replied it appears he was already well roused llenlleawg smiled and bedwyr observed the barbarians will rue the day they called the bear of britain from his den arthur joined us and received word of the enemy advance calmly how many he asked conaire did not say bedwyr informed him arthur gave a nod to llenlleawg who dashed away at once and it came to me that arthur had begun trusting more and more to the irish champion not that he neglected cai and bedwyr mind but he now included llenlleawg in his confidence where there had been but two there were now three i wondered where gwenhwyvar would fit in this triumvirate still judging from what i had seen in the hut gwenhwyvar could speak for herself i had no doubt she would make a place for herself precisely where she wanted it she joined us now and took her place beside arthur how many she asked i have sent llenlleawg to determine arthur replied there was no trace of vexation or ire in either of them like a summer storm over loch erne it had all blown over without a trace leaving the sky brighter and the sun warmer than before the wind and rain conaire summoned his bards and chieftains to attend him and pushed his way into the hall the irish king was outraged that the vandal horde should appear at his gates they tracked us from the beach he shouted as we entered the hall he threw an angry fist in arthurs face the previous nights euphoria forgotten in the new days crisis this would never have happened if you had not attacked them now they have come here for their revenge arthur bristled at the kings accusation it was to be expected he replied coolly or did you think they would not march against you if you let them take your land this reply made conaire even angrier this is your doing i should have known better than to listen to a british tyrant on my fathers head i will not allow myself to be beguiled again conaire red hand it was gwenhwyvar in full cry it is a wicked thing you are doing stop it you disgrace yourself and i will not hear it fergus joined his daughter if not for arthur the enemy would have overwhelmed us before now the britons have faced barbarians before i say we listen to them he turned to arthur tell us what you would have us do i believe conaire felt some relief at having the decision taken from him in his heart he was secretly grateful to arthur for his superior battle cunning but lest his bards and lords account this a weakness he felt he must rant against arthur thus it was all bluff and bluster and there was no real wrath in it arthur did not wait to be asked again i say we move against them at once we must not allow them to establish themselves outside our walls or we will be trapped inside conaire drew himself up that is just what i was going to suggest myself it is good to see that the british battlechief agrees with me he turned to his lords we will assemble as before those of you who followed arthur last night will do so again the rest will follow me he turned back and regarded us with an imperious gaze when you are ready britons he said as if we were recalcitrant children the enemy awaits gwenhwyvar regarded him with an angry stare that swaggering butt of a man she said does he think he is emperor of rome to treat us this way she turned to her husband we should leave him to the vandali truly replied arthur watching as the irish lords noisily left the hall when they had gone we followed out in the yard the stablers and boys were saddling the horses and warriors strapped on armour and swords while their kinsmen scurried about on desperate errands gwenhwyvar went to fetch her arms and ready herself for battle arthur stood at the door of the hall and looked on the tumult for a moment then said if we live to see the end of this day myrddin i swear upon my sword that i will yet teach these irish some order the turmoil quickly abated however and we were soon ready all that remained was for llenlleawg to return with word of the strength and position of the enemy forces we waited growing anxious and apprehensive something has happened to him cai grumbled jabbing the end of his spear into the dirt not llenlleawg bedwyr replied he is too slippery an eel to fall foul of any barbarian net still we waited cai was for going after llenlleawg to discover for himself what had happened arthur advised against it he knows the hiding places in the land he will return when he can oh aye cai agreed aye i know but i would feel better for knowing the enemys strength and position so would i cai bedwyr said and trust llencelyn to bring us word in time cai laughed aloud at bedwyrs epithet and arthur chuckled llencelyn i asked why do you call him that it was a play on the irish champions name with the word for storm i saw the humour but was curious to hear bedwyrs reason for it meant they had begun to admit the irishman into the intimate fellowship enjoyed by arthurs cymbrogi you have seen him emrys we all know he fights like a whirlwind indeed cai concurred he is a very tempest gwenhwyvar joined us then all gleaming points and keen edges her mail shirt shimmered like a wet skin and the spike of her spear blade shone she wore a kilt of leather and high leather boots her hair was gathered and bound tight at her neck and like the warrior queens of her people she had daubed her face and arms with bright blue woad spirals stripes sunbursts and serpents she appeared fierce and beautiful almost lethally dangerous to behold i had never seen her so and remarked at my surprise in her transformation she took my astonishment for flattery you have never seen me lead a warband against an invader she replied but you are fortunate indeed myrddin emrys for this woeful lack is soon redressed lady bedwyr said i reckon myself fortunate that i do not have to lift blade against you and i can but pity the luckless wretches who do arthur deriving great pleasure from his wifes appearance grinned and put his hand to her chin he took a dab of woad onto his finger and applied it to his own face two slashes high on his cheeks beneath each eye allow me said gwenhwyvar taking some of the paint from her arm she put her fingertips to his forehead and drew two vertical lines down the centre of his brow in a stroke the bear of britain became a celt like the warrior kings of old who first faced the roman eagles across the ditch how do i look he asked cai and bedwyr were as taken with the transformation as i was and acclaimed it by demanding marks of their own i will have woadpaint made for all of us gwenhwyvar told them as she dabbed their faces from now on we will greet the enemy with the blue a shout came from the platform above the gate a rider approaches llenlleawg returns arthur said starting towards the gate as the gatemen hastened to admit the rider the sound of hooves reached us and a moment later llenlleawg pounded through the gap and into the yard he slid from the back of his mount and ignoring conaire and the irish chieftains who called out to him strode instead directly to arthur they want to talk to you llenlleawg told him do they indeed wondered arthur when and where on the plain llenlleawg answered now how many have come asked bedwyr a thousand and two hundreds at least maybe more while the others strove to take this in he added i think they have all come ashore now god save us bedwyr muttered under his breath twelve hundred to our three treachery for certain cai declared conaire arrived angry at being made to run to arthur for word of what llenlleawg had discovered am i to beg for every scrap from your table he demanded will someone yet tell me what is happening here they want to talk to us replied arthur simply by all means spat conaire let us talk to them our spears will be tongues and our swords teeth we will give them such a splendid conversation they say that if we do not talk to them llenlleawg continued they will rub us out and burn everything then they will strew the ashes in the sea so that nothing will remain if this is how they parley then we are speaking to the wind cai replied who told you this i asked llenlleawg how did you come by this message the lean irishmans face fell and he blushed with shame he drew a deep breath and confessed i was taken prisoner emrys how could this happen wondered fergus i alone am to blame i saw the foemen assembled on the plain and thought to ride close he paused i rode into a band of enemy chieftains scouting ahead of the host they were in the wood and i did not see them until it was too late why did you not fight them man demanded fergus i would have welcomed such a fight declared conaire let him speak shouted arthur growing annoyed they surrounded me llenlleawg said and before i could draw sword one of them began shouting to me in our own tongue he begged me to save my own life and that of my kinsmen by taking word back to our lords you did well arthur told him let us hope it is the saving of many lives it is a cowards ruse conaire announced they can have nothing to say that we care to hear no doubt allowed arthur judiciously still we will listen all the same listen let them listen i mean to give them words of my own to chew on boasted conaire he was becoming exasperated at finding himself pushed aside by this turn of events they want to speak to arthur alone llenlleawg told him they said they would only speak to the king who ordered the night raid fergus shook his head it is surely a trick he warned revenge for last nights attack cai agreed hear him artos fergus may be right we cannot allow you to meet them alone arthur made up his mind at once very well we will go out to them together he said then myrddin and i will advance to speak to them we mounted with the war host and rode to the wide grassy plain south of the stronghold where as llenlleawg had said the vandal horde waited the ground sloped slightly away towards the west rough and uneven with hillocks of turf and rocks a ragged little stream meandered through the centre of the plain dividing it from north to south we rode to the head of the plain and halted to overlook the battleground earth and sky bear witness bedwyr gasped when he saw the battle throng twelve hundred only it seems twice that many at least or i never drew sword the barbarians swarmed thick across the western half of the plain in untidy clusters around standards of various kinds some of skin others of cloth or metal but all of them bearing the image of a black boar in their design these were i decided their clan groupings like the saecsen the vandali entered battle surrounded by their kinsmen under leadership of their tribal chieftain continuing on we advanced slowly onto the plain at our approach a knot of barbarians drew apart from the centre mass crossed the stream and marched towards us one of the chieftains carried a standard the head and pelt of a great black boar fixed upon a pole the boars mouth was open his curving yellow tusks exposed we proceeded to within a hundred paces of one another whereupon the barbarian delegation stopped this is far enough arthur said stay here the war host halted and arthur and i rode on to meet the vandal chiefs like the others we had seen they were big wellmuscled men they carried the heavy wooden shield and stout black spear naked to the waist they wore either leather leggings or coarsewoven cloth breeches their flesh was the colour of pale honey or aged parchment and to a man their hair was black they wore it long and braided thick several had thin moustaches over their wide mouths but most did not none wore a beard their eyes were strange sly and narrow slanting upwards in their broad brutal faces keen and wary and set deep under heavy brows made more mysterious by a thick band of black paint slashed across their wide cheeks a tall lanky man stood with them his skin was milkwhite and his hair the colour of flax on his neck he wore a thick iron ring with slightly smaller bands on each wrist ragged scars of vicious slash marks livid still marked the flesh of his chest and stomach it was this man who addressed us speaking in our own tongue in the name of amilcar war king of the vandal nations we greet you he said it is amilcars war host you see before you it is by his hand that you are alive this day by way of reply arthur said it is not my custom to exchange greetings with any who threaten war against me or those i have sworn to protect the tall man replied with benign indifference i understand lord touching his neck ring he said i am often made to bear tidings others find offensive since you are a slave i will assume that the words you speak are not your own therefore i hold no enmity towards you the slave said nothing but inclined his head slightly giving us to know that arthur understood his predicament aright what is your name friend i am hergest he said and though i am a slave i am a learned man as you are a latin speaker arthur said are you also a holy man i own no king but the lord christ high king of heaven hergest answered proudly formerly i was a priest the barbarians burned our church and killed our bishop along with many of our brothers the rest were made slaves i alone survive at this the slave lifted his hand as if presenting the barbarian company to us instead he said you may speak freely they understand no tongue but their own have you been long with them i asked it is three years since i was taken hergest replied you must have proven your value to them many times over i observed indeed replied the slave i must prove it anew with every day that passes for i know i will not outlive my usefulness by so much as a single breath one of the bigshouldered barbarians grew impatient with the talk and grunted something to hergest who answered him in his own tongue ida says you must come down from your mount if you are to speak to him hergest paused allowing himself the shadow of a smile they fear horses greatly tell him arthur replied calmly patting the horses neck that i will come down from my mount but only to speak to one of my own rank and authority arthur i whispered have a care the slave started arthur he asked in surprise you are artorius also called the bear of britain i am known by that name arthur answered indicating the staring barbarian he replied now tell them what i said hergest repeated arthurs refusal to dismount and to my surprise the barbarian simply nodded conceding the situation with placid acceptance he and several others began discussing the matter between them one of themwho seemed to be the youngest of the chieftains spoke earnestly to hergest who pointed at arthur and gravely intoned the words artorius rex imperator the chieftain called ida cast a dubious sidelong glance at arthur then turned abruptly and began striding across the plain to where the horde waited that was well done lord hergest told us they wished only to make certain that you were a king worthy of treating with their own leader mercia here he nodded to the young chieftain thinks that because you are young like him you must be a warrior of little worth or consequence i assured them that you were greater even than the emperor of rome arthur smiled you might have restrained your enthusiasm for my sake still i will try not to make you out a liar the barbarian chieftain had reached the battle host he addressed someone there and then turned and pointed at us a moment later a figure emerged from the mass and walked towards us the first chieftain fell into step behind this person with two standardbearers on either side the man was even taller than those around him a champion of imposing stature with wide heavy shoulders a powerful back and thickmuscled limbs like those around him he watched us with quick intelligent dark eyes above high cheekbones all but obscured beneath a wide band of black paint a thick moustache flowed over fleshy lips and a long black double braid hung over one shoulder in his right hand he carried a slender iron rod with the image of a boar in hammered gold at its top at his approach the other barbarians moved aside each man striking his chest with the flat of his hand as his lord passed he came to stand before us whereupon arthur dismounted hergest standing between them said something in the guttural speech of the vandali then turned to arthur and said lord arthur the man you see before you is amilcar war king of hussa rogat and vandalia the barbarian king raised his iron rod and placed his left hand upon the golden boar he grunted something to hergest but his eyes never left arthurs as you are called the bear of britain the slave explained the mighty amilcar desires that you shall call him by the name his enemies have learned to fear what is that asked arthur twrch trwyth answered hergest black boar of the vandali eight why are you here arthur asked his voice calm and steady as his gaze the slave hergest spoke arthurs words to the vandal king who replied impassively twrch would have you know related the slave that he has heard of the deeds of the british bear and has given command that your realm should not be destroyed at this time for the black boar is also a mighty war leader and it is a sorrowful waste of wealth when two such champions fight amilcar spoke some more and hergest continued twrch asks you to consider his elation when he learned the bear of britain was here it is difficult to imagine arthur replied amiably tell twrch trwyth that i am waiting to hear why he has seized land belonging to another he has taken land for his camps nothing more does he intend to stay hergest consulted the barbarian warlord and answered twrch says he intends to plunder the land until he has enough wealth to continue his journey does his journey have a destination i asked the learned slave we have come from carthage hergest explained the emperor of great constantines city sent soldiers to banish the boar and his people from the land they have held for many generations so now they search for another home however their departure was made in haste and they came away with nothing thus they require wealth to continue the search i see replied arthur and does he expect this wealth to be given to him the boar king and his slave conversed a moment whereupon hergest answered twrch says that in honour of your renown and the great esteem in which he holds you he will not kill you and ravage this weakly defended island a deed he could easily perform since the vast number of warriors you see before you are but the smallest part of his war host and more are coming here even now twrch says it is a very great gift he offers you in return for this kindness he expects you to make a gift of equal value for he has vowed to destroy both eiru and the isle of britons unless you grant his desire arthur stared implacably at the massive battlechief what is his desire hergest turned to amilcar and conveyed arthurs question the barbarian replied with a grunt everything hergest reported he says you must give him all to his everlasting credit arthur allowed the vandal chief no support for his greed nor any hope that it would be rewarded neither did he provoke the barbarian with an outright refusal he turned his eyes to the sky as if pondering the inconstant clouds as you know these lands are not under my authority replied arthur at last i could not give you a grain of sand or blade of grass much less anything else i know a man of your rank will understand this he paused to allow his words to be translated for the boar king when hergest turned back to him arthur said therefore i will take your demand to those who hold authority over this realm though i do not believe they will grant it arthurs reply was delivered with such confidence and dignity the boar king could not but agree take my demand to the rulers of this realm amilcar conceded through hergest if when the sun stands over the battleground i have not heard their reply then i will attack and you will all be killed like dogs well i observed as we rode slowly back to the waiting battle host together we have gained a span of time at least let us use it wisely was he telling the truth do you suppose wondered arthur does he really have more warriors on the way difficult to say i replied no doubt we shall see i expected conaire and the irish lords to greet the vandals demand with the contempt it deserved and i was not disappointed everything conaire hooted i say they will have not so much as the breath in their nostrils when we have finished let the battle begin at once they will get nothing from my hand but the sharp end of a spear it is not what you will give them arthur said it is what the enemy has given us he has given us nothing but the outrage of his assault must we also endure the insult of his absurd demands conaire glared at arthur and at me why the vandal battlechief has given us the victory this day arthur replied for he has allowed us to determine how the battle will proceed and i tell you that is worth the small insult we began discussing how best to make use of the boon we had been granted conaire grew impatient with the talk this makes no sense he complained we have horses and they do not i say we attack them and ride them down when they flee we all know they will not stand before our horses bedwyr put him straight with all respect lord conaire there are too many of them while we attacked one warband the others would quickly surround us it is four of them to every one of us mind we would soon find ourselves unable to move at all horses or no then let us form the line conaire suggested we will charge them and drive them back to the sea with the points of our spears nay lord cai replied our force would be spread too thin we could not sustain the line they would have only to sever it in one or two places to separate us once divided they would easily overwhelm us what then demanded the irish king his brittle patience shattering at last as you rightly say they fear nothing more than our horses arthur told him if we hold to the course i will devise that fear will become a weapon we can wield against them at once arthur began ordering the fight in full view of the enemy we laid our battle plan while the black boar stood looking on waiting the sun rising higher and hotter all the while when he had finished arthur said i will speak with twrch trwyth now while we are together you will lead your warbands into position but they will see us fergus suggested would it not be best to surprise them another day perhaps replied arthur this day i would have them ponder their predicament and let foreboding grow within them arthur and i returned to where the vandal battlechiefs waited amilcar not at all happy to be made to stand idle while we talked at length scowled at us arthur did not dismount but spoke to him from the saddle making the boar king squint into the sun he growled something at us and hergest said amilcar demands to know your answer the lords of ierne say that you shall have nothing from them but the sharp end of the spear arthur replied hergest smiled at this and relayed arthurs words to his master who glowered even more fiercely then you will all be killed the vandal said through his slave your settlements and strongholds will be burned and your women and children slaughtered your treasure will be carried off and your grain and cattle also when we have finished not even your name will remain when hergest finished the vandal lord added i know these are not your people and though you have refused my gift i will yet extend my hand to you bear of britain join with me you and your men two such mighty war leaders in alliance could win much plunder i care little for war and less for plunder thus i cannot accept your offer arthur answered yet for the sake of those who own you lord i will make you an offer in return take your men and go back to your ships leave this island as you found it taking nothing with you but the sand that clings to the soles of your feet if i do this what will i receive if you do as i say you will receive the bear of britains blessing further i will bid the priests of my realm to make heartfelt prayer to the high king of heaven who is my lord to forgive any crimes you have committed in coming here amilcar recoiled at the suggestion can i fill my treasure house with these prayers he sneered who is this lord of yours that i should heed him your offer is a mockery and worthy only of contempt so you say arthur replied equably even so i do not withdrawn just then one of the vandal chiefs attending twrch grunted at him calling his attention to the movement of our warriors the boar king turned to see our force divide itself in threea main body with two smaller wings to the right and left these advanced and the central body withdrew so that it was well behind the protecting wings amilcar barked a stream of commands and questions to his chieftains they answered with shrugs and worried looks whereupon he turned to arthur what is this he demanded speaking through hergest why do you array yourselves for battle in this way this is to help you understand arthur replied that we mean to defend our land and people if you would steal from us you must be ready to die these last words were spoken with the cold certainty of the tomb the vandal kings face darkened his eyes narrowed he looked again at the odd battle formation he spoke a few words to hergest then turned and walked back to his waiting horde lord twrch says that he has talked enough from this day he is deaf to all entreaties expect no mercy none will be granted we sat our horses and watched the vandal chiefs withdraw arthur waited until they had almost reached the stream and rejoined their warbands and then yah he slapped his mount and raced towards them they turned to the sound of hooves saw the horse thundering down upon them and scattered arthur swerved at the last moment and snatched away the boars head standard from the grasp of the astonished vandal holding it none of the enemy knew what had happened until arthur was already galloping away again he rode out of spearthrow stopped and lofted the standard here is your god he shouted at them then slowly so that every eye would see and there could be no question of his intent he lowered the standard and drove it head first into the ground the vandali did not take this desecration calmly as the boars head touched the earth an enraged cry went up but arthur ignored them and turning serenely away rode back to where our warriors waited leaving the boars head standard in the dirt behind him the enemy roared the louder that was well done cried fergus as we rejoined them hoo cheered conaire by lughs right hand you are a rascal lord arthur he gestured with his spear towards the vandal host listen to them oh they are angry with you but do you think it wise to provoke them so wondered gwenhwyvar it is worth the risk i think answered arthur how else could i be certain they would be drawn to the centre it is a good ploy i told him let us hope it works the infuriated enemy did not wait to be further disgraced they loosed a resounding shout and rushed forward splashing across the stream they came in a reckless heedless swarm running into battle it had been a long time since i sat a horse in battle i had vowed never to fight again but i felt the sword hilt in my hand and the old familiar thrill quivered through my spine well it would do no harm to fight today i reckoned besides every blade was desperately needed thus without considering the consequences i found myself in the forerank of the battle host i watched them draw nearer my heart quickening i heard the enemys feet pounding a dull drumbeat on the earth and saw the sun hard on spear shaft and shield rim i looked along the line of our own warriors our swift ala the horses hoofed the ground and tossed their heads the sundering shout of the enemy making them skittish to the right cai sat at the head of his wing of fifty opposite him to the left bedwyr waited with his fifty both wings angled inward to force the enemy in towards the centre they ran over the rough ground screaming as they came gwenhwyvar at my right hand looked across to me i have never fought beside arthur she mused is he as canny as they say they do not tell the half of it lady i replied i have fought beside uther and aurelius and they were warriors to make others pale with envy but arthur far outshines his fathers on the unfriendly field she smiled with admiration yes this is what i have heard the lord of hosts formed arthur for himself alone i told her when he rides into battle it is a prayer and when he fights asked gwenhwyvar delighted with my acclaim of her husband lady when arthur fights it is a song of praise to the god that made him watch him now you will see a rare and holy sight conaire sitting opposite me on the other side of gwenhwyvar heard our talk and turned his face to me if he is such a fierce warrior he scoffed why do we sit here waiting for the foemen to overwhelm us a true warrior would meet their attack if you doubt him i said then by all means join the host of vanquished saecsen who thought they knew something of war join the angli and jutes and frisians and picti who belittled the bear of britain speak to them of your superior wisdom if you can find any who will hear you closer and closer the enemy came only a few hundred paces separated us from them now i could see their faces black hair streaming mouths agape in savage howls how long must we wait demanded conaire loudly some of the irishmen muttered agreement with their lord let us strike hold countered arthur hold men let them come let them come llenlleawg sitting at arthurs right hand in the front rank turned in the saddle to face conaire shut your mouth he hissed you are scaring the horses fergus at arthurs left hand laughed and the irish king subsided with an angry splutter the enemy fully expected us to charge them they were prepared for that but they were not prepared for us to stand waiting the nearer they came the more time they had to think what was to happen to them and the more their fear mounted within them hold arthur called stand your ground the vandali reached our outflung wings as arthur anticipated they did not know what to make of the wings and so ignored them in their drive to take the centre i could almost see what they were thinking it showed in their faces surely now they were thinking the bear of britain will make his attack and then we will swarm him and pull him down but no he waits why does he delay does he fear us they rushed past the wings and surged on in a wave closer and yet closer i could see the sweat on their shoulders and arms i could see the sunglint in their black eyes i felt a thin trail of fear snake through my inward parts had arthur misjudged the moment great light there were so many and then arthur raises his sword caledvwlch shimmers in his upraised hand he leans forward in the saddle still he hesitates the vandal enemy is wary even in their greedy rush they are watching they know he must charge they brace themselves for the command but it does not come they are drawing swiftly closer but the command does not come why does he delay why does he hesitate i can see the doubt in their eyes they are almost upon us but arthur has made no move the sword hovers in the air but it does not fall why does he delay the enemy falters all eyes are on arthur now it is a slight alteration of gait a small misgiving their step is now uncertain doubt has seized them in its coils they waver this is what arthur has been waiting for caledvwlch falls like fire from heaven it falls hesitation ripples through the enemy forerank passing backward through the floodtide the signal is given and the enemy braces for the impact still we do not charge we make no move towards them confusion bewilderment the signal has been given but no attack comes what is happening what does it mean oh but the trap is sprung they do not see it their doom has come upon them and they do not know it cai slashes in from the right bedwyr on the left thrusts forward the two wings are now jaws with teeth of steel snapping shut the outwitted barbarians turn to meet the unexpected attack and are instantly divided half turn one way and half another the centre is exposed this time there is no hesitation caledvwlch flashes up and down in the same swift instant and then we are racing forward flying into the soft belly the enemy host has revealed the hooves of the horses bite deep flinging turf into the air we shout the vandal host hears the cry of our warriors it is the ancient war cry of the celt a shout of defiance and scorn it is a strong weapon and we are flying towards them i feel the wind on my face i can smell the fear coming off the enemy warriors i can see the blood throbbing in their necks as they stumble backwards the centre collapses the onrushing vandal tide is turning those in the rear force their way forward even as the forerank folds inward upon itself the horse glides beneath me it undulates slowly and i am pan of its rolling rhythm i see a barbarian turn to meet me a black spear rises the sword in my hand sweeps down and i feel the fleeting resistance as the body before me falls away another enemy appears he leaps forward jabbing upward with the spear my blade slashes and the man spins away clutching his head i hear his scream and suddenly the clash of frenzied chaos around me slows dwindling down and down to the barest movement languid and listless and slow my vision grows hardedged and keen as the battle awen seizes me i look and see the battlefield spread before me the enemy upon it moving as if in a torpor their hands swing in lazy languid strokes the spearblades edge cautiously through the air the vandal faces are rigid their eyes fixed unblinking their mouths hang open teeth bared tongues lolling the battle sound throbs in my head it is the roar of blood pulsing in my ears i move into the crush and feel the heat of striving bodies my arm strokes out its easy cadence my dazzling blade sings out an unearthly melody i smell the sicksweet smell of blood after long absence i am myrddin the warrior king once more nine i move like a stormdriven ship through the tide enemy rise before me a massive seaswell of warriorflesh breaking upon the sharp prow of my blade i hew with fatal and unforgiving accuracy death falling swiftly as my unswerving sword blood mist gathers before my eyes crimson and hot i sail on heedless of the tempestwaves of foe up and up they rise and down and down they fall death rakes them into heaps of twitching corpses before my highstepping steed the spears of the enemy seek me i have merely to judge the angle of thrust to turn aside their feeble jabs every stroke follows a leisurely contemplation in which my mind traces the arc of each movement and the next and the next no wasted motion no effort unrewarded i kill and kill again if death ever wears a human face this day its face is mine the barbarian foreranks cannot stand before us nor can they retreat they are too tightpressed from behind to give feet to their flight with cai and bedwyr forcing the sides into the centre and the centre caught between the onrushing horses and their own rear guard still pushing in from behind the enemy can but stand to our cruel killing blades eventually the advance slows the surge falters and the tide begins to turn the foe is flowing away rear ranks first the front ranks feeling the sustaining wall behind give way fall back the battleline breaks the invaders turn and flee the field leaving their dead and dying heaped upon the earth they run screaming crying their fear and frustration to the unheeding sky they run in shameful disarray without thought for their wounded kinsmen they simply abandon the battleground and all upon it in their flight i leap after them exulting in triumph my victory song resounds across the plain the foemen give way before me stumbling in their haste to save themselves i drive on and on lashing my horse to speed and then arthur is beside me his hand on my sword arm peace myrddin stop it is over the battle is finished at his touch i came to myself the battle frenzy left me i felt suddenly weak drained my chest hollow my head throbbed and i heard a sound like the echo of a mighty shout receding into the heavens or perhaps into realms beyond this world myrddin arthur gazed at me concern and curiosity sharp in his iceblue eyes pay me no heed i am well stay here he ordered urging his horse away the pursuit is outpacing us i must call the warriors back go i told him i will remain behind our warriors gave chase as far as the stream but there arthur called off the pursuit lest the enemy regroup and surround us then he returned to the bloodsoaked battleground to deal with the wounded and dying barbarians what should we do with them bear asked bedwyr he was scratched and bleeding in several places but whole arthur gazed across the corpsestrewn field crows and other carrion birds were already gathering their raw calls foretelling a grisly feast artos bedwyr asked again the wounded what will you have us do s put them to the sword kill them cai raised his head in surprise for the love of christ arthur bedwyr began we cannot do it arthur snapped turning away cai and bedwyr regarded one another with grim reluctance conaire saved them from having to carry out arthurs order i will do the deed and gladly the irish lord volunteered he called his chieftains together and they began moving among the fallen a sharp bladethrust here a short chop there and silence soon claimed the battleground sure it is a hateful thing cai observed sourly rubbing the sweat and blood from his face with his sleeve their own kinsmen would do the same i reminded him and they expect no less better a quick painless end than lingering agony bedwyr gave me a darkly disapproving look and stalked off quickly gathering up our own wounded our losses were uncommonly light we left the field and returned to conaires stronghold my head still ached with the beating throb of the battle frenzy and every jolt of the horse sent a spasm through me gwenhwyvars voice stirred me from my selfabsorbed regard did you see him she asked her voice low who i wondered without looking up it was very like you said she replied but i could not have imagined it would be so so splendid i turned my head wincing at the pain gwenhwyvar was not looking at me but at arthur a little distance ahead her skin was glowing with the sheen of exertion and her eyes were alight no i did not see him i told her simply her lips curled with the hint of a smile and she said i do not wonder that men follow him so readily he is a wonder myrddin he must have killed three score in as many strokes i have never seen the like the way he moves through battle it is as if he were tracing the steps of a dance oh yes it is a dance he knows well and caledvwlch she continued i believe it is as sharp now as when the battle began my blade is notched and bent as a stick but his is fresh still how is it possible the weapon is not called caledvwlch for nothing i told her she looked at me at last but only to see if i were mocking her she turned her gaze to arthur once more repeating the word softly it means cut steel i added it was given him by the lady of the lake charis she asked none other i replied my mother may have given him the sword but the way he uses it his uncanny skill that is his own i have seen llenlleawg fight gwenhwyvar reflected when the battle frenzy comes upon him no one can stand against him well i know it i replied recalling the irish champions extraordinary ability to turn himself into a fighting whirlwind the battle frenzy grips him and llenlleawg loses himself she continued but with arthur i think it must be the other way he finds himself i commended her perception a most astute observation lady in truth arthur is revealed in battle she fell silent then but the love and admiration in her gaze increased it is the way of women sometimes when the man they know so well surprises them to exult in their discovery and cherish it gwenhwyvar hoarded her discovery like a treasure we rested through the day delivering ourselves to the care of those who had remained at rath mor we ate and slept and roused ourselves at dusk to celebrate the victory we had been granted by then men were thirsty and hungry and wanting to hear their feats lauded in song we ate and drank and listened while conaires bards vaunted the achievements of the warriors praising one and all with highsounding words cai bedwyr and arthur were mentioned of course but among the kings involved conaire shone like a sun among so many lesser lights though his part in the battle was actually quite small this chafed the britons are we to sit here and listen to this uncouth noise cai demanded the third bard had just launched into a lengthy retelling of the battle in which the irishmen featured most prominently and the british received no mention they are telling it all wrong myrddin they only praise their king i replied he is the one who feeds them well they praise him too highly bedwyr put in and that is not right they steal the high kings glory and dish it out to conaire and his brood llenlleawg complained do something lord emrys what would you have me do it is conaires right they are his bards and this is his caer after all the three desisted then but maintained an aggrieved and peevish silence thus it did not surprise me greatly when as soon as the bard finished his laudatory song a shout went up from cai friends he said leaping to his feet we have enjoyed the singing of irish bards as much as we are able he said tactfully but you would think us britons a tightfisted and greedy race if we did not tell you that beneath this roof sits one whose gift in song is owned as one of the chief treasures of ynys prydein he turned and flung out a hand to me and that man is myrddin ap taliesin chief bard of britain is this so wondered conaire loudly he was feeling the heady effects of flattery and drink and it made him wonderfully expansive then let us share this treasure you have been hoarding sing for us bard of britain sing everyone began pounding on the table and calling for a song bedwyr rose and borrowed a harp from the nearest bard he brought it to me show them he whispered placing the harp in my hands show them what a true bard can do i looked at the instrument considering what i might sing i looked at the boisterous throng redfaced and loud in the clamour of their cups such a rare gift should not be wasted on the unworthy i thought and passed the harp back to bedwyr thank you i told him but it is not for me to sing tonight this celebration belongs to conaire and it would be wrong for me to diminish the glory he has rightly won bedwyr scowled rightly won are you mad myrddin if there is any glory this night we have won it not conaire he offered the harp to me again and i refused again earth and sky myrddin you are a stubborn man another time bedwyr i soothed we will have our night let it be this way for now seeing he could not persuade me bedwyr desisted returning the instrument to its owner with a shrug cai gave me a look of supreme disapproval but i ignored him since it was clear i would not sing and since no more songs were forthcoming the celebration ended and men began drifting off to their sleeping places just before dawn the next morning arthur sent cai and bedwyr with a small warband to the coast to observe the movements of the vandal host we had slept well and rose to break fast i observed the haughty confidence of conaires warriors they swaggered and laughed loudly as they sharpened blades and mended straps and i remarked on it to arthur give them one simple victory and they think they have conquered the world he smiled grimly they think it will always be so easy still i will not discourage them they will learn the truth soon enough yet when bedwyr and cai returned they said the boar and his piglets are leaving truly wondered conaire it is so lord replied cai most of the ships have gone indeed added bedwyr only a few remain and those are even now sailing from the bay then it is as i thought conaire crowed they were only looking for easy plunder when they saw we meant to fight they took their search to other shores gwenhwyvar who had come to stand beside arthur turned to him what do you think it means he shook his head slightly i cannot say until i have seen it for my self as quickly as horses could be readied we rode to the clifftops overlooking the bay and gazed out on a calm bright sea speckled with the black sails of departing vandali ships the last had left the bay only a short while before we arrived and were following the others sailing back the way they had come you see cried the irish king triumphantly as if the sight vindicated him in some way they will not soon forget the welcome they received at conaire red hands hearth i see them leaving fergus replied thoughtfully but i am asking myself where they are going that is what i am wondering too said arthur and i mean to find out he turned quickly and summoned llenlleawg to him they spoke quietly the irish champion nodded once mounted his horse and rode away we returned to rath mor and spent the day resting and waiting for llenlleawgs return i slept a little in the heat of the day and woke to a scattering of low clouds and a freshening wind off the sea the caer was quiet as i made my way towards the hall bedwyr called to me as i entered the yard myrddin he rose from the bench outside the hall and crossed to me quickly i have been waiting for you arthur asked me to bring you as soon as you stirred has llenlleawg returned no he replied and i think that is why arthur wishes to see you i turned towards the hall but bedwyr caught my arm conaire is there and he has had too much to drink cai is keeping watch inside bear is in his hut we walked quickly to the hut arthur and gwenhwyvar shared bedwyr ducked his head and pushed through the ox hide covering bear i have brought he began then halted abruptly and backed out the door again quickly i heard gwenhwyvar laugh and arthur called out it is all right brother there are no secrets between us bedwyr glanced at me and muttered not any more come in urged gwenhwyvar come in both of you it is all right the laughter in her voice reminded me of my own ganieda and the memory pierced like an arrow through my heart ganieda best beloved we will yet be together one day bedwyr and i entered the hut gwenhwyvar was tying her laces and rearranging her clothing her hair was tousled and her smile was full arthur was reclining he raised himself on his elbow and offered us places on the hidecovered floor you might have told me to delay a little bedwyr said blushing lightly and you might have announced your arrival arthur replied with a laugh dear bedwyr gwenhwyvar said softly there is no hurt and hence no blame be easy llenlleawg has not returned arthur said not yet bedwyr gave his head a slight shake it is as i feared then you do not know him gwenhwyvar began he will arthur did not let her finish it is not llenlleawgs welfare that concerns me i know full well that he is more than match to any trouble that finds him but if the invaders had simply sailed away he would have returned by now i think it likely the vandal host has come ashore again farther south and if amilcars boast about having more warships waiting he left the unsettling thought hanging in the wisdom of warcraft arthur had no equal likely he was right i might have asked him how he had arrived at this conclusion but i accepted it instead saying what do you propose conaire must ride south at once to renew the defence i will return to britain and raise the war host will they agree to fight do you think wondered bedwyr they have no choice arthur said bluntly how long will the island of the mighty remain secure with the rampaging boar just across muir eiru i agree bear all saints bear witness your words are prudence itself bedwyr affirmed but prudence is a virtue in short supply among the bullnecked british lords as you well know it may be that they will require something more to convince them i agreed with bedwyr but arthur remained confident in his ability to reason with the lords of britain and win them to the campaign we leave at once the ship must be readied i pointed out i have already sent barinthus ahead with some of fergus men arthur said bedwyr fetch cai bedwyr rose and paused at the door what of conaire i will tell conaire what is to be done arthur answered allow me gwenhwyvar offered you must not delay or the tide will be against you go now i will explain to conaire she saw the question in arthurs eyes and said spare no thought for me my love i will be well besides llenlleawg will soon return arthur rose the matter was concluded and he was eager to be gone very well we waited in the yard as our horses were made ready fergus and cai emerged from the hall it is better we were gone cai told us that conaire is itching for a fight and i fear he will have one before this day is through you go fergus said leave conaire to me i know him and i will see no harm is done i leave it to you then arthur said swinging himself up into the saddle do what you must but be ready to ride south as soon as llenlleawg returns i will send men and supplies as soon as i reach caer melyn fare well my love gwenhwyvar said arthur leaned down and gathered her in a quick embrace and we then rode from rath mor and hastened towards the coast the ship was waiting when we arrived and the tide was already flowing wasting not a moment we boarded the horses slipped the line and pushed off once into the bay barinthus raised the sail and the ship took wings back to britain ten we entered mor hafren as soon as it was light and came within sight of the hills surrounding caer melyn for two nights and a day barinthus and his crew had wrested speed from contrary and fitful winds to reach the trail to arthurs southern stronghold as the sun broke the horizon in a blaze of red and flaming gold once more in the saddle we flew through shadowed valleys blue with hanging mist by the time we reached caer melyn i could feel the heat of the day to come and i felt something else a stab of foreboding sharp and quick my senses pricked at our approach the gates of the fortress were thrown open wide and as the others entered the yard to the acclaim of their sword brothers i paused before passing the threshold there was a cloying closeness in the air a stillness that stifled and seemed to me more than just the early warmth of a hot summer day it was as if an enormous suffocating presence unseen as yet though near was shifting its immense weight towards us thickening the air around it as it came i could feel the ominous advance as that of a silent squall line of storm cloud drawing over the land but there were no clouds nothing could be seen yet despite the glad greeting we received from the cymbrogi my heart remained troubled by this strange feeling of oppression arthur wasted not a moment even while he washed and pulled on clean clothes he called commands to his battlechiefs he sent riders to make for the realms round about to summon all the nearest lords to council and ordered ships to take word to the north gwalchavad ever eager to plough the sea fields led the shipborne messengers they departed the caer at once and were gone before the sound of their greeting had faded in the air arthur then commanded the cymbrogi to ready the remaining fleet there were provisions to load weapons to assemble horses to gather in from the grazing lands as once more the dux bellorum prepared for war i had little part in the preparations my place was with arthur in council and i readied myself in the best way i knew to receive the southern noblemen i prayed arthur thought the warbands would rise to his call but i knew it would take more than a polite request to move british kings to pursue a war on irish soil this of course i tried telling arthur but he would not hear it and i tell you myrddin it is either fight the boar on irish soil or fight him here blood will be spilled either way i do not deny it we can at least save the destruction of our lands i do believe you however the lords of britain will want a better reason i insisted to fight shoulder to shoulder with those who have dealt them so much heartache through the years that is past and forgotten we are an unforgiving race arthur i continued we have long memories or have you forgotten he did not smile at my meagre jest they will listen to me he maintained his confidence brooked no opposition they will listen yes they will sit down and discuss the matter until the cock crows but will they act will they raise so much as an eyebrow to aid you in what every last one of them will regard as a quarrel between barbarians indeed most of them will think it divine punishment on the irish for their thieving and warring ways it was clear that arthur would not hear it so i stopped telling him i took my leave and left him to his plans stepping from the hall i nearly collided with rhys arthurs steward hurrying away on some errand or other ah rhys there you are i have been looking for you i give you good greeting emrys he replied quickly and asked is it true we are joining the irish in a boar hunt yes i answered and told him the boar we were hunting was human then i asked where is bors a message came two days ago from ban rhys explained bors was summoned home trouble i think so but bors did not say what it was he only said he would return as soon as he had seen to his brothers affairs have you told arthur this no he answered i have been running since you arrived and well tell him now rhys looked past me into the hall yes at once we will talk again later when he had gone i slung my harp upon my back and walked out from the caer and down to the little taff river to find a shady place to sit and think in the shaded valley down among the green rushes i sat myself upon a mosscovered rock and listened to the water ripple as it slid along the deepcut banks bees and flies droned on the lifeless air and water bugs spun in small circles on the slowmoving water there with the ancient elements of darkness earth and water i cast my net of thought wide come to me i whispered to the air come to myrddin illumine me illumine me i sat bent over the polished curve of my harp as if i might pluck the knowledge i sought from the songladen strings with my fingertips but though the harp gave forth its quicksilver melody i was not enlightened after a while i put the harp aside and took up my staff instead it was i reflected a venerable length of rowan the stout wood smoothed with use bedwyr had made it for me following my ordeal with morgian the thought brought a fleeting twinge of fearlike the shadow of a circling crow touching my face i pushed the hateful memory from me however and gradually felt the peace of the valley like its deep still warmth enfold me i fell into a waking sleep a reverie and i began to dream i saw the mountains of celyddon darkclothed in their sharpscented pines and beyond them the barren windy heathlands of the little dark ones the hill folk i saw the members of my adopted family the hawk fhain i saw gernyfhain the wise woman of tie hills my second mother who taught me the use of powers even druids have forgotten if they ever knew thinking on these things i let my mind wander where it would i heard the riversound the gentle ripple of water lapping and the dry twitch of grass where a mouse or bird passed i heard the click of a moorhen and the sawing buzz of a fly these sounds faded away slowly replaced by the rasping hiss of a whisper broken by time and distance but gradually growing stronger words began to form dead deadbut what do you mean how can it be no no the anguished voice faded away in a stifled scream and was replaced by another i am burning i cannot see lie down garr i will help you do not try to stand i heard a childs voice crying wake up nanna wake up the small voice dissolved into sobs and was mingled with other cries which grew into such a wailing and shrieking that i felt their distress as a keening lament my soul writhed in sympathy tears came to my eyes and yet no hint of what was happening or where great light comforter of all who mourn and are heavyladen sustain those who need your strength in the day of their travail this for the sake of your blessed son so be it i prayed and remained silent for a time but the voices did not return and i knew they would not now come again i had some times heard voices in the past and now as then it did not occur to me to doubt their veracity that i should hear them did not surprise me it merely confirmed once again the capricious blessing of the awen thrice blessed is the emrys of britain it is the blessing of my mothers race to make me longlived just as it was the blessing of my father singing the very life into my soul which awakened the awen the blessing of jesu called me forth to serve in this worldsrealm oh but i am a wickedly slothful servant dimsighted and slow of understanding preferring my warm dark ignorance to wisdoms cold light when men speak of myrddin emrys in years to come if they should remember me at all it will be as a blind beggar the fool in the courts of kings the simpleton whose ignorance was exceeded only by his pride i am not worthy of the gifts i have been given and i am not equal to the tasks those gifts beget high king of heaven forgive me there is no truth but it is illumined by you great light though i see i am a blind man still lord christ have mercy on me so the river ran and so ran my thoughts the mind of man is a curious thing seeking knowledge i was confronted with my own ignorance i could but admit my poverty and embrace mercy instead the first of the summoned lords had arrived with his warband by the time i returned to the caer ulfias whose lands were nearest was with arthur in the hall they sat at table together with cai bedwyr and cador attending ulfias looking grim and uncertain lifted his head as i entered but did not rise arthur glanced up grateful for my arrival ah myrddin good i thought to send the hounds after you he turned to rhys hovering nearby fill the cup as rhys produced a jar arthur continued i have been telling ulfias about the vandali invading ierne having taken the measure of ulfias i looked the wavering lord in the eye and demanded well then will you support your king the young lord swallowed hard it is a very difficult thing to be sure he muttered i would like to hear what the other lords say cannot you determine your own mind my question shamed him he actually winced lord emrys he said in a disconcerted tone is it not to be decided in council what the council agrees to do that will i do you have my pledge a pledge is but a paltry thing i scoffed and if the council decides to bare its bottom and sit on the dung heap will you do that as well cai and cador laughed beware warned bedwyr under his breath you go too far but arthur said never fear ulfias it may not come to that but if it does no doubt you will enjoy the close companionship of your friends oh arthur was astute though he made light of my remark he would allow ulfias no dignified means of retreat the dubuni lord was caught in his own indecision he must remain unmoved and endure the scorn or redeem himself come ulfias cador urged amiably let us support our king as we have sworn to do and who knows we may grow to love ierne ulfias swallowed his pride and said very well if the women there are all as fair as gwenhwyvar i may even take an irish wife i do not wonder that you say so cai told him solemnly i have seen the dubuni tribe and you could do worse than choose an irish maid if you can find any who would have you ulfias smiled doubtfully this gentle taunting was better than my mockery so one more lord was added to our number cadors loyalty was beyond question indeed he would not allow arthur to humble himself by asking what he was more than willing to give outright cador holding caer melyn in his lords absence had sent word to his battlechiefs within moments of arthurs return the others we might have counted on idris cadwallo cunomor and the lords of the north would not receive word for many days meurig however arrived at dusk and brastias the following morning accompanying brastias was a kinsman a young nobleman named gerontius whom the elder lord was grooming for command ogryvan of dolgellau and his neighbour lord owain arrived at midday bringing with them their sons vrandub and owain odiaeth who in this season of peace following the saecsens defeat had been given charge of their fathers war bands arthur welcomed the noblemen and gave them food and drink no sooner were they settled than urien rheged arrived with his warband and suddenly the caer was overflowing with warriors we will begin now arthur decided what about the other lords wondered bedwyr a day or two more and they will arrive you will need them i cannot wait any longer every day we delay means another day of plunder for twrch trwyth so saying arthur invited the nobles into the hall with their warriors and began the council even as the welcome cups were filled and passed your swift answer to my summons gladdens me arthur declared standing before them at the board be sure that i would not have asked you to attend if the need were not already sharp i will keep nothing from you the reason for the summons is this the barbarian horde of one twrch trwyth has invaded ierne and i fear that island is lost if we do not rally to her aid a small enough loss it seems to me observed brastias sourly cador was quick to respond to this impertinence you speak brastias like one who has never had to defend a coast against marauding sea wolves what have the irish ever given us but the point of a spear if we were foolish enough to turn our backs to them brastias demanded sooner aid the barbarian i say and have done with the irish for once and all for myself put in ogryvan laying aside his cup i have lost much to eirus thieves he looked at arthur even so i give my support to the king if it will secure the safety of my coast well said lord ogryvan arthur commended him that is the price i will demand for britains aid from what i have seen of the black boar the kings of ierne will pay that price and gladly he told them then of our encounters with the vandali and warned know this amilcar has vowed to destroy britain as well as ierne unless we stop him there we will see our own homes burned and our kinsmen slaughtered the lords sat in contemplation arthur had put the matter before them plainly what would they do meurig was the first to speak this is a most distressing report and i could wish it came at a better time he stretched a hand towards arthur we have only just defeated the saecsen our provisions are depleted and god knows our warriors could use a season of rest trouble knows no season brother old ogryvan growled he raised his head and looked around the gathering i am with you arthur he said my warriors are your own owain sitting next to ogryvan added his support our sons must soon rule in our places he said let them fight beside our war leader as we have done and learn the true cost of peace you will not regret your decision arthur told them and turned again to meurig you have heard your brother lords what say you the lords of dyfed have ever stood beside their war leader in battle meurig glanced sideways at brastias we will support our high king to the last man brastias did not like this insinuation he glared the length of the table clearly the deliberations had taken an unexpected turn he did not want to appear less willing than his peers neither did he want to aid arthur well brastias the high king asked what is it to be if they see fit to lend aid in exchange for peace brastias allowed stiffly then i will not withhold it but should this venture fail i will hold you to blame that was brastias true to nature already shedding responsibility and he had not even mounted horse nor drawn blade arthur let the remark pass and turned to ulfias you have heard the others he said do you take back your word or keep it well done arthur i thought make the wavering prince declare himself before the others give him a place to stand yes but make certain he stands when the time comes ulfias seemed to shrink in upon himself i will keep my word he said glancing up quickly his voice barely audible of the assembled lords only urien rheged had yet to declare himself all eyes turned towards him come urien ogryvan urged let us hear your pledge of all the lords i knew least about urien he was a raw young man bigboned and brawny with long hair wild like a lions mane and dark watchful eyes and a brooding mouth gave him a shrewd almost devious appearance i had heard he was a lord of rheged one of ennions kinsmen the estimable ennion had been wounded at baedun hill and died a day or two later no doubt urien fought in that battle too i do not remember but urien rheged held his kinsmans place now and i found myself wondering what kind of man he was young certainly even i think younger than he appeared he masked his youth with the kind of gravity older men sometimes possess he was given to few words which made him appear wise and took his time answering which made him seem thoughtful when at last he spoke he said for myself i am sick of warring let the irish feel the fire now i say we have felt it long enough this was said with great weariness as if he himself had borne the brunt of more battles than could be told but since my brothers deem it best to aid this campaign i am willing he paused again and looked around to see if all eyes were on him then drawing himself up he announced urien of rheged will do his part his heart was not in it but honour bound him to pursue a repugnant course at least that was the impression he meant to impart and others i noted were persuaded by it arthur struck the board with the flat of his hand good he said his voice filling the hall then it is settled we sail for ierne as soon as men and supplies can be assembled within moments the peace of the stronghold dissolved in the highpurposed commotion of a battlehost on the move rhys and the small troop under his direction busied themselves through the day and into the night with the daunting task of loading wagons and moving weapons and supplies down from the caer to the ships after the third or fourth course of wagons had departed bedwyr came to me there is not enough food he announced bluntly or anything else come to that it is as meurig said we need a season of peace to fill our storehouses and granaries i do not see how we can fight on nothing does arthur know god love him bedwyr replied shaking his head as long as there is a drop left in his cup he thinks there is enough for everyone evermore that was true arthur who had never owned anything outright for himself had as little regard for the ebb and flow of wealth as for that of the tide leave the matter with me i told him i will see that arthur is apprised but it was not until the next day when the last of the warriors were boarding and the first ships were already poling their way out into deeper water that i found opportunity to speak to arthur alone the council went well he said pleased to be moving again did it i noticed you did not tell them how many vandali stood against us the lords may have second thoughts when they see the size of the barbarian host arthur dismissed my qualms with a toss of his head so i turned to the concern uppermost in my mind bedwyr tells me we do not have enough provisions to feed the war host no he glanced at me to assess the gravity of the problem well we will raise all we can here and obtain whatever is lacking in ierne he concluded simply the irish kings will support us that was on the face of it a logical solution and we had no better choice in any event very well i replied but we must inform conaire as soon as we arrive he may need time to raise enough tribute the return voyage was maddeningly slow the winds of summer can be fickle in any event but these were mere breezes sighs that billowed the sails one moment and died away to nothing the next all day long arthur urged his doughty pilot to make haste only to be told in the same dry uncompromising tone that unless the king could wring wind from a calm sea and cloudless sky he must be satisfied with what little speed he got in the event we all took a turn at the oars fully three days later we passed through the narrows and rounded the northern tip of ierne and half a day after reached the bay from which the enemy fleet had fled there were of course no ships to be seen there so we continued south along the coast searching the innumerable nameless coves for the black ships at last at last we sighted the vandali fleet massed in the centre of a sheltered bay high up the west coast arthur almost beside himself with impatience ordered the ships to make landfall a little to the north out of sight of the vandali fleet no sooner were the men horses and supplies ashore than the ships put out to sea again there were too many britons to cross all at once so the ships must make a second voyage to bring the rest of the men and whatever additional provisions rhys had obtained as soon as his horse was on dry land arthur was in the saddle leading the war host inland do you know where you are going bear asked bedwyr as we created the sea bluffs and began descending to the wooded lowlands arthur thought the question foolish i am following the black boar of course should we not rather be looking for gwenhwyvar and fergus arthur did not bother to turn his head to answer the black boar is ashore now and where he is to be found there we will find the defenders find them we did the irish war host his own queen among them at the end of a long shallow valley with their backs to a rocky escarpment surrounded on three sides by the screaming barbarian swarm eleven must i be everywhere at once arthurs cool blue eyes sparked quick fire as they played over the battleground where the surrounded irish were fighting for their lives by the hand that made me someone will answer for this caledvwlch came ringing from its sheath at his side he lofted the great sword raised himself in the saddle turned to look behind him and gave a mighty shout for christ and glory a heartbeat later the flight of dragons thundered to the attack our war host was divided into three arthur led the cymbrogi bedwyr led the western bands and cai those of the south at cadors horn blast we swept down into the valley as one separating into our contingent groups only at the last so that the enemy could not anticipate where we would strike the vandali emboldened by early success and hopeful of an easy victory over the illprepared irish had not posted a rear guard arthur anxious to divert the foe and they were so easily diverted drove down upon them with all the tumult at his command the enemy heard the sound turned and lost all expectation of victory one look at flight upon flight of mounted british warriors sweeping down upon them and they fell into confusion the battle suddenly shifted front to back the vandal foreranks with their guiding battlelords were trapped behind the press of their own men and those in the rearward ranks more lightly armed found themselves facing a ferocious attack with no one to lead them slashing with spear and sword we thrust into the midst of the foe reckless in our attack the cymbrogi raised their battle cry making as much noise as possible to announce their arrival and divert the black boar i saw the fearful expressions on their broad faces as they turned on stumbling feet weapons slack in their hands and pitied them they were so illprepared even so i knew they would have killed us all without remorse heavyhearted i struck we all struck the killing blows driving them down and running them over the screaming of those frightened dying barbarians was bitter to hear a vandal battlechief appeared before me he drew back his great shield and swung it slashing edgewise at the horses head and neck i pulled back hard on the reins lifting my mounts forelegs off the ground the animal was well trained to battle a hoof lashed out catching the foeman on the chin his head snapped back with a crack and he sank like a stone beneath the onrushing wave of battle i felt a hand on my sword arm glancing down i saw a warrior clutching my arm and clawing desperately for a better grip i threw the reins to the side the horse wheeled away and the clinging warrior was lifted off his feet and thrown through the air to land hard on his back he made to rise but could not and fell back fainting the force of our charge carried us deep into the vandal battle cluster surrounded by frightened confused enemy warriors we drove deeper still hacking our way through them blood mist rose in our eyes the pungent sweetness of warm entrails assaulted us i let my horse have its head and smashed through the enemy with the flat of my shield striking here and there with my sword as opportunity allowed the killing was easy there was no glory in it not that there ever is though when two skilled warriors meet and prowess alone decides their fate there is a kind of honour in the contest the vandali lacked skill but tried to redeem this lack by the force of numbers this might have worked for them in the walled cities of the east and on less able defenders but it would take more than numbers alone to overcome the battlewise cymry since twrch could in no way mount a counterattack he had no choice but flight the fight was short and sharp and sent the enemy howling in rage back down the valley we pursued as far as we dared but arthur was wary of carrying the pursuit too far lest we become ensnared while cador and meurig guarded against the enemys return the cymbrogi liberated the irish clearly we had arrived at the most providential moment the irish defenders were exhausted they stood swaying on their legs barely able to raise their arms most of their horses were dead and far too many warriors gwenhwyvar stood at the forefront of the irish her shield riven and her clothing filthy and bloodspattered at her side llenlleawg wildeyed his mouth flecked with foam gripped the remains of a splintered spear bloody at both ends greetings husband gwenhwyvar said as we rode into their midst she lifted an arm and drew her sleeve across her forehead smearing gore and grime her sword was ragged and notched i would we had devised a better welcome for you lady arthur said gently the sight of you whole is welcome enough are you hurt no gwenhwyvar said shaking her head frustration and humiliation making her voice hollow i am only sorry you were obliged to rescue us not half as sorry as you would be if i had not arthur replied how did this happen he looked around his relief quickly giving way to anger where are the other irish lords he demanded the question was apt i saw only those defenders we had left behind and far fewer of those than before where were the others conaire had vowed to rally there are none fergus shouted angrily he lurched to where we stood and leaned on his spear breathing heavily there are none because conaire would not ask cai was mystified for the love of god man why not conaire thought to vanquish the vandali unaided gwenhwyvar explained giving an involuntary shudder of disgust he would share the glory with no one fergus continued bitterly least of all a briton arthur turned to confront conaire who stood glowering at us a short distance away is this true the bear of britain demanded the irish king drew himself up i will not deny it he growled and i would have defeated them too but for the treachery of my own battlechiefs treachery treachery cried fergus i call it prudence we were being cut down like timber where we stood i counted on you to attack conaire argued your thoughtless retreat cost us the battle it was retreat or be slaughtered fergus insisted enough gwenhwyvar snarled both of you perhaps you did not see how many vandali stood against us fergus charged perhaps you thought the black boar would turn tail and run away when the mighty conaire crobh rua appeared conaire growing red in the face shouted it was you who turned tail and ran away mallacht deair fergus spat on the ground silence roared arthur the two sputtered and subsided never said arthur speaking deliberately and low so that only the chieftains would hear disgrace yourself before men who must follow you in battle we will speak of this in private i advise you to gather your wounded and return to your stronghold before the vandali recover their courage conaire turned on his heel and stalked away fergus glowered at him and then moved off gwenhwyvar said i am sorry arthur it was against my will that we allowed ourselves to be party to this calamity arthur supplied the word for her gwenhwyvars eyes sparked quick fire but she swallowed bent her head and accepted his judgment i hold myself to blame she offered shame making her meek i should have prevented it someone should have prevented it arthur agreed curtly we will rue the loss of these warriors he said gazing around at the carnage his mouth a hard thin line a cruel wastethe more since it was pointless he turned again to his wife and demanded what were you thinking gwenhwyvars head rose i am sorry my lord she whispered there were tears in her eyes only then did arthur relent he turned away from her and began ordering the cymbrogi to bury the dead and remove the wounded i stepped close to gwenhwyvar he is angry with conaire and he i began no she stopped me pushing the tears away with the heels of her hands he is right she drew a deep breath steadied herself and turned to the task at hand she picked up her sword and asked is he always right i offered her a smile no i replied gently but he is rarely wrong the stronghold was an abandoned hillfort which conaire had found in lands long neglected rockbound and hilly the soil thin and unproductive it had been many years since any irish lord had laid claim to the realm there were few settlements and those were not large all the better for the black boar it provided him a safe haven from which to raid more prosperous lands to the north and this conaires negligible presence notwithstanding he had proceeded to do during our absence the vandal warlord had successfully carried off cattle and plunder from the nearby smallholdings and had destroyed the strongholds of three noblemen as well most of the irish had fled north and east out of harms way this in itself was unfortunate for if they had gone south they might at least have alerted the southern lords to the invader as it happened the better part of twelve hundred vandali warriors now lay between us and direct passage to the south effectively cutting off communication with any support we might receive the rickety fort was not large enough to house the gathered british warbands so they were forced to make camp outside the stronghold below earthen banks while the kings of ynys prydein saw to the crude comfort of their men arthur held council with fergus and conaire in the ruined barn that passed for a hall in that place most of the roof thatch had blown off and part of one wall was collapsed but the hearth was intact and the board and benches were serviceable enough so we sat over our cups in the hall listening to fergus recount all that had transpired since we were last together arthurs face grew darker and his eyes harder by degrees as fergus explained how the matter stood after the debacle of conaires defeat arthur was in no humour to view our plight in any but the harshest light the bear of britain scowled taking the news in grim and prickly silence for his part conaire had grown suitably contrite he wore his chagrin like a battered crown his back bent under the weight of disgrace and his head drooped in sympathy with his shoulders he had not breathed a word since returning from the battlefield tomorrow arthur said with controlled and quiet fury we will undertake to hold the invader in the valley and prevent him from making any more raids or moving farther into the land and you conaire crobh rua will take three of your best men and ride to rally the southern lords the irish king nodded glumly but said nothing go now arthur commanded this matter is ended conaire rose and looking neither right nor left walked slowly from the ruined hall you crushed him bear bedwyr said when conaire had departed he will recover arthur grumbled which is more than can be said for many of the men who trusted him with their lives better the slap of a friend observed fergus than the stab of an enemy arthur turned cold eyes on fergus and you he said in a tone of tight restraint will ride to the settlements round about if any are left intact to raise tribute for us we have had to come away with only what we could carry and there is not enough food or drink to sustain us it will be done fergus rose and walked out pausing at the threshold for a moment to say i never was so glad to see a man with a sword in his hand as when i saw you today arthur ap aurelius i thank you he ducked his head through the door and disappeared my father is right gwenhwyvar murmured if not for you we would all be dead now it is god you must thank arthur told her if the winds had been contrary or a storm had raised the waves or if i had chosen to spend the night in my bed rather than in the bottom of a boat he looked at his wife considering the implications i thank god you are alive he said we are fortunate indeed gwenhwyvar leaned close took up his sword hand and pressed it to her lips well i know it husband she whispered well i know it the british lords having settled their men began arriving in the hall just then gwenhwyvar kissed arthur quickly rose and departed her fingers lingered along the line of his shoulders as she passed behind him cador sat down beside arthur you did not tell us that there were so many barbarians he chided if i had told you arthur replied easily you might have found it more agreeable to stay home at least i would have had a bed cador drew a hand through his hair and rubbed his face these vandali are certainly strangelooking creatures one of fergus men appeared with more cups and jars of ale he proceeded to fill and distribute the cups among the lords as they sat down where is their homeland wondered meurig arthur invited me to answer they have come from carthage where they have lived for many years i replied the emperor of the east has driven them from that place and so now they search for new lands and plunder as they go you know this truly mused owain they have with them a slave a priest named hergest who speaks our tongue arthur answered he has told us the little we know but who are they demanded ogryvan and who is their king they are a northern race i answered led by one amilcar who styles himself twrch trwyth the black boar of hussa rogat and vandalia he is a rapacious lord whose greed is exceeded only by his vanity we talked of this for a time and then the conversation turned to the lack of any worthwhile irish presence the british kings were sharply critical of the circumstance and allowed their opinions free rein they decried the catastrophe on the battlefield i would have welcomed a little more support from the irish ogryvan suggested delicately support sneered brastias even my cowherds are better able to defend themselves can they not be bothered to protect their own lands hold brastias bedwyr warned they know their mistake arthur has dealt with them the matter is ended the lords stared uneasily into their cups and it was only when the haunches of venison appeared and men began to eat that tempers eased still it was not a good beginning the lords trusted arthur yes and for now were content to extend that trust to include the irish but for how long that was the question concerning me taking the matter into my own hands i left the lords to their repast and went in search of conaire i found him sitting with three of his chieftains beside a small fire i did not wait to be greeted may i join you i asked conaire raised his eyes and i glimpsed genuine surprise in his expression sit he said you are welcome here bard he returned his gaze to the fire i decided a clean cut was best arthur holds no ill will for you conaire i told him but we cannot drive the invader from the land without the aid of the southern irish you must see that now conaire nodded glumly i know what happened i continued drawing him out you saw how easily arthur repelled the first attack and you thought it would be the same with you that i did replied conaire staring into the fire well there is no shame in it i said some of the best warriors the world has ever seen have tried their hand truly wondered conaire glancing up hopefully truly i answered solemnly the grave mounds are full of saecsen war leaders who thought they knew how to best arthur caught the irish king squirmed is he a god then that he never puts a foot wrong in battle no arthur is a man i assured him but he is not like other men when it comes to a fight the ways of war are meat and drink to him conaire his skill is like to the genius of a bard and a bard of battle conaire sniffed in mild derision i paused checking my anger mock me conaire i do not mind but the men who died under your command today deserved better do i not know that his voice was anguished i sit here with my head in my hands and it is all i am thinking then while you sit there add this thought to your thinking you may not like the britons a true word there muttered one of the irish chieftains even so i allowed arthur has risked much to bring those britons here i do not say you should like it but you should be grateful at least conaire shrugged but said nothing his insolent silence angered me think i demanded which is easier raising a warband and sailing to a foreign land to engage a fearsome enemy or remaining secure in your own realm and enjoying the fruit of your reign the four of them stared dully at me tell me if you know contempt dripped from my words you make it more than it is conaire insisted weakly so i challenged if it is a matter of such small consequence then tell me this which of you would do the same for him conaires eyes shifted to one and another of his chieftains and then back to the fire none of them made bold to reply suddenly sickened by the irish kings misplaced pride and selfishness i wanted nothing more to do with him rising at once i bade him consider well my words then i removed myself from that miserable company great light they are but children breathe on them the breath of wisdom strengthen their hearts and souls for in the heatrage of battle we need not children but men twelve we met amilcar and his horde the next day in a narrow valley beside a lake the foe displayed a guile not seen before instead of simply overwhelming us with their numbers they split the main body of their force into three divisions and attempted to draw and separate the british defence it was clumsily done however and arthur easily avoided the trap the attack confined and constricted by the steep sides of the glen quickly collapsed and the invaders withdrew in all haste in this they showed freshly acquired wisdom the black boar is growing canny cai observed watching the vandal host streaming from the valley they are learning respect bedwyr suggested llenlleawg overhearing the remark said they are learning cunning it will not be long before they overcome their fear of our horses pray that does not happen arthur replied our ships will arrive soon and if conaire succeeds in rallying the south irish we may have a large enough force to defeat the boar and his piglets or drive them back to the sea our ships did arrive later that day bringing the remaining men and horses but only a fraction of the provisions we required i am sorry lord rhys apologized as we stood looking at the scant heap of provisions stacked on the shingle men slogged ashore through the shallows leading horses or carrying weapons i swear it is all i could raise if i had had more time to range farther he paused i am sorry where is the blame arthur asked i find no fault with you fret not rhys but it is a shameful portion for men who must fight true the king agreed but added optimistically still it may be enough if the campaign is short oh aye rhys said eyeing the meagre heap doubtfully if we conclude the conflict tomorrow or the day after the supplies will last that long at least we did not fight twrch the next day nor the day after although we did keep close watch on the enemy arthur set scouts in a wide ring around the vandal encampment and charged them with reporting even the smallest movement day or night requiring them also to bring back any game for the pot when for the third day the black boar again refused to take the field arthur grew suspicious why does he wait arthur wondered what can he be thinking he must know that the longer he delays the stronger our forces grow and indeed conaire arrived the following day with five irish kings and their warbandsover nine hundred men in all though less than half were mounted this brought the number of defenders to nearly two thousand in all arthur was well pleased with the southern lords support unfortunately they seemed to have come emptyhanded expecting food and supplies to be provided by the britons i commend you conaire arthur said hailing him loudly and with praise in the hearing of his brother kings you have richly increased our numbers i do not doubt that with such support as you have won we will soon drive the foe from your lands and it had best be soon indeed gwenhwyvar added we have but one days feeding for our own warriors and not even that if we must share it with all conaires smooth brow creased in concern and the gratified smile faded from his lips is this so he swung accusingly towards arthur i thought you would bring food supplies with you i brought all i could raise arthur answered the peace of ynys prydein is but newwon the war was long and our storehouses and granaries are empty still besides continued gwenhwyvar severely this is not britains fight do you expect the britishfolk to feed us as well as fight for us she cast him a withering glance see here conaire tight fist you must open that wormeaten trove of yours and part with some of your treasure conaire rolled his eyes and puffed out his cheeks the wealth of the uladh is no concern of yours woman he sputtered why are there no deer on the hills nor fish in the lakes if we are fishing gwenhwyvar replied arching a pretty eyebrow dangerously we cannot be fighting or is it in your mind to frighten the vandali away by waving fishnets at them she whirled away imperiously denying conaire any rebuttal ach but she is a sharptongued terror the irishman muttered if she were not also a queen he glanced at arthur and left the thought unfinished the southern lords drew near just then and conaire squared himself and straightened it is simple truth i suggested and plain as our need we lack food as this is your realm conaire we must look to you to supply it conaire still smarting under the lash of gwenhwyvars rebuke did not wish to appear niggardly under the watchful gaze of noblemen from connacht and meath he drew himself up full height never fear he said expansively stand back and watch what i will do there is no lack when conaire red hand is near i leave the matter with you arthur said he turned to the southern lords and greeted them then presented himself saying i am arthur king of the britons and the man with me is myrddin emrys chief bard of lloegres prydein and celyddon to be sure the names of arthur and the emrys are not unknown among us one of the kings replied i am aedd of clan ui neill kinsman to fergus i am and it is my good pleasure to greet you arthur king of the britons my men and i are at your service and yours to command then he inclined his head in a slight bow of respect turning to me he said but there is surely some error here you cannot be that emrys renowned in story i had thought you full of years yet here i see but a shaveling youth aedd spoke with such simple grace and goodwill that both arthur and i found ourselves warming to him at once do not let appearances deceive lord aedd the old man of the stories and myself are one aedd expressed his astonishment then it is true you are a very prince of the otherworld my people wear our years more lightly than most i cannot deny it but while we live we walk this world and not another i told him so in the name of the one who made us all i am pleased to greet you the remaining four now pressed in eager to be recognized by us aedd to conaires vexation took it upon himself to introduce his fellow kings diarmait eogan of the ui maine ulan and laigin all four young men and strong at ease with themselves and with their men confident in their abilities each displayed an easy wealth they wore brightcoloured cloaks redandblue striped broom yellow and emerald green their torcs were huge gold bands of twisted coils which together with their rings and bracelets could have kept a governors household their boots and belts were good leather and the swords on their hips fine steel long and sharpedged the five displayed an easy assurance to match their wealth i did not begrudge it them yet i was mindful that conaire for all his confidence was woefully ineffectual still i thought if swagger alone could prevail against the vandal horde we would not have to put hand to sword each of the irish chieftains deferred to arthur acknowledging his renown and placing themselves under his command aedd and laigin darkhaired handsome men seemed particularly earnest in securing arthurs good favour this pleased and gratified arthur nor did it pass conaire unnoticed as this natural warmth began to flow between arthur and his irish brothers conaire grew increasingly tightlipped and aloof we dined together that night british and irish together noblemen all and though the meal was far from sumptuous it became a feast in the glow of newkindled friendship the irish kings ceaselessly plied the british with questions about hunting and riding battles won and lost matters of kingcraft and kinship they professed themselves delighted with all they learned for their part the british were pleasantly surprised by their irish companions most of the britons had come harbouring longstanding resentment if not hostility towards the irish as i have said they or their fathers had fought irish raiders too many times to think well of them and conaires poor showing and worse manners had not altered opinion for the better for arthurs sake alone they had come not from any goodwill towards the inhabitants of ierne now however seated sidebyside along the weathered board with a hole in the roof and the summer stars looking down the british lords like arthur before them found genuine affection springing up between them and the irish chieftains nor was it drink making them feel that way we had only enough to wet our tongues with a welcome cup and the supply of ale was exhausted rather was it the inborn charm of dedannans children their graceful flattery beguiled and enchanted like their music which along with nearly all else they stole from ynys prydein years agotheir words spin and dance in beautifully intricate patterns delighting both ear and soul how they talk it is like the angels surely cai chuckled entranced by the lightness of their speech they spin fine wool bedwyr agreed only you must not let it droop over your eyes cai he was reluctant to give himself to them wholeheartedly having grown to manhood on britains western coast bedwyr had bloodshed to balance his opinion laigin sitting across from bedwyr overheard the remark for shame he said his smile wide and comfortable is it to bruise my heart that you speak so i fear for you friend bedwyr answered readily if your heart is so easily bruised life must be a perpetual injury to you laigin laughed i like you bedwyr and had i a drop left in this cup of mine i would drink the health of britains bright avenger he raised his empty cup cradling it in both hands to the most noble warrior who ever drew sword or lofted spear bedwyr resting his elbows on the board allowed himself to be cozened by laigins flattery it seems to me you need nothing in your cup bedwyr replied for words alone suffice to cheer you he is drunk indeed cai observed dryly if he thinks you the most noble warrior under this roof again i am wounded laigin declared placing his hand over his heart well bedwyr allowed i suppose we must offer some remedy for this injury laigin leaned forward eagerly at that i saw that we had come to the kernel of the young lords concern and also how adroitly he had directed the conversation to his own ends allow me the honour of riding beside you in battle tomorrow laigin said eager as a boy for his fathers approval if that would console you bedwyr began it would encourage me wonderfully well laigin put in quickly then so be it bedwyr raised his hand in assent if you ply the blade half as well as you employ your wit we shall be the most feared warriors on the field of battle cai gave a little snort to show what he thought of the notion up spoke aedd from two places away and i realized he had been following the conversation closely overhearing every word let them console themselves with their pitiful belief if they can brother cai he said take no heed only allow me to ride beside you and we will show one and all what can be accomplished by men who know the sharp end of a spear well said my irish friend replied cai slapping the board with his palm let the foe beware and friend as well said bedwyr they then fell into an amiable dispute about who should fare best in the next days combat and boast gave way to boast i looked beyond them down the length of the board and saw the remaining british and irish nobles headtohead in equally agreeable discourse with arthur and gwenhwyvar ruling over this affable assembly gently encouraging the newborn concord to deepen and thrive great light may brotherhood succeed send your sweet spirit to soothe the hurts and grudges of former days when at last we rose from the board and made our way to our beds it was as if we had all discovered kinsmen closer to us than the blood kin left behind of all present conaire alone was in no a better humour and disposition when he stood up than when he first sat down the serpent of jealousy had its sharp tooth in him and began to gnaw with the warriors assembled and ready and food supplies short we did not wait for the black boar to attack again but carried the battle to him though still woefully outnumbered arthur determined to make the most of the fear and confusion caused by our horses proposed another night raid throughout the day guided by the reports of our spies we established positions in the low hills encircling the vandal encampment by stealth like a great stalking cat we slowly silently gathered our strength for the assault as the sun dipped below the rim of the horizon we were ready to pounce darkness came eventually but even when nights cloak overspread the valley the sky remained light arthur crouched in the dusky shadow of an elm on the flank of the hill idly plucking grass from the turf and watching the enemy campfires i crouched beside him strung out along the hilltops all around the camp unseen in the twilight our warriors awaited arthurs signal the night was still we could hear the sounds of the camp below as they prepared the evening meal the clink and clatter of cooking utensils the murmur of voices around the fire the common sounds of ordinary life innocent in themselves the vandali were human creatures after all more alike in their ways than different i did not choose this arthur murmured after a time his thoughts were running with mine amilcar did i reminded him you gave him the choice did i he spat out a blade of grass he had been chewing after a while the moon rose shedding a soft silver light over the valley a chill crept into the air as the warmth of the land gradually cooled in the absence of the sun behind us ready growing anxious for the fight our warriors fidgeted the need for still watchful silence chafing them still arthur waited the moon made its slow stately way across the skybowl and little by little the sounds of the enemy camp diminished keeneyed in the night arthur crouched mute and immobile as a mountain yet i sensed in him an inner agitationor did i only imagine it regardless it seemed to me that he warred within himself doubting the wisdom of the course he pursued and so he hesitated sensing his thought i said softly the battle plan is sound it is but the waiting makes you doubt it he turned his face to me i could see his eyes hard and bright in the moonlight but i do not doubt it he replied then why do you hesitate if i hesitate he replied it is from certainty not doubt our raid will succeed he returned his gaze to the valley and peered into the darkness like a seaman trying to fathom an unknowable depth strange cause for concern i observed trying to comfort him somewhat i tell you the truth myrddin he said and though he spoke softly i heard the iron edge to his words i fear this victory for i cannot see beyond it he paused and i thought he would not speak again but after a moment he went on streams of consequence flow from every action and from every conflict there are two paths by which events may go always before i draw sword in battle i look ahead to see which path may offer the better resolution and i move the battle towards that path if i can he paused again and i waited letting him come to it in his own time tonight he continued at last tonight i look but i cannot see where either path may lead and that frightens you yes it frightens me then i am greatly encouraged i confessed are you indeed he regarded me closely once more i am i told him for it tells me you are but flesh and blood after all arthur ap aurelius though some have begun to think otherwise i saw his teeth glint white in the darkness as he smiled he rose abruptly reaching down to help me to my feet come then disagreeable bard he said it is time to discover which path we shall take and trust god to meet us on the way book three the forgotten war one all you who look upon the land now and raise your unholy complaint tell me where were you when the black boar gouged our sacred earth with his tusks and shook the very hills of ynys prydein with his ungodly bellowing tell me you who from the lofty battlements of your superior intellect scan all that passes in the world and pronounce upon it tell me now that you divined the disaster that came to pass i defy you instruct me wise ones in how it could have been prevented o great of knowledge secure in your wide intelligence as you regard the calamity of twrch trwyth tell me did you also foresee the yellow ravager when the dread comet passed over the island of the mighty and scourged lloegres with its tail where were you i will tell you shall i you sailed for armorica who left the land of your birth to barbarians who left your shores undefended who turned away from britain in its day of peril and dread not arthur never arthur why do you complain why do you demean him now i demand an answer tell me why do you grieve heaven with your tedious contention the caviling of the falsehearted is the mewling of sick cats it signifies nothing save a pinched ungenerous spirit perverse in spite and rotten with envy the weakwilled always decry those who when the day of strife breaks fill their hearts with courage and cast safety to the wind fear is mans first enemy and his last hear me now i tell you the truth conquer fear and your reward is assured on the night that arthur sought light along conflicts shadowed paths he found only fear even so being arthur he put fear behind him and strove instead in faith thus all that came after will yet be accounted him as righteousness this is something smallsouled men will never understand we triumphed that night but our victory sowed the seeds of a bitter harvest we purchased liberty for the eireann isle but at great cost to ynys prydein for iernes freedom meant hateful travail for britain at arthurs word rhys sounded a short piercing blast on the horn and it was answered no fewer than seven times across the valley at the horns second sounding we lashed our horses to speed down we struck falling like lightning from a cloudless sky we drove into the sleeping camp the vandali living by constant warfare and accustomed to it overcame the shock and reacted swiftly leaping from their round tents they ran screaming to their weapons and within moments the battle was joined it was then that arthurs genius revealed itself anew for by employing so many points of attack he spread the enemy and forced them to remain on the defensive though each of our attacking forces was small the more numerous barbarian host could not afford to ignore any of them for every lapse was punished severely the black boar and his warlords could neither unify nor concentrate their defence and thus were robbed of the advantage their vast numbers gave them the swiftmoving raiders struck and retreated to strike and strike again the tactic would not have worked in the daylight but it was perfectly suited to a night raid where darkness multiplies the ordinary confusion and chaos of battle into a potent force all its own arthur manipulated this force wielded it like a weapon a harp singing under the touch of a true bard is but a dull stifled thing compared to the song of a weapon in arthurs hands and i thrilled to it i rode in the front rank with him llenlleawg and gwenhwyvar on his left with me on his right backed by cador and meurig and their war bands from time to time i caught fleeting glimpses of other warbands as they darted in and out along the battleline it was in arthurs battle order to resist engaging the enemy headtohead so we delivered only glancing blows striking and breaking off before they could muster their forces to trap us which was ever their chief intent arthur continually searched the heaving seaswell of battle for the black boars standard if he chanced upon twrch trwyth in the fight the opportunity of crossing swords with the vandal war leader would not pass him by as the fortune of combat decreed arthur received his chance for on one of our swiftbreaking forays i saw the boar standard rise up before us and in the same instant heard a fullthroated battle cry as arthur sped past me making for the place i lashed my mount forward striving to keep pace with him i saw llenlleawgs sword flash in the firelight as he matched arthur stroke for stroke the two of them pushed into the churning mass before us turning to my right i saw gwenhwyvar struggling to follow lady i shouted here this way she was beside me at once and together we struck into the bristling wall of defenders i slashed with my sword my arm rising and falling the quick blade hacking a grudging path through the stubborn press all at once the way parted and i saw before me the huge vandal chieftain surrounded by his bodyguard and arthur high on his rearing mount caledvwlch a reddish blur in his hand twrch trwyth angry his eyes mere slits of hatred met arthurs assault he leapt forward throwing his spear before him slashing at arthurs throat but arthur was swift up came his blade the black boars weapon splintered and the spearhead spun away disarmed amilcar fell back taking cover behind his upraised shield crack arthur struck the shield a bonebreaking blow then another and another the vandal chieftain staggered and fell back i saw him stumble as his bodyguard surged forward encircling him once more then the tide of battle bore him away the foemen swarmed us and it was either break off the attack or be dragged down there was nothing for it but to disengage we regrouped just out of spearthrow i had him shouted arthur in frustration did you see i had him i saw gwenhwyvar said you hurt him arthur he went down aye he went down llenlleawg confirmed but i think he was not wounded i was this close cried arthur slapping his thigh the shield rattled on his arm i had him in my grasp he will not long elude you gwenhwyvar said few men feel the bear of britains bite and remain alive to tell it cador reined in beside us too bad you will have another chance artos if that is to be answered arthur scanning the melee it will be another battle this one is finished finished cador protested artos we are just beginning to make our mark here and the enemy has begun throwing off his confusion he pointed with his sword soon twrch will realize he can repel us i would rather we were gone before that time we looked along the line the vandali were everywhere moving to the offensive at last emboldened they were fighting back the tide of battle was turning it was time to withdraw rhys shouted arthur the horn sound the retreat thus with the sound of the hunting horn ringing in our ears we fled flew back up the long slopes and into the dark we paused at the crest of the hill to look back upon our nights handiwork the enemy camp swirled in turmoil tents burned men screamed and cried running here and there around the perimeter however the silent dead lay thickstrewn on the ground victory arthur muttered it swells your heart with pride does it not amilcar will understand his aims cannot succeed i replied it may be that you have saved the lives of many this night pray god you are right myrddin the king replied then turning his mount he rode down the hill away from the valley we did not return to the abandoned stronghold but rested beside a stream a short distance away from the battleground at dawn one of the scouts arthur had posted to watch the enemy camp appeared to rouse us the enemy is striking camp lord the rider said they appear to be moving show me arthur said he summoned cador and myself to attend him and in a gesture of reconciliation conaire as well we arrived at the crest of the hill overlooking the vandal camp just as the sun broke fair in the east we stared into the valley the redrising sun in our eyes and watched as a line of warriors extended from the mass and began threading along the stream heading west soon the entire invading host was moving flowing like a dark river towards the sea they are leaving observed cador the triumph is yours artos you have defeated them cocking his head to one side arthur gazed long at the retreating floodtide when he turned away at last follow them was all he said then arthur and i returned to our men leaving cador conaire and the scout to oversee the retreating foe the kings and lords were awaiting word and arthur lost no time it appears the enemy host is leaving the valley i have set cador and conaire to follow and bring word of their purpose so we settled down to wait and the day progressed men looked to their weapons and nursed their wounds grateful for the rest as the sun passed midmorning fergus arrived to great acclaim with muchneeded provisions including a small herd of cattle on the hoof he set those with him to distributing the food and came to us ciaran the priest was with him what am i hearing fergus demanded almost stumbling in his excitement the enemy routed that is what they are saying is it true so it does appear gwenhwyvar informed him she rose and greeted her father with a kiss the black boar has left the valleyconaire and cador follow to learn where he has gone and here i am with meat and grain enough to last the summer fergus complained goodnaturedly what am i to do with it now the food is no less welcome for that cai told him waiting is hungry work i am starving say no more my friend fergus turned and called a string of commands which brought men running with readybaked loaves haunches of roast meat and skins of ale the irish lord had it seemed snatched bread from the ovens and meat from the spit gleaning the very crumbs from beneath the tables of those from whom he obtained his support oh they were happy to give it fergus explained when bedwyr commented on the astonishing largesse once i had sufficiently aroused their sympathy they could not give me enough bless them fergus mac guillomar gwenhwyvar cried you robbed conaires settlements teh sniffed fergus you wound me daughter did i steal a mouthful i never did he gazed around him and finding few believers appealed to ciaran tell them priest you were there it is true ciaran affirmed all gave freely but upon my life i still do not understand how it is that those most reluctant in the beginning gave the greater share in the end fergus grinned ah it is my winsome way i find that once a man properly understands what is required of him he is more than happy to oblige and the presence of armed warriors crowding the threshold had nothing to do with it i suppose gwenhwyvar remarked daughter daughter fergus chided do you expect me to go scurrying through the land unprotected listen to you now i rode with stout warriors i freely confess it how else was i to fend off the vandali and bear away the supplies entrusted to my care everyone laughed much amused by fergus explanation friend fergus arthur said however you came by the meat and ale it is more than agreeable i thank you and can but praise your diligence you are good to commend me so the irish king replied still i would rather i had been here last night with you i missed a good fight i think if only i could have seen it well i was there cai told him and i tell you the truth the foam in this cup is a far better sight to my eyes than any i saw last night the day grew warm another hot cloudless day and after their meal the men lay down to sleep taking what shelter they could find under trees and bushes round about in this way we passed the time waiting for conaire and cador to return with word of the vandal retreat it was not until dusk the next day that the awaited word arrived the two lords and their scout appeared out of a crimson sunset hungry and thirsty having ridden far and fast to report that the barbarian horde had boarded their ships and sailed away two they know they cannot stand against us conaire boasted we have driven them away the nobles were inclined to agree with conaire most lords viewed the barbarian departure in an auspicious light arthur knew better the black boar has not given up the fight the high king told the onlookers he has merely gone to easier plunder elsewhere what do we care about that brastias countered he has left ierne and that is all that matters is it arthur turned on the unruly lord amilcar has left before only to appear again farther down the coast he summoned the irish lords you know your island best he began therefore you must ride the coasts to determine where the black boar has gone it will take time conaire warned there are more wrinkles in the shore than stars in the sky then you must go with all haste arthur bade him after a short discussion it was determined that each king leading a scouting party of six men would search out a different portion of coastline thus making a complete circuit of the island they would then hasten back with the report meanwhile arthurs own ships would begin a sweeping search some working north around the headlands and then south through the narrows others sailing south down the west coast then around to the east and up it is a most inelegant plan arthur observed as the first scouting party rode from the camp he paused his brow heavyfurrowed as he watched the riders depart god knows i can think of no other way there is no other way bedwyr replied you have observed the most prudent course and there is nothing more to be done until the scouts return put it from your mind bear but arthur could not put it from his mind the days passed and how they creep with numbing slowness for those who wait after six days had gone arthur posted sentries on the high ground to watch the approaches from the east west north and south charging them to bring word the instant they saw anyone returning while the rest of the camp settled back to wait the high king prowled the perimetera most restless bear he ate little and slept less growing more irritable by the day gwenhwyvar and bedwyr tried to pacify him and when their own attempts failed they brought the problem to me such anxiety is not good for him surely the queen said myrddin you must do something what do you suppose i can do that you cannot talk to him suggested bedwyr he always listens to you and what would you have me tell him i countered shall i say do not worry arthur all will be well he is right to worry amilcar has placed us in perilous difficulty and arthur knows it think bedwyr we cannot move from here until we know where the boar has gone meanwhile the barbarians are free to strike where they will i know that bedwyr said icily i only meant that it does arthur no good to fret about it he is the king should he not fret for his own i replied bedwyr rolled his eyes bards it is no help to quarrel among ourselves gwenhwyvar interposed if we cannot calm arthur at least we need not add to his worries in the evening of the ninth day two riders under fergus command returned to say that the northwestern coast from malain bhig to beann ceann had been scoured no enemy ships sighted anywhere the scout said lord fergus presses the search north to dun sgeir four days later scouts returned from the east coast we ranged as far south as loch laern they said and saw naught but your own ships working down the narrows lord the pilot said they had seen no sign of the vandali either seven days more brought further news no enemy ships anywhere on the west coast from dun iolar to gaillirnh bay after that the reports came more rapidly one or two a day and all with the same account no enemy ships the vandali were nowhere to be found if any thought this information would cheer arthur they were mistaken despite the encouragement of his lords he greeted these reports with deepest dread as if each negative sighting confirmed a dire suspicion the only variation in the pattern came from the last of the parties led by laigin whose scouts had searched out the remote and sparsely populated fingerthin peninsulas of the south coast there were ships i believe but we did not see them laigin said the people of the ban traigh say that many ships were there although no invaders attacked when asked arthur that is the strange thing the irish lord answered it seems they were there when the black boar was fighting here that cannot be suggested one of the britons i think it was brastias they are in error it must have been before the battle or after more like suggested owain what difference can it make now wondered urien they are gone and that is what matters arthur glared at the man but could not bring himself to answer such foolishness he wrapped himself in his stifling silence and stalked off nor could he be persuaded to speak again until two days later when his own ships returned barinthus having directed the undertaking came before his king with the final report we have encircled the island entire and have seen neither hull nor sail in any hiding north south east or west the black ships have gone from these waters say it loud cried conaire pushing himself forward the enemy is defeated what further proof is needed we have won fergus eager to offer his thanks took up the cry hail arthur ierne is free the barbarian is defeated at this the entire camp loosed a wild heartstirring cheer the celebration long denied began then and there the irish kings called for their bards to compose victory songs and the ale was poured anew the campfires were built up and several head of fat cattle quickly butchered and set to roast on spits over the flames the long anxious wait was over ierne was free the victory complete after days of inactivity the lords and warriors leapt at the chance to release their anxiety in revelry it was as if the entire camp had been holding its breath until now and found to its great relief that it could breathe once more while the meat roasted and ale splashed from skin to jar to cup the bards began reciting their songs extolling the virtues of the assembled warbands and their champions at the conclusion of each recitation the warriors applauded with noisy acclaim the best efforts also had their material reward the patron lords bestowing on their chiefs of song lavish ornaments of silver and of gold inspiring ever more exalted feats of praise and wordplay but arthur stood apart and watched the rejoicing with a cold eye gwenhwyvar having borne her concern with great fortitude for so many days could not but reproach him for his gloom your scowl could sour honey she told him ierne has shaken off the invader that is the best news we could receive he turned his scowl upon his wife that he told her curtly is the worst news of all the very thing i feared most has befallen us he flung a hand to the roistering warriors the saving of eiru is the ruin of ynys prydein with that he stormed into the centre of the gathering and snatching the hunting horn from rhys raised it to his lips and gave a loud blast expecting a speech of commendation and the bestowal of gifts the crowd called for silence and pressed close about to hear what the high king would say when he knew that they could hear him arthur spoke the victory is won for ierne but you must continue your celebration alone for i must return to britain at once arthur then commanded the britons to begin preparing to leave nay arthur nay fergus cried you have suffered much for our sake therefore you must stay take your rest and let us feast you three days it is but a small thing in light of your toil on our behalf i thank you and my lords thank you arthur replied it may be that we will all meet again if god wills to renew our feast in better times i fear we have waited here too long already one day more at least fergus insisted you must allow us to pay proper homage to the victory you have won for us for i swear by head and hand without you there would be no free man drawing breath this day conaire lurking nearby heard this and grimaced with distaste lord arthur has spoken fergus it is not meet to keep such exalted men from their lofty affairs some of the nearby british lords heard the remark and bristled at it urien leapt to his feet fists clenched irish filth he growled his voice low gerontius started forward brastias threw out a restraining arm be easy brother owain nearest arthur rose to his feet lord arthur he called loudly we have waited this long one day more will make no difference whether in feast or fight i would have these irish kings know that britain stands foremost he concluded eyeing conaire with cool defiance the other britons quickly assented to owains suggestion repudiating conaires discourtesy but arthur would not be moved not a moment more may be spared he insisted gather your men owain you and your brother lords and make for the ships we sail for ynys prydein at once the high kings decision was thoroughly resented by all the warriors and most of the lords only those who knew arthur best accepted his command even if they did not understand it only cai bedwyr cador and myself thought he had acted wisely the rest regarded his behaviour as rash uncouth and inconsiderate nevertheless the ships were soon fullladen and the arduous process of moving britains war host began once more as on the previous crossing the wind refused to aid us in any but the most ineffectual manner we made up for its lack by plying the oars which most warriors regarded as tedious punishment when resting from their labours the cymbrogi drowsed or talked filling the long summer day as the sun ploughed its slow furrow across the empty skyfield i stood at the prow listening to the talk around me and the slow rhythmic splash of the oars gazing at the heathaze dancing on the flat level horizon i felt the sun hot on my head smiting me with peculiar intensity and i began to wonder how long it had been since the last rain how long since i had last seen a sky grey with clouds and felt a cool north breeze on my face deep in thought i heard a voice call out to me we have no choice burn it down burn it to the ground this strange intrusion startled me i turned to see who had spoken but all was as before men in their various positions of repose no one paying particular attention to me it took me a moment to realize i had not heard the voice at allnot with my ear at least the voice had come to me as voices some times do i strained to hear more but it was gone already no choice i whispered to myself repeating what i had heard burn it down what did it mean another long hot day followed and another we glimpsed the cragged west coast of britain in the twilight but it was dark when we entered mor hafren and the tide was flowing against us rather than disembark in the dead of night on the rocky coast our small fleet anchored waiting for the tide to turn before making our way up the estuary channel to the landingplace below caer legionis it was not until daybreak that we were able to proceed as ours was the lead ship we were first to taste smoke on the morning air and first to sight the dark ugly haze smudged across the eastern sky alas we were first also to behold that sight most dreaded in our races long experience the black bank formed by the massed hulls of enemy ships the hateful keels had been driven hard aground and the ships scores of them in all shapes and sizes enough to serve an emperor hundreds of ships lashed together railtorail and put to the torch the sails and hulls must have burned for days even now the smoke rolled heavenward from the smouldering masts and keels oh but there were so many score upon score of enemy ships many times more than we had encountered in ierne and all of them fired to the waterline we gazed with shock and dismay at the loathsome sight and rued the meaning in our bones for the black boar was loose in the island of the mighty and blessed jesu have mercy he meant to stay three coldly furious arthur ordered barinthus to make landfall farther up the estuary and sent bedwyr llenlleawg and the cymbrogi to scout the way ahead he stood in water to his knees commanding his battlechiefs as they disembarked the last ships had not even touched shore before the first divisions were armed mounted and moving away the vandali had left a wide trail along the valley floor grass trampled into the dry dirt by thousands upon thousands of trampling feet the trail led directly to caer legionis the city itself such as it was had been abandoned in the days of macsen wledig when the legions left the people had moved back into the surrounding hills and built a hillfort there returning once more to an older way and a more secure we skirted the deserted town and continued on to arthurs fortress at caer melyn as we drew nearer we met bedwyr and two scouts returning they sacked our stronghold he reported and tried to burn it but the fire did not take hold the gate is broken and those inside asked arthur dead answered bedwyr all of them dead when arthur made no reply bedwyr continued they took what they could carry off and moved on shall i send llenlleawg and the others ahead to discover where they have gone still arthur made no reply he seemed to look through bedwyr to the hills beyond artos said gwenhwyvar she was coming more and more to recognize and understand her husbands moods what are you thinking without a word he lifted the reins and continued to the caer if the black boar had wanted to devastate the fortress not a single timber would have remained upright as it was however aside from the broken gate the stronghold appeared intact quiet but undamaged it was not until we entered the yard that we saw the fireblackened walls and smelled the death stink a party of cymbrogi were already at the sorrowful chore of dragging out the dead preparing to bury them on the slope of the hill below the timber palisade we joined in this heartbreaking labour then gathered on the hillside in the twilight to offer up prayers for our fallen brothers as we consigned them to their graves only when the green turf covered the last corpse did arthur enter the hall they were careless cai observed they were in haste how do you know this wondered urien since the last days in ierne he had dogged arthurs steps insinuating himself into the group closest to the high king if anyone else noticed his presence they gave no sign if twrch trwyth had desired its destruction cai answered curtly the caer would be ashes and those scattered to the winds embarrassed by his failure to discern the obvious urien withdrew and said no more it is fortunate we have the war host with us still bedwyr said that great horde on foot our horses can easily overtake them cai put in finishing the thought they cannot have travelled far but the war host is fewer now than it was in ierne cador pointed out without the support of the irish lords i fear we will fare less well than before gwalchavad will have reached the northern lords with our summons bedwyr reminded him idris cunomor and cadwallo will arrive soon cador nodded but the frown did not leave his face we need more he said after a moment even with the northern warbands it is still ten or twenty vandali for every fighting briton bors and ector should arrive any day cai added together they will bring above six hundred there followed a reckoning of numbers warbands were estimated and tallied at best we could count on four thousand perhaps more though likely far fewer however lack of fighting power was not the uppermost concern men must eat if they are to fight and the talk soon turned to the persistent problem of provisions warriors require a constant uninterrupted supply of food and weapons we had not enough of arms or food to sustain a lengthy campaign we must send to the settlements for our support cador observed gloomily and that will take men away from battle if we do not send them gwenhwyvar replied it will cost the lives of more there is no other way there is another way arthur said quietly finding his voice at last we will use the treasure of britain to buy grain and cattle in londinium turning to cador he said i give this task to you take everything we have saved from the saecsen wars and use it in the markets bedwyr shook his head in amazement bear god love you we were plundered amilcar has it all all wondered arthur aloud this problem had not occurred to him not all i suppose bedwyr allowed we have that left which was hidden under the hearth and the little we had with us in ierne it is enough that little is enough perhaps bedwyr said doubtfully artos gwenhwyvar said whatever we lack can be made up from the churches they have gold and silver aplenty go to them let them help us now as we have helped them tread lightly i warned separating holy men from their worldly wealth is not without consequence listen to your queen bedwyr urged what good will their gold and silver do them when the barbarians come and carry it off they will lose both their treasure and their lives but if they give their gold to us they may at least keep their lives so be it said arthur having heard enough to cador he said stop at the churches on the way and raise whatever you can tell them arthur has need of it when you reach londinium see you bargain well our lives depend on you cador accepted reluctantly as you will lord he said i will leave at first light tomorrow arthur stood i am going to my chamberwhat is left of it when the lords have settled their men let them attend me in council here thus as a woeful sliver of moon rose to shine upon the ruined caer the lords of britain sat down to plan the defence of the island having had a taste of the vandal way of fighting the britons were all for blunt confrontation give them the edge of the sword i say ogryvan argued they shake with fear whenever they see our horses we can catch them and ride them down he is right a bold attack will send them back to their ships smart enough added brastias they are cowards and we are swiftly done with them meurig spoke up the sooner we engage them the sooner we are rid of them we must ride at once and then we will not need all the supplies you deem necessary to purchase ulfias put in hopefully we can finish this business before harvest the high king abruptly banished all such thoughts from their minds up he rose fists clenched did the sight of burning ships mean nothing to you he shouted the noblemen glanced at one another warily when no one made bold to answer arthur said hear me now it will not be as it was in ierne the boar has changed he knows well what awaits him here and yet he comes i tell you the truth amilcar has become a new and more dangerous enemy how so lord demanded brastias he tramples he burns he runs away it is the same reckless enemy you may mistake carelessness for cunning but i reckon it well when i see it gerontius made to press the argument but arthur cut him off with a chop of his hand am i surrounded by fools he asked his voice tight with fury tribes and families he shouted their ships burned behind them think he glared the length of the board towering in his anger when he spoke again his voice was a tight whisper the black boar will no longer content himself with plunder only he means to settle before the noblemen could frame a reply arthur continued the entire realm is unprotected and twrch trwyth knows this he runs before us laying waste the land as he goes the high kings words were finding their mark at last the lords kept their mouths firmly shut and listened only now does the enemy begin to show his true likeness and it is an aspect i greatly fear having made his point arthur concluded simply saying return to your men tell them we ride in pursuit we leave at dawn while the battlechiefs made ready to ride i sat alone in the empty hall and considered the meaning of the change in the black boars designs arthur had discerned the matter aright enraged or at least frustrated by arthurs opposition to his intended plundering of ireland the black boar had moved on to easier pickings what better place than an undefended britain with the war host of ynys prydein in ierne the vandal chieftain could plunder here to his hearts content amassing great wealth before he was caught arthur had read the signs aright certainly even so misgiving gnawed at me amilcar knew and knew beyond any doubt whatsoever that the lords of britain would soon arrive to put an end to his plunder having faced arthur and suffered defeat at every turn why risk confronting the bear of britain again more importantly if he meant to settle why choose britain did he not fear arthur did the black boar believe he would not be hunted down and killed something drove amilcar to this extremity was it desperation revenge something of both perhaps but there seemed to me also a portion of shrewd defiance how was that to be weighed i went to sleep with an uneasy mind and was roused a short while later by rhys declining to break fast i went out to walk the ramparts of caer melyn until it was time to leave i watched the sky lighten in the east away in the south white clouds crept along the coast but these faded even as i watched and with them vanished any chance of rain the day before us would be the same as those just past scorching hot i turned my eyes to the hills the grass was beginning to wither and dry already the trails were turning to dust if it did not rain soon the streams would begin to dry drought is not unknown in britain god knows but it is rare and always betokens hardship as i stood looking out upon the slowly parching land these words came again to mind burn it we have no choice we have no choice the voice had said burn it down burn it to the ground words of despair not anger they spoke of resignation and defeat of a last hopeless extremity burn it down what calamity i wondered did burning resolve what emergency was served by fire we have no choice burn it to the ground i looked down upon the caer busy with the surge of men preparing for battle yet even as i looked the commotion changed before my eyes the men were not warriors anymore and the disturbance was of a very different order i heard weeping and shouting men bearing torches flitted among the dwellings pausing to set the roofthatch alight and hurrying on smoke drifted across the yard and there in the centre of the yard corpses stacked like firewood for a pyre a man with a torch approached this gruesome heap and touched the flame to the kindling at the base of the heap as flames licked up through the bodies a woman dashed forward as if to throw herself onto the pyre the man with the torch caught her by the arm and pulled her back then threw the torch onto the stack leading the woman he turned shouted over his shoulder to others looking on and walked from the caer consigning the dead and the empty stronghold to the flames smoke passed before my eyes and i heard someone call my name when i looked again i saw rhys hastening to his horse at the gate cai and bedwyr were already mounted and the flight of dragons stood by their horses shaking with the force of the vision i thrust the unsettling image from me and went to my horse below the caer word of the impending departure was shouted from camp to camp in a moment we would all ride from caer melyn some to search out and gather provisions most to engage the invader many who stood now blinking in the sunlight of a new day would not return great light we ride today on paths unknown be a bright flame before us be a guiding star above us be a beacon pyre behind us we are lost each one unless you light our way raising my hands in a bards blessing i said power of the warrior host of angels power of raven be upon us power of eagle be ours power of the warrior host of angels power of storm be upon us power of tempest be ours power of gods holy wrath power of sun be upon us power of moon be ours power of eternal light power of earth be upon us power of sea be ours and lead us along the paths by which we must go power of the heavenly realms all power of heavenly realms to bless us and keep us and uphold us and a kindly light to shine before us and lead us along the paths by which we must go satisfied with this benediction i hurried to my place took up the reins and swung myself into the saddle like countless invaders before them the vandali followed the vale of hafren striking deep into the heart of the land there were few settlements directly in the black boars path spring flooding kept the valley folk on higher ground for the most part until he reached the broad midlands where the valley gave way to meadows and fields around caer gloiu the old roman town of glevum if amilcar had already reached that far the whole of lloegres soft middle would lie open before him the barbarian hordes would then spill out over the low fertile meads and there would be no containing them thus we rode with dire urgency stopping only to water the horses pressing on through the heat of the day the long time waiting in ierne had given amilcar a fair start on us and arthur was determined to find and engage the enemy without delay days end found us far down the valley but aside from the muchtrampled earth we had seen no sign of barbarians they move more swiftly than i imagined arthur observed fear drives them at a relentless pace but we will catch them tomorrow we did not catch them the next day however it was not until the sun had fallen behind the hillrim two days later that the enemy finally came into sight though we had been watching their dust clouds before we came upon them that first sight still took breath away a great restless swarm surging like an angry flood up the wide hafren valley these were not a new breed of sea wolf looking for spoils and easy plunder these were whole tribes on the move a people looking for a place to settle an entire nation searching for a home one glimpse of the vandali host asprawl like a vast dark stain spreading over the land and arthur ordered the columns to halt he and his chieftains rode to the nearest hilltop to assay the predicament god help us bedwyr murmured still struggling to take in the immensity of the throng before us i had no idea there could be so many we saw the ships cai said but this this words failed him arthur surveyed the multitude with narrowed eyes an attack now would only push them farther inland he decided at last we must strike from the far side upon returning to the waiting columns arthur summoned the lords and told them his decision having chased the enemy for the better part of three days the noblemen anxious to engage were not pleased to have the anticipated battle denied them go around demanded gerontius but they stand waiting before us they are in no position to fight we have only to attack and they are defeated this view found favour with others who added their endorsement if it were so certain arthur replied wearily i would have given the order before you thought to complain but victory is far from assured and i would sooner force twrch trwyth back along a path he has previously trampled than offer him opportunity to venture farther afield is that prudence inquired brastias not quite concealing the sneer in his tone or plain folly if we look to our swords sparing nothing in the attack i have no doubt at all that this will be concluded before nightfall arthur turned his face slowly to the disagreeable lord i wish i could be so easily convinced he replied but for the sake of all who will raise sword beside me i must own my doubts and since i am high king the matter is not at issue he turned in the saddle we go around and waste another day at least protested brastias he and gerontius had apparently taken it upon themselves to question arthurs every move in this they were to be pitied for there is no cure or comfort for this sort of blindness and men who fall victim often find it fatal circling the enemy meant a long day toiling through the roughwooded hills to the north of the hafren valley an arduous task to move so many men quickly and quietly the first stars were already showing in the sky when we finally descended to the valley once more no great distance ahead of our slowermoving foe after setting sentries along the hilltops to either side we made camp by the river and remounted before dawn to take up our attack position we were assembled in a crook in the valley ready and waiting when the vandal horde finally appeared they came on in a great dark flood like a tidal wave pouring through the valley pausing swelling flowing inundating the land we waited and listened the sound of their advance rumbled like dull thunder upon the earth the dust from their feet clouded the air like smoke closer we heard more particular sounds the cries of children and some times laughter the barking of dogs the lowing of cattle and sheep the sharp squeal of swine arthur turned his face to me his blue eyes dark with worry and lack of sleep they advance with women and children at the fore he quickly summoned his battlechiefs bairns on the battlefield cai protested what kind of war leader would force his people so amilcar must know we would not willingly slaughter women and children bedwyr pointed out he uses them as his shield i do not care said brastias gruffly if they are fool enough to wander onto the battleground they deserve whatever happens to them others agreed but women and children gwenhwyvar protested they have no part in this she looked to her husband what will you do artos he thought for a long moment we cannot give in to amilcar the attack will commence as planned but let each warn our warbands that innocents advance before the battle host and they are not to be killed if it can be helped even so many will die gwenhwyvar insisted that is as it may be arthur conceded i know no other way yet unwilling to give the order he asked does anyone suggest a better plan the king looked to each of his chieftains in turn but all remained silent so be it he concluded return to your places and prepare your warbands i will give the signal the high kings commands were relayed quickly through the ranks the british war host advanced to their positions and made ready to charge the forerunners became aware of us then for a shrill blatting horn sounded and all at once the leading edge of the dark flood froze the sudden halt sent rippled waves coursing back through the oncoming throng may god forgive us our sins this day said arthur grimly and without another word raised his hand to rhys who put the battle horn to his lips and sounded the attack four arthur intended to halt the enemys advance which our attack accomplished admirably well one look at the flying hooves and levelled spears hurtling towards them and the vandali fled pressed between the valleys steep sides the invading host shrank from the impact the mass shuddered surged and began to move away effectively trapping the main body of warriors in the rear and keeping them from ever reaching the fight we did not even unsheathe our swords having so easily succeeded in his aim arthur commanded rhys to signal the lords to break off the charge this brought cries of outrage from the british kings why have you called us back demanded gerontius flinging himself from the saddle brastias and ogryvan galloped to where arthur gwenhwyvar bedwyr and i stood together we could have defeated them once and for all look shouted brastias gesturing wildly in the direction of the fastretreating horde we can catch them still it is not too late resume the attack meurig joined the group then ulfias and owain were not far behind llenlleawg and cai sat their horses looking on what has happened demanded owain why have we broken off the attack well you might ask cried brastias let arthur explain if he can it makes no sense to me owain and meurig looked to arthur who replied this days fighting is done madness spat gerontius madness challenged bedwyr his temper flaring instantly we had victory in our grasp and threw it away answered gerontius hotly i call that madness by god they were women and children bedwyr replied his face growing red oh a very great victory to slaughter sheep and babes in arms by all means trample down the defenceless and count it a triumph aghh growled gerontius in frustrated rage he opened his mouth to renew his protest but cai restrained him enough gerontius say no more advised cai that way you will have less to regret brastias put a hand to his friends arm and made to turn him away but gerontius shook off the hand and stabbed his finger in arthurs face we might have settled it today but for your damnable caution i am beginning to wonder if it is not cowardice instead if you value your tongue stop it flapping warned bedwyr stepping towards him gerontius glared at bedwyr then at arthur and stormed off brastias went after him calling him back to make his objections known before all though the others said nothing i could tell they also faulted arthurs decision they had supposed an easy victory and saw it snatched away after an awkward silence they slowly dispersed frustrated that the first battle fought on british soil should be cut off without at least punishing the invader for his audacity it was the right thing to do bear offered bedwyr hoping to soothe instead he produced the opposite effect little you know me brother if you imagine i care what a fool like gerontius thinks arthur replied hotly or that his words will sway me he turned on his heel and ordered llenlleawg to lead the dragon flight in making certain the retreat continued when they had gone gwenhwyvar and i sat down with arthur do they truly believe this war will be won in a day or that a single battle will decide it he asked shaking his head have they fought at my side so long yet even now can speak of cowardice it is nothing gwenhwyvar told him less than nothing pay it no mind my love they are not with me in this yet arthur said is it not enough that i must fight amilcar must i carry those faithless lords on my back as well was it ever different i asked arthur glanced at me and then allowed himself a slow smile no he admitted in truth nothing has changed but i thought that taking the high kingship might have granted me a whit of authority it only gives them reason to fear you all the more gwenhwyvar said why should they fear me is it arthur invading their lands is it arthur plundering their treasure and making widows of their women let me go to fergus and conaire gwenhwyvar urged they will show their loyalty and shame the britons arthur gently declined he rose and said come we must make certain the vandali do not overcome their fright and turn back remounting our horses we continued on down the valley leading the warbands of britain the dragon flight were already far ahead the dust from the hooves of their horses rising up to mingle with that of the fleeing enemy i saw the white pall hanging over the valley and grew suddenly lightheaded i entered a waking dream it seemed as if i were lifted out of myself as if my spirit took wings to glide above me for i felt a rush of movement and looked down to see myself riding beside arthur gwenhwyvar and cador rode at his right hand and behind us the warbands in three long columns a roman aid though no one now alive save me had ever seen one and i recalled the day i gazed out from my grandfather elphins hillfort into the dale to see magnus maximus dux britanniarum leading the augusta legion south i did not know it then but soon that great general would lead his army across the narrow sea to gaul never to return he is remembered now as macsen wledig and has become a fabulous figure an illustrious british emperor but he was roman through and through and though he fought well to preserve us from the barbarians he was no briton how long ago was that how many years have passed great light how long must i endure i lifted my head and soared higher when i looked again i saw the dark stain on the land the cancer that was the black boars invading host flowing through the valley there were so many of them so very many it was a migration an entire civilization on the move above me i saw beyond the pale blue sky bright beams of starlight fixed and frozen in their empty firmament the stars shone down shedding their light upon us by day and night untouched and uninfluenced by the deeds of men what are men after all frail creatures frail as the grass that grows green one day and withers the next blown away on every wind god help us we are mingled starlight and dust and we know not who we are we are lost unless we find ourselves in you great light out across the windtossed waves i saw gaul and armorica and beyond them the great mother of nations rome once a beacon to all the world the light had already flickered out in the east hungry darkness now stretched its claws towards tiny britain but i saw ynys prydein the isle of the mighty like a seagirt rock solid amidst stormtossed waves a manyfavoured land shining like a beltain blaze in a wilderness of night alone among her sister nations yet holding the alldevouring darkness at bay and this by the virtue of a lineage which united the fiery courage of the celt with the cool dispassion of roman discipline distilled into the heart of a single man arthur before arthur there was aurelius and before aurelius merlin and before merlin taliesin each day raised up its own champion and in each and every age the swift sure hand laboured to redeem his creation look you we are not abandoned nor do we strive with our own strength alone call on your creator o man cling to him and he will carry you honour him and he will establish guardian spirits round about you though you walk through flood and fire you will not be harmed your redeemer will uphold you bright armies of angels go before us surrounding us on every side if we could but see oh but there were haughty lords among us proud men who bent the knee willingly to no one arthur embodying all that mortal power could boast was hard put to unite them and him they knew what they would not grant to an earthly king they would scarce yield to an unseen spirit no power on earth or up above can force the human heart to love where it will not love or honour where it will not honour how long i drifted in this strange flight i do not know but when i at last came to myself again it was twilight and a still quiet camp lay around me i awoke to find myself sitting on a calfskin by a fire a bowl of stew untouched in my hands hail myrddin we welcome your return arthur said as i stirred i looked across the fire to see him watching me concerned by the dazed expression on my face you were surely lost in your thoughts bard gwenhwyvar lifted my dish slightly you have not tasted a bite of your food i looked into the bowl cupped in my hands the dark liquid within became a squirming seething mass of yellow maggots i saw human bones smouldering with inexplicable fire and i heard again the echo of those mysterious words we have no choice burn it down i saw again the mound of corpses bloated and stained a hideous blueblack piled high and burning greasy smoke assaulting a dry white sky the gorge rose in my throat i gagged and threw the bowl from me gwenhwyvar put her hand on my arm myrddin sudden knowledge burst within me the hateful word formed on my tongue pestilence i answered choking on the word even now death is moving like a mist through the land arthurs jaw was set i will defend britain i will do all that may be done to defeat the vandali he misunderstood my meaning so i said there is an enemy more powerful than the boar and his piglets more dangerous to us all than any invader who has breached these shores arthur regarded me sharply you speak in riddles bard what is this death it is called the yellow death i replied plague gwenhwyvar gasped there has been no word of plague from any of the lords said arthur i will not allow such rumours to be spread amongst men preparing for battle i have no interest in rumours o great king even so there is no doubt in my mind nor should there be in yours that the yellow death is even now loosed in britain arthur accepted the rebuke in my words staring into my eyes he asked what is the cure i know no cure i told him but it comes to me i added on a sudden inspiration that if any remedy exists it may be that the priests at ynys avallach know of it their experience is wide and their knowledge deep i said and remembered my mother telling me that the monastery was becoming a place of healing but that had been years ago would it still be so now then you must go at once without delay said gwenhwyvar i rose from my place sit down myrddin arthur said you cannot go now it is dark and there are fifty thousand barbarians between you and ynys avallach he paused looking up at me in the firelight besides i sit in council tonight and i need you here i cannot stay arthur i said if anything can be done i dare not wait i must go you know this still arthur hesitated one enemy at a time he said we only squander our strength if we chase off in all directions there is no cure for the plague you said so yourself i have no wish to defy you i said stiffly but you have the cymbrogi to attend you and i may be of use elsewhere this danger has been shown to me and i cannot ignore it i will return as soon as possible but i must go now tonight bear gwenhwyvar implored he is right let him go it may be the saving of many lives arthurs gaze swung from me to her and she seized on this momentary hesitation yes go to them wise emrys gwenhwyvar urged as if this had been arthurs plan all along learn all you can and bring us some good word i make no promise i warned but i will do what may be done as for rumours say nothing to anyone about this until i return so it is settled declared arthur though i could tell the decision did not sit well with him he stood abruptly and cried out for llenlleawg myrddin must leave us for a time he said since the valley is swarming with vandali i would ask you to accompany him on his journey llenlleawg inclined his head in assent his expression impassive in the firelight i thank you i told them both but i will travel more swiftly alone five at least let him see you to the boat arthur insisted then i will know the barbarians did not stop you seeing he was determined to get his way in something i relented bidding arthur and gwenhwyvar fare well llenlleawg and i went at once to the horse picket to retrieve our mounts we rode from the camp as arthur was sitting down to council i do not know which i pitied more arthur contending with his kings or myself spending a sleepless night in the saddle likely i had the better bargain llenlleawg and i kept to the hilltops till we were well out of sight of the barbarian encampment turning our horses into the vale as the sun broke red and raw in the east llenlleawg led the way riding a little ahead keeping close watch on the trail and the bluffs to either side lest we encounter any straggling vandali but the trail remained empty and safe until rounding a blind turn just after midday the irish champion halted abruptly someone is coming this way three riders maybe more my eyes scanned the riverside trail before us but i saw nothing there the irishman pointed to the rockstrewn riverbank ahead and to the right the white sun high overhead shrank the shadows making everything appear flat and colourless i looked where llenlleawg indicated and saw that what i had taken to be the grey shapes of boulders were in fact riders slowly picking their way along the riverside did they see us he gave his head a slight shake i do not think so we sat motionless for a time waiting for the strangers to show themselves since the men were mounted i did not think they could be vandali but we waited just the same the strangers were also wary they came on slowly pausing often to scan the trail ahead and the instant they sighted us one of their number turned tail and raced back the way they had come leaving the remaining two to continue on let us meet them llenlleawg said drawing a spear from behind his saddle we moved ahead slowly and but a single spearthrow separated us when llenlleawg gave a whoop and lashed his mount to speed it is niul he called back to me lots man he rushed ahead hailing the riders loudly i galloped after him as llenlleawg and niul leaning from the saddle embraced one another what do you here cousin cried the one called niul i thought it was a very cruachag rising out of the river to carry us off he laughed throwing back his head one glance at the scars on his shield arm and the notched blade ready on his thigh gave me to know this battlewise veteran feared little in this world not waiting for llenlleawg to present me he turned and called hail myrddin emrys at my surprise he laughed again you do not remember me nor do i blame you as he spoke a memory shaped itself in my mind i remembered a room in a house gradlon the wine merchants room in londinium the first time i had met lot this man one of lots chieftains was there it is true that i do not remember your name if i ever heard it i confessed but you i think attended the first council of kings in londinium we shared a cup of beer together as i recall since lot would drink no wine by the god that made you lord emrys niul laughed enjoying this meeting very much you are a wonder true enough my soul i was but a boy then yes we shared a cup of beer lot would drink nothing else but where is pelleas how come you keep company with this wild beast of an irishman pelleas is dead i told him several years ago sorrow stole the mirth from his smile ah a sad loss indeed he shook his head forgive me i did not know llenlleawg spoke up niuls mother and mine were kin he explained niul was fostered in fergus house we were raised together the urgency of my journey pressed upon me so at risk of rudeness i said is lot here he follows directly replied niul he is with the warband but a small distance behind come i will take you to him curving around the foot of an enormous hill the valley bent and widened as it passed once beyond the bend i saw spread out across the valley floor a warband of perhaps five hundred warriors three hundred on foot the rest on horseback a most heartening sight from the forerank of warriors two horsemen rode to meet us lot i would have recognized anywhere his bold checked cloak of black and crimson his braided locks his great golden tore the bluestained clan marks on his cheeks he recognized me too and called out with evident pleasure hail emrys i give you good greeting it is long since we last mettoo long i think i hailed him in return and we embraced one another in true friendship well it is once again in the saddle with sword in hand not so myrddin emrys i would it were not so i replied still i am glad to see you in the name of the high king i welcome you lot we came upon llenlleawg and the emrys on the other side of the bend yonder niul put in they ride alone and here were we expecting these fierce vandali gwalchavad warned us of lot offered by way of explanation continue on the way you are going and you will soon find as many as you care to see llenlleawg answered fifty thousand or more truly wondered lot gwalchavad did not say there were so many he did not know i replied nor did we llenlleawg then told them where to find arthur and how best to avoid the barbarians will you ride with us emrys niul asked alas we cannot i replied llenlleawg and i pursue other affairs no less urgent then we will not delay you longer lot said until we meet again myrddin i bid you fare well and safe return we continued on our way and they on theirs and we soon passed from one anothers sight the valley widened and as the day dwindled i could see the waters of mor hafren shining in the distance we camped on the trail and were in the saddle again before dawn the sun had not risen above the surrounding hills when high in the clear cloudless sky i saw the dark shapes of carrion birds circling a place a little distance to the north that is caer uisc i observed without a word llenlleawg turned aside and made for the settlement we arrived a short time later to find the place burnt to its post holes i surveyed the blackened arena formed by the scorched timbers of the palisade here and there under collapsed roof trees i saw a few objects recognizable still the sphere of an overturned cauldron a tripod reduced to lengths of twisted iron heatshattered jars by the score and god have mercy halfburied amid heaps of dead ash the charred corpses of plague victims young and old alike the birds worked at the dead picking clean the bones the black boar has done this thing llenlleawg declared bitterly no i told him seeing the flames and hearing the weeping of my vision once more here was its confirmation if any were needed twrch trwyth is not to blame the people of caer uisc have burned their own settlement llenlleawg started at this that cannot be he protested and began to dismount in order to examine the scene more closely stay i commanded touch not so much as an ash to your boot pulling himself back into the saddle he opened his mouth to object i silenced him with a word and said you will know this killer soon enough when you return to caer melyn tell arthur only arthur mind what you have seen tell him also that myrddins vision was true do you understand say nothing of caer uisc to the others we were never here llenlleawg accustomed to taking orders the man accepted my instructions i turned away we had best not linger the day is speeding from us we rode on in all haste to the harbour at caer legionis where arthurs fleet joined now by lots ships lay at anchor barinthus hailed our approach the doughty pilot had remained behind with a handful of men to guard and maintain the ships what word he called what word of the battle we fought but once llenlleawg answered a broken skirmish there was no victory we dismounted and greeted the pilot several others came running to hear what we had to say i told them how the situation stood between arthur and amilcar and asked have you seen anything lot arrived midday yesterday barinthus told us nothing else no one passes here without our notice the bullnecked shipman answered we keep watch day and night and neither friend nor foe has come this way save lot as i say and yourselves he paused anticipating my order i am at your service wise emrys where would you go to ynys avallach i answered indicating the broad sweep of mor hafren glittering like hammered gold in the fading light of day i see the tide is flowing now the need is such i cannot wait it shall be done the pilot said i myself will take you also i added it would be wise to move the ships away from the shore we will not need them soon i think the thought had occurred to me barinthus replied in a tone that made it clear i need concern myself no further with the safety of the ships he turned and began barking commands those with him leapt to their tasks i bade llenlleawg return to arthur then and by the time my mount and i were aboard the boat arthurs fleet was already being moved to deeper water well out of reach of marauding barbarians riding the ebbing tideflow barinthus expertly guided the ship around mudbanks and swiftly brought us to the opposite shore at the place where the little river briw met the larger padrud forming a great mudflat at low tide it looks to be a mucky landing he warned this is as close as i dare go thus was i forced to disembark in waistdeep water leading my horse i splashed through the water and floundered across the mudflat to dry land where i mounted and hastened inland night overtook me on the way but i did not stop i wanted to reach my grandfathers house as soon as possible pushing a relentless course i came in sight of the tor as the sun rose once more there can be few more beautiful sights in this worldsrealm than the palace of the fisher king by golden dawnlight the slender towers and graceful walls of white stone all roseandhoneycoloured in the morning light made a richly glowing reflection in the lake that surrounded the tor with ynys avallach rising above the flat marshland like an island from a bluegreen sea years had passed since i last saw it several lifetimes it seemed even so it remained as i recalled from earliest memory and my heart swelled with a sudden yearning avallachs palace had ever been a haven to me and i felt its old tranquillity beckoning like a cool breeze over the shaded depths of the lakes manyshadowed pools soothing the travellers heatfevered brow oh blessed jesu keep this place close to your loving heart and hold it in the palm of your swift sure hand if goodness anywhere endures in this worldsrealm let it reign here now and for as long as your name is honoured among men i made my way around the lake passing beneath the hill where stood the abbey and reached the causeway leading out across the water to the tor ynys avallach green as an emerald against the sunfired sky seemed some otherworldly place an impression only deepened upon meeting those who dwelt there fair folk indeed graceful in every line enchanting to look upon even the lowest stablehand possesses a bearing of high nobility two young grooms dashed forward running to take my horse avallach last monarch of that dwindling race appeared and called a greeting as i passed under the highvaulted arch merlin his voice resounded like glad thunder before i had properly dismounted he drew me from the saddle and gathered me in his strong embrace merlin my son my son stand here let me look at you he held me at arms length then seized me once more and crushed me to him arthur big as he is is but a boy beside the fisher king i felt a stripling youth again the peace of christ be upon you merlin my son avallach said spreading wide his arms welcome come into my hall we will raise the cup together leaving the stoneflagged yard we crossed a roofed portico and passed through two great doors into the palace charis is not here at present the fisher king informed me as the welcome cup arrived one of the priests summoned her this morning they fetch her whenever she is needed at the shrine did they say why i asked with sinking heart praying it was not what i feared could plague spread so quickly i did not know sickness avallach replied holding out the cup when the cup was filled the fisher king pressed it into my hands drink merlin you have travelled far and the journey was hot the villagers say there is drought i smiled avallach called any and all who lived in the shadow of the tor villagers as if he were a lord with thriving settlements full of loyal subjects in truth though a few folk still lived in holdings scattered around the marshes most who passed through the summerlands were pilgrims in search of a blessing at the shrine then i will find her at the abbey i said and sipped some of the good rich beer before passing the cup to avallach so i imagine he said raising the cup watching me over the rim he paused cocking his head to one side as he studied me christ have mercy he cried all at once merlin you can see truly grandfather he gazed at me as if at a marvel but but how did this happen your sight restored tell me tell me at once there is little enough to say i replied i was blind as you well know but a priest named ciaran laid hands on me and it pleased god to heal me a miracle breathed avallach as if this were the most natural explanation as if miracles were splendidly commonplace as frequent as the sun rising in the east each day as wonderful and as welcome indeed in his world perhaps they were talk passed then to the small happenings of the marshland fishing the work at the shrine and abbey the toil of the monks and the everwidening circle of faith i marvelled not for the first time how little the trauma and turmoil of the day mattered in this place events of great moment in the wider world were either unknown here or passed as incidents of small consequence the palace of the fisher king like its tor stood aloof from the ravages and upheaval of the age a true haven a sanctuary of peace in a troublefretted world great light let it ever be so i would gladly have conversed with him all day but the need pressed in me once more promising to return as soon as possible i took leave of avallach and walked to the abbey glad to be out of the saddle as i climbed the path from the lakeside some of the brothers saw me and ran ahead to announce my arrival i was met and conducted to abbot elfodds chamber six wait here please the monk said the abbot will join you as soon as he is free thank you but the monk was gone before i could stop him i thought to call him back but fatigue overwhelmed me and instead i sat down in the abbots chair to wait i had just closed my eyes when i heard the sound of footsteps outside the door merlin i opened my eyes stood and was instantly enfolded in a strong almost fierce embrace your eyes your beautiful eyes chads whispered tears of happiness spilling freely down her cheeks it is true jesu be praised you can see but how did this happen sit down at once and tell me i must know oh merlin i am glad you are here what a delightful surprise can you stay no do not tell me whether short or long it makes no difference you are here now and that is all that matters i have missed you mother i murmured i did not know how much i had missed you until this moment how i have longed for you my hawk charis said drawing me to her again and now here you are a prayer answered charis was as ever unchanged save in small ways only her hair she wore in the manner of highborn british women thickly plaited with strands of golden thread woven into the braids her mantle was dovegrey simple long and utterly lacking any ornament slender regal she appeared both elegant and mysterious the stark austerity of her garments enhancing rather than diminishing her royal mien her eyes as they played over my face were as keen as any inquisitive childs and held a strength of authority i had not known before she saw that i had noticed the change in her attire and said your eye is more than keen hawk to see what is no longer there she smoothed her mantle with her hands and smiled yes i dress more humbly now many of the people who come to the shrine have so little they possess nothing less than nothing some of them i do not wish to remind them of their poverty i could not bear to offend them even by my clothing he would be a miserable man indeed who found the sight of you offensive i replied lightly she smiled again and why your own drab cloak my son i cannot find it fitting to your rank that you array yourself so i spread my hands like you i find it easier to pass through the world without proclaiming my lineage at every turn come you are tired i was she replied quickly but the sight of you has revived me completely sit with me i would hear you tell me all that has passed in arthurs court since i last saw you and i would enjoy nothing more than to spend the day with you i replied for there is much to tell but my errand is urgent and i cannot stay one moment longer than necessary i am sorry i must return as soon as leaving before you have properly arrived both chads and i turned as the abbot bustled into the room elfodd in his white mantle and green tunic greeted me warmly welcome merlinus welcome good friend they just told me you had come sit man you look exhausted i am pleased to see you again good abbot you are flourishing i see he appeared unchanged for the most part a little plumper perhaps with more grey in his hair but the same elfodd that i remembered charis has told me you are busy as ever run off our feet matins to evensong he replied happily but we thrive god is good we thrive i am glad to hear it stillhe grew seriousit is not so with some who come here one died last night who was in our care and two others with the same illness have been found far gone they were not even the strength to drag themselves up the hill he regarded me closely weighing his next words carefully i felt i knew already what he would say merlinus it may not be safe for you here i pray i am mistaken but it seems very like plague if so the one who died last night is but the first of many trust me there will be more i told him and explained the reason for my visit i hoped you would know some remedy that is why i have come then jesu help us all for there is no remedy he answered shaking his grey head sadly the pestilence cannot be contained it wanders on the wind like tainted water it poisons everything no one is safe he grew silent contemplating the enormity of the predicament looming before him i have been speaking to paulinus charis began excitement quickening her speech he is well learned in this paulinus wondered elfodd memory broke across his blank features like sunrise oh praise god yes paulinus blessed jesu of course with all the tumult i had quite forgotten paulinus has recently arrived charis began arrived from armorica the abbot broke in he spent some time in south gaul and i believe in alexandria where he learned much of healing herbs unknown to us here they have experience of plague in those places charis said we were speaking of this just before you came merlin you must talk to him at once foolish servant cried elfodd what am i thinking he turned on his heel and called out in a loud voice paulinus someone bring paulinus to me at once a monk appeared in the doorway behind him acknowledged the abbots call and disappeared at a run though early morning yet it was already hot in elfodds cell let us await him in the cloister it is cooler there we stepped from the closeness of the abbots cell out into the colonnaded walkway a single tree grew in the centre of the courtyard shading the square the leaves on the tree were dry and drooping for lack of water i see we must bring some water from the lake for josephs tree elfodd said absently the land is athirst i thought and had my thoughts answered by a calm deep voice which said the hammer of the sun beats upon earths anvil all that is green shall be brown all that burns is consumed we turned to see an old spare baldheaded man step into the light his face was lean and brown from many days perhaps years in the southern sun into my mind came the rejoinder to his quoted scrap of prophecy and all who pass through the fire will be purified i added holding his gaze with my own so be it the monk said he inclined his head in deference to abbot elfodd who had summoned him wise ambrosius my name is paulinus i am at your service he joined us greeting elfodd and charis with simple grace i saw to my surprise that he was much younger than i had first thought his bald head and the leathery appearance of his skin made him look older than his years but there was no mistaking the youthful intensity of his deep brown eyes he was dressed in the humble undyed homespun tunic of the monks but held himself with the bearing of a lord i remember you brother i said and need no new introduction by the blessed lamb he cried in amazement it cannot be for i was but a lad the only time i saw you and never a word passed between us i looked on his countenance and recalled an elderly man helped along by a boy who carried his staff the man was the aged dafyd walking out from the llandaff monastery the applecheeked boy had shaggy dark hair and bright bold eyes the same eyes that looked at me with such amusement now you were at llandaff with dafyd i told him were you born there i do not know why i asked the question there are always plenty of children at any monastery that fact alone possessed no great significance well you know it he laughed saints and angels i thought i would never leave that place ah but truly there are times now i wish i never had he laughed again and i realized i had heard that laugh before and that turn of phrase oh yes he was a cymry through and through are you gwythelyns son one of six and good men all he answered to my kinsmen in dyfed i am pol ap gwythelyn how may i serve you myrddin emrys as charis had already discussed the possibility with him i saw no need to soften the blow as you know plague has visited britain i said i have come from the high king to learn what may be done paulinus made the sign of the cross and raising his hands and face to the sun he said all praise the world creator and his glorious son who works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform happy am i among men for many are called but few are chosen and this day have i been chosen i am but a tool in the masters hand yet my destiny shall be fulfilled elfodd looked on somewhat astonished by this outburst charis regarded him curiously do i take it you can help us i asked all things are possible with god paulinus answered brother your piety is laudable yet i would thank you for a straight answer in simple words paulinus accepted the rebuke with good grace explaining how he had long questioned the guiding hand which had led him far into foreign lands in search of exotic cures and remedies yet removed him from contact with the very people who could most benefit from his knowledge in short he had begun to feel his effort wasted that he had mistaken his call i wanted to be a healer paulinus continued i feared i had become a scholar instead that is why i came to ynys avallach the work here is known and respected even in gaul and now god in his infinite wisdom has raised up his servant my years of study will be justified my gift will be honoured i am ready he turned his face to the sun once more and exclaimed goodly wise is the gifting giver and greatly to be praised may his wisdom endure forever so be it i cried to which charis and elfodd added a hearty amen turning to the abbot i said elfodd we must hold council at once there is much to discuss of course the abbot agreed let us go to the chapel where we can speak more privately he turned and i made to follow but my vision blurred and i swayed on my feet charis reached out to steady me merlin she cried her voice sharp with concern are you ill no i replied quickly lest they think the worst i am well but overtired you have not eaten since leaving arthur charis declared and i was forced to confess it why she asked and answered her own question there is trouble in britain she said and more than plague only again i admitted that she had read the situation aright then come hawk charis said i am taking you back to the tor at once it is nothing i insisted elfodd and paulinus will attend us there she said leading me away as i had neither the strength nor will to resist i gratefully succumbed to her care and allowed myself to be taken to the glass isle seven after i had eaten something and rested a little the clerics arrived to join charis and avallach in deliberation over the predicament before us we met in the sun well outside avallachs chamber where a canopy of red cloth had been raised to form a shady place chairs were brought and we held council under the awning as beneath the cloth of a roman camp tent this was fitting for our talk was as momentous as any military campaign and no less urgent from what you have said paulinus ventured i think it safe to say that the disease follows the vandal fleet where their keels touch the pestilence alights if that is the way of it i said i am wondering why the cymbrogi remain untouched they have been fighting the barbarian from the first yet no one has fallen ill also i pointed out the vandali stormed ierne before coming to britain yet we have heard no word of plague from anyone there the monk considered this carefully then he concluded at last it must arise from some other source turning to elfodd he asked abruptly the man who died last night where was his home why he lived nearby the abbot answered at ban curnig it lies a little to the west but he was a farmer i do not think he had ever been on a ship or even near one i see paulinus frowned then i do not know what to say i have never heard of plague arising anywhere but in a port and we are a fair distance from the sea we all fell silent thinking how this mystery might be solved what about the others i asked after a time two more died were they farmers as well i do not know elfodd replied and they can tell us nothing now one of them was a trader charis said at least i assumed so i have seen a merchants purse often enough to know one avallach stood and summoned one of his servants after a quick consultation the servant hastened away we will soon discover what can be learned from a merchants purse while we wait elfodd suggested to paulinus tell us what you know of this pestilence with that the monk began to relate all he knew of the disease and the various means and methods he had learned for treating the victims there were herb and plant potions thought to offer some relief fresh water that is water drawn only from swiftrunning streams must be maintained for drinking grain must be roasted before eating or be thrown away especially grain tainted by rats travel must be curtailed for the disease seemed to spread most freely when men moved unrestrained the dead must be burned along with their clothing and belongings and to be certain their houses and grainstores too fire offered some protection since once burned out the pestilence rarely returned i will allow you no false hope paulinus warned there are several kinds of plague all are deadly with the yellow ravager as in war it is a fight to the death many will die the weak and the old first that cannot be helped but the measures i have suggested will be the saving of many the servant returned shortly bearing a leather bag which he gave to avallach now then said the fisher king untying the thongs he emptied the contents of the bag onto the table before us coins spilled out nothing else i had hoped to find something to tell us whence this trader came avallach said ruefully gazing at the small pile of coins i saw the glint of silver in the sunlight shoving aside the lesser coins i picked up a silver denarius londinium but of course that open cesspit could spawn a thousand plagues grandfather i said holding up the coin the bag has spoken most eloquently see here the man has lately been in londinium how do you know this asked elfodd greatly amazed aside from eboracum that is the only place he can offer his goods in trade for silver like this truly added paulinus if he had fallen ill in eboracum i think he would have died before ever crossing the ouse and put in charis londinium is a port elfodd nodded accepting the evidence laid before him so our friend has lately been trading in londinium and was returning home when he fell ill how does this help us paulinus replied the city can be warned and sealed off thereby greatly containing the disease for it is known that even those who merely pass through a plague city may become ill very well elfodd concluded now to the matter of the curatives speak not of curatives paulinus cautioned where none exists even so i replied you mentioned elixirs that might offer some relief how are these to be prepared paulinus somber in light of the daunting prospect before us replied with the ingredients in hand preparing the potions is simplicity itself he laid a finger to his lower lip i think yes the best i know makes use of a waterloving herb as its chief element i believe the land here abounds with the very plant required and the other herbs are easily gathered we will need a very great quantity charis pointed out the brothers will provide all that is needed abbot elfodd promised we have among us men well skilled in such matters already and they can teach others reaching every settlement and holding will be much more difficult leave that to me i said a plan had begun forming in my mind now paulinus you must tell us everything you know about the making of this remedy and its use everything i stressed to the smallest particular mind since your directions will be carried to every holding and city in the land paulinus the reluctant scholar proved an able teacher as he began describing the process by which the elixir was made and how it should be used for best effect as he spoke i found myself admiring the clarity of his disciplined mind his years of learning were not in the least wasted on him as he feared what is more i could well appreciate his elation at finally hearing the call he had waited so long to answer of course it is infinitely better to prevent the illness the learned monk concluded the small benefit offered by the remedy is useless if the potion is not given at the onset of the fever with the potion there is small enough possibility of improvement without it he warned nothing can avail save prayer alone i understand i replied turning to avallach who had maintained a grim watchful silence during our discussion i said you will be in danger here i would have you come to caer melyn with me for the abbey will soon become a haven as well as a hospice son replied avallach kindly it is that already this disease but increases the work and as the toil is multiplied so too the glory what god sends we will endure depending not on our own strength but upon the one who upholds us all and he said lifting his hand palm upward in the manner of a supplicant if prayer can avail i will devote myself to it with a whole and willing heart i was clearly not persuading him otherwise so i did not press the matter further may your prayers prove more potent than any elixir i told him when our talk concluded a short while later we left avallach to his rest paulinus elfodd charis and i walked down to the lake where the monk showed us the plant which gave the potion its healing power putting off his tunic and sandals and rolling up his trouser legs he waded into the water bentbacked hands on knees dark eyes searching the cool green shallows in a moment he stopped and reached into the water and brought up a plant with long green leaves clusters of small pale pink flowers on a fleshy stem i knew the plant as that which the lakedwellers called ffar gros this he said pointing to the thick brown root when crushed with the leaves and stalks of the garlec and the brillan mawr in equal measure and the whole prepared as i have told you provides such benefit as we can supply then as if proving the taste of the imagined remedy he added i think a little liquor of the rhafnwydden will make it more palatable returning to the bank he quickly secured the other plants he had mentioned for indeed they grow readily in woods and along most watercourses throughout ynys prydein satisfied with his ingredients paulinus led us on to the abbey where after obtaining the necessary utensils he set about preparing the potion showing us how to strip the stems and roots of the plants before crushing and boiling them together with a small amount of salt water in a pot the water turned yellow and smelled of rotten eggs when he judged it prepared paulinus dipped out some of the cloudy liquor with a ladle and blew on it gently there are several ways to determine if it is well made he said but this is the best with that he put the ladle to his lips and drank it down yes it is ready offering the ladle to each of us in turn he gave us to drink of the draught taste he urged there is no harm in it pungent charis concluded wrinkling her nose slightly and bitter though not disagreeable she passed the ladle to me and i sipped some down the liquid tingled slightly on the tongue if given when the fever first commences paulinus instructed the best result is secured as i say i commended the monks sagacity and said this plague will be a match for any mans best your king could use you in the fight will you come with me paulinus was not slow to reply i will come with you lord emrys he turned in deference to his superior if that is abbot elfodd will permit my absence paulinus elfodd said in a fatherly tone you have received a summons from the high king you must go and as we somehow endured here before you came i daresay we shall make out when you have gone yes go i give you my blessing return when your service is completed paulinus inclined his head i am your man lord emrys good we will prepare as much of the potion as we can before you go charis offered we will send you away with a goodly supply elfodd approved her offer the brothers stand ready to serve many hands will speed the work i thank you both i knew it could not be wrong to come here to paulinus i said hurry now we will leave as soon as you are ready charis and i left elfodd and paulinus to their work and returned to the palace she made no sound as we walked along so i asked are you frightened of the plague she asked with slight surprise not in the least in my years on the glass isle i have seen all that illness and disease can do hawk death no longer holds any terror for me why do you ask you have said nothing since leaving the abbey she smiled wistfully it is not from fear of plague i assure you if i am reticent it is because you will be leaving soon and i do not know when i shall see you again come with me oh merlin i dare not would that i could but why not i will be needed here indeed your skill will be welcomed wherever you go i told her arthur would find a place worthy of your skill and renown i paused i know he would like nothing more than to see you again gwenhwyvar too and i would like nothing more i assure you she replied but my place is here i have lived so long upon my tor i could not abandon it now especially in these troubled days i wish more had your courage bless you my hawk perhaps when this present difficulty is over i will come to caer melyn and stay a while with you yes she said making up her mind i will do that while waiting for paulinus to join me i rode to shrine hill it was in my mind to spend a moment at the small wattleandmud chapel in prayer before returning to the fray the shrine on its hump of a hill beside the tor is kept clean and in good repair by the monks from the abbey they venerate the place since it was here the good news first came to britain with joseph the wealthy tin merchant from arimathaea the shrine is a simple structure limewashed with a reedthatched roof over a single room containing a small stone altar i dismounted outside and entered the cool dark room to kneel on the bare earth floor before the altar the feeling of the saviour gods presence in that crude sanctuary remained as potent as ever it is an ancient and holy place here arthur was given his vision and call the night before he received the sword of sovereignty from the lady of the lake here too i saw the grail that most mysterious and elusive token of gods blessing and power kneeling in that humble place i said my prayers and when i rose once more to continue on my way it was with strength of heart and soul renewed paulinus and i left ynys avallach a short while later arthur was waiting and i was anxious to set my plan in motion it was this all travel to and from londinium must ceaseevery road and riverway sealed off every settlement and holding must be warned and provided with the elixir as to that i would have paulinus teach ten of the cymbrogi how to make the potion these ten armed with this knowledge would then range far and wide throughout ynys prydein taking word of the plague and instructing others how to combat it each monastery and abbey would like the glass isle become a refuge the monks and clerics would make the healing potion and dispense it to surrounding settlements and holdings instructing the people in the ways of combating the disease it was i reflected a poor strategy with which to fight so powerful an enemy as the yellow ravager still it was the only weapon we had and we must use it however we could seizing any advantage and every opportunity to strike and strike swiftly accordingly paulinus and i raced back along the briw retracing the trail to the landingplace where barinthus and the boat waited it was late the next day and the sun was almost down when i hailed the pilot while he and paulinus boarded the horses i stood watching the gloom deepen across the vale of mor hafren spreading like an oily stain over the water it was death i saw the dissolution of the summer kingdom that fairest flower extinguished in the first flush of its bloom before my eyes my heart grew heavy within me and cold great light what more can one man do the sun had set by the time we reached the far shore yet the night sky was light so we hastened on our way stopping once only to rest and water the horses we rode through the next day and most of the next night keeping close watch for the vandali but encountering none and reached the british encampment before dawn at our arrival one of the night guards roused arthur who abandoned his bed to greet us i protested the intrusion but he waved it aside i would have wakened soon in any event he said now we have a moments quiet to speak to one another he bade me join him at his tent where a small fire burned outside gwenhwyvar is still asleep he explained as we sat down at the fire i thought i saw more ships on mor hafren i remarked as we sat down by the fire lot is here as you know arthur answered idris and cunomor have come at last and cadwallo arrived the day after you left they are with gwalchavad and cador who are leading a raid to the south if all goes well they should return at dawn rhys appeared bearing a bowl and some cold meat and stale bread he offered the bowl first to arthur who pushed it towards me i will have something later he said but you have ridden hard eat and tell me how you have fared in the glass isle it was gods own hand that led me there arthur i told him breaking the bread i was right about the plague i know replied arthur llenlleawg told me about caer uisc i was wrong to oppose you i waved aside his apology i have brought word of a healing potion among other things i thought they said there was a monk with you to rhys i said fetch paulinus arthur will receive him now yawning all but swaying on his feet with exhaustion the monk was led forth arthur cast a dubious eye over him i give you good greeting brother he said amiably paulinus inclined his head uncertainly and i you he responded but oblivious to the honour paid him made no further salutation paulinus i said sharply shake off your lethargy man should the high king of britain not command your attention paulinus eyes grew wide as he snapped himself erect lord arthur forgive me my king i did not know it was you i thought he gestured vaguely towards the tent as if expecting a different king to appear still i thought that you would be a much older man arthur enjoyed this who then did you think me i took you for a steward paulinus blurted much chagrined the pendragon of britain he began forgive me lord jesu have mercy i meant no disrespect i forgive you readily arthur said i see you stand in need of sleep i will not keep you from it come to me when you are better rested and we will talk to rhys he said find this monk some place to lay his head where he will not be wakened by everyone who passes and give him something to eat if he is hungry thank you lord said paulinus then grateful to be relieved of further embarrassment he gave an awkward bow and scurried after rhys the high king watched him go shaking his head slightly i trust you know what you are doing he will serve i assured him he lacks experience of kings he has spent more time in the company of plants and healing herbs than that of noblemen and princes then he is what we need now arthur said and added in a sour tone not another grasping lord who thinks he knows better than his king how to wage war on the invader it is going badly then arthur picked up a stick snapped it and threw the pieces into the fire deliberately one after the other some would say so how does the matter stand he frowned into the fire behind him the sky lightened to a clear dawn the black boar and his piglets have fled into the hills he said and i heard frustration in his tone and it is the devils own work to get at them with every raid we merely push them deeper into the glens he threw another stick at the flames i tell you the truth myrddin they are more stubborn than badgers to root out he paused and brightened somewhat now that lot idris and the others have come we may begin to make better account of ourselves jesu knows we are doing all we can gwenhwyvar wakened by our talk emerged quietly from the tent she was dressed in a thin white mantle her hair wound in a strip of soft white cloth she settled easily beside arthur who put his arm around her shoulders and drew her to him greetings myrddin she said have you a good word for us no the word is not good plague is indeed upon us and there is no remedy then we must prepare as best we can yet my journey was not without some small consolation i added quickly for i have brought a monk who understands much about the disease he is going to help us i also learned this the pestilence likely issues from londinium the harbours there serve many foreign vessels paulinus tells me that plague often follows the trading fleet gwenhwyvar caught the full implication of my words at once londinium she gasped but cador is on his way there now he will be stopped arthur said it may be that he has not reached the city yet londinium must be sealed off i said all roads must be guarded and the rivers no one must enter or leave until the disease has run its course that means we cannot count on fresh supplies from londiniums markets gwenhwyvar said blessed jesu she leaned instinctively against her husband for comfort what are we to do artos we will fight this enemy like any other but it is not like any other enemy she snapped it spreads on the wind it slays all without regard and neither sword nor shield is proof against it all that can be done we will do i must go to my father she said already thinking ahead they must be told no he told her bluntly you will not go but i must warn my people it may be that they will be warned he replied firmly but i need you here his tone removed all dissent first we must tell the noblemen i suggested they will want to send word to their people the disease cannot have spread far yet arthur stood rhys a heartbeat later the high kings steward stood beside him summon the lords to attend me at once as rhys dashed away the king said what will come of this god alone knows the lords answered rhys call and assembled around arthurs fire a ring of faces some concerned others merely curious arthur did not bid them sit down but stood before them grave and solemn he wasted no words plague has come to britain he said simply you must send riders to warn your people the noblemen gazed at arthur in astonishment and looked to one another for explanation is this so they wondered in shocked voices how can it be trust that it is so the king told them the plague follows the trading fleet foreign merchants have brought this pestilence to our land tell us called one of the kings what is the nature of this pestilence how is it to be fought arthur indicated that i should tell them what i knew of it this plague is known from elder times as the scourge of the east i began it is the yellow death a sickness which spreads with the swiftness and voracity of fire by these signs it may be known the flesh fluctuates between intense fever and numbing chill the limbs tremble and shake noxious fluids bloat the body but there is no purging of the bladder in the final extremity the skin turns yellow and the victim vomits blood death brings release in the space of two days three at most yet we are not without some hope arthur continued we have with us a monk who knows how best to battle this yellow ravager now you will all summon such messengers as you deem best to ride to your clans and tribes and warn them of the danger messengers cried ogryvan i will go myself my people will hear of this plague from no mere messenger i will not abandon my realm in its crisis others made similar objection but arthur stood firm i need you here he replied the battle is joined you cannot leave cannot leave roared brastias cannot i give my aid freely or not at all i alone determine when i shall come and go i am your king arthur reminded him his voice hardedged as caledvwlch as you have pledged me fealty i hold authority over you it is my right to command and i order you to stay i too am a king brastias replied loftily the fealty i pledged is but token of the kingship i hold if i may not rule even so much as my own movements whether i stay or go then i hold no more authority than the lowest servant in my house arthur fixed him with a look of withering disdain he checked his anger before answering you know best what manner of king you are he replied his voice low and i will not make bold to dispute your claim but you do those you deem beneath you an injustice when you compare their rank to yours brastias swelled with rage arthur allowed him no time to reply time is precious to those we must warn and we waste it chattering about rights and rule summon your riders and send them to myrddin he will instruct them turmoil erupted at this command the nights lingering calm was shattered by shouts of alarm as the fearful tidings spread from camp to camp arthur gathered the dragon flight and chose three from among the volunteers to ride north bearing the warning to the lords who were on the way to join us ector especially and any other settlements they passed he also selected a force two hundred men who would be sorely missed from the ranks to lay siege to londinium these he dispatched with all haste in the hope that they might stop cador on his way to the markets as this guardian force departed those closest to arthur sat in council with him gwenhwyvar bedwyr cai llenlleawg and myself can anything be done asked cai speaking aloud the question foremost in everyones mind pray arthur replied solemnly pray god to remove this pestilence from our land or if that is not to be to show us the way through it truly i fear in my bones that unless the lord god upholds us this travail will prove the doom book four the healing dream one dry dry dry and hot the earth cracks the rivers wane no cloud touches the burning sky and the land parches beneath an unrelenting sun sacred springs dry up and holy wells echo to the sound of empty vessels there is no breath of wind or breeze to cool the land animals thirst their strength fails and they fall and falling die all the while the pestilence snakes along the lowland tracks like an unseen fog one after another the caers settlements and holdings are visited by the yellow ravager strengthened by die drought which drives men from their homes in search of water the pestilence steals over the land children cry and women mutter in fearfretted sleep men complain bitterly that this is arthurs fault the small kings blame him and plot treason in their hearts it would not be so if i held this land they boast i would put an end to this invader and drive all sickness from our shores this they say as if the vandal were no more than a drunken shepherd and the plague his mangebitten dog it steals the breath from my mouth to see how swiftly men abandon the one they pledged to serve through all things to the death but when faith fails men abandon all that sustains them they flee the source of their uncertainty rushing blind into betrayal and unbelief behold the narrow sea is ploughed with a thousand furrows as british boats sail for armorica with coward hearts oncebrave men put oar to water lest the land of their birth become also the land of their death well and well their fear can be forgiven they merely do what their faltering courage allows far worse and forever unforgiven are those who strive to use the suffering and torment of others to advance their own bloated ambitions there are four openly against arthur now gerontius brastias ulfias and urien the first two i understand indeed i know them only too well ulfias is weak and anxious to please his bellicose neighbour he has decided that peace with brastias is worth more than fealty to arthur in that he is much mistaken if only they had left the camp but no they stamped around poisoning the very air with their complaints stirring up resentment at every chance swaying the less steady with their insidious slanders weaker brothers listened to them and were led astray men like urien i can only wonder at urien his fiery enthusiasm has burned itself out his ardour so bright and warm in the beginning has grown cold this is the way of it some times god knows the hotter the fire the more quickly it dies still i had hoped for better from urien rheged young and raw and painfully eager to please it is true he yet seemed a solid enough nobleman given maturity and experience he might have grown into an able and honourable lord he would have found in arthur a steady and generous friend what i wonder turned him against arthur what failing did he perceive or more likely imagine what glittering inducement did brastias offer what irresistible promise to turn uriens firebright loyalty to sodden ash sadly even the most sacred vows are oft forgotten before the words die in the air ah let it go meddler there is no binding a heart that will not be bound less yet one that honours nothing higher than itself so be it this then is how lugnasadh found us plague ravaging the people and the black boar ruining all the land like the hounds of the wild hunt we pursued the invader north and east driving deeper into the manyshadowed glens somehow the vandali always remained just beyond reach they refused to fight preferring to flee most often travelling by night moving along the ridges and river valleys they were following albions ancient trackways into the rich heartland arthur sent swift messengers ahead along these routes to warn the settlements of the invaders approach even this simple task was made difficult by the fact that the wily amilcar had divided his forces and then divided them again there were now no fewer than seven enemy warbands loose in the land each under the command of a vandal chieftain intent on driving as far inland as possible plundering every step of the way twrch trwyth seemed well pleased to allow his piglets to scatter while he escaped north and east with the main body of the vandal host there must have been a purpose to this mad design but i could not discern it still we pursued relentlessly catching them when we could fighting when battle was offered but mostly arriving a day behind their latest flight futility dogged us and the constant sun burned us black provisions ran low a persistent problem nagging as the ache in our empty bellies for with londinium quarantined we were forced to buy grain and cattle from smaller markets as far away as eboracum and just getting enough was as tedious as it was timeconsuming meanwhile the small kings took to squabbling among themselves and disputing arthurs command this alone would have been the undoing of many a lesser man but arthur had the plague to fight as well and that proved no less stubborn than the black boar i see paulinus grown haggard and gaunt in his battle against the scourge how not he rests little and rarely sleeps he toils like a slave demented teaching organizing making and dispensing his medicine the shy monk has become a valiant warrior as relentless in his own way as any of arthurs chieftains engaged in a fight no less fierce than any fought with amilcar at first word of a settlement or holding where the plague had taken hold that was where paulinus wanted to be taking no thought for himself he gave all to the battle winning renown in the war against the yellow destroyer others saw his example and were inspired to follow him so together with a handful of brothers from llandaff who willingly joined him in the work he shouldered the task of fighting the plague but the disease like the invader ran far far ahead without slackening pace there seemed to be no way to contain or subdue either of them thus when his lords began deserting him arthur took it hard be at ease bear bedwyr said trying to calm the king we do not need the likes of brastias raising hackles at every turn we were gathered in the large council tent but arthur angry with the wayward kings had not summoned them he sat with his elbows on the board frowning while those nearest the high king tried to lighten his gloom better to see the back of them i say cai added he is right bear cador put in they took but three hundred riders with them all told blessed jesu it is not the loss of a few horses i mind roared arthur three have defied me to my face how long do you think it will be before the rot sets in with the rest gwenhwyvar bright seraph in a cool white mantle leaned close allow me to go to my people she soothed the erean kings are willing indeed they are eager to repay the debt they owe britain you need only ask it would do no harm to replace the riders and warriors we have lost bedwyr argued it may be that the arrival of the irish lords will shame the weakwilled and encourage the loyal that would be no bad thing gwalchavad offered adding i welcome any man who stands beside me in this fight gwenhwyvar took arthurs right hand in both of hers why do you yet hesitate my husband there is neither shame nor harm in this she clasped his hand and pressed it earnestly as she would press her argument the sooner away the sooner returned you will hardly know that i have gone arthur considered this he hovered on the threshold of yielding what say you myrddin your wise counsellors have given you good advice i replied why ask me but i am asking you arthur growled very well i said but before i could deliver my answer the hunting horn sounded outside a short blast followed by two more someone has come cai said jumping to his feet he paused do you want me to bring them to you bear see who it is first arthur said sourly rhys signal indicated a newcomer to the camp cai left and we prepared to receive our guests in a moment cais voice called arthur you should come out you will want to see these visitors arthur sighed pushed back his chair uthers great camp chair and rose slowly what now throwing aside the tent flap he stepped out and i followed cai was standing a short distance from the tent gazing down the hill towards the stream mounting the slight rise towards us was a crowd of clerics three bishops no less with thirty or more monks the bishops wore rich priestly garb long dark robes and glittering gold ornaments they wore soft leather boots on their feet and carried goldheaded oak staves in their hands those with them however were arrayed more humbly in undyed wool heaven preserve us gwalchavad muttered aloud what are they doing here peace brother bedwyr advised it may be they have come to lend their aid against the plague any help in that struggle would be most welcome they do not look like men who have come to offer aid gwenhwyvar observed far from it i am thinking her womanly perception was keen as her eyesight for the knit brows and firm mouths of those who approached suggested solemn purpose and inflexible resolution the leading bishop thumped the ground with his crozier as if he were pummelling snakes and those around him walked stifflegged with shoulders tight and chins outthrust another time it might have been cause for laughter but not this day the bear of britain was in no merry mood rhys moved to take his place with arthur as the churchmen came to stand before us i recognized none of them nor any of their followers their arrival had of course drawn the attention of the men in camp curious to see what these important visitors would say soon a hundred or more had gathered which seemed to please the bishops rather than come face to face with the high king they halted a dozen paces away as if to force arthur to come to them i took this as a very bad sign hail brothers in christ hail and welcome arthur called to them in the name of our great lord jesu i give you good greeting hail to you the foremost bishop replied he did not deign to recognize the high kings rankneither did he nor any of the others offer his king the customary kiss much less the simple cordiality of a kindly blessing a better man than i arthur ignored the churchmans unwarranted insolence you honour our rude war camp with your presence my friends again i give you good greeting in the name of our lord and king he said amiably heaping as it were flaming coals upon their heads gwenhwyvar not to be outdone spoke up we might have prepared a better welcome had we known you were coming she said sweetly still we are not without common courtesy i smiled at this gentle rebuke of the bishops bad manners she turned to rhys bring the welcome cup she commanded nay lady the bishop said holding up an imperious hand he was a rotund man solid as an ale vat in his long robes his chief adornment a huge golden cross which hung around his neck on a heavy chain of gold we will not share the common cup with you until we have spoken out what we have come to say speak then bedwyr said fairly bristling with menace at the churchmens effrontery god knows you have succeeded in pricking our curiosity with your audacity if you think us too bold the bishop replied haughtily then truly you are more timid men than we presumed it seems to me replied cador perfectly matching the clerics icy tone that you presume too much then before the irate bishop could respond he changed tack ah but forgive me he continued smoothly perhaps you do not know who it is that addresses you with such good grace the young king raised his hand to arthur and said i give you arthur ap aurelius king of prydein celyddon and lloegres chief dragon of the island of the mighty and high king of all britain the pompous cleric almost burst at that he glared at cador and muttered we know who it is we have come to see again cador was ready with a choice reply then i must beg your pardon once more he said lightly for it did seem to me you were in some doubt regarding the rank of the man you addressed i only thought to ease the burden of your ignorance if ignorance it was for i did not imagine such a grave insult could be intentional realizing he was bettered the gruff bishop inclined his head slowly i thank you for your thoughtfulness he replied turning to arthur he said if i have offended the mighty pendragon it is for me to beg his pardon arthur was losing patience who are you and why have you come he demanded bluntly i am seirol bishop of lindum he announced grandly and these are my brothers daroc bishop of danum and abbot petronius of eboracum he raised his monkish staff to his fellow bishops each in turn lifting a pale hand in the sign of peace we come with representatives of our churches as you see by this he meant the company of monks with them we come by authority of bishop urbanus of londinium who sends this with his sign he produced a parchment roll bearing the bishops sign and signature you have wandered far from home brothers arthur remarked lindum is many days to the north likewise eboracum and londinium is no small distance away the matter must be of some import that you travel so far in such troubled times well you know it lord seirol affirmed imperiously we have braved many hardships and this so that you would not have cause to doubt our resolve you seem most resolute to me arthur answered bedwyr who sensed approaching danger warned under his breath tread lightly bear bishop seirols nostrils flared with anger i had heard of the rough ways of our great king he said disdainfully i fully expected my share of abuse if you think us too rough cai remarked then truly you are more delicate men than i presumed many of the onlookers laughed outright and the churchmen shifted uneasily the bishop stared sullenly around raising his crozier slowly he gave a sharp rap on the earth silence he cried you ask why we have come here i will tell you we have come to perform our most righteous and holy duty in demanding that you arthur ap aurelius foreswear your kingship and yield the sovereignty of britain to another what the incredulous voice was bedwyrs but the thought was in every head arthur forsake the throne that is indeed a matter of some consequence arthur remarked drily unless you are more fool than you seem you must have sound reason for this grave suggestion i would hear it now churchman bishop seirol frowned but failing to discern whether arthurs reply slighted him or not he drew himself up and launched into the explanation he had prepared flourishing his crozier he proclaimed since we have braved many dangers do not think we will be easily discouraged the land is in turmoil and the people are hard pressed all day long we are sore beset plague and owar have proved the doom of many and the land calls out for justice we are not unmindful of these travails cador assured him if you da but look around you will observe that even now you stand in a war camp at the forefront of the battle or did you think this was londinium or caer uintan and we were all hiding safe behind high walls bishop darocs anger flared your impertinence is unbecoming lord cador oh yes we know you too you would do well to heed our indictments who hold sway over the eternal security of your soul i had thought cador responded coolly that god alone held dominion over my soul and since i have placed my trust in him say and do what you will i fear no mortal man bishop seirol pressed on with his attack hear me proud king do you deny that the enemy overruns the land with impunity do you deny that the land is wasted by pestilence how replied arthur slowly could i deny what is perceived by even the dullest eye you must know that i have sent messengers far and wide throughout the land with the warning an expression of triumph transformed the bishops face he raised outspread arms and turned this way and that exulting in his imagined victory hear me warriors of britain seirol cried in a thunderous voice these twin travails of plague and war have come upon us by the immorality of one man he flung a hand at arthur and shouted arthur ap aurelius you stand condemned of god truly the evil ravaging the land flows from your iniquity alone and from the wickedness of your reign the accusation hung in the air for a long awful moment then cais voice cracked the stunned silence iniquity and wickedness he hooted in sharp derision bear we have heard enough from this puffedup toad allow me to run them out of camp with the flat of my sword by what right do you come here like this to defame the king of britain demanded gwenhwyvar tartly i am the bishop of lindum seirol cried i speak for the holy church of christ on earth since there is but one saviour we are united in one body thus when i speak i speak for god i am caius ap ectorius of caer edyn cai spat stepping towards the churchman his hand on the hilt of his sword i say you are an addled windbag and i speak for every man here the absurdity of seirols charge defied us to take it seriously but the bishops were in dead and utter earnest they had worked themselves up to this preposterous indictment and meant to havetheir full say bishop petronius his features convulsed in a murderous scowl pushed forward kill us if you will he hissed we expected no less from you all the world shall know that we were martyred in pursuit of our duty by vicious and spiteful cutthroats persist in speaking to your king thus bedwyr warned his voice low with menace and we will not disappoint you priest bloodshed and murder is all you know charged bishop daroc death will not stop our voices the truth will not be silenced our blood will cry calumny from the very ground shall we put it to the test gwalchavad inquired arthur raised his hand peace brothers he said his tone even he looked to seirol you have made grievous complaint against me friend now i would hear your proof the bishops exchanged glances and an expression akin to worry flitted across seirols flushed face they had thought the charge selfevident and had not anticipated a direct challenge so do the arrogant and selfrighteous ever remain swift to observe the mote in others eyes while oblivious to the log in their own they trembled now for the first time beginning to doubt themselves well i am waiting pressed arthur where is your proof beware vituperous priests i warned stepping forward you stand in the presence of one whose honour is above reproach but instead of praising him as you ought you impugn him with foul slander woe to you and shame were you men of honour you would fall on your faces and plead forgiveness for your sins were you true servants of christ you would drop to your knees and beg pardon i shouted and the air shivered pray mercy from the king of kings on earth who rightfully holds the rule of this land from the high king of heaven kneel before him for i tell you the truth you stand to forfeit your worthless lives no one had spoken to them like this before and the perfidious monks gaped in horror and disbelief yet they were so consumed with condemnation and their own selfimportance that they could not accept the truth as i spoke it bishop seirol infuriated by my outburst lunged forward angrily recklessly you ask for proof he cried you ask for proof i tell you the proof of my accusation stands beside you o king with that the bishop lofted his clerics staff and gazed around with a flourish of exaggerated pomp he levelled the crozier and pointed i felt my blood surge within me as i prepared to meet his allegation i would meet and answer the slandering monk stroke for stroke but it was not me he pointed to no that unjust honour fell to gwenhwyvar behold the bishop crowed she stands brazen and unashamed in the sight of all what need have i of further proof both arthur and gwenhwyvar were taken aback by this extraordinary outcome the nature of the accusation escaped them it did not escape me however i knew precisely what the foul churchman insinuated for the love of christ man i whispered harshly withdraw and say no more i will not withdraw seirol exulted he now imagined he had won his case and made bold to pursue his victory further this woman is irish he said his voice ripe with insinuation she is foreign and a pagan your marriage to her o king is against gods law as sure as you stand beside her you stand condemned petronius emboldened by seirols example entered the dispute since the beginning of the world he charged never was there plague in britain until you became king and took this pagan irish woman for your queen it was difficult to determine which he thought the worse that gwenhwyvar was pagan or that she was irish or indeed that she was a woman bishop daroc thrust himself forward it is the judgment of god upon us for this immoral kings crimes god is not mocked his laws endure forever and his punishment is swift arthur grave and calm replied in a voice so even and restrained that hearing it froze the marrow of those who knew him well i am no scholar of holy writ that i freely confess my life is otherwise spent in bloodshed and strife is your life spent sneered petronius and was swiftly silenced by the arch of arthurs eyebrow but tell me now arthur continued raising his voice slightly is it not sin to bear false witness against a brother well you know it replied seirol smugly under gods law those stand condemned who exchange the truth for a lie and does not this selfsame law you invoke invite him who would condemn another to first present himself blameless the bishop all but laughed in arthurs face do not think to turn that great teaching to your defence seirol crowed i was shriven at dawn and bear no taint of sin which can be reckoned against me no wondered arthur his voice the warning rumble of thunder then hear me impudent monk you have sinned three times since you came into this camp and for those sins i call you to account you dare malign a bishop of christ charged the outraged cleric i have not sinned once much less three times liar roared arthur finally roused to the attack he lifted a balled fist and slowly raised one finger you accuse me of iniquity and wickedness and call down the judgment of god upon me yet when i demand proof of these accusations you offer none instead you carry the assault to the woman god himself has given me regarding gwenhwyvar he slowly raised a second finger you call her pagan who is like yourself a christian born of water a baptism to which fact i can call to witness charis of ynys avallach and abbot elfodd himself and since as you happily remind us there is but one saviour and all who call upon him are united in one body you do falsely judge her and call her pagan who is in truth your sister in christ thus you twice condemn one who is innocent only then did the churchman feel the sand wash out from beneath his feet the colour drained from his face those with him did not yet perceive the fatal blow though even as they watched the stroke was falling upon their uncomprehending heads arthur raised another finger lastly you lie when you say you have no sin for you have sinned in the sight of these many witnesses since first you began to speak i have no doubt that you would continue adding sin to sin were i to allow you to go on speaking bishop daroc drew himself up we are not under judgment here are you not demanded arthur he is ever under judgment who bears false witness against his brother the sun has not yet reached midday and already you have in your own words exchanged truth for a lie and not once only but three times for this you stand condemned out of your own mouth alight with righteous wrath arthur challenged what have you to say churchman i am listening but i do not hear your answer can it be that when you have no lie in your mouth you have nothing to say the chagrined bishop having no reply to offer glowered at arthur but kept his mouth firmly shut too late you show wisdom arthur told him would that you had thought to exercise it sooner as it is you have wasted much in a long and dangerous journey to flaunt your foolishness i am certain you could have accomplished that without setting foot beyond lindum or is there yet a further purpose to your visit some other grievance against your king bishop daroc could not resist flashing a brief glance in cadors direction thereby betraying the true essence of the priests complaint his ears flushed red and colour rose in his cheeks so understanding broke like sunrise over arthurs countenance myrddin warned me about holy men and worldly wealth how well he knows your kind indeed lord remarked cador you should have heard their shrieking when i suggested we had need of the golden trinkets gathering dust in their treasure chests arthur addressed the bishops with thunder in his voice you have lied to your king and borne false witness against your queen for no better reason than because i sought relief and sustenance for my men in the wealth of the church i am sworn to defend your selfishness and pride that only brought you here and all who have witnessed this shameful exchange now see your naked greed and poverty of spirit he shook his head slowly you are no christian men hear me sons of vipers for your sins you will be stripped and flogged and driven from this camp you will be conducted to llandaff where the holy illtyd true priest of christ will decide your punishment pray that he has more compassion than i for i tell you straight i will advise him to turn you out of the church lest you bring the blessed jesu himself into disrepute with your pride and ungodly conceit so saying the high king reached out and lifted the gold cross and chain from around seirols neck you will no longer need this i think and we can use it here to buy food and drink for hungry warriors he turned away from the sputtering cleric gwalchavad cador take them to llandaff and tell illtyd all charge him devise fit punishment cai watched as the odious priests were led away you should have let me deal with them bear he said god knows they have already been the downfall of many their punishment best comes at illtyds hand arthur replied for he is a holy man and they will not be able to console themselves with the secret thought that they were misunderstood or compelled unfairly by a pagan he made to turn away but gwenhwyvar now stood before him hands on hips her shapely brows knit together and dark eyes ablaze this matter is not ended yet o king she said i have been reviled for my birth in the sight of everyone here honour demands satisfaction suspecting a subtle trap arthur cocked his head to one side what do you propose he asked warily just this that i sail at once for ireland and summon lords who by the strength of their devotion will make faithless britons everywhere weak with envy and sick with shame to see such homage as my noble race shall offer the last clouds of anger lifted then from arthurs brow he looked at his wife sharp appraisal mingled with deep appreciation and what gratitude recognition yes he saw in her a soul as staunch and zealous as his own fiercely loyal and steadfast through all things and like himself more than a match for a handful of fallacious monks and faltering lords the bear of britain smiled and relented men of valour are ever welcome at my side he said speaking loud for all to hear and if the nobles of ierne prove more loyal servants of britain than britains own sons so be it let those who abandon faith and fealty bear the shame of their disgrace wickedness and deceit have no place in my realm and any man who embraces the truth is friend to me gwenhwyvar kissed him then and the embrace was lauded by the throaty cheers of all who looked on the queen sailed on the next tide with ships enough to bring the irish back twelve ships and men enough to crew them at arthurs behest llenlleawg and i went with her two we made landfall in the bay below muirbolc commanding barinthus and his men to hold the ships ready to sail we made our way at once to fergus stronghold which we found utterly abandoned the houses were vacant and the hall was silent though cattle stood in the pen and there were horses in the stable we dismounted and stood in the yard wondering where they had gone and when gwenhwyvar moved towards the hall allow me llenlleawg told her darting ahead he disappeared inside and emerged but a moment later to announce it is not long abandoned the ash bed in the hearth is warm yet gwenhwyvar remounted her horse we will go to rath mor she said it may be that conaire knows what has happened here we turned our horses and hastened into the wood on the trail leading to conaires stronghold we had not ridden far however when llenlleawg halted in the track ahead and held up his hand listen i paused and attuned myself to the sounds around me birds warbled overhead and the horses champed and chafed the ground with their hooves beyond that the light breeze fluttered leaves in the higher branches and higher still a hawk keened its lonely cry was this what had halted llenlleawg no there was something else i heard it nowas if coming on a wave of the wind the wailing shriek i recognized at once as the screech of the irish pipes it is the piobairachd of battle the irish champion said there must be a fight this way cried gwenhwyvar pushing past us and away we continued on the trail for a short distance then gwenhwyvar led us off the track beside a small brook reduced to little more than a bare trickle through the undergrowth it was cooler down in the little dingle and as we splashed along i noticed the sound of the pipes growing gradually louder until mounting the bank of the brook we burst from the treelined shade and onto a broad woodsurrounded meadow adazzle in the sun and there on the meadow were two mounted forces arrayed and positioned for battle between these alone and on foot facing one another were conaire and fergus brandishing the huge twohanded cldimor the ancient clan sword both blades glinted as the combatants whirled them around their heads gwenhwyvar took one look at the flashing swords and lashed her horse yah she cried and galloped across the meadow yelling stop that stop it i say father the queen shouted flying directly to the centre of the clash she slid from the saddle before her mount had stopped are you mad what are you doing stay back daughter fergus answered he was stripped to the waist and gleaming with sweat and oil he had been anointed for battle and the sunlight made every muscle glisten and gleam there were leather bands at his wrists and binding his legs from knee to ankle in all he appeared a celt from another time as he leaned upon his great weapon breathless from his exertion this is a fight to the death this is absurd gwenhwyvar contended put up your swords both of you aside from a neat cut on conaires arm there was little evidence thus far of any deadly intent stand aside woman king conaire told her this is between fergus and me alone the pipes screeched on skirling loudly silence gwenhwyvar screamed at the pipers who faltered to a squawky stop she turned back to the two kings fists on hips and in a tone that brooked no foolishness demanded now tell me why are you standing out here hacking at one another like finn mac cumhaill and usnach blue shield do not think to intrude here conaire growled we mean to settle this before the sun passes midday do your worst conaire crobh rua fergus said tightening his grip on the great sword once more answer me commanded gwenhwyvar addressing conaire why are you fighting fergus spoke first he has heaped dishonour on the tribe of guillomar and i cannot allow such abuse to go unpunished come then cried conaire we will see who is to be punished here stand aside woman he made to raise the sword over his head gwenhwyvar put her hand to the naked blade and held it she confronted him her face a hairs breadth from his conaire red hand you tell me what has happened and tell it now i will not conaire i it was it he stammered the weapon beginning to waver it is all fergus doing ask him for my sword speaks for me you hold the fealty of five lords and are bound by strong oaths to protect them gwenhwyvar told him still holding the blade and keeping his arms aloft therefore i demand to know why you are attacking one of your own kings i will tell you nothing ask fergus i am asking you conaire was redfaced with anger his arms trembling with the effort of holding the heavy sword above his head woman you do vex me most sorely he growled i have told you it is all fergus doing liar cried fergus pressing close stand aside daughter let me finish him now father keep still she faced conaire and demanded will you speak yet or must we stand here all day i glanced at llenlleawg and saw that he was smiling obviously enjoying the dispute even so his spear was in his hand and ready the huge sword trembling above his head conaire rolled his eyes and gave in to her demand you are worse than your father he snorted in disgust let my hands down and i will tell you gwenhwyvar satisfied with his reply released the sword and stepped back a pace well it is that accursed priest ciaran has done nothing to you fergus charged thrusting forward gwenhwyvar pushed him back and addressed conaire what about the priest he stole six of my cattle the king complained weakly your cattle wandered away when your cowherd fell asleep fergus said the priest found them and took them to his own pens he offered to give them back oh he offered he offered if i would come and get them he would give them back well demanded gwenhwyvar growing more exasperated with each passing moment it is only so that he can rail at me with that that creed of his conaire insisted he defies me to listen to him and says that he will make a christian of me yet but i will have none of it what are you afraid of man fergus challenged hear him out and make up your mind no one can make you believe anything you do not want to believe and you fergus mac guillomar are a fool conaire rejoined you are beguiled with the babble of that priest most malicious of men he has stolen your wit as well as reason christians look at you fergus you cannot even fight your own fights anymore i see what listening to priests has done to you and i will not go down that path gwenhwyvar spoke up i am a christian too conaire she said coolly do you think me weakwilled and witless conaire raised a warning finger stay out of this you this is no concern of yours is it not she asked i rather think it concerns all who hold the christ as lord over them then draw your weapon and stand behind your father conaire told her and i will give you stroke for stroke what i give fergus go to it then cried fergus do your worst oh stop it both of you gwenhwyvar snapped conaire we do not have time for this if it is a fight you want listen to me now the vandal host is laying waste to ynys prydein i have come to raise the warbands of eiru to aid arthur fergus was only too happy to be distracted from the tussle at hand did you mean to keep it from us daughter why my men and i are ready we will put to sea at once he turned to his warriors who stood looking on bid your kin farewell men arthur needs us turning back to gwenhwyvar he said arthur in need say no more that is good enough for me conaire frowned well i care little for that i will not go gwenhwyvar could scarce believe the mans stubbornness after all arthur has done for you she challenged is this the thanks of a noble lord britain suffers now because arthur helped you what son of king leaves his realm unprotected conaire sniffed putting on a brave display of indifference he did it to save you gwenhwyvar declared more fool he replied the irish king smugly i did not ask his help nor did i need it if not for arthur you would be dead nowyou and all your people with you conaire red hand and if i were dead i would not have to keep hearing about arthur gwenhwyvar her face flushed with rage spun from him go father ready your ships and men llenlleawg and i ride to rouse the southern lords this lord will not be roused conaire insisted nor any beholden to me go your way conaire gwenhwyvar told him you are of no consequence anymore i will not go well and good and neither will i allow my lords to sail to britain he said this is no concern of the uladh or its kin arthur needs help and i am pledged to give it fergus said all i have i owe to him more he is my kinsman through the marriage of my daughter i am going to help him and i say you will not go and i say i will you will not silence gwenhwyvar screamed she faced the irish king squarely you can choose not to help us she said anger seething from every pore that is your right but you cannot prevent fergus from going if he is so resolved no allowed conaire growing sly i cannot prevent him from going but he turned a defiant gaze upon fergus if you leave your lands are forfeit snake snake cried fergus you cannot do that stand back and watch what i do do not listen to him father gwenhwyvar said go and ready the men since you are going conaire continued i advise you to take your priests and people with you for i tell you the truth there will be no home for you if you return take the land fergus bellowed drawing himself up with immense dignity and i take back my oath of fealty to you i once pledged myself to a true king but you are not that man go your way conaire crobh rua i am done with you what need have i of a faithless lord like you conaire sneered i will give your lands to men who honour their oaths and do not go chasing after priests of strange religions fergus drew breath to reply gwenhwyvar put her hands on his chest and turned him go now say nothing more indeed her father replied there is nothing more to say he turned and hastened back to his waiting warband and the gathered throng of his tribe in a moment they began moving away i leave also conaire gwenhwyvar said my only regret is that i may not deal with you as you deserve but hear me now the day will come when you rue your shameful behaviour and on that day may your stone gods save you she turned leaving him gaping after her gwenhwyvar swung into the saddle wheeled her mount and galloped away conaire turned to me and put out a hand as if he would explain you have had your say o king i told him may your hasty words be a comfort to you as you sit in your friendless hall i paused allowing him to think about this but it does not have to end that way put conceit behind you join arthur and help him now as he helped you his handsome face tightened like a fist that i will not do so be it i turned my mount and rode after the others when fergus reached muirbolc a short time later he was less happy with his decision he sat downcast on a stool while around him the clan prepared to leave their home for ever gwenhwyvar did her best to console him but she was anxious to be away once more i am sorry fergus sighed i lost the land land our fathers have held since the dew of creation was still fresh on the earth you did well gwenhwyvar assured him better an empty bowl with a true friend than a feast with an enemy i lost the land he sighed shaking his head sadly i gave it to him arthur has a surfeit of land she told him i am certain he will reward your loyalty most generously that was all she said but it remained with me for some time after leaving fergus to oversee the work we three continued on llenlleawg led as he had recently come this way on an identical task we rode first to aedd perhaps the most ardent supporter of arthur among the southern irish and also the nearest and two days later received a hearty reception hail and welcome aedd called as we dismounted before his hall the sun was well down stretching our shadows long we were travelweary and glad to quit the saddle i give you good greeting my friends the irish king spread his arms wide in welcome i have been hoping to see you again but i did not think it would be so soon we greeted and embraced him and gwenhwyvar said it is no happy chance that brings us there is trouble aedd said glancing from one to the other of us i see that it is so we have come to gwenhwyvar began but aedd would not allow her to demean herself by asking his aid you have come to share the welcome cup with one who would be numbered among your many friends he said quickly come take your ease gwenhwyvar agitated at her inability to make herself understood tried again would that i could she said but i fear we must you must not worry about anything while you are here aedd said he took her hand and drew her away with him towards the hall perhaps you should explain lord emrys llenlleawg suggested watching his queen disappear into the hall let us trust aedd in this i said in any event it is late and we can go no farther this day i could ride to laigin on my own the stalwart champion proposed stay i advised let us eat and rest and see what tomorrow brings aedd could not do enough for us he commanded servants to wait upon us while we were with him a man each for llenlleawg and myself and a maiden for gwenhwyvar he summoned forth the best of food and drink and directed his chief bard and harpers to sing soothing music when we finished eating he engaged us in amiable conversation but would not allow any talk of the trouble that had brought us to him thus we rose and went to our beds well satisfied with all save the most important part of our task i will speak to that man in the morning gwenhwyvar vowed i will not be put off again it is well for him to sit before the hearth spinning his nets of fine words but i am not a salmon so easily caught i will speak to him at first light and he will listen then let it rest until the morning i remarked it is a fine gift he has given us we have enjoyed a nights peace and the friendship of a generous lord far from the battle clash and the carping of smallminded men the queen bit her lip uncertainly i hope you are right i keep thinking of arthur and how he needs the aid we must bring that is a worry for tomorrow bright one she smiled at the epithet and did indeed brighten then i will leave it there she leaned close raised her lips to my cheek and kissed me god be good to you myrddin sleep well gwenhwyvars maid appeared with a rushlight to lead the queen to her sleepingplace i watched them go thinking how fortunate was arthur to have a wife with such intelligence and courage and so thinking i asked forgiveness of the great light more fool the man who regards her lightly i whispered there beats the heart of a lioness beneath that breast of beauty yes and an ironclawed will sheathed in a lithe and supple form three i wakened the next morning to an illhushed commotion outside my sleepinghut i sat up the sun had risen but only just the light was thin the air still yet ringing with the sound that had roused me the jingle of a horses tack in a moment the sound came again but it was not that of a single horse meanwhile the slap of bare feet gave way to the whisper of excited voices i threw aside the lambskin covering and rose from the pallet quickly pulling on my clothes seizing my staff i went outside upon emerging from the hut i saw the first horses arriving and knew at once what aedd had done without word or hint to us the canny king had dispatched messengers to each of the other southern lords and these had instantly assembled their warbands riding through the night to arrive at dawn this he had done to delight his guests god love him llenlleawg said when he saw the warriors standing in the yard here breathes a noble celt indeed like a sovereign of an elder time aedd had seen to the needs of his guests with a graceful selfeffacing generosity it was a virtue still lauded in song but now rarely encountered one could be forgiven for believing that it had passed out of this worldsrealm altogether but here was a man king in more than name only holding to the old way this nobility lifted him up and exalted him in our eyes and in the esteem of all who would hear of it in the days to come the three southern lords had come laigin diarmait and ulan with their massed warbands numbering in excess of two hundred and all on horseback aedds stronghold could not contain them all and most waited beyond the bank and ditch gwenhwyvar likewise roused by the noise appeared and hurried to where llenlleawg and i stood watching aedd as he gave orders to the warriors seeing that we had discovered his surprise aedd joined us have you told them of arthurs need gwenhwyvar asked and demean that great king aedd replied chiding her gently i would never say such a thing gwenhwyvar watched the teeming yard and wondered but you must have revealed something of the urgency of our distress to bring them at such speed lady aedd smiled expansively i have simply told them that arthur is desirous of increasing his joy with the pleasure of their company in his various adventures i may have mentioned the merest possibility of a battle they fought among themselves to be the first to respond to the summons my lord and i thank you the queen said i pray your kindness will be rewarded many times over aedd inclined his head then with a sudden sweep of motion caught up her hand and kissed it gwenhwyvar blushed prettily this is my reward he told her i desire nothing more as for these he lifted a hand to the assembled lords and warriors the chance to fight alongside arthur and encourage him with irish valour is all they ask one of the lords approaching us just then ulan i believe overheard this remark arthur has rightly shown his virtue he said now we must demonstrate ours or for ever hold ourselves men of small regard again i heard the echo of an older sentiment in his words llenlleawg had recognized it and named it and he was right here in this emerald island the old ways still lingered on the irish for all their failings yet held to the ideals of their ancestors and clung to the beliefs of an earlier age when kings were more than powerhungry hounds ever attacking one another and killing off the weaker members of the pack oh there were irish kings as grasping as any of course but it warmed my heart to see that these few at least were not like their brothers i must warn you gwenhwyvar was saying there is sickness in britain plague is there and more are dying of fever than ever see a vandal one enemy is much like another aedd answered each will be fought in its own way the plague will be to us only another enemy to be met and matched we will not shrink from the fight laigin called are we to grow old standing here there is honour to be won and i mean to get my share hear him shouted diarmait why do we linger even a moment longer when we could be gaining everlasting renown at this the gathered irish sent up a great clamour to be away gwenhwyvar overcome by the eager affection of her countrymen turned once more to thank the king but he would hear nothing of it you see how it is aedd said they will have their share of glory send them now for i can no longer hold them back gwenhwyvar stepped a few paces nearer the lords kinsmen and friends she said if arthur were here before you he could in no wise offer you greater thanks than i do now go and join him you will be welcomed even so do not think to increase your renown for i tell you truly she paused tears shining in her eyes any glory you win in battle cannot match that which you have already earned this day the irish lords and those men close enough to hear were greatly cheered by gwenhwyvars words no sooner had she finished than diarmait shouted a blessing send us with a blessing aedd turned to me myrddin would you i took my place beside gwenhwyvar and raised my staff stretching my other hand high palm outward i said strength of fortress be yours strength of kingship be yours strength of love and pride of homeland sustain you through all things the circling of christ to protect you the shielding of angels to guard you the aiding of god to support you in the hot rage of battle and the twistings of the fight be the holy christ between you and all things hurtful be the holy one of heaven between you and all things wicked be the holy jesu between your shoulders turning every harm to good upholding you with his swift sure hand forever upholding you with his swift sure hand so saying i sent them on their way to muirbolc and the waiting ships aedd bade us dine with him before leaving gwenhwyvar declined we will break fast in the saddle i think or we shall be left behind we departed the fortress as soon as the horses were saddled aedd summoned his chief bard and one of his noblemen and directed them to hold the caer in his absence saying i give you full freedom to serve me in every cause while i am away should evil befall i bid you to seek the best for the people if your lot is good then i urge you to seek its increase and impart the benefit to all within your care both bard and chieftain vowed to uphold the kings will and extend his renown whereupon aedd bade them farewell and we left the stronghold in a white haze of dust upon reaching muirbolc once more we dismounted and stood on the cliffside overlooking the bay while the warriors and crewmen undertook to board the horses a task made difficult by the swirling surge of the tideflow once the animals were blindfolded however the boarding process proceeded smoothly soon the first ships were putting out to sea turning to aedd gwenhwyvar put her hand on his arm thank you my friend she said you do not know how much your courtesy and thoughtfulness have encouraged me never say it aedd replied what i have done is but a small kindness when held against all that you and arthur have given me lord gwenhwyvar wondered what have we given you save the chance to die on foreign soil fighting an enemy that is no more threat to you lady the irish king answered you have granted me the opportunity of raising sword alongside the most exalted hero of this age if i die so be it at least my blood will be mingled with that of champions and i will enter heavens fair hall in the company of men of vast and terrible renown what warrior dares hope for more we joined the ships then picking our way down the cliffside to the shore as llenlleawg boarded the horses aedd gwenhwyvar and i hurried to our ship waiting a little way out in the bay the irish used small round hide boats hardly larger than leather shields to carry us so that we would not have to wade through the surf barinthus helped us aboard leaning low over the side to steady the small coracle the wind is fair for a change and the sea is running i would we were away lord emrys he said as soon as we were all aboard we will make good sailing if we leave at once then do so man i urged lead on the rest will follow he scurried back to his tiller and began shouting commands to all within sound of his voice the big square sail swung up on creaking ropes ruffled in the wind puffed out and the ship swung away from the land within moments we were running before a fresh wind the lowriding sun sent yellow rays glancing off the green waves setting every crest alight and seeding the watery furrows with gold gradually the greens and gold of water and light deepened to the blues and greys of night as eventide stole over the wide seafield beneath a clear starfilled sky the sea danced and glittered divided at our passing by the ships sharp prow swirling in pools of molten moonlight in our wake the air remained warm occasionally wafting cool crosscurrents that splashed across my face i remained awake watching the lively sky and the slow progress of the glowing moon across heavens vaulted dome to be alive to the wonder of the commonplace i thought that is the very gift of a wildly generous creator who ever invites his creatures to contemplate the exuberance of his excellent handiwork there is a deep and abiding joy at work in this worldsrealm and we who toil through our lives do often forget this or overlook it but look it is all around ceaseless unrelenting certain as sunrise and constant as the rhythm of a heartbeat i stood as i say at the prow through the night the stars and silent watchful barinthus my only companions toward morning i saw the rich darkness of the eastern sky begin to fade i watched the sunrise with eyes beguiled by nights veiled mysteries dawnlight streaked the sky with the red of blood and banners staining the deephued water the play of liquid light and sinuous shadow cast me into a melancholy mood i felt the coming of day as the approach of a predatory presence my scalp tingled my stomach tightened my vision grew keen the boat rode the tideflow and the sunrise glinted like molten metal in flux swirling bubbling moving i lifted my eyes to the opposite shore now in shadowed silhouette against a burning sky it seemed to me as if the boat were no longer moving through water but gliding over endlessly coiling clouds passing like a phantom through the very essence of this worldsrealm behind me the world of sense and substance stark and solid faded from view before me opened the glimmering insubstantial otherworld the boat its bullnecked pilot and my fellow passengers vanished as if stolen by an allobscuring mist i felt the rising upsurge of my spirit as it shook off the dull unfeeling flesh and soared free fresh wind rushed over my body i tasted sweet air on my tongue in the space of three heartbeats my feet touched a far distant shore a woman wearing a long gown of gleaming sea blue stood waiting for me fair efface and form she raised a slender hand and beckoned me to follow i moved as one without thought or will shielding my dazzled eyes with my hand i looked for the sun but could see it no more the sky itself glowed with the intensity of brilliant white gold a radiant firmament reflecting a great hidden source of light that was everywhere present casting no shadows the woman led me to the foot of a high hill a short distance from the shore the estuary had disappeared and a sparkling green sea stretched to the far horizon we walked up the hill the broad flank covered with grass so green it glowed in the golden light like sunstruck emerald atop the hill a standing stone pointed like a long finger towards the shining sky the woman her long hair black as polished jet her green eyes shining with wisdoms undimmed light lifted her hand to the stone and in a voice soft as the breeze rippling the grass on the hilltop asked can you read the stone little man i stepped to the stone and saw that its rough surface was deeply carved with the spirals knotwork and mazelike patterns of old i gazed at the ancient designs letting my eye follow the intricate tracery of the cunning lines though i had seen it countless times before i could make no sense of it i cannot read them i confessed and turned away from the stone to see the womans face cloud and tears begin to fall from her lovely eyes she buried her face in her hands and her slender shoulders shook with sobs lady i said agitation making my voice tight why do you weep for sorrow that this confession should fall from your lips she said for you above all men should heed the signs carved in the stone i read words i countered give me words and i will discern their meaning she raised her tearful eyes and gazed upon me with an expression of deepest grief and mourning alas and woe she said now is our doom come upon us once there was a time when you would have beheld these selfsame signs and their meaning would have been clear to you this is my lament you then o son of dust might have read them as men now read their precious books this last was said as she turned and walked away i started after her but she held up her hand and bade me stay there will come after me another one who will lead you back the way you came by this i thought that i would return to the world i had left behind either i was mistaken or she meant something else for i waited and no one appeared yet something held me on that high hill through a day and a night i slept through the dark period and awoke to see a maiden approach she came to stand beside the tall stone i give you good greeting she said and smiled her teeth were even and white her brow high and smooth her eyes were bright she was dressed in a mantle of green and gold and her feet were bare in her hands she held a clothwrapped bundle which she opened to reveal a harp the harp was none other than my own for i recognized it what is this she asked in a voice to charm small birds from the sky and before i could answer she added in a warning tone though you think you know it surely you know it not at all i would be ignorant indeed not to know what i myself have held and played a thousand times i replied it is my harp she shook her head sadly though you say it is a harp and speak the word forthrightly it is clear you do not know it for if you had spoken in truth this instrument would have sung its name aloud the sound of your voice alone would have called forth music the maiden turned away and with a worldweary sadness rested the harp against the runecarved standing stone there will come after me another who will lead you back the way you came she said and disappeared leaving me alone once more three days and three nights passed and i awoke on the fourth day to see a tall youth standing beside the stoneso still he might have been a part of it like the woman his hair was dark and his eyes green his cloak was blue like the sky and his shirt leaf green his trousers yellow gold and his belt white as a cloud he carried a large cup or bowl in his hands upon seeing him i rose and stood before him i have been waiting for you i told him suddenly irritated at the delay though every heartbeat was a thousand years he answered you have not tarried half so long as i have waited for you anger leapt in his eyes like lightning seaming black storm clouds with fire i have waited all my life for you who are you i asked i am the king of summer he replied i knelt before him i am your servant lord stand on your feet little man you were never servant to me he sneered for how is it that the servant does not recognize his lord but i have never seen you i insisted even so i stand ready to serve you through all things get you away from me falsehearted one for if you had been my servant you would have heard my call and you would know what it is i hold here in my hands when did you call me lord myrddin he replied in a voice aching with sorrow i have ever called you from before the beginning of the world i have sung your name please lord i cried forgive me i did not hear i did not know with a look of mingled sorrow and disgust he placed the cup he carried beside the stone next to the harp he then started away lord i beg you i called after him he paused and looked back after me will come another who will lead you back the way you came the summer lord vanished then and i was alone once more i contemplated the stone and its carved symbols i gazed upon the harp but did not play it and mused over the meaning of the cup three days passed on my lonely hilltop and three dark nights a sound came to me as i slept and i awakened i rose and stood listening for the sound that had roused me almost at once i heard someone singing in a clear strong voice my heart beat more quickly i knew the voice though i had heard it only once before for there is none like it in all the world or any other i heard it and oh i knew it taliesin four i gazed across the hilltop to see a man striding towards me a fine and handsome man his hair gleamed like shimmering flax his cloak was blue as the night sky and full of stars his tunic was white and his trousers soft leather he carried a stout rowan staff in his right hand and a harp slung over his shoulder on a strap in all he looked a mighty bard penderwydd champion among bards my heart ached to see him for i realized there were no more of his kind in the world great light where are the men of power and vision whose words bring life from death and kindle goodness in the coldest hearts where are the men who dare great things whose deeds are legend hail taliesin i called casting aside my grief and running to meet him he seemed not to hear me for he strode on as if to pass by taliesin wait i shouted he halted and turned aside but did not greet me do i know you little man he asked and the question cut through me like the thrust of a sword know me but i taliesin i am your son he gazed at me searching me head to toe is it you myrddin he asked at last his mouth bent in a frown of disapproval what has become of you my son why i asked my heart breaking have i changed so much i tell you the truth he replied if you had not spoken my name just now i would not have known you he pointed to the instrument lying against the standing stone that is hafgans harp he said why is it sitting there embarrassed to have left it untended i retrieved the harp and cradled it to my shoulder and though i stroked and strummed i could but conjure a meaningless tangle of noise from the instrument i opened my mouth to sing and could produce only a strangled halfhearted sound stop he cried if you can play no better than that cast the thing aside it is useless as a rotten stick in your hands he then led me to the crown of the hill and pointed to the bluegreen sea stretching below us like some vast swathe of billowy silk he bade me look and tell him what i saw i see mighty manawyddans realm i replied deep as it is wide dividing the island nations one from another and what see you there he indicated the long sweep of the strand along the coast i see the waves ceaseless in motion whitecrested servants of the lord of the wavetossed sea taliesins hand dropped to his side they are not waves he said look again ignorant one and look closely this time tell me what you see still i saw the waves and only the waves washing back and forth upon the shore taliesin was not pleased with this answer how is it possible that you look and do not see has the light of discernment abandoned you he raised his hand level to the horizon and spread his fingers wide they are not waves he said again they are the boats of the people fleeing their homeland the britons are leaving myrddin in such haste and in such numbers as to agitate the ocean as he spoke those words the waves turned into boats the white crests became sails and the rolling motion the wake flung back from each and every prow and there were hundreds upon hundreds and thousands upon thousands of them all fleeing the shores of ynys prydein in great waves of homeleaving where are they going i asked aware that i was witnessing a disaster unknown in the island of the mighty from the days of its creation they are fleeing to realms much inferior to the land of their birth taliesin answered sadly where they will live brutish lives under rulers unworthy of them why i asked why do they abandon their lands and king they leave because they are afraid taliesin explained simply they are afraid because their hope has failed and the light which sustained it is extinguished but arthur is their hope and his life is their light i objected they are surely wrong to leave for the high king is yet alive in britain yes agreed taliesin arthur lives but how are they to know there is no one to sing his deeds no one to uphold him in song no one to extol him with highsounding praise and so fire the souls of men he turned accusing eyes on me where are the bards to sing arthurs valour and kindle courage in mens hearts i am here father i said you you myrddin since i am chief bard of britain i said proudly it is my duty and my right i sing arthurs praise how so he demanded you cannot read what is written on the stone you cannot coax music from the heart of the oak you cannot drink from the exalted cup chief bard of ants and insects you may be but you are no true bard of britain his words stung me i hung my head cheeks burning with shame he spoke the truth and i could make no reply hear me son of mine taliesin said and oh his voice was the wild windforce trembling the hilltop with its righteous contempt once you might have sung the shape of the world and the elements would have obeyed you but now your voice has grown weak through speech unworthy of a bard you have squandered all that has been given you and you were given much indeed i could not stand under this stern rebuke please father i cried falling to my knees help me tell me is there nothing i can do to turn back the waves who can turn back the tide who can recall the arrow in flight taliesin said no man can replace the apple on the bough once it has fallen even so though the homeleaving cannot be halted the island of the mighty may yet be saved i took heart at these words i pray you lord tell me what i am to do and it shall be done i vowed though it take my last breath and all my strength i will do it myrddin beloved son taliesin said that is the least part of what it will cost still if you would know what is to be done know this you must go back the way you came before i could ask what he meant taliesin raised his hands in the bardic way one above his head the other shoulder high both palms outward facing the standing stone he opened his mouth and began to sing oh the sound of his voice filled me with such longing i feared i would swoon to hear the sound of that bold enchanted voice was to know the power of the true word i heard and inwardly trembled with the knowledge of what i had once held in my grasp and somehow let slip away taliesin sang he raised his head and poured forth his song the cords stood out on his neck and his hands clenched with the effort wonder of wonders the standing stone cold lifeless thing began to change the slender pillar of stone rounded itself and swelled stretching thickening growing taller stubs of limbs appeared at the top these lengthened and split becoming manyfingered branches which swept out and up into the handsome crown of a great forest oak leaves appeared in glossy profusion deep green and silverbacked like birch this tree spread its leafy branches wide over the hilltop in response to taliesins glorious song my heart swelled to bursting at the splendour of the tree and the song that shaped and sustained it a song matchless in its melody extravagant spontaneous rapturous yet reckless enough to steal the breath away then as i stood marvelling the tree kindled into bright flame and began to burn red tongues of flame sprouted like dancing flowers among the branches i feared for the destruction of the beautiful tree and made to cry out in alarm but even as i stretched my hands towards the blaze i saw that the shimmering flames halved the tree dividing it top to bottom one half stood shimmering dancing alive redgold against a blue night sky the other half remained fullleaved and green in the bright light of day behold in the timebetweentimes the tree burned but was not consumed taliesin stopped singing and turned to me gazing with the sharp scrutiny of a master challenging his wayward pupil he asked now tell me what do you see i see a living tree where once was a stone i replied i see this tree half in flames and half greenleaved and alive the half that burns is not consumed and the half that resists the flame puts forth leaves of silver my father smiled i felt his approval and my heart quickened perhaps you are my son after all he said proudly lifting his hand to the tree he spread his fingers and the flames leaped higher sparks flew up into the night sky and became stars birds flocked to the green half of the living tree and took refuge in its branches small golden apples appeared among the leaves the birds ate the apples and were nourished and sustained this he said turning to me this is the way by which you must go son of mine see and remember he gripped my shoulder tightly now you must leave let me stay but a little i pleaded there is so much i would ask you i am ever with you my son he said gently fare well myrddin until we meet again the next i knew i stood alone on the hilltop before the halfflaming halfliving tree there i remained for a time whether short or long i do not know puzzling over the meaning of this conundrum repeating the words this is the way by which you must go but i came no nearer to an answer the weather changed a sharp wind gusted around me raw and cold hard rain began to fall stinging where it touched my skin driving me away gathering my cloak around me i peered over my shoulder one last time the solitary oak had become a grove and i understood that it was for me to enter there i stood for a moment hesitant fearful the way back led through the grove there was none other i understood still i hesitated great light i said at last go before me into this dark place be my saviour and my guide through all things whatever shall befall me and if it please you lord oversee my safe return i place myself under the protection of your swift sure hand and entreat you to surround me with heavens champions though i go into the pit there let me find you though i ascend the heights of moon and stars there let me find you where i go i go in faith knowing that wherever i am there will you be also i in you and you in me in life in death in the life beyond great light uphold me i am yours so saying i entered the grove the path lay silent the air heavy and redolent of the tomb no kindly ray illumined my passage it was as if i walked in the shadowlands alive yet cut off from the realm of the living the trees their thick gnarled trunks black with age and scarred by the gnawing ravages of timeseemed stout pillars holding aloft a canopy so green and dark that it formed a shroud over me i walked steadily but no eye marked my passing no sound of footfall attended my steps i had entered a sanctum a holy remove from the wider world a nemeton what is more moving among the trees i felt a strange familiarity with a shiver of recognition i realized where i was bryn celli ddu the sacred grove on the holy island hafgan dear blessed hafgan had told me about it when i was a boy within this secluded remove i sensed the spirits of the druidkind still lingering in the dense and dusky silence old beyond reckoning the trees were ancient when rome was still a muddy cattle pen they had witnessed the ascent and decline of princes kings and empires they had witnessed the slow ebb and flow of the years and seen fortunes wheel revolve in its ceaseless turning these trees had watched over the island of the mighty since the first days when the dew of creation was still fresh on the ground brutus of troy alexander cleopatra and great constantius had come and gone beneath their steady and unyielding gaze the learned ones had held discourse under their twisting branches and many yet slept in the bare earth beneath them hafgan had told me too about that terrible day long ago when the legions of rome attacked the grove on the holy island the bards of britain were felled like trees hacked to death by roman swords without protection of armour or weapons for all its genius the roman military mind failed to recognize that the grove not the learned brotherhood was their true enemy had they burned it down or uprooted the trees they would have triumphed that day for they would have cut the bardic fellowship to its heart relentless realists men of practical habits and cool logic the romans never imagined that the trees the symbol of the druid must be conquered the canny druids knew that flesh is weak it lives out its span dies and is no more they sacrificed the perishable to the imperishable the dying served the everliving and thereby gained the eternal the hardheaded roman generals watching the slaughter with cold eyes never guessed it was their own downfall they beheld for every drop of druid blood secured a future victory and every druid death a triumph the romans are gone now but the learned brotherhood lives on many very many have realized the end of truths quest in the cross of jesu the wise ones of the oak have become the brotherhood of christ the power of the holy grove is now the provenance of the holy church the great light moves how he will so be it in a little while my steps led me to the mound i knew i would find in the centre of the grove a round hump of stone covered by earth and turf its entrance barely visible in the gloom it was a tomb both actual and symbolic for as everyone knows actual symbols are always the most potent actual for the dead were truly buried within but symbolic too for here among the bones of the illustrious dead of elder days the seeker could lie down in figurative death that his living bones might commune with the agebrittle remains of his fathers now it was my turn i was the seeker stepping to the mound entrance i raised my face to the sky but could see nothing through the dense thatch of interwoven branches save a dull golden glow the boles of the mighty yews showed ironblack against the uncanny gloaming it was the timebetweentimes and i could already feel my feet on the path raising my hands to either side of my head i cried out in supplication in every stream headland ridge and moor traversing glens traversing forests traversing valleys long and wild fairest jesu be upholding me christ triumphant be my shield great king of mercy be my peace in every pass on every hill in every stream headland ridge and moor each lying down each rising up whether in this world or some other thus emboldened i bent my head and stepped into the mound once inside i was able to stand i did so and walked farther into the mound passing stone chambers on either side i came to another threshold crossed it and continued more chambers some still bearing the bones of the ancient dead i came to a third threshold and crossed it entering yet another chamber round as a womb and almost as dark my shadow shattered and danced on the walls around me quickened by a strange flickering light behind me the walls of this chamber had been limed with white and painted with blue designs the spiral and sundisc the mor cylch and cernunnos horn but the white had flaked away and the blue was little more than a stain on the rock there were bones piled neatly against one wall skulls round and white as river stones thin curved ribs arms and thighs i considered the impermanence of all things flesh and the timeless moment that is eternity i pondered the eagle of time sharpening his beak upon the granite mountain of this worldsrealm when the stone mountain has been worn away to a single grain of sand the eagle will fly away to the eyrie whence he came i meditated on these things as i stooped and stretched my hand towards a slender shinbone all at once the ground beneath my feet gave way as if a pit had suddenly opened under me the chamber where i stood was hollow and the floor weakened over time could not hold my weight i plummeted down into the blackness of annum the underworld realm had swallowed and claimed me i spun into the abyss darkness blacker than the cold embrace of death swarmed over me the world of light and life vanished somewhere far above extinguished like a rushlight in a gale i cast aside all hope and clung to my failing senses as a man hurled into the teeth of the storm i fell tumbling turning dropping down and down and down past roots and rocks past springs and pools and underground streams far far below i heard the clash and clatter of water breaking on rock in a vast hidden cataract falling swift and straight i struck the dark water and struggled to swim to rise but my clothes were heavy and my limbs exhausted i plunged beneath the surface and sank without hope into my cold deepwater grave in a rictus tight as rock my body was seized and borne along by swift currents over naked spires and crevices yawning wide in unending night over a landscape barren as it was bleak i flew far beneath the roots of the world i drifted deeper than the deepest whale deep in afancs realm i soared in a slow undulating flight through eons of earth ages i existed in my elemental wandering without breath without sight without sense a pure spirit pulled along by the slow circulation of annwns unseen ocean bereft of all volition i moved where the currents moved me i became light and tenuous as a single thought possessing only a thoughts ineluctable freedom in this way was myrddin emrys reduced and undone i became nothing less than nothing trackless was my journey unknown and unbeheld by any save god alone outward and inward drifting over broken vistas of the underworld and my own arid soul the two were one and the same to me the darkness of the pit was my inner darkness its emptiness my own i was a ripple on the crest of a secret wave i was a fleeting disturbance in the hidden deep i was nothing the silence of the tomb engulfed me a stifling suffocating quietude solid as granite and as heavy i shouted my name aloud in defiance but my voice could not penetrate that dense oppression and the word fell at my feet like a bird dead from the sky i felt the mass of this deadweight silence on my skin as if i were immersed in an ocean of firethickened pitch i wandered i know not where creeping with utmost care over a rough stone floor that slanted away from me descending with every step down and down and down into a darkness immense and greedy occasionally i passed a fissure where i glimpsed the dim flicker of lurid flames crackling up from a deepchambered cell below at one such crevice i felt the hot blast of vented gas like the belch of a firethroated dragon the heat gust washed over me in a great hissing gasp my eyes stung and nostrils burned with the acrid sulphurous stink tears streamed from my eyes my nose ran and my breath came in racking gulps choking gagging i stumbled on bowed by the rack in my lungs and the pain in my eyes each step a cry of defiance gradually i came to feel the presence of another with me in the gallery walking but a short distance ahead as it seemed to me i say that i became aware of this presence for i think the stranger had been with me from the first step but i had been too absorbed in my own misery to perceive her yes i knew as one knows in a dream that a female presence went before me leading me along the deathdark corridor matching my steps with hers stopping when i stopped moving when i moved once i stumbled and fell down on hands and knees i heard the footsteps continue a little way ahead of me wait i shouted lest i be left alone once more my voice struck the rock surface like the flat of a hand but the steps ahead halted and then turned back they came towards me i heard the soft footfall return closer until the woman stood directly over me though i could not see her i knew she was near please i said wait but a little do not leave me here alone i expected no reply from my phantom companion nevertheless my plea was answered then get you up merlin the woman commanded sternly or i will leave you that voice i knew it ganieda is it you the footsteps started away again wait please wait i shouted scrambling to my feet once more do not leave me ganieda i have never left you my soul she answered her voice echoing back to me from somewhere ahead and i never will leave you but you must hurry i raised myself and lurched onward desperate now i must catch her dragging myself along striking the solid jutting stone walls now and again with hands and arms and elbows however fast i moved she remained that many paces ahead of me i could not gain so much as half a pace on my beloved guide i ran growing breathless in the pursuit my chest heaved with the effort but i did not slacken my pace just when i thought i must faint i felt cool fresh air on my face and perceived a lightening of the darkness ahead a slight but discernible greying of the allpervading shadow in which i moved a dim grey pall like false dawn hung over the room into which i stumbled no more than a dozen paces ahead of me stood my beloved ganieda she appeared as she had on our wedding day dressed in a fine white linen mantle with a golden bell on each and every tassel of her hem her black hair brushed to shining and braided with silver threads and on her fair brow a circlet of spring flowers folded over one shoulder she wore a cloak of imperial purple and skyblue check of the northern tribes the folds fastened with a splendid golden brooch gold bracelets and bands graced her slender wrists and arms and white leather sandals held her feet all this i beheld with ease for a light radiated from her dim and diffuse but distinctas if her clothing glowed with a willothewisp light she gazed at me intently her face at once severe and lovely her hands clasped before her ganieda you are i began moving towards her she threw out a hand to halt me come no nearer she said harshly then added in a softer tone it is not permitted best beloved then why have you come if we are not to be together torment me not beloved she said and oh i thought my heart would break we will be together that i promise you but not yet my soul not yet you must endure yet a little longer are you willing i am if by enduring i may secure the promise you have given then hear me my husband believe me when i tell you that britain will fall to the invaders sword through rapine and slaughter the land will be lost and the people destroyed kings shall die unmourned princes shall go to their graves unmarked and warriors curse the day of their birth the holy altars of prydein will be baptized in the blood of her saints and flames destroy all they touch this is more bitter to me than my own death i replied mournfully these are not words to steady a faltering heart my darling she said in a voice of utter compassion you above all men must know that where great danger threatens there hope abides faith ever erects her tent in the shadow of travail ganieda smiled shaking her head slowly is darkness stronger than light is not even the frailest good more powerful by far than the most eminent evil she spread her hands and i saw all around her the forms of warriors scores of warriors hundreds of them and each one arrayed for battle shield over shoulder strong hands gripping sword hilt and spear they lay still their eyes closed tell me ganieda are they dead or do they sleep they live she said as long as men love courage and honour they remain alive then why do they sleep they await the battlehorn to call them forth she explained only tell me where it is and i shall sound it i replied britain has need of such men yes she agreed readily and so shall she ever need them but these she made a circling motion with her handtheir time is not yet be assured you will know when it comes am i to see this tribulation ganieda turned sorrowful eyes upon me yes heart of my heart you will live for it is you alone who must summon the warriors to their mighty work and it is you who must lead them she paused letting her gaze linger on the forms of the warriors around her i show you this so you will know without doubt that you go not alone into the evil day your sword brothers go with you merlin they only await your call i looked upon the warriors once again and i saw among them faces that i knew cai was there yes and bedwyr and gwenhwyvar llenlleawg and gwalcmai gwalchavad bors and ban and cador meurig and aedd there were others as well the brave dead of previous battles pelleas custennin gwendolau baram elphin and gwyddno garanhir maelwys pendaran gleddyvrudd men of hard purpose fearless rightloving warriors who shrank before nothing valiant heroes all it is not for me to lead such warriors i demurred though i would gladly stand beside the best of them the call is not mine to give certainly a worthy king can be found to lead them if that is what you wish she said and stepped aside and i saw behind her another warrior a lordly form a figure i knew well arthur i gasped say he is not dead i have already told you ganieda replied as long as men love couragei know my voice grew tight with desperation please say it all the same he lives she stated firmly but he like all the others awaits your call and he will lead the war host of britain in the battle to come use them well my soul they are the last and when they are gone the world will never more see their like she turned and began walking swiftly away now come with me she called there is more i would show you but we must hurry for my time with you is almost finished taking a last look at the sleeping warriors i hastened after ganieda and soon found myself in another gallerythis one of uncut stone a natural tunnel after several hundred paces we entered a rough cavern water glimmered dully in the centre of the floor ragged teeth of stone dripped water into the black pool drop by solitary drop ganieda stood at the edge of the pool come stand beside me merlin she said beckoning me nearer look upon the water a seeing bowl i remarked thinking the pool filled with the black oak water of druid lore it is the seeing bowl of annwn she confirmed dread filled her voice she stretched forth her hand look you and tell me what you see i looked and saw the dull glimmer of the waters surface agitated by the steady slow drops from the stone teeth above but beneath the ripples i perceived a young woman it is a maiden i said the maiden turned as if looking up at me from the pool but no she could not see me for she turned away again and began walking all at once i could see all around and beyond her she is moving through a forest i continued it is an ancient forest and the path is narrow but she knows it well the maiden hurries but not from fear she is not afraid for she knows where she is going ah there she has come into a meadow in the wood i watched fascinated by this virgin of the forest as she entered the meadow which contained a pool fed by a clearrunning spring she walked to the pool holding out her hands two men appeared among the trees by their look and manner i understood that they were dying of thirst the dying men saw the water and rushed to the pool the first man fell on his knees at the spring dipped his hand and drank but the water turned poisonous in his mouth and he died clutching his throat the second man approached the virgin of the forest and consulted her at which she produced a cup and offered it to him taking the bowl between his hands the man filled the cup from the spring he drank from the cup and his life was restored he left rejoicing in the wisdom of the maiden the image changed and i saw the maiden once more but grown she stood with one foot on high yr widdfa and the other on the banks of mor hafren her head touched the sky and stars glinted in her tresses in one hand she held a forest and in the other the cup the marvellous cup and as she walked across the land the spirits of the ancient britons awakened and the island of the mighty flourished once more ganieda led me from the pool we moved farther into the cavern descending all the while penetrating deeper into the heart of the earth through cracks and crevices on either side i glimpsed the ruddy glow of molten rock seething up from below in the lurid light i beheld strange creatures frozen in stone massive muscled behemoths with bony shieldplates and claws the size of scythes their strange and ponderous bodies trapped in postures of predation or defence menacing reptiles their hideous flat heads bristling with spikes i looked with dread fascination upon them and wondered at the dire purpose of their creation deeper and still deeper we went past seams of gold spangling the walls of my underworld palace gleaming in the flames of subterranean fires i beheld halls of crystal and precious stones turning neither right nor left ganieda led me through the endless halls of annwn until at last we came to a rock ledge where she halted the place proved a shore of stone rimming a limitless underground sea which i viewed by virtue of seething patches of burning oil afloat on the surface of this underworld ocean we stood together overlooking the dreadful deep where no breath of wind ever stirred nor seaswell billowed nor ebbtide flowed it was a vast dark water grave under a stony sky an ironhued firmament solid unchanging inviolable i must leave you now merlin my heart she said turning to me her eyes full of sorrow at our parting where you are going i cannot return and where i am going you cannot enter no ganieda not yet i reached out for her but she stepped away even so my beautiful one replied we must part there is nothing more i can do if you are to live you must go back the way you came she took two steps backwards placed her fingertips to her lips kissed them and raised her slender white hand to me fare well best beloved she said remember i will come for you one day please ganieda i cried grief surging up like a wave within me do not leave me please god be with you always merlin with that she disappeared leaving me to stand alone on the stone ridge above the underground sea but not for long for i began to run to the place where i had last seen ganieda my foot slipped on a bit of broken rock and i fell striking my knee on the ledge with a tremendous crack i squeezed my eyes shut against the pain and when i opened them again the darkness was gone the luminous sky had likewise vanished and i stood at a ships solid prow once more five barinthus bellowed out a warning and the ship shuddered to a stop in the silt of a nearby bank aedd and gwenhwyvar disembarked at once sliding easily over the rail and wading the few paces to shore to wait while the other ships landed and the horses were brought i watched diem as if still in a dream and then moved to join them as i stepped towards the rail llenlleawg stooped where i had been standing and retrieved a clothwrapped object emrys he called after me will you leave your harp behind my harp i stared at the bundle in his hands how had that come to be there i returned to where he stood and lifted the cloth to reveal the harp i knew full well i had left behind in arthurs camp you must go back the way you came knowledge came to me in a rush like a gust of wind and with it came certainty yes i raised my head and lifted my voice in song i am the true emrys immortal i am old i am forever young i am the true emrys immortal gifted of the giving giver with a perceiving spirit i am a bard a battlechief of knowledge though blind i will continue to see god i do not vouchsafe the secrets of my craft to unenlightened creatures i am a wise guide i am a righteous judge i am a king whose kingdom is unseen i am the servant of the great light though blind i will continue to see god all saints and angels all things in heaven and earth bear witness word singer worldsinger myrddin ap taliesin am i llenlleawg stared at me this i told him raising the harp is the heart of oak in the hands of a true bard it burns with lifegiving song but is not consumed this is the way i must go so saying i struck the harp with the palm of my hand and the strings gave forth a sound like a chorused shout sweet the sound my heart thrilled to hear it may the gifting giver be good to you taliesin may you enjoy peace and plenty in the great kings heavenly hall and may you sing heartfelt praise to the lord of life for ever come i shouted we must hurry arthur is waiting and i have been away far too long but it is only a day since we left llenlleawg reminded me no my friend i replied i have been away far far longer than that but i have returned now pray llenlleawg pray i am not too late impatient to be away i mounted my horse as soon as it came ashore await the other ships and follow us when all the warbands are assembled i instructed aedd we ride before you to the british camp to tell arthur to ready your welcome we three llenlleawg gwenhwyvar and i rode as fast as we could through the day and night pausing only for water only to find the camp all but deserted a scant handful of warriors remained behind to guard the servants women and wounded they left before dawn one of them told us the vandali have gathered in glen arwe five warbands almost the entire war host he raised a hand to point the direction the effort brought a wince of pain and i noticed the arm was swollen and discoloured glen arwe llenlleawg asked aye a half days ride to the north the wounded warrior confirmed just follow the sound you cannot go wrong aedd and the irish lords ride behind us llenlleawg told the warrior send them on as soon as they arrive with a snap of the reins we were off again tired as we were we made what speed we could encountering no one on the way but as the warrior had promised we heard the battleclash long before we came upon the conflict itself the sound echoed along the river course raw voices shouting the crash and clatter of weapons the rumbling thunder of horses hooves and vandali drums as if the massed war hosts of all the world lay just before us llenlleawg halted as we entered the glen a haze of smoke and dust obscured the way ahead i want to see how the battle stands gwenhwyvar stated we may get a better view from there llenlleawg indicated a place high on the ridge overlooking the glen we turned aside forded the river now just a scant trickle along the damp earth and climbed the hillside to the ridgetop when we stopped again the glen lay far below us in a pall of dust then as we strained to see the dry breeze gusted and the clouds parted the battleground was revealed a vicious swirling tangled mass of men and horses the british lords had joined combat with the black boars forces and had succeeded in dividing the enemy host into three enclaves the usual tactic would have been to continue harassing each division cutting into smaller and smaller sections the vandali however were standing their ground and refused to be further divided llenlleawg took one look it is not good he said shaking his head slowly unless the enemy can be moved and soon arthur might as well call off the attack he can do nothing it did appear that the assault had foundered and was if not yet in danger of collapsing then very close to it i do not see him gwenhwyvar said scanning the churning mass below do you llenlleawg looked too his lower lip between his teeth strange he replied at last where is arthur i gazed into the chaos searching where the battle raged hottest looking for the familiar sight the whirling blur of caledvwlch and the reckless headlong lunging that marked britains impetuous war leader but i could not find him fear stole over me i imagined arthurs body lying broken on the bloodsoaked earth life seeping from a dozen wounds as the battle surged around him i imagined his head struck from his shoulders to adorn a vandal spear i imagined him hacked to pieces there arthur where no not arthur someone else llenlleawgs gaze narrowed as he leaned forward in the saddle he stabbed a finger at the maelstrom below cai i think yes and he is in trouble the irish champion drew his spear from its place behind his saddle and prepared to join the fight to gwenhwyvar he said stay here if arthur is down there i will find him his mount leapt forward and llenlleawg disappeared over the edge of the ridge when i saw him again he had reached the glen and was hurtling across the valley floor towards a place where a knot of cymbrogi had become surrounded and separated by the main body and were in imminent danger of being overwhelmed i watched llenlleawg flying into battle scattering the foe before him driving headlong into the fight some there are no doubt who would question the ability of a single warrior to redeem such a desperate plight but there is no one i would rather have fly to my defence whatever the odds and any inclined to doubt that one sword more or less could make much difference can never have seen the irish champion with the battle frenzy on him i tell you the truth no foe confronting the spectacle of llenlleawg gripped in the awen of battle remained unpersuaded for long but where was arthur i dismounted and crept to the edge of the bluff to better search the heaving mass below the battlesound rose up like the roar of an ocean gale the men rushing hurling themselves into the clash like seawaves breaking against one another most of the britons were mounted but the superior numbers of vandali and the closeness of the glen had lessened any advantage the horses provided this perhaps was why the attack had been repulsed and was now in danger of disintegrating altogether gazing down into the melee i picked out cai at the forefront of his warband sword whirling trying to hack a way through the mass before him he was attempting to reunite his force with the one nearest to him but the enemy so securely choked the gap that far from cutting a path through it was all he could do to keep from being swept farther away bedwyr i think led those nearest cai but he was hardpressed to prevent his warband from becoming surrounded cador or cadwallo perhaps i could not be certain was being forced step by grudging step farther from the other two in this way the vandal moving fluidlike in and around the mounted cymbrogi surging into the empty places filling them surrounding inundating flowing on were slowly reversing the tide of battle where was arthur look shouted gwenhwyvar behind me cador is in trouble following llenlleawgs lead she spurred her horse forward plunging down the hillside to join the battle there was no stopping her i did not even try the vandali made best use of their numbers and the pinched confines of the glen to blunt the attack of the britons halt it and turn it back it now appeared britains battlechiefs had a rout on their hands something would have to be done and soon if the britons were to escape a cruel beating where was arthur i gazed from one end of the plain to the other but could see no sign of him where could he be what if he had fallen in battle i dismissed the idea at once if he had been cut down i would have seen some sign of it by now indeed the british attack doubtless would have collapsed around him no i consoled myself i did not see him because he was not there llenlleawg had reached the beleaguered cai and took his place in the forerank of the fight his sudden almost miraculous appearance greatly encouraged the flagging cymbrogi and they fought with renewed vigour to extricate themselves from their dire predicament following llenlleawgs lead they succeeded in cutting through the enemy wall between them and bedwyrs warband and wasted no time in reuniting the two forces this tactic proved of only limited value however for as the two warbands merged the barbarians swarmed into the gap surrounding them both now instead of two halfenclosed warbands there was one fully encircled arthur where are you the battle is lost and the bear of britain is nowhere to be found what has happened to him the black boar no doubt astonished at finding himself within a spearthrow of an assured victory cast off all restraint i saw the boar standard waving in a frenzy and the drums quickened booming like angry insistent thunder at once the mass of vandali foot men thickened drew together then hurled itself against the british host gwenhwyvar had reached the fight and quickly gathered a force around her despite her best efforts they were kept on the outside try as they might they could not find a way to break through and were reduced to harrying the rearward rankswhich they did with great if ineffective zeal while the main battle took place elsewhere sensing their dilemma the mounted british stiffened and defied the encircling pressure bedwyr seemed to understand what was happening and attempted a counterattack driving into the wall of foemen thrusting forcing hacking his way forward by the strength of his blade alone a wedge of horsemen formed behind him desperately trying to cut a swathe to the surrounded cymbrogi step by bloody step they advanced fierce the fight savage the resistance the enemy gave ground with lifegrudging reluctance i saw men staggering under the weight of their shields struggling to fend off the blows of the foe with broken weapons i saw men pulled from their mounts even as they struck down their adversaries i saw men falling beneath the hooves of the horses shrieking men suddenly lacking limbs bedwyr was now within two spears lengths of rescuing the surrounded cymbrogi they were so close one more push one last strike would break the enemy line bedwyr saw it too he raised himself in the saddle lofted his sword and exhorted his warriors to the task and the cymbrogi responded they lowered their heads and drove in over the bodies of the fallen alas the enemy also saw the line bending inward as if to break one of twrch trwyths chieftains appeared and with breathtaking bravery threw himself against the buckling line leaping whirling he matched bedwyr stroke for stroke and halted him the faltering vandali took heart and rallied behind their wild leader they rose up with a shout surging like a seawave to overwhelm the british bedwyr was thrown back within the space of three heartbeats his gallant effort was undone i gazed across the churning turmoil as across a bubbling cauldron everywhere it was the same the british were being surrounded and forced back giving over hardwon ground falling failing the smoke and dust drifted up and up casting a filthy veil over the sun the cries of men and horses the sharp crack of wood and bone the stinging ring of metal on metal ascended to the dead white sky my hand clenched as if holding a sword and i felt the tug of battle in my blood turning at once to my horse i mounted and retrieved my sword from its place behind the saddle i made to draw the weapon but could not pull it from the sheath though i drew mightily i simply could not free it i sat for a moment mystified and then my eye fell upon my rowan staff tucked securely in its place under the saddle i am the bard of britain i thought what need have i of a sword drawing out the staff i lofted the rowan and raised it over the battlefield in the ageold motion of a bard upholding his people in the fight and as i did so i heard the words of taliesin from my vision you must go back the way you came understanding burst within me dazzling like the fall of lightning from a clear sky gripping the staff with all my strength as if the meaning of my vision might elude me once again if i let go i sat upon my red horse in a wonder of illumination my thoughts reeling yes yes this this is the way i must go not by the sword but by the rowan i dismounted and carried the staff to the cliffside and there i knelt clutching the rowan rod to me as if it were salvation itself gazing down upon the battle my spirit writhed within me i saw death as a grey vapor stealing over the plain and a putrid sickening smell rose up to sting my nostrils the vapors mingled with the stench and spread out over the plain and beyond to poison all britain it was the plague and war combined with the fear and ignorance of terrified men it was the stink of corruption hovering over britain and then ringing high and strong cutting like a swordstroke through the tumult the strident sharp blast of rhys battlehorn its ringing call sliced the air like a spearhead flung into the heart of the enemy the horn sounded again a piercing insistent shriek keen and angry behind the ringing call came arthur and the dragon flight sweeping down the hillside and into the tumult they appeared so suddenly their flight so swift the black boar had no time to order his forces to meet this new attack the vandal host chagrined by this unexpected event melted before arthurs fresh onslaught the impetus of the attack carried the dragon flight deep into the enemy host scattering foemen in all directions by the time the black boar had regained control of his warriors arthur had succeeded in breaking the line in several places the britons were not slow to seize their freedom within moments the essential shape of the battle was transformed and the enemy wall began to crumble in disarray seeing their advantage dwindling before their eyes the vandali lashed themselves to a frenzy screaming wailing shaking with fury they threw themselves against the mounted cymbrogi they fought with hopeless courage hurling themselves into the breach trying to halt the british with their own corpses even arthur could not stand against such desperate determination rather than risk becoming encircled again and hopelessly enmired in a fight he could not win arthur chose flight he quit the field thus when the vandal host rose once more to the counterattack they found the bear of britain in full retreat many another battlechief encouraged by the fleeting success of his unexpected appearance would have misjudged the moment thinking his surprise manoeuvre had won the day arthur knew better so before the enemy had a chance to rally the cymbrogi were already riding away the high king turned from uncertain victory choosing instead the sure saving of his men using the momentary advantage gained by surprise to secure a safe corridor for their escape it was as i say a circumstance decreed by dire necessity oh but it exacted a terrible price i stared down into the bloody glen horrified where the fight had been most fierce i could not see the ground for the dead they lay atop one another toppled and stacked like felled wood limbs were strewn here and there entrails coiled like brightcoloured snakes heads also salted among the bodies gapemouthed and emptyeyed and the earth dear god in heaven the earth was stained deep deep crimsonblack with the gore the futility the waste sickened by the loathsome extravagance of death i felt my stomach heave i gagged but could not keep it down i vomited bile on the ground at my feet then fell sobbing with the humiliation of having witnessed nay encouraged aided promoted such an evil i wept and cursed the blindness of my soul great light how long must hate and bloodshed reign in this worldsrealm i closed my eyes and raised my voice in keening lament for the dead on both sides when i finished i saw that the last briton had fled the field the vandali had withdrawn farther up the glen and the battlefield lay very still and terribly silent the only movement was that of carrion crows hopping obscenely from corpse to corpse the only sound their rasping croak as they gathered to their grisly feast i felt the stain of death in my soul and in my heart aching with shame and grief my hands shaking i remounted my horse and made my way back to camp six warriors lay on the ground where they had collapsed exhausted too tired to move they lay gasping hardly more alive than the dead we left in the glen some men sat slumped over wounds contemplating the extent of their injuries as if they revealed the source of the worlds sorrow women and boys hurried among the scattered warriors with jars of water to help revive the beaten war host dull eyes watched me pass with little recognition i did not pause but made my way to arthurs tent the bear of britain was holding council with his battlechiefs outside the tent we have fared poorly today arthur announced it was only by gods grace that we escaped it is true cador conceded the vandali were ready for us today more than ready observed bedwyr sourly it was as if they knew each move we would make before we made it this brought a chorus of agreement from the gathered chieftains aye said cai speaking up the boar is showing himself a fighter at last the farther inland they run the more fierce they become he ended shaking his head wearily i do not understand it we are losing this war i declared taking my place before them and if we persist on this course we will lose it and all britain as well arthur drew a deep breath we are tired he said and we all have duties elsewhere we will talk again when we have seen to our men and taken some rest he dismissed them then and as they departed he said attend me in my tent myrddin we must speak as soon as we were alone he turned on me i cannot believe you would speak like that in front of the men myrddin are you trying to discourage them i spoke the truth you spoke of losing and defeat i do not find that helpful especially after such a battle as we fought today it was not a battle i replied it was a disaster i was ambushed he declared the sneaking barbarian had a warband lying in wait in the gully it was a trap god love you man it was a trap i was anticipated and taken by surprise it was unfortunatea disaster yes but i cannot see what good it does to wallow in it i do not say this to grieve you o king i say this to open your eyes to the truth but it does grieve me myrddin i am aggrieved you speak of disasters and loss as if i did not already know it well i know it i am the war leader i own the fault no i replied if fault is to be apportioned i am mostly to blame i have not served you as i should i have failed you arthur you he wondered surprised by this unwarranted admission you have ever stood by me you have been my wise counsellor and my best adviser you did not need another adviser i told him flatly you needed a bard britain needed a true bard and was made to suffer a blind meddler instead that is my fault and i own the blame arthur drew his hand through his sweaty hair i do not understand you myrddin i led good men into the most simple trap of all i have chased twrch trwyth all summer i should have known i should have seen it straightaway but why sit here moaning about the blame where is the virtue in that great the virtue if it leads to salvation our salvation is as close as the next battle arthur contended the black boars ambush held me too long from the fight or you would have seen a different ending to this days battle i will not make the same mistake again believe me and now that the irish lords are soon with us you have not heard a word that i have said i snapped this is not about a single battle or even a war this is about the failure of a vision are we better men simply because we have better warriors or better weapons with the irish here arthur maintained we will yet drive the barbarian from this land hear me o king the realm is dying plague and war are bleeding us to death if we persist we will die it is not so bad arthur said lamely it is the ruin of the world arthur glared at me sullen and annoyed we will yet drive the invader from this land that is the truth i say and those dead on the battleground what do they say agh there is no talking to you arthur turned away and flung himself into uthers camp chair he put his head in his hands and rubbed his face i moved to stand over him we must change or we will surely die we must go back the way we came i declared think on that i challenged think long and hard arthur for until you begin to understand what i am telling you britain is lost the tent felt suffocatingly close i could not breathe leaving the high king to his thoughts i went in search of a place where i could be alone i moved through a camp sunk in the gloom of defeat silent unmoving awaiting the nights shadows to cover and claim it warriors spent and forlorn sat or lay before unlit fires speaking in hushed tones if they spoke at all boys were leading horses to the pickets and women were working to bind the wounds of the injured a pall hung over the camp a lethargy deeper than simple fatigue as if all understood the futility of effort alone to win any lasting gain i saw men sleeping and knew that some of these would not rise in the morning jesu have mercy i saw several of the lords heads together holding close council they stopped talking as i approached watching me darkly i ignored them and moved on my feet found the path leading to the stream moving among the slumbering bodies of those who had come to drink and dropped there i descended the bank crossed the water and continued on the path began to climb ascending the hillside and i followed where it led up through pungent bracken and prickly gorse eventually i found myself in a grassy hollow scooped out of the hillside smooth lichencovered rock formed a wall at the rear fringed by elderberry and blackthorn shrubs beech trees stood on either side of the hollow leaving the front open to a good view of the british camp below i sat down crosslegged on the soft turf between the two trees and watched twilight gradually enfold the glen in deep blue shadow the sky held a pale lingering light for a long time at last giving way before oncoming night from my lofty perch i watched and listened attending to the slow descent of the world into darkness my heart moved within me for it seemed that as night stretched its dark hand over the glen a weight of sorrow settled in my soul death had taken many good men this day their sacrifice all but forgotten as chief bard it was my duty to lead the people in laments of mourning for their fallen kinsmen yet here was i sitting aloof from the concerns of my brothers once again here was myrddin this day and always a man apart bearing all things whether in triumph or tragedy alone you must go back the way you camel thus spoke the truth of my vision and thus i did believe but how alas i had no idea how such a thing might be accomplished nor where i might begin i sat looking out over the glen in the steadily deepening twilight lost in thought i did not hear the footsteps approaching from behind then hearing them i turned supposing arthur had sent rhys to find me i turned and strange faces rushed at me out of the shadowed darkness before i could lift a hand i was taken four immense vandali armed with stout spears surrounded me i made no move to resist that would i was instantly persuaded have been futile so i simply remained seated and forced myself to appear calm and unafraid it was a small thing but great events often swing on such modest hinges the vandali confronted by an unarmed enemy who appeared neither frightened nor in the least disturbed hesitated this emboldened me i regarded them impassively and raised my hands in welcome as if i had been expecting them i recognize you i said knowing full well they would not understand me that was not important however i merely wanted to be the first to speak thinking to keep them off their mettle put up your weapons and let us speak together as reasonable men my ruse did not work one of the vandali raised his lance and made to strike the narrow blade hovered poised in the air but the hand was stayed by a quick shout from the shadows a voice barked a harsh order and the warrior froze i waited my heart thumping violently in my chest the spear still hesitated over me i was less than a hairs breadth from death then the voice spoke again this time to my complete surprise it said stand easy you are in great danger with these words a figure emerged from the gloom and came to stand before me though large and fully as powerful as those with him he was younger than any of the others i recognized him at once as one of the black boars piglets the young chieftain they called mercia i am well aware of my danger i replied easily you need have no fear of me mercia i am unarmed he started at my use of his name how do you know me i remembered him as the one who had remarked on arthurs youth at that first meeting you speak forthrightly i told him hergest has taught you well he stared you know this too well it could be no other way but i did not let on instead i touched my forehead meaningfully and said i am a bard i know a great many things his eyes narrowed shrewdly then tell me why i have come here without hesitation i said you have come to spy upon the british camp as you have done many nights before amilcar depends on the information you bring to order the battle this is how amilcar was able to defeat arthur today his eyes grew wide hergest said you were a mighty man of wisdom the priest ever speaks true even to his hurt clearly this high regard for truth impressed him will you sit with me mercia i said indicating a place on the ground beside me there is something i would tell you you have been waiting for me i let him think this sit let us talk i had no idea what i would say to him my only plan was to win his confidence and find some way to persuade him to let me go even so as he stood over me quivering with indecision a plan formed in my mind please i said smiling in what i hoped was a confident and persuasive manner we have little time they will come looking for me soon signalling to his men he growled a quick command they raised their spears and backed away mercia sat down on the ground opposite crosslegged lance in his lap we regarded one another in the fading light what have you to say he asked at last it is in my mind that amilcar does not hold the trust of all his battlechiefs i said slowly watching him to make certain that he followed my meaning it was a crude but effective guess i have never known a war leader yet who enjoyed the entire and utter confidence of all his lords god knows even arthur fighting for britains survival battled his own lords he studied me a long time as if making up his mind finally he said it is true there have been many disputes since coming here he paused i nodded understanding only too well drawing the young man further into his confession he obliged me by continuing with quiet defiance our renowned war leader holds not the favour of all i believe your war leader often goes against those who counsel wisdom i suggested watching mercias face for nuances of expression to guide me i saw what i expected to see and thrust home saying all the more when those chieftains are held in low esteem because of their youth the young battlechiefs eyes flashed quick fire and i knew i had struck the raw wound of his complaint he is a most stubborn lord mercia allowed cautiously once he has set his hand to a thing he will never yield though it were wiser by far to do so his use of the words by far expressed worlds of meaning to me and i began to discern the slenderest golden glimmer of hope listen to me mercia i said you are closer to your desire than you know trust and believe he regarded me suspiciously and i feared i had pressed him too far mercia threw a quick sideways glance at his men who were watching us closely he uttered a low growling command but they made no move or response turning back to me he said do you know my thought truly it is as i have told you i replied i know a great many things i will never betray my lord he said and i sensed the shape of his fear i seek an honourable settlement i assured him treachery will have no part in it neither betrayal i held him with the uncompromising certainty of my voice but i demand honour for honour loyalty must be repaid with loyalty do you understand he nodded there was nothing sly about his acceptance but i wanted assurance hear me mercia the honour i demand is costly indeed it will be bought with blood i understand he muttered impatiently he glanced sideways again then said what must i do only this i spoke in an ominous tone raising my hand in the gesture of command when the time comes to add your voice to the support of peace you must not be silent he did not expect that i could see him struggling to find a hidden meaning in my words is there nothing else that is enough truly it is more than many brave men will dare he drew himself up my courage has never been doubted i believe you when will this take place soon he rose abruptly and stood over me at once menacing and wary i could kill you now and no one would know yes that is true you said i must trust you yet you offer no token of trust his hand tightened on his spear then accept this as a sign i replied rising slowly to my feet to face him there will be no attack against you tomorrow the british will remain in camp nursing their wounds tell this to amilcar he turned on his heel and snapping a quick order to his men disappeared into the shadows the men stood watching me and i feared mercia had indeed ordered my death i remained motionless resistance was impossible and flight would do no good the spears swung up with a decisive motion with an effort i held myself steady within the space of three heartbeats the warriors were gone melting quietly back into the darkness i listened for them but heard only the faint murmur of voices rising from the camp below i turned to see the campfires shining bright as earthbound stars and sweet relief gave way to sudden apprehension great light what have i done seven i maintained my vigil through the night heart and mind clutching tight to the slender hope that had been granted me the saving of britain and the kingdom of summer since even the most compelling dreams can dissipate into the empty air when touched by the suns hard light i waited for what the day would bring hope refreshed or despair confirmed certainty of purpose came with the dawn up i rose thanking the high king of heaven and all his saints and angels for the weapon delivered into my hand as the sun rose bloodred over the eastern ridge i returned to camp to find the war host already stirring readying themselves for the days battle i went directly to arthurs tent and he admitted me yawning and scratching himself following him into the tent i could not help noticing that gwenhwyvar was nowhere in sight she prefers to bathe early arthur said i would speak to you alone first i replied and told him about my chance encounter with mercia and what the young battlechief had told me of dissention among the vandali the king sat in his chair before me shaking his head do you understand what i am telling you arthur frowned no he did not understand at all why must we stay in camp because i explained i promised it to mercia i gave this in pledge for my life before arthur could make further objection bedwyr came to the tent and called for the king i am here brother arthur answered i will join you in a moment well i demanded what is it to be arthur hesitated he frowned at me and rubbed his hands over his face oh very well he said at last i will not make a liar of you there are many among us who would welcome a days rest in any event we stepped from the tent to greet bedwyr the war host is ready he said the chieftains await your command there will be no battle today arthur told him bluntly bedwyr glanced at me in surprise why bear what has happened i have changed my mind i have decided to give the men a days rest but everyone is ready we have full assembly of the greatest warband since tell them bedwyr tell them all we will not fight today i will tell them he growled turning on his heel he hastened away no sooner had bedwyr departed than we heard shouts from the far perimeter of the camp where a commotion had broken out now what arthur muttered glaring at me as if it were my doing bedwyr hearing the uproar came running back to the king rhys appeared on the run vandali he shouted so much for your day of rest bear bedwyr grumbled will you give the order wait i said not yet rhys ran to where we stood vandali he said breathlessly five of them they advance with willow branches the slave is with them i think they want to parley bedwyr and rhys looked to arthur awaiting what he would say arthur looked to me i know nothing of this i told him very well said arthur let them come to me and we will hear what they have to say we waited before the tent while rhys conducted the enemy envoy to us as he said there were five the four warlords we had met before including mercia and the captured priest hergest all the british lords came running to see what was to take place so the emissaries arrived amidst a great crowd of onlookers gwenhwyvar cai and cador pushed through to stand beside arthur and me greetings lord arthur hergest began we beg to speak with you and to return to our camp unharmed speak freely priest arthur said i give you my word that no hurt shall come to you while you are under my protection why have you come before the priest could reply one of the barbarian chieftains the one called ida i think pointed to all the men pressing close and uttered a long complaint in their rough tongue he says that your word is worthless hergest informed us merlin vowed you would not ride today and yet we see that you ready yourselves for battle bedwyr threw me a questioning glance which i ignored arthur replied i was not informed of myrddins pledge until a moment ago and have only just given the order to stand down even so we are ready to fight if pressed to it while the slave repeated arthurs words i sought mercias eye he saw me watching him and with a slight but deliberate downward jerk of his chin gave me to know that he accepted this explanation we too are ready to fight hergest said resuming his communication however it is in amilcars mind that the war leader arthur has remained shielded behind his warriors long enough the black boar is minded that the two kings meet and prove before both nations which of them is the greater battlechief indeed remarked arthur and does amilcar say how he proposes to make this proof the slave relayed arthurs reply to ida who responded with a sneer and another long utterance ida says that amilcar will meet arthur alone on the plain beside the river which lies between our two camps bringing whatever weapons the british warrior favors when the sun passes midday the two will fight the combat will continue until one or the other is killed hergest paused and ida spoke again amilcar makes this challenge though he does not expect arthur to accept it the slave added tell amilcar that i will consider his challenge arthur replied evenly i will bring my answer to the plain at midday hergest repeated arthurs words whereupon the enemy battlechiefs satisfied that they had delivered their message turned to go owain vrandub arthur called choosing two from among the assembled noblemen see that they leave the camp the way they came unmolested to the others he said go back to your men and explain the challenge we will assemble at midday and ride to the plain as the lords hurried away arthur bade his advisors attend him in the council tent gwenhwyvar cai bedwyr cador llenlleawg and i joined the high king to decide what to do it is a very good sign bedwyr said as we seated ourselves at the board it means the black boar knows we have increased the strength of the war host and he is afraid what of this pledge not to fight today asked gwenhwyvar sharply the question was for me i quickly explained how i had been surprised and taken by mercia cador professed himself amazed by this and said he let you go if you promised not to fight today no i said it was not like that we talked first he gave me to know that there is dissension in the vandali camp amilcar has lost the confidence of some of his lords and see cried bedwyr i am right the black boar is running scared the vandali cannot withstand the might of britain any longer single combat is the only fight he can win cai put in attack with all our might i say this is the chance we have been waiting for perhaps replied arthur it is a chance to end the war without further bloodshed perhaps it is a trap pointed out gwenhwyvar sharply the barbarians cannot be trusted said cador quickly even if amilcar was defeated what makes you think they would honour any vow of peace they made it was a good question one that would be uppermost in every british warriors mind i was ready with the answer it makes no difference i answered their silence contradicted me truly it makes no difference i persisted for without amilcar the war will simply collapse can you not see that now the disbelieving stares of cador and the others told me that they could not see here i said whether it is a trap i inclined my head towards gwenhwyvar as i said this or whether amilcar proves false or anything else makes not the slightest difference to us for the selfsame moment he dies on the battlefield before his watching host the invasion ceases and the war ends how do you know this demanded cador mercia told me i answered and you believed him i did indeed i replied he held my life in his hands let there be no doubt a word from him and my death was assured but he let me live that i might know he spoke the truth he is a barbarian cador charged he would tell you anything to make you believe this lie but i am not so easily persuaded it may be a lie i answered or it may not i say we put it to the test and find out if i am right the war will end but what if you are wrong cai asked what then eh then the war will continue i replied solemnly and britain will become the grave of champions they grew silent thinking this over before they could renew their objections rhys ducked into the tent just then to say that the priest paulinus had returned to camp let him come in arthur said the monk gaunt and frayed about the edges like a bone gnawed to gristle entered and all but collapsed at arthurs feet without a thought the king raised him and sat him in his chair a drink rhys called arthur hurry forgive me lord paulinus said he saw the others looking on and struggled to his feet arthur pressed him back into the chair with his hand sit man rest yourself you have ridden hard as we can see gather your strength and tell us what word you have brought rhys appeared with a cup and pressed it into the monks hands paulinus drank thirstily and dried his mouth with his sleeve i wish i had a better word lord the monk said how bad is it asked gwenhwyvar stepping close it is not good paulinus replied the fever spreads despite our best efforts the roads from londinium are secured but people still persist in travelling on the river it seems we can do nothing to stop them thus the plague follows the waterways he paused gulped from the cup and concluded we have succeeded in rescuing a few settlements where the disease has not yet gained a foothold but much of the land south of londinium has succumbed paulinus drank again and returned the cup to rhys three of our own have taken ill and one has died nor do i expect the others to live arthur stood over the priest hands at his sides fists balled but there was nothing to strike paulinus seeing his kings frustration rose slowly i am sorry lord i wish i had better tidings i had hoped we had all hoped you are doing all you can we know gwenhwyvar said go now we will speak again when you are rested beckoning his steward arthur said rhys see that our friend has something to eat and a place to lay his head paulinus took his leave and when he had gone arthur turned to the others i cannot stop the plague he said softly but if i can end the war with the black boar i deem it a risk worth taking i will fight amilcar a little while before midday the lords of britain and their battlechiefs were assembled once more and brought to stand before the high kings tent arthur acknowledged them one by one and lauded their loyalty then he said sword brothers all you have heard the black boars challenge i have given the matter careful thought and i have decided that if there is a chance to end the war by defeating amilcar in single combat then i must take that chance therefore i will accept the barbarians challenge and meet him on the plain the decision provoked a general uproar is this wise arthur wondered ector aloud certainly we all stand ready to ride beside you a score of voices added their agreement of that i have no doubt arthur replied holding up his hands for silence indeed many good men have stood beside me already and alas too many have died truly if not for the loyalty of all noble britons we could not have driven the enemy to this desperate cast i am persuaded that the will to continue this war rests with amilcar thus when he is dead the war will end but what if you are killed instead shouted cunomor his voice rising above the din what then if i am killed arthur replied it will be left to those who remain to carry on however they choose the death of one man matters little weighed against the death and destruction which has gone before and all that will certainly follow we came to fight for you shouted meurig not to stand by and watch you fight alone ogryvan added we fight for arthur he does not fight for us this produced a clamour which continued for some time when it began to die away another cried out lord arthur the voice was strange to many ears the british lords turned as aedd stepped forward the man who wins this fight will gain everlasting glory and his name will be sung in the halls of kings for ever therefore though i am least among your lords i beg the boon of serving you let me face this barbarian amilcar in your place great king let me be your champion in this fight aedd god bless him was in earnest he would readily trade life for life with arthur but the high king could not allow it i thank you lord aedd he said and i will not forget your offer but it seems that amilcar believes me a tyrant like himself in that if i am defeated britains defence will crumble away we must encourage him in this belief my life must be the prize the petty kings were not at all happy with this decision but though many argued against it none could suggest a better plan thus arthur won his way at length so it is settled the high king concluded gather your warbands we will meet amilcar now eight i have thought many times what i could have done perhaps should have done differently in those fearful days yet events swiftly outstripped my small ability to guide them as is ever the way of things those circumstances we would most gladly shape ever remain beyond our grasp while we are made to bear unexpected burdens to unsuspected destinations all stand helpless before a power too potent to contain too immense to comprehend so be it thus i who would have formed the days to my design was made to stand with all the rest of the british war host ranged in ranks upon the plain looking on in apprehension i see it now as then always before me the same stark image arthur standing alone under a blistering sun with neither shield nor helm only caledvwlch at his side the sky is leached white with the searing heat the grass is brittle underfoot and brown arthur stands waiting his shadow shrivelled small beneath him as if it dare not stretch its full length in such heat across the plain the vandal host appears warriors women children all advance slowly to the place of meeting the broad plain of lyit coed where the rivers tamu and ancer come together a fortress once stood nearby but the vandali have burned it and the settlements round about have been destroyed the people killed or forced to run i watch the enemy host advance a crabbed and clotted line of black the dust from their feet rising up in thick white columns behind them they move slowly and we wait we might still attack them or they might attack us there is nothing to prevent it save britains high king standing alone on the cracked and burning plain waiting in all good faith for the black boar of the vandali to honour his word and meet him facetoface there is but one question in the mind of every man looking on will the hosts fight or will amilcar treat with arthur as he has promised the advance halts abruptly and dull silence descends over the heatoppressed plain then the thunder begins the plain echoes to the rumbling roar of the vandali war drums and for one terrible moment i think they will attack steady bedwyr calls out and his words are repeated down the line stand your ground men the drums are meant to frighten to unnerve us but arthur stands and so we stand grimfaced sweating our stomachs knotted in anticipation and dread as the drums boom in our ears the sound once heard is not easily forgotten i hear it now when the invader had drawn up in striking distance of us the beat of the drums abruptly ceased and the long triple line halted the vandali stood staring at us in a silence as terrible as the bonerattling thunder of their drums they remained motionless not a muscle twitching weapons gleaming dully rank on rank their grotesque boars head standards rising above them confronting us with the dread spectacle of their military might arthur stood easy patient regarding the fearsome battle host with an unflinching gaze after a time one of the standardbearers moved from his place in the forerank advanced a few places and stopped he was joined by a group of vandali chieftains mercia and the slave hergest foremost among them then all together they moved out to meet britains high king in the centre of the plain after a few brief words spoken in voices too low to hear the standardbearer returned to his place in the line i cannot endure this muttered gwenhwyvar crossly i will stand with him bedwyr made bold to stay her but she shook off his hand slipped from the saddle and stepped quickly out from the rank to reach arthurs side before anyone could prevent her the king welcomed her with a curt nod and the two stood side by side as the black boars head on its skullandscalpbedecked pole proceeded once more this time it heralded the arrival of amilcar himself the two lords eyed one another across a gap of but three paces i saw arthurs hand rise in the sign of peace amilcar made no gesture arthur said something to which the black boar replied through hergest when the priest stopped speaking arthur turned to gwenhwyvar who made a reply while staring straight ahead at amilcar as her words were repeated by hergest i saw the black boars lip curl in a savage sneer he growled a reply of low disdain threw his head back haughtily and spat perhaps this is what she intended for in the blink of an eye her slender sword was in her hand and she lunged at the vandal king she was quick quicker than arthurs restraining hand and amilcar was saved a grave if not fatal stroke only by the swift reaction of one of his chieftains who knocked the sword aside with the shaft of his spear as die blade sliced the air a whiskers breadth from amilcars throat amilcar recoiled raising his spear in the same motion arthur shouted seized gwenhwyvars arm and pulled her bodily away from her attack the black boar still wielding his spear made a short angry speech to which arthur made a solemn reply in all the exchange was brief a few more words passed between them and then arthur and gwenhwyvar turned abruptly and walked back to the british line we meet tomorrow at dawn said arthur with never a word of what had passed on the plain so began the long wait and the british host bore the waiting hard the warriors rested through the heat of the day while the sun made slow slow sailing into the west but as the whitehot disk disappeared behind the hills they began to stir and to talk and to worry it was i thought time to remind them of the prize awaiting us and the lord who held our trust after a brief word with arthur the battlechiefs were summoned and instructed to assemble the men on the hillside above the council tent with the gathered host of britain ranged before me as pale twilight crept over the vale i advanced to my place the stifling heat had begun to loose its grip on the land and a light breeze stirred the wispy grass a great beacon of a fire had been lit a beltane blaze to rekindle the past in their memories a rising moon cast hard shadows on the ground and the sky above gleamed with stars from one horizon to the other the crowd surged restless anxious wary the warrior throngs waited the very air tense with their uncertainty and apprehension all knew of arthurs ordeal and it troubled them what if arthur was killed they thought who would lead them against the vandali then thousands owed their lives to arthurs skill as a war leader how would they fare without him they watched me suspiciously i could almost hear their muttered whispers a song far better to sharpen blades this night i shouldered the harp plucking notes at random and flinging them out as pebbles pitched into a seething sea at first no one heard me but i kept playingand then they did not want to hear me they kept murmuring but their eyes strayed time and again to where i stood strumming the harp as if oblivious to their muttering then as the harpsong struck the fearfretted air my vision ignited within me once more and glowed with the intensity of the sun itself i saw again the halfburning halfliving tree and my spirit soared with the meaning of the riddle for the first time in a very long while i felt like a bard again giving the harp its voice i played through their apprehension and unease until all eyes were on me and i occupied every thought gradually the music took hold as little by little the murmuring ceased when all was quiet on the hillside i called out in a loud voice hear me i am a bard and the son of a bard my true home is the region of the summer stars from the earliest days of our race the guardians of the spirit taught that wisdom resides in the heart of oak i raised my harp above my head and held it high for all to see i hold in my hands this heart of oak by virtue of his craft the bard releases the soul of wisdom to work its will in the world of men hear then and heed all i shall tell you that you may remember all that you are and may become so saying i cradled the harp and began to play again like a weaver spinning threads of silver and gold my fingers worked the intricately patterned melody establishing a gleaming ground for the words i would recite i played gazing out upon the faces of all those people men from every part of britain from prydein celyddon and lloegres and from ierne also they seemed to me hollow people gaunteyed and empty like their lords they were starving for the true word i realized this and my heart went out to them great light i stand humble before your loving power move in me my lord that i may move the hearts of men in the same instant i felt the up welling of the awen like a longcaptive bird released to the sky the melody came first trailing words in its glittering wake taking shape as it touched my tongue i gave myself up to the song there was no longer myrddin only the song existed and i was but a vessel hollow empty of myself but filled with the exquisite wine of the or an mor i sang and the great music poured forth unstinting in its blessing a new song took life that night and men were amazed to hear it this is what i sang in the elder age when the dew of creation was still fresh on the ground there arose a mighty king and manawyddan was his name all the world was his realm and every tribe and clan owed him tribute everything he put his hand to prospered and wherever he looked something good and worthy favoured his gaze one day evil tidings reached lord manawyddan and caused him sore distress the otherworld it was said had fallen beneath the shadow of a usurper who treated the people most cruelly the great king decided then and there to give the sovereignty of his realm to the best man he could find so that he might go and free the otherworld folk from the sly oppressor and this is the way of it the great king summoned his noblemen to attend him and laid the matter before them i am going away for a time manawyddan told them whether short or long i do not know but i shall not return until i have vanquished the usurper who even now plunders the otherworld and lays waste to that fairest of realms his lords and noblemen answered him full sorrowful we are to hear your purpose they confessed it may be well for the folk of the otherworld but it is nothing less than a calamity for us to this the king replied nevertheless this is what i have decided i will place the kingship in the hands of the man i shall choose and he shall serve in my place until i return and he began to assay among them who was worthy to take up the sovereignty no easy decision that for each man among them was as worthy as the next and no less worthy than his brother in the end however he devised a means to put the issue to the test he caused his chief bard to make an ornament of gold shaped like a ball and then manawyddan brought forth this ball and held it before his lords this has been made for me he told them what think you of it and they answered it is very beautiful lord the king agreed it is beautiful indeed and more beautiful than you know for it is the symbol of my reign he lifted the golden sphere before them here he called take it with that the great king threw the golden ball to his lords the first one reached out and caught it easily clasping it to his chest the king said thank you noble friend you may go the lord turned to go but the king prevented him until the golden ornament was retrieved no sooner had the ball been returned to him however than he threw it again to another who caught it in his fist thank you noble friend you may go the great king told him the chieftain turned to go but the king prevented him until his precious sphere should be returned and this is how it was with each man in turn each time the king threw the golden ball it was caught and returned to him until he threw it to lludd up the ball flew and down it came but the nobleman could not bring himself to grasp it seeing the priceless ornament fall from his open hand lludd sank to his knees forgive me my king he cried i am not worthy to touch such a valuable object but the king raised him up not so lludd he told him you alone are worthy to hold my kingship until i return so saying the great king took up the ball and placed it firmly in lludds hand and charged him thus such authority as i enjoy i give also to you hold it until i come again to my kingdom no one saw king manawyddan after that though they often heard tidings of his marvellous deeds in the otherworldly realms lludd meanwhile ruled well and wisely and the realms under his care flourished and grew great so that none would lack the benefit of his wisdom lludd established lords in each realm to serve him and bring before him the needs of the people there one of these lords was a brother named mab righ who watched over his island realm with dedication and devotion day or night whatever trouble the people brought to him that was all his care now it happened that the realm of mab righ was attacked by a strange and formidable enemy in the form of three plagues each more peculiar than the one before the first plague was the arrival of an enemy host called coranyid whose knowledge was derived from the fact that they could hear any word spoken anywhere no matter how hushed the speech the wind carried the words to them thus no one could say anything against them and it was impossible to move against them for they always learned the plan and evaded it the coranyid laid waste to everything nothing remained where they passed the second plague was a terrible cry that arose at beltain on every hilltop over every hearth and under every roof in the realm this cry was of such tormented misery that it pierced the hearts of all who heard it and there was no living thing anywhere that did not hear it men lost their strength and women their vigour children swooned and animals lost their senses if any female creature was pregnant a miscarriage resulted trees and fields became barren the water sickened and soured the third plague was the inexplicable theft of food from the houses of chieftains and nobles no matter how much food was prepared none remained the next morning if meat not so much as a greasy bone was left if bread not so much as a grainy crumb if stew not so much as a drop of broth though they prepared enough food to last a year by dawn the board was bare these plagues so distressed the people that they raised a piteous lament mab righ was moved to gather all the tribes together to determine what should be done everyone was baffled by the plagues no one knew what had brought them about nor could anyone say how the island could be rid of them three days and nights they bethought themselves what they might do and in the end mab righ summoned his chieftains and placing the care of the people in their hands left his island realm to seek the counsel of his wise brother lord a ship was fitted out in secret and sail was raised in the dark of night so that none should learn of mab righs errand the ship soared like a gull across the waves and lludd looking out across the sea one day saw his brothers sails coming towards him he commanded a boat to be readied and he set off at once to meet him lludd received mab righ gladly embraced him warmly and gave him gifts of welcome yet despite his good greeting mab righs smile soon faded and his brow assumed its furrow of worry what has happened to produce this face of woe asked lludd when they had returned to his handsome hall mab righ replied woe heaped on woe and misery on misery he shook his head sorrowfully you know i am not a melancholy man by nature lludd agreed wholeheartedly it is true but tell me please if you can bear it i would hear what has brought you to this lowly state most mournful of men am i brother mab righ answered my island is beset by three plagues each one worse than the other in short we are harried aggrieved and tormented at every turn i have come to you for help and advice for i am stretched full length wondering what to do you have done well coming to me lludd told him together we will discover the cure for the ills which have befallen you speak brother and let the healing begin mab righ took heart at these kindly words and roused his courage i will speak he said but first we must devise a means of guarding our words and he explained about the plague of coranyid and how any word spoken would reach them on the wind lludd smiled and answered him not difficult that and he ordered his smith to make a silver horn of his devising and they spoke to one another through it the wind could not carry the words to the evil coranyid but the silver horn produced an adverse result whatever good word was spoken into one end came out the other as hateful and contrary this perplexed lludd greatly until he discerned that a demon had established itself inside the horn and this wicked demon was twisting all their words in order to sow discord between them you see how it is lludd declared this is the very tribulation you face but fret not i know full well how to help you priests had come from a far country and the king sent to them for wine and when it was brought to him he poured the wine into the silver horn the power of the wine drove the demon out straightaway thereafter lludd and mab righ were able to speak without hindrance and mab righ told his brother all about the three devastating plagues and lludd listened his countenance grave and solemn when mab righ finished lludd took himself away for three days and nights to think within himself what should be done he called his priests and wise bards to him and held council with such learned men as were close to hand after three days he returned to his hall and summoned his brother to attend him lludd hailed his brother saying rejoice brother your troubles are soon ended mab righ asked have you succeeded where others have failed that i have lludd answered here is the remedy for your woes so saying he brought forth a bag of grain mab righ looked at the bag and happiness died in his breast forgive me for doubting brother he said glumly but i seem to see a grain bag in your hand if grain alone could avail i need never have troubled you lludd smiled the wider oh that merely shows how far from the true path you have strayed for this is no ordinary grain indeed not it is a wondrously potent grain whose properties avail against every ill now listen carefully here is what you must do and he began to instruct him in how best to rid his island of the three devastating plagues holding up his finger lludd said the plague of coranyid distressing and dangerous though it be is most easily remedied take a third portion of the grain and immerse it in clean vats filled with water drawn from a clearrunning spring cover the vats and let them stand for three days and three nights meanwhile send word throughout your realm that you have discovered a drink more wholesome than fine ale and more lifegiving than water invite your people to attend you to sample this wonderful drink naturally the coranyid will swarm and swell your ranks you have only to take the graininfused water and sprinkle it over their heads and the cure is assured your own people will live but the evil coranyid will die lludds words restored mab righs confidence his heart swelled with joy to hear how his people could be delivered however lludds next words cast him into despair once more curing the second plague the king told him will be as difficult as the cure of the first was easy i perceive that the terrible cry which desolates the land is caused by a wicked serpent who crawls from his den on the eve of each beltain searching for food so great is his hunger that he screams aloud and this is the cry you hear mab righ shook his head in dismay how can we rid ourselves of such a creature lludd answered what is impossible for ordinary men to destroy is possible with this wondrous grain here is what you must do measure the length and breadth of the island and quarter it to find the exact centre where the centre is found dig a deep pit and cover it with a strong cloth made of virgin wool then take a third portion of the grain and place it in a vat and fill the vat with the blood of nine lambs place this vat in the centre of the cloth when the snake comes searching for something to devour he will smell the blood of the lambs and slither onto the cloth to get at the vat the weight of the snake will cause the cloth to sink into the pit then you must quickly seize the corners of the cloth and tie them tightly together pull up the cloth and cast it into the sea snake and all mab righ was overjoyed he clapped his hands and acclaimed lludds wisdom loudly but his lords next words cast him into a despair so black that it seemed as if he had never known happiness for so much as a day in his life the third plague is the most difficult of all he said and if it were not for the power of this grain there would be no hope for you woe and woe again cried mab righ i feared this all along lludd took his brother by the shoulders and spoke to him sternly have you not heard a word i have said the grain i give you is cure for any ill that should befall you but listen carefully the third plague is caused by a mighty giant who has come to your realm and taken shelter there this giant is cunning as a sorcerer and when you prepare a feast his spells and enchantments cause everyone to fall asleep while the realm sleeps the giant comes and steals away the feast therefore you must stand watch for your people if you hope to catch this giant keep a vat of cold water nearby when you feel sleepy step into the water and revive yourself yet that is only the beginning there is more and he told his brother what else he must do to rid the island of the wicked giant when he had finished mab righ bade his brother farewell took up the bag of grain and sailed back to his realm as fast as sails and sea would allow when he reached home he sprang ashore and went straight to his hall and prepared the libation exactly as he had been instructed measuring out the grain and water into clean vessels he then called his people together to try the wondrous drink and of course the evil coranyid heard about it and swarmed the gathering intending harm seeing all assembled mab righ plunged a bowl into the water and dashed it over the unsuspecting crowd the people stared at one another dripping and the coranyid howled with anger ignoring the outcry mab righ quickly filled his bowl again and flung the contents over the gathering the people laughed and the demons screamed assuming their normal grotesque shapes they pleaded with mab righ to abandon his plan but the lord turned a deaf ear to their cries and filling his bowl once more sprinkled the contents over the crowd the vile coranyid shrivelled and died releasing the people at once and everyone acclaimed the king and his wisdom and celebrated the virtue of the healing water wasting not a moment mab righ set about measuring the length and breadth of the island when he had done this he quartered the land and thus divined the centre he ordered a deep pit to be dug at the centre and he ordered a great cloth to be made from the first shearing of all the lambs in the island the cloth of undyed lambs wool was brought to the place and spread over the huge pit a third portion of the grain was put into a vat with the blood of nine lambs and that vat set in the centre of the cloth it happened that the next night was the eve of beltain and the serpent emerged from its underground den and quickly scented the blood of the lambs the wicked beast drawn to the vat slithered onto the cloth and coiled itself around the vat preparing to feast but before it could so much as dip its tongue into the vat the cloth sank into the pit mab righ who had been hiding nearby ran out and grabbed the loose ends of the cloth before they fell tied them together and bound the knot with strong ropes he and his men pulled the bundle from the pit and dragged it to a high promontory the snake screaming all the while they hauled the bundle to the cliffs and cast it into the sea the snake thrashed and screamed and thrashed as it went down this ended the terrible scream and it was never heard in the realm again and the people who had gathered along the clifftop sang a song of liberation as the snake sank out of sight they lifted mab righ onto their shoulders and carried him back to his hall to celebrate his victory they prepared a great and wonderful feast using the last portion of the grain which they made into dough and baked the dough produced enough bread to feed the whole of the realm for thirtythree days when the feast was served everyone sat down to eat but before even the smallest morsel could be touched by the smallest finger the assembly grew sleepy yawning widely they all put their heads down upon the board and fell fast asleep mab righ also found himself yawning and rubbing his eyes he longed to sleep but remembered his kings words as his eyes closed and his head sank towards his chest he stepped into the vat of cold water by his side the cold water shocked him awake once more as he shivered in the vat of cold water there came the sound of a heavy footstep on the hearthstones a heartbeat later a shadow passed over the hall and a giant man appeared at the banqueting board this huge fellow was dressed in leather clothes head to heel and carried an enormous hammer made of stone a long shield of oak bound with iron bands was slung on his back and in his wide belt he carried an axe with an iron head he also had a basket made of wicker which he proceeded to fill with food bread and meat and victuals of all kinds tumbled into this basket without end mab righ watched with amazement wondering how any vessel could hold so much without ever growing full finally the giant had cleaned the board to the last crumb only then did he stop and then merely to see if he had neglected anything and seeing the board swept clean the immense man turned and started off into the darkness once more up charged mab righ leaping from the water and splashing after the giant stop in the name of the one who is lord over us i command you to stop this is what lludd had told him to say and the giant stopped turned and raised his stone hammer unless you are better skilled with your weapons than you are at guarding your feast the giant replied in a voice to tremble the hills round about i will soon add your pitiful carcass to my wicker tub mab righ was ready with his reply though you have wrought endless crimes and turned the joy of many into laments of sorrow he said i say that you shall not take one step more the giant mocked him saying will you not defend your feast little man for i tell you i am not easily persuaded against my will he swung the hammer high over his head and down with a savage sweep mab righ leapt deftly aside and the hammer fell without harm the giant turned and began walking away he took one step and then another and on the third step was staggered backwards by the weight of the wicker basket he struggled ahead another step but the basket had suddenly become so heavy that he could no longer hold it what manner of bread is this he wailed it grows heavier with every step with that the basket slipped from his hands and smashed to pieces on the ground the giant saw the loaves of bread and joints of meat roll upon the earth and fell on hands and knees to retrieve his feast he seized a round loaf in his hands and lifted it but the bread was too heavy for him and despite his enormous strength the uncanny weight bettered him and he fell beneath the bread as beneath the heaviest millstone that ever ground a grain casting off his amazement mab righ strode to the nearest loaf and picked it up with one hand raised it and held it over the giants head i have another loaf for you the lord of the isle said as you are a greedy giant i shall give it to you add this to the one you clasp upon your chest the giant saw the bread poised over his head and cried please lord i yield do not hurt me further for though you may not know it i am weakened even unto death by the very loaf i clutch suspecting a trick mab righ said how can i believe you who have stolen the life from the mouths of my people the giant wept and cried that the loaf was crushing him lord i cannot endure the weight any longer he said unless you free me i am dead if it is my life you desire then you have it lord and my word with it free me and i will never again trouble any who have tasted the bread by which you have conquered me holding the loaf mab righ said your life is small enough payment for the wrongs you have done to my people but for the good of all i will free you with that he lifted the bread loaf which had conquered the giant go you hence the lord told the giant you will have neither morsel nor crumb from us for ever more the giant rose and shook himself all around then honouring the oath by which he had bound himself he took his leave of mab righ and walked away to the east and was never seen in the island again and thus the island was rid of the three plagues and the people were released from their long ordeal as sore had been their affliction so great was their happiness they delighted in their deliverance and revelled in their release for thirty days and three the people of the island realm feasted on the bread of their liberation and as much as they ate there was three times that much left when they were finished indeed they will feast on it for ever here ends the song of mab righ and the grain of rescue let him hear it who will nine as the last glittering notes went spinning into the night like the flaming sparks from the fire behind me i gazed upon the hillside the people sat rapt unwilling to break the spell that held them they had tastedhad feasted on the food of life and were loath to leave the table oh but it was not my voice that stirred those starving souls to their feeding it was the great light rising like the morning sun within them bidding them break their long fast i became aware of a movement nearby and arthur was there beside me tall and strong his face lit by golden firelight a field of stars behind him he lifted caledvwlch brandishing the naked blade as if he would drive away all dissent i stepped aside and arthur took my place cymbrogi he cried lofting the sword you have heard the song of a true bard and if you are like me your heart aches with the beauty of things we cannot name and yet and yet i tell you that it has a name truly it is the summer kingdom the high king spoke simply but with the zeal of a man who knows his greatest hope is within his grasp vitality shone from him brightening his countenance with holy fire he was the summer lord and he had glimpsed his kingdom still far off but nearer now than it had ever been the summer kingdom he said again his voice almost reverential in its awe myrddin emrys says this wonderful kingdom is near it is close at hand my friends awaiting our good pleasure to establish it who among you would shrink from such a glorious undertaking if we hold it in our power to establish the kingdom of summer how can we turn aside i do not know whether we shall succeed or fail he continued the task may be more difficult than any alive can know we may give all we have and still we may fail but who in the ages to come would forgive us if we did not try let us therefore pledge our hearts and hands to something that is worthy nay more than worthy of our best efforts who will make this pledge with me at this the warrior host roared out a shout to tremble heaven and earth my song had filled them with a yearning for the summer realm and the sight of their high king bold and bright before them had given them a glimpse of its lord they pledged themselves freely and with all their hearts but arthur was not finished when the shouts had died away he looked at caledvwlch in his hand this blade is mighty my arm is strong he told them cymbrogi you know that i love britain better than my life had i ten lives i would hold them worthless if i could not spend them in the island of the mighty this brought wholehearted approval which arthur humbly accepted believe me when i tell you that i would never do anything to defile this land nor less yet bring it to harm believe me also when i tell you that this ruinous war must cease he paused gathering all eyes to himself therefore i will meet the black boar on the plain tomorrow and i will fight him the high king still grasping the sword threw his hands wide cymbrogi he cried i ask you to uphold me in the day of trial uphold me my brothers tomorrow when i walk out onto that plain i want your hearts and prayers united with mine in the battle cast off doubt brothers cast off fear pray my friends pray with me to the god who made us all to grant me the victory not for my sake alone but for the sake of the summer kingdom he paused looking out across the silent sea of faces go now he said go to your prayers and to your dreams let us all rise tomorrow in the strength that comes from hearts and souls joined in true accord thus did we sleep and when night faded in the east and the high king and queen emerged from their nights rest gwenhwyvar stood resolutely beside arthur her face impassive against the day arthur broke fast and held council with his chieftains you have pledged to uphold me through all things he said reminding them of their vows of fealty i commend your readiness for war but now ask your willingness for peace today i will fight amilcar and i demand your sufferance hear me no one shall give the vandali cause to doubt that i shall hold to the terms of the ordeal in good faith if any man among you cannot agree this course let him depart now for he is no longer friend to arthur but if you stay then you will honour me in this many among them still distrusted the barbarians intent i do not blame them for feeling uncertain a man can doubt can nurse great misgivings and yet uphold his vow though his heart is no longer in it this i believe is the spirits highest consummation holding fast to faith by dint of will alone when the fire of certainty has grown cold for when the firewind of ardour gusts high even the weakest soul can fly but when the fire dies and the wind fails the real test of a souls worth begins those who persevere through all things gain strength and find great favour with god arthur did not cozen them but let the lords of britain know what he demanded and what their support would cost to their credit the nobles remained staunch none despite their misgivings deserted the high king or muttered against him accordingly as the sun began to break the far horizon the high king armed himself donning his good mail shirt and his war helm and slinging his ironrimmed shield over his shoulder with cut steel on his hip he tucked a dagger into his belt and selected a new spear cai and bedwyr did what little they could to help him inspecting his weapons tightening straps and laces offering advice and encouragement when he was ready he mounted his horse and rode out to the arranged meeting place on the plain the amassed war host of britain at his back the place was not far and when we halted a short time later arthur ordered the battlechiefs to take their places bidding rhys to remain alert to his signal and his chieftains to maintain keen vigilance and order among the men come what might he leaned from the saddle across to gwenhwyvar stoic and steely at his side cupped a hand to the back of her head and drew her face near you have ridden at my side in battle arthur said gently each time i have taken up the sword i might have been slain truly i might have been slain a thousand times over this day is no different so why do you fear a wife is ever happy to share her husbands lot gwenhwyvar replied tears suddenly welling in her eyes i have fought at your side yes chancing death gladly with you but i have no portion now in what you propose and that is more bitter to me than anything i know i care nothing for myself arthur told her what i do this day i do for britain in this battle i am britain no one can take my place or share my portion for this combat belongs to the king alone he stated the matter succinctly if peace was to obtain to all britain it must be won by him who held all britain in his hand thus arthur and no one else the sacrifice would be his or the glory but whether sacrifice or glory it was a sovereign act and his alone to make noble gwenhwyvar understood this and though she did not like it she accepted it for his sake i will abide she whispered only i wish i could bring myself to believe this barbarian would honour his word my heart arthur said taking her hand in his and gripping it hard we are not in amilcars hands truly we are in gods hands and if the high king of heaven upholds us who can stand against us gwenhwyvar offered a thin smile she lifted her head and squared her shoulders the warrior queen once more in all that followed she remained steadfast though many brave men quailed gwenhwyvar breathed no word of doubt or fear whatever qualms she might still have harboured in the matter she spoke never a word more nor did she ever so much as hint whether in mood or gesture that she distrusted the undertaking when she at last understood that arthur would not be moved gwenhwyvar took her place beside him as square and true as any of his chieftains and if arthur had so desired she would have taken the kings place on the plain without a murmur such was her true nobility arthur kissed his wife then climbed down from the saddle and squaring his shoulders walked alone onto the battlefield the britons stood in ranks behind their battlechiefs ardent prayers on every tongue great light preserve our king surround arthur with defending angels shield him with your swift sure hand away across the plain the vandali host advanced nor did they show any sign of halting until they were close enough for us to see their dark eyes gleaming in the merciless light their expressions were grave giving away nothing they came on nearer nearer still and i thought they would yet overrun us while we stood watching but when no more distance than the length of two spearthrows separated the two war hosts the vandali halted amilcar with two chieftains and hergest advanced seeing that amilcar arrived with bearers i called to cai and bedwyr to follow me and we ran to join arthur on the plain he cast a quick glance over his shoulder as we came running it may be true that you must fight amilcar alone i told him but you need not trust blindly to his barbarian sense of honour cai bedwyr and i will attend you and see that the black boar keeps his word arthur glanced at the resolute expressions on the faces of his friends very well let it be so we will go out together the three of us walked with arthur to meet the black boar and i determined to do what i could to ensure the fairness of the contest we met the vandal war leader in the centre of the plain and halted a few paces away the black boar was even bigger and more heavily muscled than i remembered him stripped for battle he presented a fierce and wildly savage aspect he had smeared his face and limbs with lard blackened with soot naked to the waist his torso was a mass of scars from old wounds stout thighs bulged below his leather loincloth he was barefoot and carried the heavy shield short widebladed sword and thickhafted spear or lance favoured by his kind around his thick neck he wore a triplestranded band strung with human teeth and knuckle bones his hair too had been greased and hung in thick heavy black ropes from his head there was indeed something of the wild boar in his aspect he stood easily regarding arthur with mild contempt no fear at all in his fathomless dark eyes amilcar seemed eager to meet arthur face to face at last in all he appeared a supremely confident warrior profoundly secure in his prowess the vandal chief grunted a stream of words in his guttural tongue which his captive priest rendered intelligible to us amilcar says he is well pleased that arthur has not run away from this fight he would have you know that he considers it the utmost honour to kill the british king the head of such a great lord will bring him much renown arthur laughed tell twrch i may not be parted from my head so easily as he thinks many have tried but all have failed hergest enjoyed repeating arthurs words to amilcar who made a quick reply lifting his necklace as he spoke and rattling the bones twrch trwyth says it is the same with him nevertheless he will be most happy to add the teeth and knucklebones of a briton king to his battledress amilcar spoke again twrch is ready hergest repeated there has been talk enough it is time to fight not yet i said holding up my hand before the combat begins i would hear the warriors vows what vows are these asked amilcar through his learned slave that you will observe the threefold law hergest relayed the reply and the vandali warlord asked what is this law the law is this that no man from either camp shall intervene or impede the contest that the appeal for mercy shall be granted that combat shall continue only so long as a man has breath to lift his weapon amilcar glared at me as hergest interpreted my words for him and delivered himself of a mocking reply twrch says your laws are the bleating of sheep in his ears he will have nothing to do with them then neither will this combat take place i replied firmly cai and bedwyr squared themselves hands on sword hilts unafraid for unless you agree to honour this law i continued the war will continue and the british lords will hound you from one end of this island to the other you will be hunted down and ground into the dust amilcar heard this with a scowl on his face he spat a word of reply it is agreed hergest told me amilcar makes this vow i turned to arthur agreed he said giving a sharp downward jerk of his chin i will be bound so be it i stepped away from the two combatants let the battle begin ten cai and bedwyr steely and determined took their places at my side keep your hands on your sword brother and watch his every move bedwyr hissed to cai amilcar is a liar and cannot be trusted twrch trwyth grinning savagely raised his sturdy lance and placed the short blade against his naked chest drawing the finely honed weapon across his flesh a thin trickle of blood dripped from the shallow wound down his blackgreased torso this i had seen before the barbarians believe that drawing first blood ensures victory through the spirit of the weapon thus awakened while the vandal thus occupied himself arthur drew caledvwlch and dropped to one knee gripping the blade in both hands he raised the hilt before him to form the sign of the cross whereupon he offered up a prayer to the saviour lord amilcar watched him narrowly as arthur knelt to pray the barbarian king moved to stand over him gazing down with an expression of deepest loathing he drew a deep breath and spat in arthurs upturned face the animal growled cai i will steady warned bedwyr putting his hand on cais sword arm arthur opened his eyes and regarded amilcar with icy indifference not so much as a muscle twitched closing his eyes once more he finished his prayer then stood slowly nose to nose not a hands breadth between them they confronted one another i could almost feel the heat of their anger tell twrch trwyth i forgive the insult to me arthur told the priest softly and when he is dead i will pray that jesu will forgive the insult to god and have mercy on his soul hergest repeated arthurs words whereupon the barbarian turned and swung out catching the slave priest with the back of his hand the monks head snapped back and a livid handmark appeared on the side of his face the barbarian will regret that most bitterly cai muttered beside me as amilcar strode to his position a few paces away arthur gestured behind him rhys alert to the signal blew a long shimmering blast on the horn the sound startled the waiting vandali host twrch glanced towards the british line seizing the moment arthur darted forth die twrch trwyth bedwyr cai and i retreated a few paces mercia hergest and the barbarian lords removed themselves to a position opposite which placed the combatants between us arthur and amilcar began circling one another warily it is the way of men who would learn the measure of one another both used the spear grasping the weapon easily midshaft amilcar probed with his spear swinging the blade restlessly back and forth searching for an opening a momentary lapse to exploit arthur however held the weapon still poised for either thrust or throw i watched them edging around one another and weighed them both in my mind neither man gave away anything in height arthur was more broad in the shoulder but amilcar was thicker through the torso where arthur was surefooted and steady the black boar was agile arthur bigboned strong and sturdy possessed a strength born of the wild northern hills the vandal chieftain possessed the considerable stature and hardiness of his race both men i concluded were roughly equal in strength and stamina though amilcar used to fighting on foot might have held a slight edge over arthur who waged combat from the back of a horse but a warrior is not proved on the strength of his sword arm alone if raw power were all that mattered a warrior queen like boudicca or gwenhwyvar would never have stood a chance women are not gifted with heft of shoulder and arm of the average man but they are clever and craftier by far as warriors their brains are quicker more nimble and more shrewd in battle cunning easily outreaches the strongest arm truly a warriors brain is first among all attributes the heart is second and here arthur had no equal although he may not have enjoyed llenlleawgs rare gift of the battle awen he owned a distinct advantage he was fearless nothing daunted arthur whether he faced a single spear or a thousand it made no difference to him whether arnilcar fought alone or with the entire vandal war host at his side i do not believe it would have dismayed the bear of britain in the least he might not have survived the encounter but fear would have had no part in his death when men think of arthur they imagine him all thicksinewed brawn carrying all before him by sheer dint of physical prowess in truth no more courageous or canny warrior ever lofted spear or strapped steel to hip he was strong of course but he was also wise a very druid of battle so the black boar of the vandali and the bear of britain circled one another eyes keen hands ready to seize upon the slightest lapse it came almost at once as the two moved sidestep by careful sidestep amilcar stumbled a small slip on uneven ground but arthur was on it in an instant he lunged forward spear stabbing up under the inside edge of amilcars shield everyone saw the misstep and gasped at arthurs speed in pursuing it but amilcar twisted away from the quick spear thrust sweeping his lance before him the cheers of the british died before they could be given voice for had arthur stepped in behind his stroke to force it home as a warrior often does his throat would have been sliced open amilcar recovered with such aplomb i wondered whether the misstep had not been a ruse a subtle feint designed to catch a greedy opponent unaware however effective in the past arthur was not overeager for an instant victory he was content to allow his spear to probe a little without committing himself to the first opportunity that came his way the white sun blazed along the keenedged blades and in the narrowed eyes of the combatants slowly slowly edging sideways the two warriors circled searching for an opportunity to strike arthur seemed prepared to allow this exercise to continue as long as it may he would not be rushed into error nor did the black boar seem anxious to grant arthur another opening false or otherwise so we stood in the hot sun the barbarian war host silent rank on rank facing the mounted might of britain with little more than a spearcasts distance between us every eye watching the dread dance unfold step by wary step around and around they went never putting a foot wrong circling circling ever watchful scarcely blinking they moved their feet making a large ring in the dust the first to lose patience would make a strike and the other would be waiting but nerve held for both men neither man lost his concentration but someone lost patience for across the battleground a shout went up from the vandal ranks whether of coarse encouragement for amilcar or derision for arthur i could not tell the cry cracked sharp in the silence and amilcars head turned towards the sound arthur saw his opponent look away and leaped forward in the same instant his spear level the blade slashing the sunlight flared on the blade i blinked when i looked again amilcars shield had knocked arthurs spear wide as his own lance jutted forth it happened so fast that i thought arthur had surely caught the spearpoint in the ribs he threw his shield into amilcars face forcing him back a step i looked for blood but saw none arthurs mail shirt had saved him a brutal cut the black boar permitted himself a sly wicked smile giving me to know that the shout and his apparent lapse had been another ruse clearly the man was shrewdly deceptive and had taken care to arm himself with many such deceits arthur had avoided the first of them and narrowly escaped the second i wondered what amilcar would try next and whether arthur would see it in time to save himself the cautious circling resumed and appeared likely to continue for some time indeed it had settled into a dull even rhythm when arthur suddenly stumbled he went down on one knee his spear slapping flat to the ground amilcar leaped on him in the same instant the stout black lance darted forth arthur stretched forward grabbed the oncoming spear with his free hand and pulled it towards him amilcar unbalanced by the unexpected tug on the end of his lance fell forward with a surprised grunt arthur leaped to his feet snatching up his spear once more in the same swift motion amilcar regaining his balance spun away swinging his heavy shield before him but arthurs spearpoint had grazed his side and blood now trickled down the black boars gleaming flank the cymbrogi raised a tremendous cry signalling their approval of the daring manoeuvre britains king had drawn first blood and perhaps more importantly served the barbarian warlord fair warning that the bear of britain was not without a few tricks of his own i had never seen this stumbling feint of arthurs and surmised that he had made it up by way of retaliation to temper amilcars deceptions the enemy war host did not care for the feat and they howled their disapproval from across the plain the merciless sun mounted higher the combat settled into a wary contest of stamina and will now and then one of the warriors would venture a stroke which was answered in kind but neither man was so hasty or inexperienced as to allow himself to be drawn into an impulsive exchange of blows around and around they went neither warrior presenting a weakness nor finding any in his opponent they circled and the burning sun peaked hovered and began to lower in its long slow plunge to the western horizon the britons shielded their eyes with their hands and watched the contest senses numbed by the heat and light on and on the ceaseless circling went and the day crept away eventually the light failed before either man gave in to fatigue or error i took it upon myself to halt the combat as the sun set and shadows began to claim the battleground signalling to hergest i indicated my wish to confer and he brought mercia to me it is soon dark i said we can let this go on through the night or we can agree to stop it and meet again tomorrow the captive priest delivered my words to mercia who hesitated regarding the fight thoughtfully i sensed in him a reluctance to interfere so i added it will be no hurt to either man to rest the night and begin again at midday tomorrow it shall be done the barbarian replied through the priest and the two approached the combatants calling for them to put up their weapons and withdraw for the night this they did though not without some reluctance thus the day ended without victory eleven the cymbrogi were relieved to welcome their kings safe return but disappointed that the days fight should leave the issue unsettled for his part arthur was tired of course hungry and desperately thirsty he desired nothing so much as a moments peace to recover himself the cymbrogi however having suffered the days endless and relentless uncertainty now required solid reassurance that their king remained strong and keen for the fight arthur understood their need tell them i will speak to them after i have eaten he instructed me as we entered his tent he removed his helm with a sigh and lowered himself wearily into his camp chair rhys where is that cup tell them to leave him in peace gwenhwyvar commanded sharply she knelt beside her husband and began pulling at the leather laces of his mail shirt he has endured enough for one day leave it with me i replied rest while you may stepping from the tent i addressed the gathered throng your lord is well but he is tired and hungry allow him a space to recover his strength and he will hold council when he has eaten and rested i raised my hands to them go now return to your duties and allow your king a space of peace is there anything we can do asked bedwyr stepping near say the word and it is done see that no one disturbs him i answered that will be no less a boon to him than food and rest done bedwyr replied contemplating the crowd a moment later after enlisting cador fergus and llenlleawg he began moving the warriors along to their camps reminding them that vigilance was still necessary for the vandali were yet near i called rhys to me and set him the task of bringing food and drink i have already seen to it he said slightly annoyed that i should have thought to command him in such an obvious duty the food is soon ready and i will bring it lord emrys never fear arthur passed a restful night he ate well and slept soundly rising with strength and spirit renewed no less eager to continue the fight than on the previous day he greeted his lords and warriors with good humour and spent the morning tending to his weapons choosing a new spear from among the many presented to him by eager cymbrogi just before midday he broke fast on hard bread and water then donning his mail shirt and helm he took up his weapons and went out to do battle once more as before they met on the plain the war hosts arrayed in long ranks behind them the black boar took his place his battlechiefs by his side looking smugly impassive indeed it seemed to me as i gazed at his coldeyed expression that amilcar appeared even more confident than before perhaps their previous encounter had answered any anxiety he may have had in confronting arthur or more likely he had armed himself with additional tricks and feints which he hoped would turn the fight his way arthur did not care to allow amilcar the first word hail twrch trwyth he called across the distance between them you appear most eager to die come then i will give you your hearts desire through hergest the priest the vandal chieftain received arthurs taunt by way of reply he spat arthur replied acidly as always your wit is charming the fight began as before both warriors circling and circling searching for an opportunity to strike the first perhaps decisive blow i took my place with cai and bedwyr beside me and the vandali chieftains took theirs we stood opposite one another watching the efforts of our champions as expected the black boar had armed himself with further deceptions these might have beguiled a less wary and experienced warrior but arthur handled them easily so the day passed to the sound of spear on shield the two warriors strained to their work hewing at one another each trying to beat down the resistance of the other but neither forcing a decisive advantage i watched the day stretch long a feeling of frustration and helplessness growing in me once during the heat of the day hergest approached to offer the warriors a drink of water i saw him standing between the two combatants and came to myself with a start i had been drifting in reverie oblivious to the battle before me but i saw the priest holding out the water jar offering a healing drink to the two combatants and the words came again into my mind you must go back the way you camel i have done that i thought what more can i do but the words became a voicemy own yet not my own and the voice grew insistent stern accusing it persisted drowning out all other thought until i heard nothing else go back go back the way you came if you would conquer you must go back the way you came i stood squinting in the sun staring at arthur as he leaned against his spear and drank when he finished he raised the bowl and poured water over his head i saw the high king of britain head back the harsh light full on his sweating face holding the bowl above him as the water splashed down it was a vision old as britain a weary warrior refreshing himself before returning to the fight the voice in my head stopped its insistent refrain as if silenced by the sight but it was not silent long for as i beheld the vision of arthur dousing himself with water another voice stirred to life this day i am britain they were arthurs words the words of the king to his queen spoken to remind her of his rank and responsibility true words certainly but as the cooling water bathed his face i heard in them the echo of a truth long forgotten too long forgotten or overlooked in our headlong drive for victory great light forgive me i am a slowwitted and ignorant man kill me lord it would be a mercy the fight resumed and continued until pale twilight descended over the battleground the day was spent and neither warrior had succeeded in gaining any advantage over the other as before i signalled mercia and we approached the combatants with the offer of breaking off the battle and resuming the next day both men weary beyond endurance readily agreed lowering their weapons they stepped away from one another i turned to summon cai and bedwyr to help arthur and amilcars chieftains advanced to aid their king the instant my head was turned the black boars lance flashed out i saw the swift movement of his arm and shouted arthur the spearpoint caught arthur in the upper shoulder he fell forward with the force of the throw his shield slamming to the ground the spear glanced and dropped into the dust cai leaped forward snatched up the shield and placed himself between arthur and amilcar mercia shouting wildly rushed forward and took hold of amilcar pulling him way before he could strike again bedwyr and i having reached arthur stooped to examine his wound it is nothing arthur said his teeth clenched help me stand it is nothing here do not let the cymbrogi see me so yes yes in a moment i want to see the injury i reached a hand to the wound but he shrugged away myrddin help me stand i will not be seen to lie here bedwyr whitefaced with shock and rage took arthur by the uninjured arm and helped him to his feet the brute he growled give me your sword artos i will gut him like a hog stay brother arthur said his voice calm and even it is nothing i would not like him to think he has gained any advantage in this let him think i but stumbled at the spearcast i looked across to the waiting cymbrogi every eye was on their king more than a few had drawn weapons and were prepared to attack gwenhwyvar was running to meet us her expression caught between concern and fury arthur raised a hand to halt her and waved her back cai bedwyr do not look back arthur commanded walk away may his barbarian soul for ever burn in hell muttered cai take my arm bear let us go from here we made our way from the field with exaggerated dignity gwenhwyvar llenlleawg and cador brought the horses and helped arthur to mount cymbrogi he called aloud have no fear for me i am tired from the fight and twrchs spearcast caught me unawares my good mail shirt has done me a service however and i am unharmed with that he raised his hand to them showing that his arm was not injured jerked the reins and rode back to camp with gwenhwyvar beside him cai bedwyr and i followed while the british battlehost watched the barbarians and waited for them to depart it was as arthur had said his mail shirt had done him admirable service and the wound was not serious well he asked after i had examined it properly it is not as you say nothing i answered the lance was well thrown if not well aimed the blade cut through your shirt and you have an ugly gash but it could have been worse gwenhwyvar added much worse even so i do not like the look of it i told them both bluntly i think it best to let the cut bleed as much as it will and then to bathe it with warm water put a little salt in the water to help cleanse the wound and then bind it keep your shoulder warm through the night and i will examine it again in the morning both of them caught the implication of my instructions why myrddin will you not be here no there is something i must do gwenhwyvar tend to this i replied i will return before morning gwenhwyvar rolled her eyes in exasperation but asked no further questions go then she said and bent her attention to her husband i left arthur to gwenhwyvars able care and stepped from the tent already my mind was running ahead to all i must do before the sun rose again on the next day cai and bedwyr looking anxious were waiting just outside the wound is not serious i told them i want you to aid gwenhwyvar and guard the kings rest i am going away but i will return before morninggwalchavad will accompany me llenlleawg also i could see the questions already forming on their lips and waved them aside saying fret not trust me and what shall we tell the lords when they ask after the king bedwyr called after me tell them to honour the kings peace and all shall yet be well i turned and hurried away cador fergus i called summoning them out from among the warriors gathered helplessly before the tent they came to me at once and i instructed them to gather the tools i needed for my nights work the two hurried away commanding other warriors to help gwalchavad i called llenlleawg come here the two were beside me in an instant ready your horses and get something to eat if you are hungry we are leaving camp and we will not return before morning where are we going asked gwalchavad back the way we came back to the beginning i told him he thought it a jest as far as that he inquired lightly and in only one night god willing i replied it may not be as far away as we think twelve the sky was nearly dark when we rode from the camp we did not go far a few hills away but well out of sight of any curious onlookers i halted my small company beside a dry streambed and while gwalchavad tethered the horses llenlleawg helped me unload the wagon cador had found why have you brought all this wondered llenlleawg hefting a hammer shovels picks augers saws why do you need all these tools you will see i told him gwalchavad hurry listen i said as he rejoined us there is not much time before sunrise tomorrow we must accomplish two tasks we must make a quantity of lime not difficult that gwalchavad said there is limestone enough along the riverbank and dry wood for burning yes i told him i hoped one of you would notice that shall be your task and the other inquired llenlleawg we are going to make a chariot a chariot exclaimed the irishman mildly in one night in one night yes gwalchavad laughed but llenlleawg merely nodded thoughtfully as if it were the most ordinary of chores making a chariot by dark of night when you said we were going back to the beginning i did not realize it would be so far he replied still you can depend on me myrddin emrys i will aid you every way i can that is why i chose you i explained and for another reason you two are unique among the cymbrogi and tonight i need your singular attributes they regarded one another curiously trying to decide what i saw in them that set them apart you will not see it in your faces i said the difference is this you are islanders wise emrys gwalchavad laughed again is it touched you are perhaps standing all day in the hot sun has poached the brain in your head perhaps i allowed but it seems to me that you have lived more closely to the ancient ways than most men in the south true remarked the son of orcady proudly the eagles could not subdue the wild islands the lords of the north never suffered the taint of rome nor did ireland put in llenlleawg quickly precisely i knew you would understand now i clapped my hands to work they fell to the task with a will and never asked the reason why like celts of old they simply laboured for their bard at his behest if the chief bard wanted a chariot that is what he would have my heart swelled with pride to see their simple trust does this from the exalted height of your enlightened age seem to you an insignificant thing i tell you it is not belief is everything these trusting men would labour day or night willingly because they believed in me in the old ways in the loyalty which bound them to their king they lived their belief and if asked they would gladly die for it tell me now who in your glorious age holds a belief so strong well we went about our tasks as i say the moonlight was more than adequate for gwalchavad who set about digging a shallow bowl in the riverbankthis would become the kiln he would fill with firewood and chunks of limestone dug from the cliffside i kindled a fire for myself and llenlleawg as he began removing the wagons front wheels and axle while the others were busy at these chores i sought the woad the plants were stunted and withered owing to the long dry season but as i had only a solitary torso to daub and not a whole warband i soon gathered all i needed i chopped the leaves and upper stalks into a small cauldron which i filled with water and set beside the flames to boil then i turned my attention to helping llenlleawg it is not so very difficult to make a chariot from a wagon something that resembles one at least once the smaller front heels axle and sides were removed we detached the pole and fixed it to the back mounting the high frontpiece to what had been the rear to give the driver something to hold to we then concerned ourselves with adding another harness to the pole and chain for a second horse it is possible to pull a chariot with one horse but much easier with two we worked amiably talking quietly the smoke from gwalchavads kiln fire drifting over and around us once or twice i observed the young warrior leaning on the stick he used to poke the fire his face ruddy in the glow of the fire and i watched llenlleawg stripped to the waist the firelight glimmering on his back as he worked with the wood and iron fittings a celt of elder days coming upon us now would have greeted the sight with recognition and hailed us as brothers if there is any enchantment in good men toiling together in hardy companionship we made powerful magic that night the moon slid farther towards the horizon before disappearing in a white haze at last after the moon set i built up the fire and stoked it more often to keep the light steady the night passed to the cold ring of the hammer and the hot crack of flame daylight was greying the eastern sky before we finished gwalchavad unblocked his kiln and scooped the soft white powdery lime onto flat rocks to cool then came to view the result of our nights labour bring on the vandal hordes he cried leaping onto the platform i will vanquish them all from here it is a beautiful thing do you think so wondered llenlleawg regarding the vehicle doubtfully it still looks more wagon than war cart to me a genuine war chariot would have been much lighter the wheels larger and the frontpiece made of stout wickerwork the pole would have been longer as well to prevent the horses hooves from crashing against the platform as they careened in full flight over the battleground nevertheless our crude imitation would more than satisfy my purpose if i had such a chariot gwalchavad replied happily the enemy would soon learn to fear the thunder of my wheels fortunately i replied a little thunder is all that is required i do not think arthur even knows how to fight from a chariot i only hope he can manage to steer it never fear wise emrys llenlleawg replied i will control this chariot for him that is how the ancient kings entered battle i would not see arthur settle for less you have done well i commended them and glanced to the rising sun and now we must hurry back the camp will be stirring soon and i want to be there when arthur wakes while llenlleawg and gwalchavad harnessed the horse to the chariot i packed the lime into a bag and retrieved the woad cauldron leave the tools i told them mounting to the saddle to llenlleawg i said remember what i told you to hear is to obey emrys the irish champion replied so be it snapping the reins i wheeled the horse and raced back to camp as i expected the warriors had begun to rouse themselves a few cooking fires were already sending slender plumes of smoke into the clear cloudless sky the first rays of sunlight broke above the hillline and i could feel the heat on my back as gwalchavad and i entered the encampment not wishing to see or speak to anyone i rode directly to arthurs tent find bedwyr cai and cador i commanded as we dismounted give them my instructions gwalchavad gave me the bag of lime and hurried away glancing quickly around i drew aside the flap and stepped into the kings tent the sight i encountered made my heart move within me gwenhwyvar her arms around arthur holding him his head on her shoulder sound asleep save for his mail shirt he was still wearing his clothes of the day before she looked up as i came to stand before her he was too tired to undress she whispered brushing his forehead with her lips have you held him like this all night i asked kneeling before her he fell asleep in my arms she replied i did not like to disturb him but you have had no sleep for yourself arthur is to fight again today she replied lifting a hand to stroke his hair i wanted to spend the night with him just like this she did not say that she feared it might be their last night but that is what she meant although we spoke in whispers the sound of our voices roused arthur and he wakened he sat up drawing away from his wife she released him but kept an arm on his shoulders oh lady i he began i fell asleep i am sorry i hush she said laying a fingertip to his lips i am content you were exhausted you needed sleep she put her mouth to his and kissed him he pulled her to him in a tight almost crushing embrace then noticed me myrddin he said is the whole camp risen so early not the whole camp perhaps i replied but i wanted to see you both before anyone else let me look at your shoulder arthur gwenhwyvar carefully peeled away the dressing and i saw an ugly red gash swollen and hot to the touch the cut was not long a thumbs length only but when i pressed the edges of the puncture a clear fluid oozed from it how does it feel i asked him good arthur lied a bee sting is worse by far move your arm for me arthur grudgingly moved his arm and rolled his shoulder satisfied he asked impatiently i told you it is nothing a nights sleep has done me a world of good possibly i allowed but i think it would be better to give your shoulder another days rest what and let the barbarian think that he has gained the advantage of me i will not let amilcar think what he likes you must consider your shoulder what will it avail britain if you get yourself killed today for the sake of your pride twrch trwyth and the vandali will soon assemble on the plain what will they do if i am not there amilcar violated the law he agreed to honour i pointed out i do not believe he will press the matter further let him wait i say until tomorrow if need be do you forbid me bard he demanded growing cross i hesitated then shook my head saying i do not say you cannot i say you should not i leave it to you do what you will then i will fight him today arthur declared and with gods help i will defeat him perhaps god has already sent his aid i suggested why arthur asked looking from me to gwenhwyvar and back again what have you done i have contrived a surprise for amilcar i said a deception gwenhwyvar chided in mock disapproval and from you myrddin emrys i am alarmed no deception i answered and quickly explained how llenlleawg gwalchavad and i had spent the night what said arthur when i finished has no one slept the night but me a chariot wondered gwenhwyvar but that is wonderful i must see this marvel at once said arthur rising to his feet soon but not yet i said i would rather no one see you before the fight am i to be made prisoner in my own tent only until all the others have gone out to the battlefield i told them both what i intended they listened to all with bemused slightly astonished expressions on their faces no king has ever had a better bard said gwenhwyvar when i finished rising she smiled and kissed me on the cheek it is splendid wise emrys i commend your scheme and will pray for its success arthur stretched and yawned and sat down again on the bed rubbing his wellstubbled jaw thoughtfully well the shave will be agreeable at least i will bring a basin and a razor gwenhwyvar said stepping to the tent flap it pleased me that she welcomed my plan so eagerly and something to eat added arthur yawning i am starving he lay back on the bed and was soon sleeping soundly once more thirteen the opposing war hosts were arrayed on the field of battle as before rank on rank behind their chieftains staring fiercely across the plain at each other it was nearing midday and they were looking for arthur to arrive but he was nowhere to be seen a premature shout went up as i appeared but died abruptly when they saw i was alone they looked at one another with puzzled expressions and returned uneasily to their waiting the britons were not the only ones anxious for arthurs arrival the vandali also stretched their necks for a sign of him and with even greater anticipation for if the british king failed to appear then amilcar would be judged the victor each moment that arthur delayed the expectation of triumph grew i did not know how long the vandal king would content himself to stand aside while arthur tarried i hoped he might use the opportunity to belittle his opponent but he seemed content to bide his time and the longer he waited the lower ebbed my hope and i began to fear that all my work would come to nothing had the wily black boar guessed what arthur was planning no impossible then why did amilcar stand so amiably by why did he not denounce arthur and call for the britons to produce their king or declare himself the victor the sun mounted higher in a formless sky blazing hot pooling inky shadows on the dry ground i looked along the ranks of men standing uneasily sweating their eyes narrowed slits against the hard hard light across the plain the barbarians shifted restlessly the expectation was growing too great to contain any longer yet amilcar waited when the vandali war drums finally sounded i thought at last the moment we have been waiting for arthur take it amilcar advanced with his bodyguard and priest to his accustomed place he stood for a moment scanning the ranks then drew himself up and called out in a loud voice which hergest repeated where is your champion where is your great king is he hiding is he afraid to face me the words met stony silence why does no one answer me has fear taken your tongues come out and fight show me you are not afraid when he received no answer his shouts became taunts dogs cowards now you show your true nature kings of cowards where is your coward of a king this went on for a time the britons grew sullen and restive under this abuse i could see the seeds of doubt and worry taking root this was all to the good my plan would better succeed if even arthurs own cymbrogi were taken by surprise and amilcars abuse was beginning to worry our men bedwyr hurried to my side a frown of deepest concern creasing his brows i thought you said you would bring him i did and i have then where is he amilcar will not wait for ever whatever you are planning peace bedwyr i soothed return to your place all is as it should be with you myrddin nothing is ever as it should be he retreated a few steps behind me telling cai it is no use brother he will tell us nothing where is arthur demanded cai peace i replied he is near well if arthur does not come soon cai called to me tell twrch that will fight him that will stop him raving amilcar drew encouragement from the refusal of the britons to meet his taunts he preened and posed strutting back and forth crying his insults to the cowed and increasingly uncertain britons i saw in his swagger the confidence of a man who believes himself a conqueror and his adversary already vanquished yes i thought he is ready come arthur it is time but arthur did not come and then it was my turn to worry where was he why did he wait what if something had happened to him i endured this uncertainty for a time wondering what to do and was on the point of sending cai and bedwyr to find him when i heard it a low rumble like distant thunder the sound grew rapidly louder mounting steadily like the wind of an approaching storm the britons heard it and looked to the west the vandali heard it too and turned towards the sound because of his shouting the black boar was the last to hear the strange thunder his voice faltered and he turned his gaze to the west where a pillar of dust had appeared the sound became a steady drumming rumble and arthur appeared as if out of a tempest but it was arthur as no one had ever seen him standing upright on the platform of a speeding chariot brandishing a spear llenlleawg also painted with blue woad held the traces driving two of fergus swift irish stallions the chariotfor it did look very like a war chariot was hung with a bearskin and there were spears lashed to the uprights giving it an even more menacing appearance this llenlleawg had done on his own so pressed for time to complete the vehicle i had not thought of it as remarkable as the sudden and unexpected appearance of the chariot might be however i think it was scarcely noticed at all for every eye was on arthur alone and he held them rapt his hair was a wild spiky mass white and stiff with lime most startling of all he was wearing neither leather nor mail in truth he wore nothing save his golden tore of kingship the champions of an elder time often fought naked disdaining armour trusting only their own prowess for protection his face and body were freshly shaved and his skin daubed blue with woad spirals hands stripes jagged lightning patterns all over his arms and chest and down his thighs and legs symbols and signs now forgotten but once possessing great power the impact of his unexpected appearance could not have been greater it was as if a hero of old had taken flesh anew morvran iron fist himself rising bodily from the dust at their feet would not have astonished them more some did not recognize arthur at first and even those who did know him stared in amazement behold i cried the pendragon of ynys prydein riding to the defence of his realm how long has it been since a british king has appeared so before his people i felt a touch on my arm as gwenhwyvar came to stand beside me her face was alight with pleasure at the effect of the surprise oh he is a splendid man truly and do not think to send me back to the line she said after what happened yesterday i will not go very well i replied stay we stood together the queen and i revelling in a sight that had not been witnessed in the island of the mighty for ten generations or more such a spectacle so bold and proud standing in the chariot tore glinting in the sun adazzle with the blue of an elder age they were heroes indeed arthur and llenlleawg raced up and down the length of the british line encouraging wild whoops and cheers from the gathered cymbrogi a sound to assault the heavens when they had whipped the britons into an ecstatic frenzy llenlleawg turned the horses and drove the chariot to the centre of the battlefield where he stopped arthur lofted his spear and hurled it into the ground a few paces away then stepped down llenlleawg turned the horses and drove the chariot from the field taking up his shield and sword both washed white with lime the high king of britain called out to the vandal warlord twrch trwyth i have heard your empty boasts take up your weapons and let us make an end of this battle i tell you the truth the world is weary of your presence and i grow tired of you myself come death awaits you amilcar much impressed by arthurs appearance was slow to answer indeed one of us will leave the field the other will stay the barbarian king spoke much less confidently now so be it let whatever gods you pray to receive your soul thus the deadly dance began once more around and around the warriors moved circling circling edging probing for an opening gwenhwyvar chewed her lip never taking her eyes from the contest i noticed that one hand found the hilt of her sword the other her dagger she stood there at the ready willing arthur to make a beginning take him bear she murmured you can do it strike and as if in answer to her prompting arthur took a quick backward step and amilcar suspecting a trick hesitated that momentary lapse was all arthur needed indeed i saw now that he had cultivated it using the vandals devious nature against him a man who employs deception always looks for it in others and amilcar thought he saw it now but arthur used no trick his quick step backward was but preparation for an honest and open attack and like arthurs altered appearance it caught amilcar unaware arthur stepped back releasing his sword and letting it fall to the ground his arm swung out and his hand closed on the spear he had planted he whipped his arm forward the black boar flatfooted in hesitation made to dodge aside but too late the spear struck amilcars shield square in the centre it was a supremely wellexecuted throw but i wondered at its prudence it had done no hurt to the black boar and now arthur lacked a spear no no no gwenhwyvar groaned but we were wrong arthurs ploy was genius itself the spearhead was deeply embedded in the centre of amilcars shield where he could not easily reach it to rid himself of the nuisance twrch must either lower the shield or somehow swipe at the spear with his own and try to knock it off he could not leave the spear where it wasan unbalanced shield was too awkward and his arm would soon grow tired just trying to steady the unwieldy thing the black boar was in trouble and the look of incredulous anger creasing his face said that he knew it he made an ineffectual swipe at the infuriating spear with the butt of his own weapon arthur was ready he scooped up caledvwlch and darted forward swinging the great blade through a tight arc as if to sever amilcars spear hand this brought a howl of exasperation from the black boar a roar of approval from the britons and a yelp of delight from gwenhwyvar good she cried well done bear amilcar evaded the stroke with a quick sidestep but arthur pressed his slight advantage moving closer sword slicing the air above the upper rim of his adversarys shield he weighed in against the black boar forcing him back and back amilcar desperate his face fixed in a snarl of rage thought to use the bothersome spear against arthur he threw his shield before him heaving the protruding spearshaft into arthurs face arthur unencumbered by the weight of leather and mail ducked easily under the shaft and charged headlong into amilcar as the shield swung wide the black boars chest and stomach were momentarily exposed and arthurs swordpoint found its mark amilcar made a futile chop with his spear as he fell rolling onto his back arthur lunged at him to deliver the killing blow but amilcar released his useless shield and hurled it up into arthurs face the protruding spear deflected arthurs strike allowing amilcar to squirm away as the blade bit into his hip he regained his feet in an instant and backed away he had saved himself a terrible gash but now faced arthur without a shield and bleeding from two wounds neither injury was mortal but the steady loss of blood would fatigue and weaken him the balance of battle had tipped towards arthur he had placed his opponent in a critical if not grievous position what would amilcar do the next move would likely augur the end gwenhwyvar realized this too i suddenly felt her hand on my arm fingernails digging into my flesh take him arthur she urged eyes bright her brows lowered against the sunlight oh take him quickly knowing himself in dire distress amilcars reaction was immediate and decisive he attacked like the boar cornered by the pursuing hound he gave an earsplitting shout lowered his head and charged i could but marvel at the daring truly i murmured he is a very boar of battle i see that his name is well earned gwenhwyvar did not care for my approval her mouth bent down she gave a derisory snarl and removed her hand from my arm the black boars attack on arthur lacked nothing an act of concentrated fury its ferocity was breathtaking a stone hurled from a sling is not more relentless or unswerving nor less swift amilcar drove in behind his lance broad back and shoulders hunched for a mighty thrust straight and true he charged risking all on this one feat arthur caught the blow square on the shield i heard a loud crack as the thick vandal lance shattered arthur staggered and almost went down amilcar threw the splintered shaft into arthurs face drew his short sword and before arthur could move charged again hurling himself forward with an earsplitting scream of rage and desperation but arthur did not meet this attack at the last moment he stepped aside and allowed the black boar to pass unscathed i wondered at this it is not like arthur to permit even the slightest opportunity to slip by but he seemed to be having difficulty with his shield his arm hung down no groaned gwenhwyvar suddenly please god no then i saw it too and my heart clenched like a fist in my chest fourteen amilcars lance had penetrated the stout oak of the high kings shield and embedded itself in arthurs arm blood cascaded freely down the inside of the kings shield skewered his forearm pierced arthur could not free himself desperate to make the most of this unexpected advantage amilcar seized his sword hilt and leaped at arthur loosing a furious rain of doublehanded blows upon the wounded arm beneath the shield again and again the blade rose and fell each stroke hammering at the broken spearpoint forcing it deeper into the wound arthur reeled his body convulsing in agony each time amilcar struck the point he tried to fend off the blows swinging caledvwlch in powerless futile strokes the black boar swung hard and struck the sword from arthurs hand the blade spun from his grasp and landed in the bloodspattered dust at his feet gwenhwyvar groaned but did not look away staggering back and back no longer able to respond to the black boars assault arthur swayed under the blows glimpsing his chance at victory amilcar lifted his voice in a growling shout of triumph leaping driving striking again and again again again again wild savage ruthless blows each one falling with boneshattering impact dearest god in heaven what keeps arthur on his feet chips of wood from arthurs shield flew into the air blood splashed from the split shieldrim in a steady rain pelting into dust my throat seized i could not swallow i could neither watch nor look away crack crack the great shield began to break under the shattering attack chunks of splintered oak dropped to the ground i saw the point of amilcars lance protruding from the inside of arthurs arm the blunt blade had passed between the bones making any movement of the arm impossible arthur was fixed to the shield amilcar terrible in his fury raised his heavy blade over his head and brought it down on the rim of the broken shield arthurs head jerked back his features twisted in agony shoulders heaving the black boar threw the blade high and brought it down with all his strength crack the shield rim burst and the oak split top to bottom another such stroke and the shield would break completely arthur gwenhwyvar screamed arthur twrch trwyth bore down mercilessly the vandali filled the air with a clamour of encouragement for their king a sound to strike terror into the stricken british again the short black sword rose and again it fell arthur collapsed his legs had given way beneath him and he went down heavily landing on his hip he rolled as if trying to crawl away but amilcar was on him instantly striking furiously another massive chunk of arthurs shield came away amilcar howled he hacked at arthur with a savage demented glee arthur struggling to rise kept the broken shield over him every warrior who saw it knew he was only delaying the terrible inevitable final fatal thrust the high king heaved himself up the black boar raised his foot and kicked arthur back arthur rolled on the ground again god help him cried gwenhwyvar holy jesu save him i echoed her prayer with one of my own no less blunt or heartfelt still the black boar struck his iron blade cracking loud on the shattered remnant of the high kings shield arthur rolled his good arm flung wide he seemed confused his hand fumbled uselessly in the dust great light save your servant arthur squirmed on his back as the black boars sword smashed the broken shield the battered wood parted falling away completely his last defence abandoned him caledvwlch cried gwenhwyvar arthur caledvwlch in the same instant arthurs hand found his fallen sword i saw his fingers tighten on the blade and pull it to him he has it i shouted rise bear cried gwenhwyvar stand arthur gathered his legs beneath him and pushed himself up on one knee twrch lashed out with his foot striking arthur on his injured shoulder arthur fell arthur cried gwenhwyvar her sword was in her hand and she made to dash forth amilcar exultant bellowing his conquest raised his weapon one last time grasping caledvwlchs naked blade in his bare hand arthur made his final stand and i remembered that time long ago when a young boy stood alone on a mountainside against a charging stag now as then arthur made no attempt to strike he merely lifted the blade against amilcars doublehanded assault amilcars sword swung down as arthurs rose to meet it there was a peal of ringing metal a flash of spark and the black boars blade fractured sheared neatly in two the wildeyed triumph in the vandal chieftains face melted into disbelief as he stared at the swordblade lying at his feet cut steel had served its master well with a heroic effort arthur gathered his legs beneath him and raised himself up he stood swaying his wounded arm hanging uselessly at his side the lancehead still firmly stuck the bright blue woad on his body was now mixed with sweat and deep red blood head bowed he stared unblinking at his adversary the vandali stricken by the swift turnabout fell silent the shouts of triumph dying in their throats silence claimed the plain arthur steadied himself and squared his shoulders the black boar clutching the useless hilt with its stub of broken blade glowered at the high king with a shout of defiance he flung himself at arthur slashing fiercely with the broken shard of his blade unable to fend off the blows arthur stepped aside and lowered caledvwlch but his courage had not deserted him even as he evaded amilcar he prepared his last defence as amilcar leapt arthurs hand steady calm unhurried snaked out swinging the sword level the black boars charge carried him onto the blade amilcar threw back his head and roared a cry of shock and sharp defiance then lowered his eyes to view the sword driven up under his rib cage he had impaled himself on arthurs sword the black boar raised his head and smiled his eyes glazed and his grin icy he lurched towards arthur forcing the blade still deeper into himself blood bubbled out of the wound in a sudden crimson rush he opened his mouth to speak his tongue strained at the words but his legs gave way and he fell to the ground where he lay twitching and convulsing stepping to amilcars body arthur extracted caledvwlch from his enemys chest clenching his jaw against the pain he raised the blade to shoulder height and let it drop swiftly down severing the black boars neck with a stroke amilcars head rolled free and the dreadful quivering ceased arthur stood for a moment then turned and staggered towards us in the same instant a scream tore the stillness of the battleground one of the vandal warlords ida it was rushed out onto the battlefield readying his spear as he ran arthur gwenhwyvar shouted behind you arthur turned his head not yet apprehending the danger closing on him from behind arthur she screamed already racing to his side llenlleawg was instantly at her back britains king half turned to meet his new assailant and his legs buckled under him he crashed to his knees arthur made to rise but his attacker was closing fast one quick spear thrust and britains high king would be dead gwenhwyvars knife glinted like a fiery disc in the sun as it spun in the air it did not stop the barbarian he ran on a few steps before his hand lost strength and the lance slipped from his fingers he glanced down to see the queens dagger buried up to the hilt in his upper arm he stooped to retrieve the lance and gwenhwyvars sword sang through a tight arc and caught him at the base of the neck the barbarian pitched onto his face dead here i am cried gwenhwyvar her voice towering with defiance who is next she stood over the corpse her sword red with the blood of arthurs false assailant shouting daring the vandali to attack llenlleawg bristling with menace took his place beside the queen another of the barbarian chieftains appeared eager to take gwenhwyvar at her word he drew his sword and started forth mercia seized him and threw him back the battlechief staggered up thrusting the head of his lance in mercias face mercia grabbed the shaft of the lance and lashed out with a cruel kick catching his bellicose comrade on the point of the chin the chieftain subsided in a heap cai and bedwyr dashed to gwenhwyvars side the four stood over arthur weapons drawn daring the enemy to attack meanwhile i ran to arthurs side mercia stepped boldly out from among the others he called in a loud voice and summoned hergest to him together they advanced to where the three britons stood help me stand groaned arthur through clenched teeth in a moment i told him gently first i must look at your wound there was blood everywhere and sweat and dust and woad help me stand myrddin he shrugged away and using caledvwlch raised himself up on his knees his injured arm hung down limp and useless blood seeped from the wound in a steady dark flow i helped him regain his feet and he turned to meet the advancing vandali mercia with hergest beside him presented himself to the high king lord mercia says that he recognizes arthur to be victor hergest explained he will abide the terms of peace do with us what you will with that mercia threw the disarmed chieftains lance to the ground at cais feet he then drew the short sword from his belt laid the blade across his palms and offered it to arthur bowing his head in submission i am slave to you lord king he said the high king motioned to gwenhwyvar who took the sword i accept your surrender arthur said through clenched teeth his voice hollow to cai and bedwyr he muttered see to it he made to turn away stumbled and would have fallen if not for llenlleawgs quick reaction the irish champion threw an arm around the kings shoulders and held him up for the love of jesu arthur sit down and let me tend you but arthur would not hear it walk with me to the chariot he said to gwenhwyvar let me bind your arm at least i objected i will leave the field as i came he growled his skin was ashen and waxy he was on the point of fainting join me when matters are concluded here he gripped my arm not before arthur walked with slow painful dignity to the waiting chariot llenlleawg on one side and gwenhwyvar on the other upon reaching the chariot llenlleawg all but lifted his wounded king onto the platform and the queen took her place beside him to steady him and keep him upright they drove from the battleground to the ecstatic cheers of the british the cymbrogi hailed him loudly as he passed but arthur kept his eyes on the far horizon i bade mercia summon the remaining vandali battlechiefs and there over the corpse of their dead leader i received their surrender mercia assuming command made bold to answer for all through the captive priest he said the battle was fought fairly our king is dead we accept your terms and stand ready to give whatever spoils you ask whether hostages or victims for sacrifice cai did not like this do not trust them myrddin they are all lying barbarians you will be disarmed i told mercia your people will be taken from here and returned to your camp to await the pendragons pleasure hergest repeated my words in their tongue whereupon under mercias commanding glare the vandali battlechiefs threw their weapons upon the ground when they were disarmed the young chieftain spoke once more and hergest said you called the king of britain a strange name pendragon did you not i did i replied mercia spoke up addressing me directly what means this word pendragon the word means chief dragon i explained it is the title the cymry use for the supreme ruler and defender of the island of the mighty hergest translated my words and mercia placed his hand on his heart and then touched his head it was a sign of submission and honour i place my life in the hands of the pendragon of britain leaving bedwyr cai cador and the rest of the lords to deal with the vandali i returned to the line mounted the nearest horse and raced back to camp as fast as the beast could fly i pressed through the worried throng gathered before arthurs tent the few women and invalid warriors who had not attended the battle but had witnessed their wounded kings return swarmed the entrance to his tent anxious and worried pushing my way through i entered the tent to find gwenhwyvar cradling arthur against her as she held him halfsitting halflying on his pallet her clothing was smeared and stained with blue woad and red blood it is over my soul she soothed dabbing at his arm with a cloth it is finished gwenhwyvar iit is arthur began then winced pain twisting his features he bit back the words and his eyelids fluttered and closed be easy bear she said kissing his brow then raised her head and looked around furiously llenlleawg she cried saw me and said myrddin help me he keeps fainting i am here keeling beside her i took the cloth and gently gently oh so carefully i lifted arthurs arm he groaned gwenhwyvar gasped at what she saw the point of the lance had been driven through the arm passing between the two arm bones the broken shaft protruded from one side a mass of splinters where amilcar had hacked at it the thick iron tip poked through the other but there was more the force of the thrust had driven the spearhead through the arm and into the soft crease above his thigh where the veins gathered thick one of these had been severed he was bleeding into his abdomen i pressed the cloth to the gash and sat back to think where is llenlleawg i sent him for water to bathe the wound hold tight i told her indicating arthurs arm what are you going to do gwenhwyvar asked easing the arm upright i took hold of the black boars broken spear grasping the splintered stump i gave a quick firm pull aghh arthur gasped in agony stop it shouted gwenhwyvar myrddin stop it must be done i told her again i tightened my grip on the stub end greasy with blood gwenhwyvar her lips a tight line held arthurs arm in both her own clutching it to her breast blood welled from the wound spilling over her hands now i shouted and yanked with all my might arthur gave a strangled cry his head lolled on his shoulders the shaft broke away from the head but the blade did not come free i had succeeded only in making the wound bleed more freely llenlleawg entered the tent with a basin of water he brought it to me and knelt down holding it i took the bit of cloth he offered dipped it into the water and began to bathe the wound washing away the blood and dirt is the arm broken asked llenlleawg no i replied probing the injury with my fingertips but this is not the worst i told them about the groin wound truly that alarms me far more than the arm i rose making up my mind at once i turned to llenlleawg there is room in the chariot for three you will drive arthur and gwenhwyvar will go with you i will ride ahead to alert barinthus and ready a boat i turned starting away make him as comfortable as possible and come at once where are we going demanded gwenhwyvar to ynys avallach i called over my shoulder fifteen charis grave with concern emerged from the room where arthur lay i think the bleeding has stopped at last she said solemnly thank god gwenhwyvar breathed her relief almost tangible but charis continued there was no comfort in her voice he is very weak she paused looking from gwenhwyvar to me truly i fear for him gwenhwyvar shook her head denying what charis was saying the wound is not so bad gwenhwyvar insisted her voice growing uncertain once the blade was removed i thought i thought he would her voice cracked very close to tears arthur has lost much blood charis said putting her arm around the queens shoulders it often happens that loss of blood is more harmful than the injury itself we must pray he awakens soon and if he does not asked the queen horrified by the thought but asking nonetheless it is in gods hands gwenhwyvar charis said we can do no more after a breathless chase through the vale and barinthus swift boat across mor hafren we had reached the fisher kings palace charis and elfodd had taken over arthurs care with skills honed by long experience the point of the broken lance had been carefully removed from the high kings arm and he had been given healing draughts to drink arthur had seemed to revive at first he sat up and talked to us then he slept and we thought the rest a benefit to him the thigh wound had opened again in the night however and by morning he had lapsed into a dull insensate sleep he slept all through the day and now as evening stole across the quiet hills arthur could not be roused charis was clearly worried she squeezed the queens shoulder it is in gods hands she whispered hope and pray gwenhwyvar clutched my arm her fingers digging into my flesh do something myrddin she urged please save him save my husband i took her hand and clasped it tightly go with charis and rest a little i will stay with him now and send for you if there is any change charis led gwenhwyvar away and i entered the chamber where arthur lay on the litter the fisher king used when his old affliction came upon him abbot elfodd raised his head as i came to stand beside him he saw the question in my eyes and shook his head i will watch with him now i whispered the good abbot declined to go saying we will watch together we stood a long time in silence listening to arthurs slow shallow breathing god will not let him die i said willing it to be so elfodd looked at me curiously i remember another time when i stood here like this and another spoke those selfsame words he paused and indicated arthurs sleeping form but it was you myrddin lying there in the sleep of death and it was pelleas standing over you refusing to let you go that way my mind flooded with the memory we had been in armorica pelleas and i where morgian thought to slay me with a wicked enchantment pelleas had brought me to ynys avallach for healing much as i had brought arthur i remember i said thinking of that strange unhappy time with all thanks to you i was saved with no thanks to me the abbot objected it was avallachs doing not mine avallach i had never heard that part of the tale before what do you mean elfodd regarded me with an expression close to suspicion no he turned away perhaps i have said too much i have spoken above myself what is it elfodd tell me i charge you there is a mystery here and i would know it he made no answer elfodd tell me what is it i cannot he said it is not my place then tell me who may speak ask avallach himself the abbot said ask your grandfather he knows my heart quickened within me leaving arthur to the abbots care i fled the chamber and went in search of avallach it did not take long i found him at prayer in the small chapel he had made in one of the rooms in the west wing of the palace i entered the chapel and went to kneel beside him he finished his prayer and raised his head ah merlin it is you he said his voice a soft rumble of thunder i thought you might come here how is arthur weak and growing weaker i replied speaking the full force of my fear he may not live through the night avallachs generous features assumed an expression of heartsick grief i am sorry he said the bear of britain is not dead yet i replied and told him what elfodd had brought to mind i remember it well avallach agreed oh we were worried for you merlin we almost lost you elfodd said that but for you i would have died is that true it was a miracle of gods blessing the fisher king replied and when i asked him what he meant elfodd would only say that he had spoken above himself he would tell me nothing more about it he said i must ask you i stared at him hard well grandfather i am asking you what did he mean avallach regarded me for a long time in silence then lowered his curly dark head it is the grail he answered at last his voice still and low he is talking about the grail i remembered the holy cup of the christ it had come to britain with the man who had paid for that last meal in the upper room the tin merchant joseph of arimathaea i had seen it once years ago while praying in the shrine i have always thought it was a vision i said it is more than that avallach answered very much more my heart leapt with sudden joy then you must use it to heal arthur as you used it to heal me i jumped to my feet and made to hasten away no avallachs stern refusal halted me before i had taken two paces why what do you mean arthur is dying the grail can save him if you have it you must use it to heal him the fisher king rose slowly i could see sorrow like an immense weight upon his shoulders it cannot be he said softly it is not my place to decide such things it is gods place he must decide it is ever gods good pleasure to heal the sick i insisted how can you withhold that healing if it is within your power he merely shook his head the grail he said gently the grail merlin is not like that it is not to be used so you must understand i do not understand i declared flatly i only know that arthur is dying and if he dies the kingdom of summer dies with him if that should happen britain will fall and the west will die the light of hope will fail and darkness will overtake us at last i am sorry merlin avallach said again i would it were otherwise he made to return to his prayers now it was my turn to challenge and refuse no i shouted do not think to pray for arthurs healing when you hold that healing in your hands yet refuse to give it death replied the fisher king sadly is also gods good pleasure do you think this easy for me i sit here every day and watch people die they come to the shrine this plague has oppressed us sorely and we do what we can for them a few live but most die as i said it is for god to decide he alone holds power over life and death he has given you the grail i argued why has he done that if he did not intend you to use it it is a burden more terrible than any i know moaned avallach yet you used it once to heal me i persisted you took it upon yourself to decide then you saved my life where is the harm that was different how so i demanded i see no difference at all he looked away sighing heavily you are my daughters only child the only son of your father you are my flesh and blood merlin and i am weak i could not help myself i did it to save you indeed i cried my voice ringing in the rock cell my life was saved so that the kingdom of summer would not die perhaps i was saved so that i could stand here before you this night and argue for arthurs life the fisher king observed me thoughtfully who is to say you preserved me and so preserved the vision of the summer realm hear me avallach the kingdom of summer is near closer now than it has ever been how can we let the summer lord die he said nothing though i could see that he was wavering if you are the keeper of this grail i said solemnly then it is for you to exercise the power of your position for the good of all i tell you the truth there is not another life the worth of arthurs and even now it is slipping away from us saving that life will lead to the salvation of generations yet unborn avallach pressed a hand to his head wearily do you not know i have been entreating the throne of heaven on his behalf i have not left off one moment since he arrived god will welcome arthur in his time i affirmed but that time is not yet this i know if a life is required i stand ready to give mine i raised my hands to avallach in supplication save him please save him very well avallach relented i will do what i can though i do not command the grail as you seem to think i can only ask the grail answers how it will i did not know what form the fisher kings ministrations would take but as we hurried back across the yard to arthurs chamber i offered to help in any way i could tell me what is to be done grandfather and it will be done avallach stopped beneath the gallery roof no one can aid me merlin what i do i must do alone as you will every mortal creature must be removed from this place avallach continued every male and female all mortal flesh whether human or animal must be removed beyond the walls of the palace arthur only may remain i wondered at this but accepted his instructions it shall be as you say while elfodd and i ran through the fisher kings palace rousing everyone from bed llenlleawg awakened the stable hands and began moving the livestock from the barns and pens by torchlight we made our way down the narrow twisting path to the lake some led dogs on leashes others horses several drove cattle sheep kine and goats two or three carried bird cages and one child held an armful of kittens in a little while all who lived in the palace mortal fair folk birds and beasts were gathered at the lakeside below the abbey the horses and cattle grazed quietly in the long grass charis and gwenhwyvar were the last to leave arthurs side come lady we can do nothing more for him charis said taking gwenhwyvar by the hand it is time to give him up to the care of another i am loath to leave him lady charis gwenhwyvar said tears swelling in her eyes she lowered her face to arthurs and kissed him a tear splashed on the kings cheek she kissed it away come i said gently for unless you leave he cannot be healed charis and i led the queen from arthurs deathbed at the doorway i paused and looked back at his body sunken in the cushions of the litter so still so silent as if already sinking into dissolution and decay gwenhwyvar hesitated and turned she ran back to the litter and unfastening the brooch at her shoulder removed her cloak and spread it over him as gwenhwyvar covered arthur with a cloak i covered him with a prayer great light banish the shade of death from the face of your servant arthur shield him this night from hate from harm from all ill whatever shall befall him so be it she kissed him again and murmured something in his ear then rejoined us dryeyed now and resolute we hastened through the allbutdeserted palace i looked for avallach but saw no sign of him as we passed quickly through the empty hall and gallery and then flitted across the vacant yard and out through the open gates in darkness we made our way down the narrow path to join the others waiting at the lake elfodd and llenlleawg were there holding torches the rest of the palacedwellers were scattered along the shore sitting in small clumps or standing some on the hillside some by the lake we appeared an exile band cast out from our homeland in the dead of night the air was warm and calm though the moon had already set the sky overhead blazed with stars casting a pale silvery light over all below are you certain all the animals have been removed i asked every dog to the smallest pup llenlleawg answered every horse and colt sheep lamb and cow nothing on four feet or two remains behind elfodd scanned the small gathering around us his finger wagging in the air as if counting motes i thinkyes he said when he finished everyone is here good i said and we talked a moment but our eyes kept stealing to the fisher kings palace above soon our talk ceased and we stood silent and expectant waiting wondering what if anything we might see a group of the brothers from the abbey came down to see what was happening they stood with us gazing up at the dark edifice on the tor a young woman one of charis serving girls i think began to sing a hymn in a voice as soft and sweet as a nightingales the words were unfamiliar but the melody i knew one by one others joined in and soon the song filled the night hope made audible in the heart of darkness when the first song was finished another began at once and another when that was done in this way we passed the night singing every eye on the fisher kings palace waiting for a miracle i felt gwenhwyvars hand slip into mine she clasped it tightly and i pressed hers whereupon she raised my hand to her lips and kissed it there were no words for what we felt so we simply stood clutching one anothers hands and listening to the voices in the night the songs continued and the stars drifted wheeling across the skybowl it seemed to me that the songs became a prayer rising up to heaven let it be so i thought may heavens high king honour his high king on earth as we honour him with our sacrifice of song this thought had no sooner gone than a voice called out listen a young monk who had been sitting on the hillside a few paces away jumped to his feet waving his arm and pointing into the eastern sky he said look they come i looked where he was pointing but saw nothing save the bright stars shining silence claimed the hill and lakeside we all stared into the shimmering sky they come another cried and i heard a sound like that of the harp when it sings of itself in the wind a music at once moving and mysterious it might have been the wind but it was deeper and more resonant the sky itself was breaking forth in song the air stirred softly as with the light flutter of feathered wings i felt a silken touch like a cool breath on my face and tasted honey on my tongue i inhaled a fragrance surpassing in sweetness any i have ever known blossoms of apple and honeysuckle and other blooms combined an unseen presence had passed through our midst trailing perfumed music in its wake my spirit quickened in response my skin tingled all over and my heart beat fast i saw as out of the corner of my eye a faint phantom image pale halfveiled shapes falling out of the sky and swirling around the fisher kings palace strange lights began to play in the darkened windows above turning to gwenhwyvar i saw her face bathed in golden light her hands were clasped beneath her chin her face upturned in the starlight her lips trembling blessed jesu i heard her say blessed jesu the golden light gleamed forth from every window of the fisher kings palace the holy music swelled resounding through heavens vast halls the swirling fluttering shifting seenyetunseen shapes seemed to have multiplied until the sky could not contain them they were everywhere angels breathed abbot elfodd in an awed whisper heavens champions have come for arthur i gazed into the golden light now boldly blazing from the palace atop the tor casting all below in sharp relief the shadows of men and animals thrown hard upon the ground the light was a living thing dazzling brilliant it pulsed with ardent power brighter and more potent than lightning and then as swiftly as it had begun it ended the light dwindled and the music hushed to a swiftly fading resonance disappearing so fast i wondered if i had heard or seen anything at all perhaps i had only imagined it perhaps it was a dream but the unseen presence returned moving back through the waiting throng the same way it had come i felt my soul rise up within me and my heart moved in response my skin tingled and then this too was gone leaving only a lingering fragrance and a sweet taste in the air we were alone in the night once more and the night was dark indeed there was no more music there were no more lights all was still and quiet as if nothing from one eon to the next ever happened but we still looked above at the palace and the sky full of stars beyond searching for the wonders we had known that is how we saw him arthur bold in the gateway of the fisher kings palace alive and hale dressed in his finest clothes kingly tore gleaming gold at his throat the summer lord raised a hand to us a signal that he was healed and he was well then he started down the trail i saw gwenhwyvar running swiftly mounting the path i saw arthur descend to seize her catch her up and lift her off the ground i saw their fervent embrace but then i saw no more through the tears that filled my eyes epilogue how now gerontius rich the life of an exile do you not savour it and you brastias ever and always turning your eyes towards the home you left behind does your wellearned shame keep you warm at night ulfias weakwilled and easily led if you must follow a king why not the one you were sworn to honour is your great regret a comfort to you and urien young schemer is your foreign bed made more luxurious with the knowledge of your treachery false lords the dogs begging scraps under your table know more of fealty than you did you really think the cymbrogi would follow you did you believe you could take arthurs place or was this hope like the vows you so quickly abandoned merely empty air as well faithless ones hear me now the kingdom of summer was more than a dream more than a tale to beguile children brave men died to secure it pledging life to faith any realm founded on the rock of such faith cannot fail do you wonder that the lords of vandalia rogat and hussa received mercy from arthurs hand i tell you that they did for in victory arthurs full grandeur became apparent he took pity on his enemies fed them and offered them peace the pendragon of britain having shown heroism in adversity in triumph practised christian mercy arthur befriended his enemies and thus made cruel foes the very same who had come to respect his valour realize his nobility the vandal lord mercia was baptized at arthurs invitation and the high king welcomed him as brother and if these former enemies gained a boon by virtue of arthurs generosity how much more did the irish lords benefit those who forfeited home and lands to aid arthurobtained all and more in return thus is faith rewarded say what you will britain was exalted then no we did not escape the further torments of plague and drought the yellow ravager gnawed deep and dry winds carried our harvest away on the dust but to those who knew where to look the summer realm was even then sending forth its first faint rays for the high king of heaven had blessed us with the holiest object in this worldsrealm the cup of christ that grail which would become the bright sun of the kingdom of summer arthur declared that this most sacred object should become the symbol of his reign to be established in the church that he would build in truth all britain trembled when it learned of that most holy grail ah but that is another tale
