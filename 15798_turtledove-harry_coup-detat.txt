harry turtledove coup detat chapter manila harbor was a mess pete mcgill hadnt expected it to be anything else and the fierce philippine sun beat down on him even though it was january the past few years hed served in peking and shanghai he was used to winter blowing straight down from siberia this muggy tropical heat by contrast seemed like too much of a good thing he still wasnt as steady on his pins as he wished he were either the bomb in shanghai that killed his ladylove came much too close to finishing him too the docs here did as good a job of patching him up as they could and hed had time to heal all the same an ankle ached and a shoulder twinged every time he took a step his face was set in a permanent grimace not least so nobody would notice him wincing and try to send him back to the hospital or maybe no one would bother any which way it looked to pete as if theyd take anybody with a pulse right now a fireboat played streams of water on a burning barge whatever was going up didnt seem to care black greasy stinking smoke rose high into the sky that wasnt the only fire burning around here eithernowhere close pete coughed harder than he usually did after his first morning cigarette jap bombing raids had hit the airports and the harbor hard now the only question was when the slanteyed little monkeys would try to land an invasion force pete was sure it wouldnt be long maybe all the smoke here would keep them from bombing accurately maybe out of the fucking way corporal goddammit somebody bellowed behind pete sorry he sidestepped as fast as he could which wasnt very a petty officer went back to yelling at the filipino gun crew manhandling an antiaircraft gun into place the swab jockey must have served here for a while because he was as fluently profane in tagalog as he was in english pete picked his way through the chaos toward the light cruiser boise the us asiatic fleet wasnt very big this part of the world was too close to japanese waters for the usa to risk much around here chances were that meant the philippines would fall something the marine tried hard not to think about bomb fragments scarred and dented the boise s metalwork but she hadnt taken any direct hits ifno whenjapanese planes came back with luck she wouldnt be here exhaust from her funnels meant she could get going in a hurry she could and she probably would but she hadnt yet mooring lines and a gangplank still tethered her to the wharf ignoring the pain in his leg pete strode up the gangplank and saluted the freshfaced ensign standing at the far end of it permission to come aboard sir he asked the officer of the deck after returning the salute the kid asked and you are corporal peter mcgill sir reporting as ordered the ensign checked the papers in the clipboard he carried in his left hand mcgill yes here you are he made a checkmark with a mechanical pencil he pulled from his breast pocket the united states might be at war but that didnt mean you didnt have to dot every i and cross every t not yet it didnt anyhow once the sacred checkmark went into place the youngster unbent enough to add permission granted thank you sir as soon as pete set foot on the ship he turned and saluted the stars and stripes at the stern the flag fluttered in the warm moist breeze dalrymple the ensign called as if by magic a tall redheaded able seaman appeared beside him take corporal uh mcgill to the marines quarters well let them decide how best to use him as if catching himself at that he asked pete you can serve a fiveinch gun cant you oh yes sir pete answered at once marines aboard battleships and cruisers often manned the big ships secondary armament the boise fought other ships with half a dozen long sixinch guns mounted in three turrets the stubbier fiveinchers and a variety of smaller quickfiring weapons tried to keep planes off her when they werent serving the secondary armament shipboard marines also did duty as constables pete didnt look forward to that he wanted to fight japs not his own countrymen along with everything hirohitos bastards had done to him he had vera to pay them back for too a million slanties might be enough for that two would definitely be better though come on with me corporal ill show you where you can stow your duffel and all dalrymple said im coming pete said the sailor took long quick steps keeping up with him made petes ankle whimper but he took no notice of it he knew about where hed be going but not exactly hed served aboard two destroyers and a battleship before going to peking but never a cruiser steps between decks might almost have been ladders the treads were that narrow and steep he managed to stay close to dalrymple anyhow two corporals and two sergeants were playing pinochle in the cramped bunkroom to which the able seaman led him they glanced up with no particular interest or liking but one of the twostripers looked vaguely familiar youre joe orsatti arent you pete said yeah the other guys swarthy face scrunched up as he eyed pete in a new way we were in the brooks together werent we sorry mac but screw me if i remember your handle his new york city accent might have been even more clotted than petes mcgill pete said and stuck out his hand orsatti reached for it their trial of strength was a push or near enough pete chucked his duffel onto a top bunk he wasnt surprised to run into somebody with whom hed served before the marines were a small club and noncoms in the corps a smaller one orsatti introduced pete to the other card players they switched from pinochle to poker pete lost a little won a little lost a little more he was down five bucks when the generalquarters klaxon hooted he hadnt heard that noise in years but it still raised his hackles what do i do where do i go he asked as they all sprang to their feet you guys are the only ones ive seen cmon with me orsatti said our shell jerkers got a bad back i bet you can feed us ammo fastern him pete hadnt said anything about his own injuries he didnt say anything now either instead he followed orsatti to a portside fiveinch gun step aside jonesy orsatti snapped to the private standing next to the ammunition hoist we got a new guy here who aint gonna keel over on us im okay goddammit jonesy said move orsatti told him and the other marine moved such was the power of two stripes pete grabbed a shell and handed it to the loader how much did it weigh fifty pounds seventyfive he wasnt in anything like good hard shape hed have to do the best he couldthat was all he could hear planes overhead the more they could knock down or scare off the better the gun roared the smaller antiaircraft guns were already stuttering out destruction he seized the next shell and passed it on sweat was already springing out only dead men didnt sweat like pigs in the philippines a plane with big red meatballs on the wings and fuselage plummeted into the harbor trailing smoke and fire the blast as its bombs exploded staggered pete water they kicked up drenched him and a glistening metal fragment tore out jonesys throat his cheers turned to horrible gobbling noises he clutched at his neck with both hands but blood sprayed and gushed all the same his hands relaxed he slumped to the deck he couldnt hope to live not with his head half cut off more bombs whistled down in spite of blast and whining screeching fragmentsin spite of almost literally being scared shitlesspete went on feeding the fiveinch gun maybe the intense antiaircraft fire from the boise did scare off some japs maybe the light cruiser was just lucky any which way she picked up a few new dents and dings but no more some of the other gun crews also had men down wounded or as dead as jonesy all the same she remained a going concern her skipper decided it was time for her to get going too as soon as the japanese bombers droned off to the westback toward japowned formosa pete supposedhe ordered the lines cast off and the gangplank raised then he took her out of the harbor as fast as she would go nobody aboard had a bad word or pete was sure a bad thought about that if she stayed where she was odds were she wouldnt stay lucky a third time all the old boring jokes about sitting ducks applied and pete had more new buddies than joe orsatti go through a fight with a gun crew and you were all pals if you survived it jonesyhis first name was elijahwent into the pacific shrouded in cloth and weighed down by shell casings along with half a dozen other dead men the boise raced south at upwards of thirty knots looking for pete didnt exactly know what whatever it proved to be he hoped hed come out the other side again january was a miserable frigid day in philadelphia sleet made the roads anywhere from dangerous to impossible ice clung to power lines too and its weight brought some of them down peggy druce wouldnt have wanted to be without electricity in this weather if you didnt use coal if you had an oilfired furnace that depended on a pump losing power meant that before long youd start chopping up your furniture and burning it so you didnt freeze to death washington lay less than a hundred miles south but it was conveniently on the other side of the cold front lowell thomas assured his nationwide radio audience that it was in the forties with clouds moving in front of the sun every now and then but no rain and certainly no sleet peggy who hadnt seen the sun since last friday was bright green with envy we are here on this historic occasion to observe the third inauguration of president roosevelt thomas said in his ringing sonorous tones this is of course the first time in the history of the united states that a president will be inaugurated for a third term and with the nation plunged into war little more than a week ago through the empire of japans unprovoked attacks on hawaii and the philippines the president surely has a lot on his mind peggy wished herb were sitting there beside her listening to the ceremony too things werent so easy between them as they had been before she got back from europe she wished like hell some of what had happened there hadnt happened those wishes did as much or as little good as ever still she would have enjoyed what were sure to be his sarcastic comments about the ceremony farther south but her husband had taken the packard in to his law office regardless of the slick icy roads he hadnt called with tales of accidents and neither had the police or a hospital so peggy supposed hed made it downtown in one piece he was bound to have the radio on if he wasnt with a client and maybe if he was herb was always somebody who kept up with the news till peggy got stuck in wartorn europe shed wondered whether that had any point she didnt any more lowell thomas dropped his voice a little ladies and gentlemen chief justice hughes will administer the oath of office to president roosevelt with his robes and his white beard the chief justice looks most distinguished most distinguished indeed he also gave the president the oath at his two previous inaugurations only a few old men wore beards in these modern times well charles evans hughes was pushing eighty hed probably grown his before the turn of the century decided he liked it and kept it ever since hed come as close as a bad republican turnout in california to unseating woodrow wilson in the world would be a different place if he had peggy wasnt sure how but she was sure it would be are you ready to take the oath mr president hughes sounded younger than he was even if rumor said he would step down from the court before too long i am mr chief justice no one whod ever heard fdrs jaunty voice could mistake it repeat after me then hughes said and the presidentthe thirdterm presidentdid i franklin delano roosevelt do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states congratulations mr president the chief justice said they are shaking hands lowell thomas said quietly in the background applause rose like the sound of surging surf thank you very much roosevelt said and then again a moment later thank you he is holding up his hands to still the clapping thomas noted but the clapping didnt want to still back in fdrd said we had nothing to fear but fear itself well we had other things to fear now starting with japanese planes and carriers and battleships and soldiers thank you roosevelt said once more slowly the applause ebbed very slowly it was as if people didnt want the president to go on because if he did they would have to look out across the sea at the big dangerous world into something approaching quiet fdr continued believe me i do thank you from the bottom of my heart what greater honor can any man claim than the continued confidence of the american people that drew more applause and cheers now though they quickly died away i am going to tell you the plain truth roosevelt said and the plain truth is things could be better when i ran for reelection promising not to send american boys off to fight in a foreign war i meant every word of it peggy coughed as she inhaled cigarette smoke nobody in the united states played a deeper political game than fdr when he started going on about what a plain simple fellow he was that was the time to hold on to your wallet but we have had war delivered to us no matter how little we want it the president let anger rise in his voice and our freedom is threatened not only in the far east whoever wins the great european struggle liberty will be the loser he was bound to be right about that whether hitler beat stalin or the other way around the winner would be big trouble for the rest of the world right now with france and england trailing along in his wake because hed pulled german troops out of france the nazi seemed to have the edge on the red but there could be more big switches after the one daladier and chamberlain had pulled nobody would know under which shell the pea lurked till all the sliding around stopped some people suspected roosevelts intentions too no european war a man yelled loud enough for lowell thomas microphone to pick it up hitler hadnt declared war on the united states if he did it would hurt his palsywalsy relationship with the last two surviving western european democracies it wouldnt do the third reich any good either peggyd spent much more time in nazi germany than she ever wanted the germans didnt understand how strong the usa could be but even the fuhrer seemed to want to take things one step at a time i do not intend to get us involved in a european war roosevelt said firmlyso firmly in fact that peggy got that walletclutching urge again did that yell come from a shill then the president proceeded to hedge i did not intend to get us involved in war against japan either the only things i know for certain now are that the road ahead will be long and hard and dangerous and that the united states of america will emerge triumphant at the end of that road he got another hand then peggy remembered that back in the days of ancient rome people used to keep track of how many times the senate applauded the emperor when he addressed it she didnt know how she knew that but she did maybe herb told her once upon a timetheyd rammed a big dose of latin down his throat in high school and college somebody needed to keep track of the ovations in washington today we are going to become the arsenal of democracy as i said in my fireside chat not long ago the president continued we must be strong enough to defeat the enemy in the far east and to ensure that no enemy anywhere in the world can possibly defeat us yet again people clapped and cheered how many of those people had the faintest idea what war was like oh some of the men would have gone over there a generation before theyd seen the elephant as their grandfathers would have said in civil war days most of fdrs audience though didnt really have any idea of what he was talking about peggy did shed watched the nazis storm into czechoslovakia and promptly start tormenting jews shed watched them march off freighters and into copenhagen ruining her chances to get back to the states for a while shed huddled against their bombsand while she was stuck in germany against english bombs too and maybe even against french and russian bombs as well so she knew as much about what war was like these days as anyone who hadnt carried a rifle could some people cheering roosevelt would find out just that way and others would learn when young men they loved came back maimed or didnt come back at all would they still be cheering then the truly scary thing was all the anguish and agony roosevelt wouldnt talk about in an inaugural address were going to be needed the horror peggy had seen and gone through in europe made her much too sure of that sarah goldman eyed the clerk behind the barred window in the munster rathaus with nothing but dismay shed never faced this fellow before it wasnt that he was grayhaired and had a hook where his left hand should have been no one young and healthy would have sat behind that window young healthy german men wore feldgrau these days not a baggy brown suit that reeked of mothballs but a button gleamed on the clerks left lapel it wasnt the ordinary swastika button that proved somebody belonged to the nazi party no the gold rim on this button showed that the clerk was one of the first party members hed been a nazi long before hitler came to power in other words hed like jews even less than most national socialists you wish he said as sarah came to the head of the queue he sounded polite enough for the moment well why not she was a pretty girlnot beautiful but pretty and with her light brown hair hazel eyes and fair skin she didnt look especially jewish i need she had to nerve herself to speak louder than a whisper i need to arrange the paperwork for my wedding there shed said it and loud enough for him to hear it too you should be happy when you do that dear the clerk might be graying and mutilated but he noticed a pretty girl all right behind the reading glasses that magnified them his own pale eyes seemed enormous as he studied her he held out his good hand let me have your identity booklet and well begin all right sarah said as she took the indispensable document out of her purse it wasnt all right and it wasnt going to be he held the document down with the hook and opened it with the fingers of his meat hand he was no slower or clumsier than someone who hadnt got hurt how many years of practice and repetition lay behind him oh he said in a voice suddenly colder than the nasty weather outside of course the booklet bore the big stamp that said jude the nazis had made all german jews take the first names moses or sarah since sarah already owned the one required for women shed briefly confused the bureaucracy she didnt confuse the clerk now she just irritated him or more likely disgusted him he shook his head you wish to marry yes sir she said staying polite wouldnt hurt though it might not help either its not against the law for two jews to marry each other sir that was trueafter a fashion law for jews in germany these days was whatever the nazis said it was jews werent even german citizens any more they were only residents forced to become strangers in what most of them still thought of as their vaterland well the clerk said ominously he pushed back his chair and stood up he was shorter than sarah expected the chair let him look down on the people he was supposed to serve shaking his head he went on i must consult with my supervisor the stout middleaged woman behind sarah in line groaned whats eating him she said sarah only shrugged she knew all right but she didnt think telling would do her any good she waited as patiently as she could for the clerk to return the woman and the people in the queue behind her grumbled louder and louder anything that made him leave his post obviously sprang from a plot to throw sand in the systems gear train he came back after three or four minutes that seemed like an hour with him came another functionary this one a little older who also wore an alter kampfer s goldrimmed party button on his lapel the newcomer eyed sarah as if hed have to clean her off the bottom of his shoe you want to get married he said his voice full of even more revolted disbelief than his subordinates had held yes sir sarah repeated whatever she thought of him she carefully didnt show and your intended is also of hebraic blood thats right sarah supposed her family had some aryans in the woodpile isidor bruck looked like what everybodys idea of looking jewish looked like he came by it honestlyso did his father and mother and younger brother what is his name the senior bureaucrat asked she gave it the senior man sneered no that is not correct he is moses isidor bruck and will be so listed in our records sorry said sarah who was anything but she was mad at herself shed just been thinking about the forced name change but shed forgotten to use it nobody remembered except people like the ones on the other side of the window i see by your documents that you are twenty years old the senior man said and what is the age of the other hebrew it was as if he couldnt even bear to say the word jew hes uh twentytwo sarah answered why is he not here to speak for himself the bureaucrat demanded hes working sir hes a baker like his father bakers never starved when rations for most german jews were so miserable that wasnt the smallest consideration in the world mrmp the functionary was anything but impressed he scribbled a note on a form then glared out through the bars that made him look like a caged animal but he and his kind were the ones who kept jews in the enormous cage theyd made of the third reich and what is your fathers occupation hes a laborer sarah said as steadily as she could he used to be a university professor when jews could still do that both nazi bureaucrats scowled to wipe those nasty expressions off their faces sarah added hes a wounded war veteran too wounded and decorated benjamin goldmans iron cross second class and his limp did matter nazi laws mandated better treatment for jews whod fought at the front and their families not good treatmentnowhere near good treatmentbut better sarah almost told the clerk and his boss that her father and brother tried to volunteer for the wehrmacht this time around but she didnt want to remind them she was related to saul goldman who was wanted for smashing in a labor gang boss head after the other fellow hit him and rode him for being a jew once too often on the lam saul had stolen papers or got his hands on a forged set so he was in the army now even though the nazis didnt know it the less they thought about him these days the better sarah liked it both men with goldrimmed party badges went right on looking unhappy no matter what nazi laws said about jewish frontline veterans a jew with a medal and a wound was plainly just another kike to them laborer the senior fellow said and he wrote that down too when will isidoruh moses isidorand i hear about getting official permission to marry sir sarah asked this wasnt her first trip to the rathaus official policy made everything as difficult as possible for jews marriage was definitely included the nazis wished there were no more jews in germany or anywhere else come to that no wonder they werent enthusiastic about anything that threatened to produce more people they hated when the functionary echoed when we decide you will thats when all right sarah fought down a sigh she didnt want to give the nazis the satisfaction of knowing theyd annoyed her they might be pretty sure but she didnt aim to show them she was her fathers daughterno doubt about it she even managed a smile of sorts as she said thank you very much and left the window well about time said the stout gal whod waited behind her the woman started pouring out her tale of woe to the bureaucrats sarah didnt hang around to find out how she fared any jew in germany had plenty of worries of her own theo hossbach supposed he should have been happy that the wehrmacht and its polish slovakian hungarian english and french allies hadnt lost more ground to the red army during this brutal winter after all a headlong retreat would have made it more likely for something bad to have happened to the panzer ii in which he served as radioman but bad things could happen to the panzer ii all too easily any which way the lightly armed lightly armored threeman machines werent obsolescent any more they were obsolete and everybody who had anything to do with them knew as much they soldiered on regardless a veteran crew which his panzer certainly had could still get good use from one and any panzer at all made infantry very unhappy besides there were still nowhere near enough modern panzer iiis and ivs to go around when the best werent available the rest had to do what they could what theos company was doing now was protecting a stretch of front that ran from a village to a small town closer to smolensk than to minsk just exactly where the village and town lay theo wasnt so sure a good atlas might have shown him but he didnt have one what difference did it make anyhow all he really knew was the front had gone back and forth a good many times lately it seemed to have gone back more often than it had gone forth the ivans were marvelous at slipping companies sometimes even battalions or regiments of infantry in white snowsuits behind the german lines and raising hell with them they werent so good at taking advantage of the trouble they causedwhich was a lucky thing for everybody who had to fight them theo still wore the black coveralls of a panzer crewman they looked smart and didnt show grease stains no doubt that was why the powers that be had chosen them but odds were a man in black coveralls running toward a hiding place through the snow wouldnt live to get there got a cigarette theo adalbert stoss asked here theo passed the driver a tobacco pouch he doled out the fixings for a smoke more readily than he parted with words adi tore off a strip from a russian newspaper none of the panzer men could read he sprinkled tobacco from the pouch taken off a dead ivan onto the cheap pulp paper rolled the cigarette and lit ithe did have matches ahh he said after the first drag exhaling a mixture of smoke and fogit was well below freezing much obliged he returned the pouch unlike a lot of soldiers theo knew adi didnt steal everything that wasnt nailed down his family must have raised him the right way which didnt necessarily make him the ideal man for life in the field on the other hand if anybody in a black coverall could make it to shelter running through the snow adi could he was the best footballer theo had ever seen except for a handful of professionalsand he was in their league he was fast and strong and agile and he was smart which only added to his other gifts with a sergeants pips or even a corporals he would have made a fine panzer commander i should be jealous theo thought hed been in the war from the very beginning adi hadnt but theo knew he would be a disaster trying to command a panzer he was the kind of fellow other people didnt notice which suited him fine give orders talk all the time no thanks sergeant hermann witt who did command the panzer had machinemade cigarettes of his own theo preferred the captured stuff it might not be especially good but by god it was strong everything that came out of germany these days was adulteratedwell everything but the ammo anyhow the cigarettes that got issued along with rations tasted of hay and horseshit the coffee was ersatz people said the war bread had sawdust in it as a stretcher theo didnt know if he believed that people also said the war bread was better than it had been in the last fight theo didnt know if he believed that either if the last generation had it worse than this no wonder they threw the kaiser out the nazis said germany got stabbed in the back in well the nazis said all kinds of things theo took them no more seriously than he had to since he said next to nothing himself he wasnt likely to get in trouble on account of that he glanced over at adi stoss smoked as intently as he did everything else by all the signs he didnt take the nazis very seriously either and chances were he had better reasons not to than even theos no sooner there than gone theo didnt want to think about stoss reasons he didnt want to and so he didnt no matter how little use he had for the nazis hed learned a thing or three since the fuhrer came to power he wasnt even consciously aware that he had which meant nothing at all ideas thoughts went into little armored compartments when he wasnt actively dealing with them they might as well not have been there no one else would ever notice them more often than not he didnt notice them himself somebody who lived in a free country wouldnt have to think that way theo understood as much but since he couldnt do anything about it he kept his mouth shut come to that he kept it shut as much as he could even though he didnt love the nazis he did love the vaterland and regardless of what he thought of the current german regime it had placed himalong with millions of other young german menin a position where his countrys enemies would kill him if he didnt fight hard that was underscored when mortar bombs started dropping near the panzer crewmen russian rifles barked urra the ivans roared urra urra they sounded like fierce wild animals their officers fed them vodka before sending them into action it dulled their fearand their common sense theos first instinct when the mortar rounds came in was to hit the dirt his next instinct was to get inside the panzer that was the better notion hed be at a little more risk while he was upright and running but the machines armored sides would protect him against fragments and smallarms fire sergeant witt and adi stoss also sprinted for the panzer ii other men in black coveralls dashed toward their machines too a couple of them didnt make it those coveralls and their blood bright against the snow reproduced the german national colors a bullet sparked off theos panzer just a few centimeters from his head he dove through the hatch behind the turret and slammed it shut a schmeisser hung on two brackets above his radio set if somebody started climbing up onto the panzer hed open a hatch and start shooting otherwise the submachine gun was there more to ease his mind than for any other reason start it up witt screamed at adi the order made sensea panzer that was just sitting there was a panzer waiting for a molotov cocktail theo didnt want to think about burning gasoline dripping into the fighting compartment and setting things ablaze in here but would the beast start in a russian winter that was always an interesting question and often a terrifying one the selfstarter ground maybe adi would have to get out and crank the engine to lifeassuming he didnt get shot to death before he could maybe even cranking wouldnt get it going german lubricants werent made for this hideous weather sometimes crews kept a fire burning through the night under the engine compartment to keep the engine warm enough to turn over in the morning adi tried it again this time to theos amazed delight the grinding noise turned into a fullthroated roar as the engine fired up after all forward witt said and the driver put the panzer ii into gear forward it went back against the fireproofhe hopedbulkhead that separated the fighting compartment from the engine theo started to warm up heat came through slowly but it came witt could traverse the turret by muscle power even if the gearing froze up he could and he did spraying machinegun fire and occasional rounds from the mm cannon at the oncoming ivans a few more bullets spanged off the panzers steel hide but bullets didnt bother it anything worse than a bullet would but theyre running the panzer commander exclaimed in the russians fine felt boots theo would have run too if they had no armor of their own in the neighborhood they were helpless against panzers a little german victory this time for the moment how to turn that into something more lasting theo had no idea did anyone else from hitler on down chapter alistair walsh had spent his whole adult life in the british armywhich unlike the navy and the air force wasnt royal the former sergeant sometimes wondered why not his best guess based on long experience was that no king of england in his right mind wanted to lend his regal title to such a buggeredup outfit almost as soon as walsh got to france the first time in the summer of he stopped a german bullet the kaisers men had pushed as far as they could then and soon started getting pushed instead walsh was back at the front before the armistice he saw enough action to decide he liked soldiering he certainly liked it better than going back to wales and grubbing out coal for the rest of his life which was his other choice when the war ended he managed to stay in the army while it hemorrhaged men after peace came and he went to france again this time as a staff sergeant rather than a raw private when things heated up once more in regardless of rank he knewhed had it proved to himhe wasnt bulletproof hed fought in belgium and then in france as the allied armies fell back under the weight of the new german assault once they managed to keep the nazis from sweeping around behind paris and winning the campaign fastwilhelms old pipe dream even if hitler came equipped with a different mustachehe got shipped off to norway as part of the anglofrench expeditionary force that tried to stop the wehrmacht there thats when my trouble really started he muttered under his breath a dumpy woman coming the other way on the london sidewalk gave him a funny look he didnt care it wasnt as if he were wrong the anglofrench force couldnt stop the germans air power outdid sea power even if the royal navy was royal walsh counted himself lucky for getting out of namsos before it fell plenty of soldiers hadnt a stuka attacked the destroyer that carried him home after sneaking into the harbor under cover of the long northern winter night but the ship survived to make it back to dundee hed been on leave riding a hired bicycle through the scottish countryside when that was when his troubles really started hed seen and recognized a messerschmitt bf a longrange german fighter buzzing along above scotland hed watched somebody bail out and come down in a field not far from the narrow lane he was traveling why he had to be the one to meet rudolf hess and take the nazi big shot back to the authorities hed never worked out it wasnt proof of gods love for him he was too bloody sure of that if anything it was proof the almighty really and truly had it in for him because hess was carrying a proposal from hitler to chamberlain and daladier the germans were willing to withdraw from france though not from the low countries or scandinavia and certainly not from czechoslovakia which was what the war was supposed to be about in exchange for anglofrench support of the war in the east the war germany and poland were fighting against stalin and chamberlain and daladier made the deal neither of them had wanted to fight the fuhrer theyd even gone to munich to hand him czechoslovakia on a silver platter but he wouldnt take it peacefully not after a czech nationalist took a revolver into germany and plugged konrad henlein the leader of the germans in the sudetenland it wasnt as if stalin were a nice guy himself as soon as he saw that hitler wasnt sweeping all before him in the west he demanded a chunk of northeastern poland from marshal smiglyridza chunk that included the city of wilno which not only poland and the soviet union but also lithuania claimed proud as any pole smiglyridz said no so stalin invaded he did not too well for much too long but finally outweighed the poles in the area by enough to be on the point of grabbing wilno but before he could marshal smiglyridz asked hitler for help no one ever had to ask hitler twice about whether he wanted to fight bolsheviks that bought him the twofront war from which the existence of poland had shielded him up till then but he didnt care chances were chamberlain and daladier preferred fighting bolsheviks to going after the nazis hitler gave them the bait and they gulped it with greedy jaws as hess had bailed out of the bf the fuhrer bailed out of his war in the west with the low countries and denmark and norway firmly under his thumb he had england and france on his side once their leaders pulled the big switch he might be a vicious weasel but he was a damned clever vicious weasel some englishmen couldnt stomach what their prime minister had done walsh was one of them not that anybody cared tuppence about what a staff sergeant thought but winston churchill was another he hated hitler and hess and everything they stood for he thundered about what an enormous betrayal the big switch was till he walked in front of a bentley allegedly driven by a drunk no one but chamberlain and his claque knew whether churchills untimely demise was an accident or something else altogether no one knew but plenty of people suspected alistair walsh not surprisingly was one of them he couldnt stand the idea of fighting alongside the bastards in feldgrau and coalscuttle helmets whod come so close to killing him so often and he couldnt stand the idea of fighting for a government that might well have murdered its most vehement and most eloquent critic they let him resign from the service he was far from the only man who couldnt abide the big switch plenty of veterans found themselves unable to make it but because hed seen that parachute open up there in scotland hed acquired better political connections than most of the rest churchill might be dead but other mostly younger conservatives still resisted the governments move it wasnt chamberlains government any more chamberlain was dead of bowel cancer but sir horace wilson his successor was more ruthless than he had beenand even more obsequious to the nazis when walsh casually glanced back over his shoulder then he really wasnt so casual as all that a nondescript little man was following him and not disguising it as well as he should have someone from scotland yard probably the police were the governments hounds military intelligence was split some people followed orders no matter what others couldnt stand the notion of being on the same side as the gestapo walsh rounded a corner and quickly stepped into a chemists shop as the aproned gentleman behind the counter asked how may i help you sir the sergeant peered out through the window set into the shops front door sure enough the shadow mooched around the corner sure enough he stopped right in front of the chemists to try to work out where walsh had gone he came to the proper conclusionjust as walsh threw the door open and almost hit him in the face with it the shadow showed admirable reflexes in jumping back the way his right hand darted under his jacket showed he probably had a pistol in a shoulder holster at the moment walsh didnt care he knew he would later but he didnt now that gave him a startling moral advantage sod off he growled the more grief your lot gives me the more trouble ill give you have you got that im sure i havent the least idea what you mean sir the shadow gave a good game try at innocence walsh laughed in his face my left one he jeered you tell sir horace to leave me alone tell him to leave all of my mob alone we can make him just as sorry as adolf canhed best believe it too tell him plain do you hear me he had the satisfaction of watching color drain from the other mans face i dont speak to the likes of the pm the shadow gasped ill wager thats the truth any road walsh said brutally but you talk to somebody who does talk to him right without waiting for an answer he went on tell him its still a free country and itll go right on being one too we arent bloody fritzes we dont put up with his kind of nonsense think you can remember that oh ill remember the shadow regained spirit and ill lay youll remember tooonly you wont be so happy about it the cheek he did walk off then which surprised walsh was someone else following the follower and walsh as well if someone was he wasnt blatant enough to give himself away as luck or irony would have it walsh hadnt been going anywhere or intending to meet anyone who would have interested either the shadow or his superiors up to and including horace wilson in the slightest he hadnt tried to tell that to the man hed confronted he knew it would have done him no good england remained nominally free but its people were starting to learn totalitarian lessons and one of the first of those was that nobody believed you when you said you were doing something altogether innocent and the more you insisted on it the worse off you ended up hansulrich rudel eyed his ju like a parent looking at a child just out of surgery the groundcrew men whod performed the operation seemed proud of themselves there you go sir said the luftwaffe corporal whod bossed the crew now you can take off and land your stuka no matter how shitty the weather gets well maybe hansulrich answered as far as he was concerned that maintenance sergeant had just showed why he stayed on the ground not that the fellow didnt have a point putting skis on the ju in place of wheels let the dive bomber take off and land in conditions it couldnt normally handle the ivans did that kind of thing all the time if any flyers in the world were used to coping with vicious winters the men of the red air force were the ones and stukas fixed undercarriages made the conversion easier than it would have been on planes with retractable landing gear even so anybody who tried to take off or land in the middle of one of these screaming blizzards would crash and burn you did want to be able to see when you were getting airborne or coming down mistakes at the beginning or end of a flight wrote off almost as many planes as enemy fighters and flak sergeant albert dieselhorst ambled up the radioman and rear gunner considered the skis with enthusiasm hidden amazingly well his gaze traveled from them to the panzerbusting mm gun pods mounted under the wings happy day he said well be even less aerodynamic than we were already rudel winced those heavy bulky gun pods did up the drag and make the ju slower and less maneuverable than it was without them all the same the pilot answered take an even strain albert she couldnt get out of her own way even before they bolted on the skis sir the groundcrew corporal sounded hurt hansulrich half expected him to clap a hand to his heart like an affronted maiden in a bad melodrama hell hes right dieselhorst said we count more on our armor than on our guns and our speedha theres a laugh to get us through when were in a jam he wore the iron cross first class on his left breast pocket rudel wore the knights cross on a ribbon around his neck a lowly groundcrew corporal with only the ribbon for the iron cross second classa decoration that in this war you had to work hard not to winhooked to a tunic button couldnt very well argue with either one of them two days later the weather was good enough for flying the stukas big junkers jumo engine fired up right away when the groundcrew men cranked it and spun the prop they had a mechanical starter mounted on a truck chassis but nothing they did would make the truck motor turn over muscle power and bad language sufficed a ministers son hansulrich rarely swore and almost never drank if not for that ritterkreuz and all it said about his nerve he would have been even more a white crow to his comrades than he already was snow and the skis smoothed out the dirt airstrips bumps and potholes better than the wheels had but rudel quickly found sergeant dieselhorst had made a shrewd guess the ju flew like a garbage truck with wings if any russian fighter found him even one of the obsolete biplanes the ivans kept flying he and albert were in a world of trouble snowy fields barebranched birches with bark almost white as snow pines and firs and spruces all snowdappled the russian landscape in winter the sun never climbed far above the southern horizon not in these latitudes because it stayed so low it cast long shadows the reds were better at camouflage than even the thorough germans dreamt of being but not for all their ingenuity could they hide shadows neither whitewashing them nor draping them with netting did stalins men the least bit of good hansulrich might not have noticed the russian panzers moving up to the front they were well whitewashed and soviet soldiers trotted in their wake with whisks made from branches to smooth out their tracks so those didnt show up from the air they did a pretty good job of that too rudel might not have seen the tracks shadows though shadows he saw he gave dieselhorst the number of panzers he observed and their approximate position the radioman with the rearfacing machinegun mount relayed the news to the germans on the ground hansulrich added you can tell them im attacking too he tipped the stuka into a dive acceleration pressed him against the armored back of his seat he wondered if the skis would act as small airfoils and change the planes performance but they didnt seem to the groundcrew men hadnt touched the jericho trumpets mounted in the landinggear struts the screaming sirens terrorized the russian foot soldiers who ran every which way like ants from a disturbed nest panzers couldnt scatter like thatand inside those clattering hulls even the wail from the jericho trumpets took a while to register the machines quickly swelled from specks to toys to the real thing rudels finger came down on the firing button each mm gun bellowed and spat flame recoil from those monsters slowed the stuka even better than dive brakes hansulrich yanked back hard on the stick things went red in front of his eyes as the ju pulled out of the dive if you werent paying attention you could fly a dive bomber straight into the ground several germans in the legion kondor had done it in spain stukas got autopilots after that but the men who flew them unanimously hated the gadgets hansulrich had had groundcrew men disable his and he was far from the only pilot who had you got the bastard sergeant dieselhorsts voice through the speaking tube was like sounding brass engines on fire crews bailing out good rudel couldnt see behind him so he had to rely on the radiomans reports experience in france and here had taught him to aim for the engine compartment almost any panzers armor was thinnest on the decking there he manhandled the stuka into a climbing turn lets see if we can kill another one or maybe more than one the pillar of greasy black smoke rising from the rear of the panzer hed struck told him it wouldnt be going anywhere any more he nodded to himself in somber satisfaction hed killed a lot of enemy armor with the big guns he must have killed a lot of enemy panzer crewmen too but he tried not to dwell on that after hed gained enough altitude he chose another whitewashed russian panzer and tipped the stuka into a new dive again the jericho trumpets howled this time though they didnt take the ivans on the ground by surprise hansulrich had a low opinion of russian brains but not of russian balls the reds opened up on the stuka with their small arms the commander of rudels new target vehicle fired a burst from the turret with a submachine gun all that might have made the ivans happier but did them no good you couldnt shoot accurately at a dive bomber from the groundit was going too fast even if you got lucky and hit it the engine and the compartment that housed the two crewmen were armored against riflecaliber bullets blam blam the stukas big guns thundered again at almost the same instant hansulrich pulled out of the dive he brought his fist down on his thigh in triumph when sergeant dieselhorst reported that hed nailed another one aim to go after number three dieselhorst asked why not rudel said hardly any russian panzers carry radios they wont call fighters after us some do so you hope they wont the veteran underofficer replied that was nothing but the truth hansulrich didnt want to meet fighters not in his ungainly machine he got more ground fire in this dive than he had before at least one lucky round clanged into the stuka but it did no harm and when the mm guns belched fire once more they wrecked another soviet panzer part of rudel wanted to go after a fourth russian machine but common sense told him that was a bad idea sooner or later fighters blazoned with the red star would show up around here the best thing he could do was to be somewhere else when they did he hauled the stukas nose around and flew off to the west ivan kuchkov counted himself lucky to be alive he was a short squat brawny russian peasant the authorities had yanked him off the collective farm where he grew up and put him in the bomb bay of an sb medium bomber short squat and brawny were ideal qualifications for a bombardier smart wasnt and nobody including ivan himself had ever claimed he was he hadnt tried to keep track of how many missions hed flown for instance he just knew thered been a lot of them he also knew that if you flew a lot of missions against the nazis you were waiting for the law of averages to catch up with you and it did the tupolev bomber had got hit and caught fire on the way back from a run into germanheld byelorussia kuchkov bailed out he didnt think either the pilot or the copilot and bombaimer made it hed flown with sergei yaroslavsky ever since they volunteered to aid czechoslovakia against fascist invaders when the war was new unless his brain was totally fucked he wouldnt be flying with the lieutenant any more he wasnt sure hed be flying at all red army men rescued him and got him away from the germans after he landed the first lieutenant commanding the company didnt want to give him back to the red air force lieutenant pavel obolensky recognized a hardnosed son of a bitch when he saw one obolensky wanted kuchkov fighting for him the air force faggots fight in the air force the lieutenant declared youre a real man right real men belong in the red army that was nonsense as kuchkov had reason to know i bet my bombs killed more fascists than all the fuckers in your cocksucking regiment sir he said he wasnt being deliberately disrespectful he just spoke mat the obscenitylaced underworld and underground dialect of russian as naturally as he breathed he almost didnt know how not to swear luckily for him lieutenant obolensky like yaroslavsky recognized as much and didnt come down on him on account of his foul mouth maybe they did the infantry officer said but fuck your mother if we dont get to watch the cunts die when we nail em like most russians he could use mat too even if he didnt make a habit of it the way kuchkov did youve got something there ivan admitted he thought it over then nodded why the hell not remembering such manners as he owned he saluted uh sir for the moment the red air force probably thought he was as dead as the rest of the sbs crew that made turning into a foot soldier easier one of these days his proper service would figure out that hed kept breathing after all that was likely to complicate his life but it wasnt as if hed deserted and hed never been one to borrow trouble plenty came along on its own thank you very much such calculations had nothing to do with his choice along with being short and squat and strong he was dark and ugly and uncommonly hairy in the red air force they called him the chimp he hated it anyone who came right out and used the nickname to his face he did his best to deck and his best was goddamn good but he knew people called him chimp behind his back maybe joining up with a bunch of strangers would let him escape it he might be rugged as a boulder but he was curiously naive he could get away from the nickname he despised for about twenty minuteshalf an hour tops as soon as anybody with even a little imagination got a look at him he was as sure to be tagged chimp or maybe king kong as a redhead was to get stuck with red or rusty lieutenant obolensky was making calculations of his own the main one was that sergeant kuchkov would be worth eight or ten ordinary guys in a fight at least and so the lieutenant grinned when kuchkov didnt make a fuss about staying in the air force ochen khorosho obolensky exclaimed as far as he was concerned it was very good indeed lets get you kitted out ivans furlined flight suit gave him better coldweather gear than most of his new comrades enjoyed thanks to obolensky though he got a white snow smock to put over it he also got a tunic with collar tabs in infantry crimson rather than air force blue and he got a submachine gun to replace the tokarev pistol he carried as a personal weapon he didnt ditch the pistol though you never could tell when an extra weapon would come in handy hed maintained the machine guns in the sbs dorsal and belly turrets next to them the ppd might have been a kiddy toy it was plainer and uglier than the nazis schmeisser but it had a seventyoneround drum magazine that made it heavier than a schmeisser but so what it kept firing a lot longer too he knew hed have to clean the magazine even more often than the weapon itself which boasted a chromed barrel and chamber dirt could foul the clockwork mechanism that fed cartridges into the ppd a jam was more likely to prove fatal than just embarrassing no jams then ivan shifted the three metal triangles that marked his rank from old collar tabs to new lieutenant obolensky gave him a squad right awayinfantry units took more than their share of casualties and obolensky had had a corporal who barely needed to shave running it the juniorvery juniornoncom didnt resent losing the position he hadnt held long lucky for him too if he had kuchkov would have whaled the piss out of him one advantage of air force life was sleeping out of artillery range of the enemy sometimes even in a real cot in a heated barracks nothing like that here there werent even tents you wore as many clothes as you could rolled yourself in a blanket if you had a blanket as if you were a cigar and it the wrapper and either you slept or you didnt the soldiers in ivans new squad eyed him warily wondering how hed cope with living rough no one came out and said anything about it to him not all the infantrymen could read and write but ignorance didnt make them stupid if they pissed him off hed make them sorry he had the look of somebody who wouldnt worry about regulations when he did it either three days after parachuting down into the red army he led his squad out on patrol he picked a skinny little nervous jew called avram as point man somebody like that was liable to jump at shadows but he wouldnt happily amble into a nazi trap even with his furandleather flying togs on under the snow smock ivan was miserably cold in wool greatcoats the ordinary red army men would be even colder but from everything everybody said the germans would be colder yet russians made jokes about winter fritz ivan hoped all the jokes were true a private trotted back to him theres a field up ahead and a village out past it the fellow reported avram says the germans are holed up in the houses oh he does does he ivan still didnt know how far he could rely on avramor anyone else in the squad come to that ill fucking see for myself be careful going forward he says the private told him a sniper in the village can hit you if he sees you right kuchkov wasnt sure if the zhid was only warning him or trying to find out if he was yellow he didnt know all the groundpounders tricks yet he did know enough to keep his head down and to stay behind trees as much as he could he made it out to avram without getting shot at the point man sprawled behind a stout pine so nazi cocksuckers in the village ivan asked him da comrade sergeant avram nodded if you want to lookcarefullyyoull spot them only his eyes showing under the snow smock ivan peered out from behind the pine the germans in the village werent being nearly so cautious theyre fucking there all right he agreed scoot back to the lieutenant tell him where the cunts are at tell him we can take embet your ass we canif the machine gun and mortar help keep our dicks up after another nod avram silently disappeared he made a good point man half an hour later lieutenant obolensky crawled up to check things out for himself the mortar crew and machine gunners set up not far away ivan smiled wolfishly obolensky didnt think he had the vapors or was showing off then outstanding other men from the company took places near the edge of the woods theyd be ready to go forward as soon as they got the word the lieutenant put a hand on kuchkovs shoulder youre right he whispered we can take them and we will soldiers swigged from their hundredgram vodka rations borrowing bravery for the fight ahead kuchkov drank too because he liked to drink the mortar dropped bombs on the village the machine gun sprayed death toward it obolenskys brass officers whistle squealed like a shoat losing its nuts to the knife forward he yelled urra the russian soldiers roared as they swarmed out of the woods a few rifle shots answered them but no machine gun either the germans didnt have one there or the mortard knocked their crew out of action ivan pounded forward with the rest till he got a lot closer the ppd was just a weight in his hands he never did have to fire it the nazis put up only a token resistance then they got the hell out of there a bullet broke one red army mans arm another fellow lost the bottom half of his left ear and bled all over his snow smock the nazis left two dead men behind how many casualties they took with them ivan couldnt guess the village came back into soviet handsnot that any peasants remained in it it had been a dreary little place even before the germans overran it kuchkov didnt care hed proved himself in front of his men that he cared about vaclav jezek found himself even more isolated in spain than he had been in france the czech hadnt imagined such a thing possible but there you were the spanish republic might have been the most isolated country or half a country in the world when england and france forgot about fighting fascism and turned on the bolsheviks instead they made a point of forgetting about their erstwhile iberian ally great powers had the luxury of doing such things whenever they pleased jezek didnt hed battled the nazis ever since the day they jumped czechoslovakia instead of surrendering after the germans overran bohemia and moravia and father tiso led slovakia into fascistbacked independence he crossed the border into poland and let himself be interned the russians hadnt jumped the poles then so poland remained neutral czech soldiers were allowedeven unofficially encouragedto go to romania likewise neutral in those days and from there by sea to france to take service with the czechoslovak governmentinexile vaclav did all that his thinking and the governmentinexiles was that keeping the nazis from conquering france was his own countrys best and perhaps only hope for eventual resurrection that best hope looked none too good the czech lands and tisos puppet slovakia remained under the reich s muscular thumb which was not to say corporal vaclav jezek hadnt done the germans as much harm as one man could from a poilu whod never need it any more hed acquired an antitank rifle a godawful heavy weapon that kicked like a jackass but could drive a thumbsized armorpiercing bullet right through the hardened steel plating on a german light tank or armored car he also discovered that the antitank rifle made a great snipers piece it shot far and fast and flat after he mounted a telescopic sight on it he could pick off a man more than two kilometers away not always but often enough to be useful at half that range hed blow off a nazis head with nearly every round his countrymen and allies loved himtill the french suddenly turned into hitlers allies instead just as suddenly the czechoslovak governmentinexile and its little army became embarrassments france somehow did find the courtesy not to intern the men whod given their blood to help keep her free she let those of them who so desired cross the pyrenees to republican spain instead in france sergeant benjamin halevy a french jew with parents from prague had interpreted for the refugee soldiers now he was a refugee himself having no more stomach for fighting on the fuhrer s side than did the stubborn czechs someone fluent in french like halevy could follow a word of spanish here and there the same way a czech could understand bits of russian vaclav had learned just enough french to swear with the only foreign language he really spoke was german that was of no more use to him here than it had been in france it was the enemys tongue in the spanish republic as it had been on the northern side of the mountains but fewer people in these parts understood it and most of the ones who did backed marshal sanjurjos fascists not the republic most but not all the fighters from the international brigades had come to spain to lay their lives on the line to halt the advance of hitler and mussolinis malignant ideology some were from america some from england but more from central and eastern europe an awful lot of them could speak german or yiddish even if they were no more native speakers than vaclav by what amounted to a miracle in this bureaucratic age the powers that be in the republic realized as much instead of sending the czechs to some threatened border region and all the republics borders except the one with france were threatened the spaniards grouped them with the internationals defending madrid the internationals were red red red vaclav couldnt have cared less just like him they killed fascists they didnt seem to worry about anything else but a soldiers universals ammo food tobacco and pussy nobody tried to make him bow down toward moscow five times a day they appreciated the antitank rifle and what he could do with it we have a few of those ourselves but we never thought of using them for sniping said a fellow who called himself spartacus it was a nom de guerre he spoke german with a throaty hungarian accent vaclav loved magyars hardly more than germans he had to remind himself he and spartacus were on the same side it works he said he wasnt about to let anybody take the mantall monster away from him but that wasnt what spartacus had in mind i bet it does thats the idea he said why dont you start thinning the herd of fascist officers his thin dark mustache made his smile even nastier than it would have been otherwise i can do that as a matter of fact ive been doing it in france and here vaclav said no one here would have paid much attention to what hed been up to that was what you got for being a newcomer especially if you had language troubles all right good very good the hungarian international seemed on the stupid side to vaclav to say nothing of overbearing most magyars seemed that way to most czechs magyars werent as bad as germans but they were a devil of a long way from good if you eyed them from a czechs perspective anyhow how czechs seemed to magyars was another question altogethernot one vaclav had ever thought to ask himself and not one he was likely to ask himself either his biggest complaint was one he hadnt expected to have in sunny spain the trenches northwest of madrid got as cold as a german tax collectors heart sunny spain was even in wintertime but the central plateau lay some distance above sea level and the winds seemed to blow straight through him hed been warmer up near the francobelgian border as long as he didnt shiver while he pulled the trigger though he could do his job if anything it was easier here than it had been in france however much he despised the germans he couldnt deny that they made sensible soldiers officers didnt look much different from their men sometimes theyd even turn their shoulder straps upside down to make it harder for a sniper to spy their rank badges marshal sanjurjos soldiers werent like that a man in those ranks who was somebody wanted to show that he was somebody he prominently displayed the gold stars that set him off from the common vulgar mob and he often wore a uniform of newer finer cloth and better cut than the ragged faded yellowish khaki the ordinary fascist soldiers had to put up with all of which made it much easier for vaclav to spot enemy officers an aristocrat in a neatly pressed uniform his stars of rank glittering under the bright spanish sun sometimes had a moment to look absurdly amazed when he made the acquaintance of one of the antitank rifles fat slugs more often the fascist bastard just fell over vaclav wasnt fussy nobody gave out style points chapter sergeant luc harcourt shivered as he led his squad into the russian village that wasnt fear the village lay several hundred kilometers behind the line and was unlikely to have holdouts in it no luc was just cold french greatcoats and other winter gear werent made for weather like this if not for the felt boots he wore over his own clodhoppers he would have been colder yet hed stripped them off a dead russian and they were lifesavers the ivans had to deal with this crap every year poor bastards and they knew how hed noticed that german soldiers wore valenki whenever they could get hold of them too that left him obscurely amused so the master race didnt know everything there was to know about winter warfare either well good daladier might declare that france and germany were allies against the bolsheviks now luc might have taken a train trip through the reich so he could get at the red army but before that hed spent two years shooting at the nazis and trying like hell to hide when they shot back some boche had shot his father during the last war no matter what fucking daladier declared luc didnt love the germans no sir not even close a lot of russian villages the germans and their allies had overrun were empty the locals had cleared out instead of sticking around to see what occupation would be like luc sympathized plenty of frenchmen and women had fled when the germans invaded too and there were lots of jews in these parts if he were a jew he wouldnt have stayed under german rule for anything not everyone had run away from this place though a few men and women came out of their battered shacks to eye the soldiers trudging down the main streetan unpaved track with some of the dirty snow trampled into the frozen ground all the russians regardless of sex had valenki luc thought they were foolish to put the overboots on display some of his men were liable to steal them right off their feet a fellow with a graying stubbly beard wore a wool scarf a sheepskin cap and jacket and baggy wool pants stuffed into the tops of his valenki he surprised luc by asking youre frenchmen arent you in fluent french thats right the sergeant answered where did you learn our language the ivan smiled a sweet sad smile once upon a time i studied medicine i learned french then i learned german too the smile got sadder still i used to think i was a cultured fellow well what the devil are you doing here luc asked this miserable village was as far from culture as anything could get tending my garden the russian said as candide might have done he went on what i grow in my own plot i get to keep and sell the state takes what we grow on our collective lands of course and i still do what i can when someone gets hurt or comes down sick why arent you a doctor in some big city luc inquired the council of workers and peasants was going to send me to a labor camp for being an intellectual the russian answered as calmly as if he were talking about someone else but they decided i could work out my antiproletarian prejudices here on the kolkhoz instead ive been here since well now weve come to set you free luc trotted out the propaganda line the germans had fed their new allies to see what this cultured russian would make of it by the way the fellow looked at him he might have pissed in the baptismal fontexcept the building that had been a church before the revolution was currently a barn if youd come here in i would have welcomed you with open arms the russian said so would almost everyone else but now no weve spent a generation building up and getting used to the new ways of doing things you want to tear down everything weve managed to do and tell us to start over one more time we would rather fight for general secretary stalin than go through that again he didnt make fighting for stalin sound like a good choiceonly like a better choice than starting from scratch chuckling luc said maybe i ought to shoot you now then to keep you from making trouble later on it could be that you should the russian wasnt joking i see that because you are french some shreds of civilization still cling to you the nazis would not talk like that they would just start shooting and burning it has happened here in the soviet union many times already no doubt it will happen many more luc wanted to tell him that was all a pack of lies nothing but garbage served up by the propaganda cooks in moscow he wanted to yes but the words stuck in his throat after all the germans had invaded his country twice since they werent gentle occupiers either time from all hed heard they were more brutal now than they had been a generation earlier why would he expect them to be gentle here in the east then uneasily he said international law gives them the right to be hard on francstireurs if you picked up a rifle without being a soldier any army in the world that caught you would give you a blindfold andif you were luckya cigarette and then fill you full of holes of course the germans took hostages if francstireurs troubled them they murdered them by dozens or scores to remind the people they were fighting not to get frisky here in the east they probably executed hostages by the hundreds would such frightfulness intimidate the russians or only make them hate harder looking into the doctorturnedpeasants pale eyes luc didnt like the answer he thought he saw keep your nose clean or youll be sorry he said his voice rougher than hed intended oh but of course monsieur the russian said his tone so transparently false that luc wondered whether he should plug him right there a nazi would have the ivan understood as much so did luc it was the biggest part of what stayed his hand he didnt have his men camp inside the village as hed intended when they approached it instead he led them on for another kilometer they were grumbling by the time he finally let them stop he didnt feel like listening to them put a sock in it you clowns he said we go to sleep in one of those houses well wake up with our throats cut well freeze here in the middle of nowhere one of the poilus retorted is that so much better we wont freeze well just be cold theres a difference luc said he knew what the men would be saying about himthat he wouldnt feel it because his heart was already cold hed said the same kind of thing about his sergeant back in the days before he wore any hash marks on his sleeve sergeant demange was second lieutenant demange now a veteran noncom from the last war demange didnt want to be an officer but the knowitalls above him kept getting shot and he finally won a promotion whether he liked it or not the way he chainsmoked gitanes said he didnt or maybe nothed smoked like a chimney as a sergeant too luc told him about the frenchspeaking russian back in the village you should have scragged the asshole said demange who had very little use for his fellow man it wouldve given the rest of the shitheads back there something to stew on the gestapo would be proud of you sir more than two years of serving demange had earned luc the right to speak his mind up to a point fuck you demange answered evenly fuck the ivans too you want to make sure they dont cause trouble youve got to boot em in the balls oh yeahand fuck the gestapo fuck em up the ass except the ones who like it that way merde alors admiration filled lucs voice you hate everybody dont you close enough demange said with most of the bastards you run into it just saves time he was looking atlooking throughluc right then if that wasnt a hint luc had never run into one dont worry sir everybody loves you too he said sketching a salute he went back to his squad behind him the reluctant officer chuckled in the middle of the night the russians dropped a swarm of mortar bombs on the village and on the poilus whod paused there for the night several soldiers got hurt lucs squad was far enough from the buildings that nothing came down on them he didnt point that out to the men he led if he had they would have figured he was blowing his own horn if they figured it out for themselves though theyd see what a clever fellow he really was back in his days as a sergeant demange would have played it the same way luc had learned more from him than he would ever admit evenmaybe especiallyto himself the hackedup boards the landsers fed into the fire came from a house a russian shell had knocked flat the gobbets of meat they toasted over the flames came from a horse that had hauled a mm howitzer till another shell broke its leg willi dernen had shot it to put it out of its misery hed long since lost track of how many enemy soldiers hed killed or wounded but he couldnt stand to see or listen to an animal suffer he took a bite the meat was half charred half raw it was also gluey and gamy it was horsemeat in other words it wasnt the first time hed had it and he was sure it wouldnt be the last he turned to his fellow gefreiter senior privateand said ive probably eaten enough horse to let them enter me in next years berlin steeplechase adam pfaff shook his head not fucking likely willi ive eaten plenty of pussy but nobodys gonna put me in a goddamn cat show while willi was still digesting that so to speak his buddy added besides have you taken a look at yourself lately youre no threeyearold believe me and no thoroughbred either oh yeah and you are willi said they grinned at each other like the rest of the men in their sectionlike the rest of the german frontschweine in russiathey were scrawny and filthy and badly shaven a crawly itch under willis whitewashed stahlhelm said he was lousy again too one of these days hed get deloused and hed stay clean till the next time he went through a russian village say half an hour after he left the delousing station then hed have company once more whos got some tobacco he can spare corporal arno baatz asked willi had a nice little sack of makhorka russian tobacco cheap and nasty but strongin a trouser pocket he would have bet adam pfaff had a similar stash adam knew what was what about keeping himself supplied neither gefreiter said a word willi had had to put up with awful arno since the war started adam was much newer to the regiment but hed rapidly learned the unteroffizier made a pisspoor substitute for a human being here you go corporal a private named sigi herzog gave baatz a cigarette willi had already pegged him for a suckup one more suspicion confirmed good awful arno didnt bother thanking sigi he took such tribute as no less than his due another reason to despise him as far as willi was concerned one more to add to a long list were baatz a gutless wonder everything would have been perfectand the company would have had a perfectly good excuse for shipping him back behind the lines where he could annoy people without risking lives but he actually made a decent combat soldier it was everything else about him that williand anyone else who got stuck serving under himcouldnt stand he lit the cigarette and sucked in smoke his plump cheeks hollowed how any german on the eastern front stayed plump was beyond willi but awful arno managed he shaved more often than most landsers bothered to but he was still plenty whiskery right this minute after blowing out a stream of smoke and fog he let loose with a blast of hot air straight from the propaganda ministry as soon as the weather gets even a little better well roll up the ivans like a pair of socks that he believedand worse parrotedsuch bullshit was also on the list of reasons why hed got his nickname willi rolled his eyes adam pfaff rounded on sigi what did you put in that smoke you gave him man has to be better than tobacco thats for sure if youve got more give me some too baatz sent him an unfriendly look about the only kind the corporal kept in stock so what are you saying pfaff are you saying we wont roll up the reds he asked that sounds like defeatism to me defeatism could get you tangled up with the ss the last thing anybody in his right mind wanted pfaff shook his head dont talk more like a jackass than you can help corporal anybody whos seen me in action knows im no defeatist is that so or isnt it if you make other soldiers not want to fight their hardest thats defeatism too baatz said stubbornly and youd better remember im not too big a jackass to know it pfaff didnt back down nobody heres gonna run home to mutti on account of anything i come out with and we all know wed better fight hard or else the russiansll cut off our cocks and shove em in our mouths do they really do that shit asked a kid whod come up to the front only a few days earlier his uniform wasnt so patched and faded as the ones the other landsers wore but for that there wasnt much to choose between him and the rest they sure do pfaff replied awful arno noddedthey agreed on that much anyhow willi nodded too hed seen it for himself however much he wished he hadnt you dont want to let the ivans take you prisoner he said save a last round for yourself maybe the guys they do that to are already dead but you dont want to find out for yourself do you so what do we do with the russians we capture the new fish asked the veterans squatting by the fire eyed one another nobody said anything for a little while at last willi answered well sometimes we send em back to a camp like good little boys the way we would have in the west we would have most of the time in the west anyway he thought the french and english werent perfect about sticking to the geneva convention either aloud he went on sometimes though he shrugged its a rough old war i dont know what else to tell you if we catch commissars or jews we do for them right away awful arno said pigdogs like that dont deserve to live not every commissar or jewish red army man died right away the wehrmacht kept some alive for questioning the ones who did live for a while probably wound up envying their comrades who perished on the spot german interrogators werent likely to be gentler than their soviet opposite numbers the kid chewed on that for a few seconds then he asked if we treat them rough doesnt that give them an excuse to do the same to us arno baatz laughed at him you want to spout the golden rule sonny you should put on a chaplains frock coat before you start he waited for the other men whod been through the mill to laugh with him sigi herzog did but he was the only one awful arno scowled at the others willi stonily stared back at him the kid had a point of sorts but only of sorts look when this fight is over either well be left standing or the damn russians will willi said you fight a war like that and who has room to be a gentleman isnt that what the geneva conventions for the new fish asked to keep things clean on both sides i mean awful arno laughed some morea mean nasty laugh didnt they tell you anything before they shipped your sorry ass up here yeah thats what the geneva conventions all about when we fought the tommies and the frogs we played by the rules and so did they but you know what the fucking bolsheviks never signed the fucking convention oh the kid said in a small voice and that was about the size of it there were no formal rules in the fight between the third reich and the soviet union they could go at it however they pleased they could and they did the kid made one more try if we told stalin wed follow the convention whether we have to or not wouldnt he almost have to do the same baatz laughed one more time however little willi wanted to he found himself laughing along it was either laugh or weep and laughing hurta littleless stalin doesnt have to do anything he doesnt want to do awful arno said what he wants to do now is kill all the germans he can he was right about that of course hitler didnt have to do anything he didnt want to either and what he wanted to do was kill carload lots of russians which left the soldiers in feldgrau or khaki stuck in the middle between them in one hell of a rough spot like i didnt know that already willi thought his bayonet got most of its use as a belt knife he hacked off another hunk of horsemeat with it then he skewered the meat and held it over the fire at least his belly would be full anyhow chaim weinberg liked having the czech holdouts around they might not be marxistleninists the way he and most of the internationals were but they were good solid men the american jew had nothing against spaniards he wouldnt have come to spain to fight for the republic if he had spaniardsspaniards on both sides dammitwere extravagantly brave they put up with shortages and fuckups with good humor he could only admire because he sure couldnt imitate it but they were flighty they were temperamental they could be cruel for the fun of it hed never got used to bullfighting and they liked to talk jesus h christ did they ever it wasnt as if he didnt enjoy the sound of his own voice he did he argued and converted and preached the red faith with as much zeal as any friar taking on the latest jungle tribe who knew not the word of god but when it came to passion chaim had to admit the spaniards had him beat hed fallen hard for la martellita a party organizer in battered madrid he would have said hell he did say to anyone who would listen hed fallen in love with her the emotion involved though sprang from an organ south of his heart she was tiny she was stacked she was gorgeous in the blueblackhaired highcheekboned flashingeyed spanish way she had what he couldnt help thinking of as a blowjob mouth and the way she painted it said she knew as much too she wouldnt look at him for the longest time it wasnt that he was no movie star himself even if he was no movie star himself he was not too tall kind of dumpy and looked as jewish as he was but what really bothered her was that he wasnt ideologically pure enough he had the american gift or curse of thinking for himself not blindly swallowing the latest twist in the party line out of moscow he got into her bed by the oldest most timetested method in the world he waited till she got smashed went back to her place with her and had his fun while she was too loaded to carealmost too loaded to notice she was anything but delighted to discover him next to her the next morning and her lethal hangover had only a little to do with it but hed tended to the hangover and sweettalked her till she let him back in bed fully conscious he owned the memory forever then she found out she was pregnant she could have got rid of it easily enough the republic had probably the most progressive social policies in the world but she didnt want to maybe a strict catholic upbringing still lurked in the unexamined basement of her soul no she wanted her little surprise to carry a proper surname and so chaim found himself a married man he felt like brer rabbit in the briar patch la martellitaher revolutionary name meant the little hammer and suited her all too wellpromised shed divorce him after the baby was born divorce was even easier here than abortion and unlike abortion it didnt trouble her tender conscience in the meantime it could have been a white marriage like one between a fairy and a dyke wearing masks for the sake of the worlds good opinion la martellita though was as thorough in marriage as she was in everything else and she had discovered that chaim wasnt half bad in the sack it surprised her as it had quite a few other women before her i may not be pretty but by god i can screw he said not without pride you may be able to screw but by god youre not pretty la martellita answered not without truth despite such devastating candor from his moreorless beloved he went back into madrid from the front as often as he could and he returned to the front less and less worried that she hoped he would stop something up there so she could give the baby a name as a respectable widow and not have to go on worrying about the messy details that went into marriage little by little the republicans were driving the nationalists back from the northwestern edge of madrid thered been months of bitter fighting over the corpse of the university now those battered buildings lay several kilometers behind the line pretty soon most of madrid would be out of artillery range for marshal sanjurjos thugs mike carroll had served in the abraham lincoln battalion for as long as chaim had mike was tall and fair and lean and handsome chaim should have hated him on sight instead theyd been buddies since the moment they met like so many buddies they sassed each other all the time youre the only abe lincoln who doesnt want us to advance any more mike said one chilly morning a certain gleam in his eye my ass chaim retorted the fuck that supposed to mean means the farther the front goes from the city the tougher the time you have getting back there and getting your end wet carroll answered chaim suggested that one way he could achieve such an objective was by having his comradeinarms perform an unnatural act on him said comradeinarms made reference to his mother and also to the possibly relevant body parts of a ewe chaim surmised that the ewe might be diseased due to earlier intimate acquaintance with said comradeinarms if they both hadnt been laughing their heads off they would have tried to murder each other after the filthy jokes ran thin chaim said seriously man we better push the fascists back as far as we can ive got the bad feeling this summer wont be a hell of a lot of fun amazing sherlock mike said what leads you to this deduction ah cut the crap you know as well as i do chaim answered we arent licked yet mike said which wasnt a ringing denial everybody on the republican side knew what was wrong as in a sickroom where the patient still seemed strong but was plainly sinking no one wanted to talk about it now that england and france were backing hitlers push against stalin republican spain was definitely the girl theyd left behind the republic was lucky to have got those czechs and the handful of french jews whod come with them not many more soldiers would make it over the pyrenees not many more supplies would either france and england didnt want to sell to the republic any more stalin did but he had his own war to worry about and a swarm of enemies between him and spain meanwhile nobody was stopping the fuhrer and the duce from shipping marshal sanjurjo all kinds of goodies maybe fdr will come through mike said and rain makes applesauce chaim returned ill believe that when i see it america was at war with japan not with germany roosevelt hadnt even tried to get a declaration of war against germany through congress had he tried he would have failed the usa had been selling billions in weapons to the socalled western democracies till the big switch after that fdr pulled the plug the munitions makers might have found a market in spain to take up some of the slackif the new war against japan hadnt got them going full speed ahead again chaim paused to scratch why wasnt it too cold for bugs in the trenches because they lived on nice warm peoplethat was why even if we are fucked weve lasted three years longer than anybody thought we could he said the government was going to take the internationals out of the line remember cause wed done all we could do or we thought so anyway till hitler jumped on the czechs and all of a sudden england and france liked the republic again and now they dont any more and were fucked again carroll said till the roulette wheel stops on a new square we are i wish hitler wouldve declared war on america that would have fried his fish for him boy you got that straight chaim said can you imagine all the shit thatd pour into spain then he imagined it with the dreamy halfhopeless awe a starving prospector gave to striking the mother lode in the meantime carroll poked him in the ribs in the meantime youve got your little cutie back in town if she doesnt give you something to fight for youve got to be dead chaim would no more have called la martellita a little cutie than he would have hung the same handle on a mm shell it wasnt obvious which was more dangerous or more explosive still some guys did talk about weapons that way even if he didnt his features softened for a reason different if related im gonna have a kid a halfspanish kid a kid whos gonna live here in the country we end up making he said softly his eyes dreamy and far away that now that gives me somethin to fuckin fight for some german propaganda sheets lay next to the bubbling samovar when anastas mouradian walked into the red air force officers meeting room he could tell what they were right away for one thing even by soviet standards the paper they were printed on was amazingly cheap and cruddy for another the font the nazis had chosen looked like something from before the last war the armenian bomber pilot wondered why theyd picked something so outdated maybe they didnt have any more modern type or maybe since the alphabet wasnt their own they were just styleblind it wasnt the alphabet stas had grown up with either but he saw it all the time couldnt hitlers clowns have found a defector to fill them in on their own stupidity most likely they hadnt even gone looking germans were so convinced of their own superiority they often didnt bother asking advice from anyone else sometimes they paid for their arrogance too he picked up one of the sheets a misspelled word and some bad grammar leaped out at him the nazis were trying to persuade nonrussians in the ussr to go over to them you thought the tiranny of the tsars was bad stalins is even worser the flier said no no one would take you seriously if you stuck your foot in your mouth as soon as you opened it a russian pilot paused at the samovar to pour himself a glass of tea he chuckled when he saw what mouradian was looking at so stas you going to fly your plane over to a hitlerite airstrip he inquired he was joking stas knew that perfectly well all the same the armenian set down the propaganda sheet as if it burned his fingers not me he declared sincerity ringing in his voice only thing ill give them is a thousand kilos of high explosive the trouble with jokes was you never could tell who was listening to the answers stas had no reason to think boris there belonged to the nkvd or informed on his fellow officers he had no reason to think that about any of the other flyers sitting down with tea and hard rolls and fatty pork sausages and papirosi either but he couldnt afford to joke back with the russians because there was always the chance he didnt care to see the lubyanka the nkvd headquarters in moscow from the inside he didnt want to go to a labor camp in turkmenistan or siberia just on account of a misunderstood joke he didnt want to go to a place like that at all but especially not for such a stupid reason and so remarking this stinking thing wouldnt even make a good asswipe he poured himself a glass of tea too and walked away from the table without a backward glance at the propaganda sheet his copilot came in a few minutes later ivan kulkaanen also picked up one of the sheets after a quick glance he put it down again fascist bullshit he said loudly and got himself some tea and a roll it was fascist bullshitno possible doubt about that with better propaganda the nazis might have had more chance of prying people away from the soviet regime not everyone in the ussr loved it not even close if you had to choose between stalin and his henchmen on the one hand and people who turned out crap like that on the other though you turned into a soviet patriot almost by default lieutenant colonel tomashevsky came in the squadron commander waved to his men telling them not to bother to jump up and salute discipline in the soviet armed forces had tightened up since the war started leaders had discovered that while a revolutionary military sounded good a hierarchical one performed better theyd found the same thing in spain theyd rediscovered it after the french revolution no doubt spartacus that soviet hero had had to learn the lesson too after snagging tea and breakfast tomashevsky said looks like well fly today comrades he sat down by the way he shoveled sausage into his chowlock action didnt leave him too nervous to eat anastas mouradian felt the same way he wanted some ballast in there when he went up some people worked differently theyd puke or get the runs if they went into combat with a full stomach they werent cowards they just came equipped with anxious insides whats our target comrade colonel someone asked theres an enemy concentration east of vitebsk tomashevsky said mostly englishmen and the french intelligence says his lip curled in fine contempt if they want to play these games we have to show them the price and if we smash them up before they get to the front thats one thing less for the red army to worry about groundcrew men were bombing up the pes and making sure their machine guns had full belts when mouradian and kulkaanen went to their plane some of the bombs had slogans chalked on the casings for stalin and death to fascists and the like the only way the enemy would find out about one of those was if the bomb proved a dud but the groundcrews did that kind of thing all the time it made them happy and didnt hurt anything so why not fyodor mechnikov profanely directed bomb stowage the blocky sergeant reminded stas a lot of ivan kuchkov with whom hed served before getting promoted away he wasnt quite so hairy or quite so ugly and he didnt have quite such a foul mouth but he came close on all three counts well give em hell right he said to stas the armenian nodded gravely that isnt borscht were dropping on them borscht the bombardier didnt need long to decide what he thought of that youre weird sir it could be mouradian agreed it probably is in fact but as long as i get the plane there and back as long as we deliver the load what difference does it make when you put it that way not fucking much mechnikov allowed flying the pe was a pleasure it had so much speed and maneuverability people called it the fighting bomber of course theyd said the same thing about the sb the plane stas had learned on only a few years earlier the state of the art had passed the sb by one of these days the pe would also grow obsolescent but it hadnt happened yet if were gong after the english and french we wont have to worry so much about s will we kulkaanen asked as they reached cruising altitude i hope not stas said sincerely calling a pe a fighting bomber meant it had a chance against a messerschmitt a good chance well no from what hed heard english fighters were about as good as the french machines not quite neither country had swarms of them in these parts the way the nazis did the squadron droned on toward the west a few antiaircraft guns fired at them as they crossed the front russian german both no one got hit so it didnt matter somewhere down there in the snow approaching the target tomashevskys voice echoed in stas earphones the pilot wondered how he could tell then he saw fairly well camouflaged tents belowand antiaircraft fire abruptly picked up let em go fedya he called to the bombardier through the speaking tube away they went all at once the bomber grew nimbler it needed to for english hurricanesmouradian thought they were hurricanestore into the formation less than a minute after the pes turned for home tracers scored deadly fiery lines across the sky two bombers spun earthward one after the other a hurricane went down too flames licking back from the dead engine toward the cockpit stas didnt see a parachute open there he didnt look very hard either he was too busy throwing his plane around the sky trying to keep any hurricanes from getting on his tail mechnikov fired a burst from the belly machine gun no answering storm of lead tore into the pe so maybe he scared off the enemy or maybe he was shooting at nothing stas didnt care as long as he got away he didnt care about anything else chapter julius lemp swept the horizon with his zeiss binoculars ratings up on the us conning tower scanned all segments of the sky the baltic was a damned narrow sea you had to stay alert every second you were on the surface trouble would land on top of you with both feet if you didnt estonia lay to the south finland to the north under marshal mannerheim finland was neutral or even friendly to the reich estonia would have liked to be stalin didnt give the little country the choice the reds still resented losing the baltic states when the russian empire fell apart they resented losing finland too but they werent in such a good position to do anything about that when the soviet union sneezed estonia came down with the sniffles when stalin said do something his little neighbor did it otherwise especially in troubled times like these the red army would march in as a matter of fact the red armyand the red air force and red navy had marched in that was why lemp cast an especially wary eye toward the south but things could have been worse estonia still remained independent in name stalin had promised that his forces would leave once the emergency was over even an idiot knew stalins pledges were worth their weight in gold but at least hed bothered to make this one lithuania was as much a german sphere as estonia was a russian hitler had reannexed memel and the lithuanians seemed pathetically eager to cede it to him he might have grabbed the whole country if they hadnt like stalin he swore up and down that the wehrmacht would pull out after hed won the war lemp chuckled nastily once a guy got it in he always promised hed pull out whats funny skipper one of the ratings asked the field glasses never left his eyes his steady scan of the sky never faltered lemp told him he laughed so did the rest of the sailors up there you used that line too did you another one said who me lemp answered in a voice brimming with innocence more goatish laughter erupted aboard the kriegsmarines surface ships prussian discipline was alive and thriving everything was bright metal and fresh paint and sharp trouser creases and smooth shaves and zu befehl mein herr uboats werent like that by the nature of things they couldnt be no one wasted precious fresh water on shaving like his men lemp wore a scraggly growth of face fungus his uniform was as grimy and smelly as theirs were the only thing that distinguished his from theirs was the white cover on his service cap theirs were all navy blue hed taken the stiffening wire out of the crown as every uboat skipper did one more silent swipe at spit and polish the sun glinted off the sea to the south and threw dazzling reflections into his face it stood higher in the sky than it had in the depths of winternot that anybody who had to sail the baltic in that season saw it very often but the wind still blew down from the northstraight off the north pole by the feel of it despite a heavy peacoat and quilted trousers lemp shivered one of the ratings stiffened he pointed southeast smoke on the horizon lemps binoculars swung that way yes the dark smudge was therelow and hard to make out but there sure as hell and smoke in these waters could come only from a russian ship good job anton ill see it goes into your file the skipper said then he called down the hatch to the exec who had the helm change course to all ahead full anton spied the smoke changing course to skipper klaus hammersteins voice floated up from below he was a good officer hed get promoted away from the u into a boat of his own before too long when he was the old man himself he could let more of his good nature show hed have an exec to do the dirty work for him then instead of his doing it for someone else lemp heard him call the setting change back to the engine room the uboats diesels throbbed harder the type viia could make sixteen knots on the surface that would be plenty to run down a freighter if anton had found an enemy warship ill worry about that later lemp told himself he did not hold the red navy in high regard yes the ivans were brave but hed spent most of the time since the war started facing off against the royal navy out in the north sea and the atlantic those were the best surface sailors in the world better than their opposite numbers in the kriegsmarine he nodded to himself they were the men from whom the germansand everybody elsetried to learn their craft set against competition like that the russians didnt come close to measuring up he went to the big piermounted binoculars on the conning tower they had a narrow field of view but more magnification and far more light grasp than the ones he and the ratings wore on straps around their necks and now he wasnt scanning for things that might be there something was and he knew just where to look for it distant waves leaped toward him so did that smoke smudge not quite so low on the horizon now as the uboat hurried toward it before long he got what he was waiting for both the u and the enemy ship rose on swells at the same time he didnt get to study that lean shark shape for very long but he didnt need long either destroyer he said crisply he glanced at his own boats exhaust there wasnt that much to see diesels ran cleaner than turbines and his engines were smaller than the ones powering the soviet ship an outstanding lookout might spot his smoke or now the uboats silhouette against the sky but how many outstanding lookouts did the red navy boast not many and not many german officers were better equipped to judge that than he was so he waited and waited and waited some more as the gap closed only when he figured any halfwayawake fellow with binoculars was liable to see the u did he order the ratings below as usual he was the last man off the conning tower as he dogged the hatch behind him he ordered take her down to schnorkel depth and raise the periscope schnorkel depth aye aye hammerstein said the snort let the diesels breathe under water it gave the boat better performance than she had on her electric motors as long as she didnt dive deep the dutch had invented the gadget but more and more german uboats used it these days also of course the schnorkel s stovepipe tube and the skinnier one that housed the periscope were a lot harder to spot than the us hull would have been lemp peered through the scope and tried to work out the destroyers speed course and distance have we got a shot the exec asked i think so lemp said slowly they have no idea were around theyre strolling along at eight knots tops that was about a quarter of the destroyers full speed were within four kilometers now we can close some more too he fed the course and speed information to hammerstein who had a kind of glorified slide rule that helped him calculate the torpedo settings regulations said the skippers zentrale was to be closed off from the rest of the boat like most skippers lemp ignored that reg easier just to call orders forward than to shout through the voice tube they closed to just over two kilometers that was still a longish shot but it was as good as they were likely to get any closer and somebody on the russian destroyer was liable to wake up and spoil things a ship like that could show them her heels easy as you please or make an attack run instead which wouldnt be any fun lemp ordered a spread of three torpedoes one by one at his shout of los the eels sprang away from the u seawater gurgled into the boats forward ballast tanks to make up for the several tonnes of weight now vanished and to keep the trim level the stopwatchs hand seemed to crawl around the dial with maddening slowness lemp looked from it to the periscopes eyepiece again and again the destroyer made sudden smoke and started to turn too late the first eel caught her up near the bow one of the others not far from the stern both explosions rumbled through the u as badly broken as a dog hit by a car the destroyer went down fast they got a signal off dammit the radio operator said emerging from his tiny sanctum change course to lemp said well stay at schnorkel depth lets see their planes spot us then right you are skipper i am changing course to the exec swung the u back toward the west the direction from which the boat had come a rare smile spread across his face the lords will be extra happy weve made a kill eh think so do you lemp smiled too the most junior crewmenthe lords in uboat crews jargonbedded down in the torpedo room as long as it was full of eels some of them slept on top of torpedoes once the reloads went into the tubes theyd have more room to place their bedrolls and sling their hammocks to them that had to outweigh sinking a soviet destroyer it didnt for julius lemp but he knew how they felt all the same sergeant hideki fujita was busy counting logs the count had to come out perfect for every unit at pingfan under his command if it didnt somebody would catch hell oh the logs would of course but they counted for nothing in a japanese soldiers view of things the person who would catch hell if the count screwed up was the man in chargefujita himself he glowered at the logs as he counted them the maruta stood at stiff attention their faces as expressionless as they could make them they or most of them wanted the count to come out right too until the japanese authorities were satisfied the prisoners of war wouldnt get fed that simple truth should have nipped all escape attempts in the bud if somebody got out of one of the barbedwire enclosures nobody who stayed behind would get anything to eat the maruta didnt get that much to eat as things were they would have got even less if the bacteriologists of unit didnt need reasonably healthy subjects for some experiments in spite of themselves the maruta shivered pingfan was a little south of harbin but only a little winters in manchukuo were nothing to sneeze atunless you got influenza or pneumonia or any of the other illnesses you could catch all by yourself in cold weather fujita felt the chill himself and he wore a fur cap with earflaps a doublebreasted greatcoat with a fur collar and a thick lining heavy mittens and valenki hed taken off a dead russian in the forests on the far side of the ussuri the maruta red army men in this enclosurehad only their ordinary service uniforms they also had more than cold weather to worry about to the japanese bacteriologists they were nothing but guinea pigs to be used up as needed that the japanese called them something like logs showed what they thought of them brave soldiers proper soldiers wouldnt have let themselves get captured proper officers wouldnt have surrendered not when they were defending a place as vital to their country as vladivostok the other useful thing about calling a pow a log of course was that you didnt have to think of him as a human being once you started doing it japanese soldiersand scientists toohad trouble thinking of prisoners as human beings like themselves anyhow by surrendering you threw away your manhood your self your honor in essence who could possibly care what happened to you afterwards but tagging the pows at pingfan maruta made that dehumanizing process all but official one of the privates helping fujita with the countdoing most of the actual work in other wordscame up to him and stood at attention waiting to be noticed after a delay designed to remind the soldier he was only a private fujita deigned to nod yes please excuse me sergeant san but i make the count out to be a hundred and seventyfour does that include the two bodies fujita pointed toward the corpses lying in front of the russians neat ranks you had to show your dead how else could the guards be sure they hadnt run off to join the chinese bandits bedeviling manchukuo and to spread wild lying rumors about what went on at pingfan hai sergeant san the private nodded eagerly the other new conscript with fujita hustled up a moment later and reported the same figure theyd gone down opposite sides of the prisoners ranks so they couldnt have put their heads together to come up with it it also matched the number of men this compound should hold taking the deaths yesterday into account fujita knew thathe kept track of such thingsbut he checked the figure on the paper stuck in his clipboard even so he couldnt afford to be wrong not on something this important yes nobodyd run off in the night not here he raked the red army men in the front row with his eyes they were only prisoners after all they deserved no better khorosho he shouted his accent was terrible but he didnt care it was up to the roundeyed barbarians to be grateful that hed wasted any time to learn a few words of their stupid ugly language arigato gozaimasu sergeant san the russians chorused naturally they had to thank him for finding their numbers acceptable they reached as one for the mess tins on their beltsif they had beltsand trooped off to the kitchen for their meager morning meal fujita pointed to the scrawny dead bodies have these disposed of when the maruta come back he told the privates yes sergeant san one of them said while the other went of course sergeant san fujita had taken his lumps while he was a private now he could hand them out these fellows had to keep him sweet as hed had to suck up to his sergeant before that was how the system worked later that day a microbiologist came up to him sir fujita said stiffening to rigor mortislike attention what do you need sir whatever it was fujita would get it for him or die trying his orders were that a scientists white lab coat was as good as an officers collar tabs if somebody wearing one gave him orders he had to follow them an officer would knock you around at the slightest suspicion of reluctance the scientists were friendlier than that or maybe just more naive dr tsuruo yamamura was a nice guy sometimes he even said please when he told people what to do a courtesy no officer would ever show he did it now we have a new shipment of maruta coming in by train this afternoon please take a squad of guards and meet them at half past three then take them to the new compoundis it number twentyseven yes sir compound twentyseven fujita tore off a paradeground salute be gentle with them unless they try to escape yamamura said they are important to the war effort yes sir the sergeant repeated but then he risked a questioning sir he wasnt used to orders like the ones hed just got dr yamamura was willing even eager to explain where an officer would have either snarled or hauled off and belted fujita for his gall these are american marines captured in peking and shanghai the bacteriologist said their reactions to our experiments will help show how americans and englishmen differ from chinese and japanese and will let us make more effective weapons to use against them i see fujita said slowly hed talked to more than a few soldiers whod served in one or another of the major chinese cities from what they said american marines were very bad news big tough clever fighters who backed away from nobody if they were as tough as all that though why did they let themselves be taken prisoner instead of killing themselves or making their foes finish them that wasnt a sergeants worry being at the railroad siding with a squad well before was fujita made sure he and his men were in place the train down from harbin naturally ran late that also wasnt his worryor anything close to a surprise more than a hundred americans stumbled off the train when it finally showed up theyd been packed in like rice grains jammed into a sack close to half of them wore dirty bandages that showed theyd been wounded they jabbered in incomprehensible english shouts and gestures with bayoneted rifles got them moving in the right direction most of the time the japanese soldiers would have clouted some of them with rifle butts to speed things along but fujita had spelled out dr yamamuras orders so his men took it easy compound had a barracks hall with a central stove inside the barbed wire the prisoners wouldnt be too crowded they could recover from whatever theyd gone through on the train fujita thought they were almost living in a hotel by the way his men rolled their eyes they also figured the americans had it soft but they were only soldiers the officers and scientists set over them didnt care a sens worth what they thought somewhere or other adam pfaff had got his hands on a pair of field glasses they were such an obviously useful thing for an infantryman to have not even awful arno complained about them and baatz complained about everything hed sure pissed and moaned about the gray paint pfaff had slapped on his rifles woodwork somehow though the nonregulation mauser hadnt made the world come to an end or handed the war to the ivans on a silver platter baatz was used to the piece by now willi dernen wouldnt have been surprised if hed started ordering other people to paint theirs the same way had willi owned binoculars he would have used them for something practical like ogling girls getting into or out of clothes from ranges where they couldnt catch him at it his buddy didnt do thator if pfaff did he didnt brag about it or share the field glasses when he spotted something juicy the way most guys would have instead when he wasnt using them to search out male ivans with rifles he pointed them up into the sky he tended to mumble to himself when he did that what do you see up there bombers willi asked one evening at sunset when he caught pfaff doing it he didnt hear aircraft engines but that might not signify sometimes the ivans flew so high you couldnt hear them and spotting planes against the darkening sky was a bitch again binoculars would clearly come in handy but the other gefreiter shook his head without lowering the field glasses heavenly bodies he answered that made willi think of naked women again he wasnt as big a cockhound as some of the guys but he wasnt a priest either nowhere close he looked up into the sky himself he didnt see any naked girls up there only the firstquarter moon and a growing number of stars he said so this time pfaff did lower the binoculars he shook his head again in some annoyance not that kind of heavenly bodies he said it wasnt that he had anything against women either well what then willi inquired he was getting annoyed himself if you really want to know i was looking at the moon willi eyed it himself there it was up in the sky it looked like half a coin the straight line that ran from top to bottom wasnt quite straight it seemed ever so slightly chewed which made it different from the rest of the moons outline it still wasnt very exciting or even interesting again willi didnt hesitate to say so pfaff handed him the field glasses have a look through these you know how to adjust them for your eyes oh sure ive used em before willi aimed at the moon it wasnt very far out of focus even before he carefully twisted each eyepiece in turn to sharpen things up his buddys vision couldnt have been too different from his own but once he got the image as clear as he could wow he breathed hardly even realizing he was making a noise its something isnt it pfaff spoke with quiet pride as if instead of galileo he were the first one ever to see the heavens close up that pride was wasted on willi who didnt even hear him the moon hung there seeming close enough to reach out and touch if he took one hand away from the field glasses it wasnt just a light in the sky any more it was a world a world out there in space the faint gray patches you could make out with the naked eye and willi didnt so much as think of naked women the truest proof of how fascinated he was swelled into plains that had to be hundreds of kilometers across craters pocked them and filled the brighter whiter areas of the moon shadows stretched across the craters closest to the straight line the others under higher sunlight showed less contrast what made them willi asked volcanoes adam pfaff understood what he was talking about right away nobody knows for sure weve never been there after all he answered but thats one of the best guesses wow willi said again staring and staring you see the three craters one above the next near the sunrise linethe terminator they call it pfaff said willi peered again then nodded i see em theyre called ptolemaeus alphonsus and azrachel all the shit on the moon has names that had never occurred to willi before you could make maps of what was up there the same as you could down here it really was another world you think they look impressive through these you should see em through a telescope pfaff said back home ive got an eightcentimeter refractor its little and pretty cheap but itll let you magnify a hundred times not just seven then you can really start to get an idea of how much there is to see willi tried to imagine the moon appearing that much bigger and closer than it did even through binoculars he felt himself failing after youd started playing with yourself you could try to imagine what a girl would be like but you wouldnt know what counted till one let you get lucky what else can you show me here he asked well you see those two bright stars close together a little west of the moon pfaff asked willi nodded once more one of them was the brightest star in the sky the other the more easterly one was fainter and more yellow his friend went on you can take a look at them if you want the bright one is jupiter maybe youll see a couple of its moons if you hold the binoculars real steady the other ones saturn rings willi exclaimed remembering from school rings adam agreed only the binoculars wont show them through a telescope theyve got to be the most beautiful thing in the sky you think they cant possibly be real if they were more beautiful than the magnified moon willi wished he had a telescope through the field glasses the stars stayed stars they looked brighter and you could see more of them but they didnt get bigger jupiter and saturn did jupiter especially showed a tiny disk it probably wasnt even a quarter as wide as the moon through the naked eye but it was there and sure as hell it had two little stars dancing attendance on it that was interestingnot so glorious as the moon but interesting all the same what else is there willid ignored the heavens as long as hed been alive now he wanted to look at everything at once adam pfaff pointed to the left of the moon this time see those faint stars in what looks like mist you cant make em out real well because the moons so close but theyre there following his finger willi spied what he was talking about pfaff said thats the pleiades they look different through the field glasses different how willi asked pfaff didnt enlighten him so he turned the binoculars that way he whistled softly had someone taken a bag of diamondsalong with the odd sapphire and rubyand spilled them on velvet of the deepest blue imaginable a blue only a whisper from black he might have made an inferior copy of what willi saw jewels dont shine by their own light the stars of the pleiades did even more than with the moon the naked eye gave no hint of what hid in plain sight hey what are you clowns up to arno baatzs grating voice made willi yank down the binoculars as if the corporal had caught him with dirty pictures baatz brayed on trying to freeze your stupid dicks off you dont have to try real hard not here you dont willi had forgotten he was cold out in the open in the middle of a russian winter that would do for a miracle till a real one came along were just looking at the moon and stuff through my field glasses pfaff said want to see nahh awful arno laughed at the idea that saddened willi without surprising him i got better things to do with my time i do the corporal added willi almost asked him what they were but held his tongue instead if baatz didnt want to know willi didnt want to tell him in the red air force political officers were like epaulets on a uniform they were decorative but you didnt need them most of them had sense enough to know it too if a politruk tried to countermand a squadron commanders orders the arrogant fool would be ignored if he was lucky if he wasnt so lucky he might leave a bomber without a parachute from several thousand meters up any halfclever officer could cook up paperwork explaining the unfortunate accident it wasnt as if the jerk it happened to would be there to give him the lie ivan kuchkov soon found out things in the red army were different political officers here took the job of indoctrinating the men seriously they preached communism the way priests preached religion and like priests they thought what they were doing was important they also expected everybody else to think it was important when a politruk started gabbing he expected all the soldiers within range of his yappy voice to pay close attention ivan soon mastered the art of seeming to listen while his mind roamed free he didnt take long to realize he wasnt the only one lieutenant vasiliev went on and on about the benefits of party membership the most important one for most red army men was that their families were sure to get word if they fell on the field unlike the nazis soviet soldiers wore no identity disks the government kept only loose track of them they were interchangeable expendable parts but communist party members were part of the elite they mattered to the state so it monitored them more closely than ordinary fighters that might have been a selling point for most soldiers but not for ivan his mother was dead he couldnt stand his brother or sister and if he ever saw his old man again hed smack him in the snoot to pay him back for all the beatings hed dished out when ivan was a kid or hed try anyhow his father was a sneaky weasel and might get in the first lick himself so all that recruiting crap went in one ear and out the other but sometimes vasiliev went on about other stuff too one morning after breakfastblack bread sausage and tea plus whatever the soldiers could scrounge from the countrysidehe gathered the company together in the woods and spoke in portentous tones romania has declared war against the rodina back when the war was new kuchkovs sb had flown across romanian airspace so soviet volunteers could reach czechoslovakia to fight the fascists that aid wasnt enough theyd had to get the hell out of there again a month later but theyd tried which was more than anybody else could say now now the politruk went on marshal antonescu shows he always was a fascist at heart he thinks the nazis and their lackeys are a better bet than the ussr but our heroic soldiers our brave workers and peasants will show him what a big mistake he has made this widens the war now it stretches from the baltic to the black sea have the nazis got enough men for such an enormous fight no can romania hope to fight the red army by herself no again we will push forward through her and tear into the hitlerites soft underbelly he waited for applause he got some the men had learned he shut up sooner if they cheered fuck the romanians ivan called bugger em with a pine cone he took the germans seriously they were too good at their trade for anything less but the romanians they had to be worse humpties than the poles the poles at least were brave nobodyd ever said that about the romanians lieutenant vasiliev beamed at him theres the soviet fighting spirit are you a party member sergeant no comrade lieutenant kuchkov wished hed kept his big mouth shut you didnt want to draw their notice theyd dump garbage on your head if you did would you like me to begin your paperwork for you its easy enough to arrange however you please comrade lieutenant ivan wanted to become a communist almost as much as he wanted to shit through his ears but you couldnt just tell the sons of bitches no then youd go on a list people who landed on those lists had bad things happen to them youre kuchkov right yes of course you are vasiliev had the politicians knack for matching names and faces well most of the time with a selfdeprecating chuckle he added please remind me of your name and patronymic ivan ivanovich sir cant get much plainer than that can you the politruk smiled as he wrote it down me im arsen feofanovich so im at the other end of things kuchkov nodded both vasiliev and his father had uncommon first names all right but the lieutenant made a mistake if he thought kuchkov might care the germans started shelling the forest where the company sheltered digging proper foxholes in ground frozen stone hard was a bitch and the nazis had come up with an evil trick one the red army also used though ivan didnt worry about that they set their fuses to maximum sensitivity so most shells went off as soon as they touched branches overhead then the bursts sprayed sharp fragments of hot metal down on the men huddled below it was ivans first real time under shellfire he couldnt shoot back any more than he could when his bomber drew the unwelcome attention of antiaircraft guns all he could do was stay low and try to dig himself in though his entrenching tool took only pathetic little bites of dirt something hissed in the snow a few centimeters from his hand a shard of brass that could have skewered him as easily as not fuck your mothers he yelled though of course the nazis serving those distant s couldnt hear him i hope your dicks rot off he also hoped one of those nasty fragments would wound lieutenant vasiliev he didnt want vasiliev dead just hurt enough to forget about putting him up for party membership if the politruk spent a few weeks in the hospital and then got sent to a different unit that would do fine other soldiers swore too to let out their fear and wounded men shrieked and wailed the unhurt soldiers closest to them did what they could to relieve their comrades agony too often that wasnt much slapping a wound dressing on a leg ripped from knee to crotch was sending a baby boy to do a mans job ivan wondered whether the germans would follow up the shelling with an infantry attack russians laughed at winter fritz yeah propaganda posters showed scrawny shivering nazi soldiers with icicles dangling from the ends of their long pointed noses that didnt match what kuchkov had seen yes widetracked russian tanks had the edge on german machines in the snow the german foot soldiers around here seemed to know what they were doing though some of their gear was improvised or stolen from the locals but it wasnt bad and yes sentries shouted in alarm submachine guns stuttered out death far more red army soldiers carried them than any other nations troops they didnt have a rifles range true or a rifles stopping power but they were cheap and easy to make and they spat a lot of lead inside a couple of hundred meters a company of men with submachine guns would massacre a company of riflemen the germans by contrast made sure almost every squad included a light machine gun that was another way to get firepower in carload lots german mgs were far more portable than their soviet equivalents ivan hadnt been a foot soldier long but he already hated them snatching up his own ppd he ran for the edge of the woods shells kept falling but you did what you had to do the artillery might get him if the nazis made it in among the trees he was a dead man for sure as soon as he saw figures in whitewashed coalscuttle helmets running toward him he threw himself down behind a tree and started shooting the nazis were pros they flattened out most of them had snow smocks or bedsheets for camouflage though a few wore only their fieldgray greatcoats and stood out like lumps of coal two germans served an mg ivan burned through most of his big drum magazine before he took them out but he made damn sure he did without that monster supporting them the fritzes lost enthusiasm for the attack across open ground sullenly in good order they drew back ivans sigh of relief filled the air in front of him with fog his number wasnt up this time chapter benjamin halevy had all the answers he was a frenchman and a jew so he sure thought he did anyhow marshal sanjurjo inspects the madrid front every so often he said the nationalists still dont realize everything your elephant gun can do put a round through his giblets at a kilometer and a half and watch the assholes on the other side thrash like a chicken after it gets one in the neck from the farmers wife you make it sound so easy vaclav jezek eyed his cigarette with distaste spanish tobacco was even harsher than french every drag sandpapered his throat the only thing worse would be no tobacco at all this was a misfortune that would be a catastrophe youve done it before halevy said you just have to be in the right place at the right time thats all you make it sound so easy jezek repeated even more dryly than before like so many things sniping had to look simple to people who didnt do it the positioning the concealment the waiting the shot everything had to go perfectly or you wasted a bullet more likely you never got your shot off or else some canny bastard on the other side somebody who was better or luckier than you were at that particular moment blew out the side of your head well think about it the jew told him im starting to get connections and sometimes they hear things from the other side if you punch sanjurjos ticket the republic will pin so many medals on you youll look like a fascist general i think id rather get laid vaclav said halevy laughed vaclav sent him a sour stare and how are you getting connections you dont speak spanish no but if people here speak any foreign language they speak french halevy made it sound natural and easy it probably was for him vaclav grunted pinched out the cigarettes coal and stowed the little butt in a tobacco pouch waste not want not a jew would land on his feet anywhereeven in spain evidently somebody on the other side fired a rifle the bullet whined high over the republican line it would come down somewhere but long odds it would hurt anybody when it did a lot of shots fired in war were like that you wanted to get the other guys but you didnt want them to get you so you fired without sticking your head up to see what you were doing you made them keep their heads down anyway more often than not the czechs and internationals holding this stretch of the line would have ignored such a wild round but guys here must have been jumpy because two rifles in quick succession answered the fascist shot that spooked sanjurjos men vaclav couldnt imagine what they were thinking that the veterans on the other side would swarm out of the trenches and charge them they had to be nuts to believe anything like that nuts or not more of them fired back bullets started snapping past much closer to the trenches you didnt want to stick your head up over the parapet or youd stop one with your nose halevy chambered a round in his rifle i didnt much want a firefight but he shrugged war wasnt about what you wanted it was about what you got stuck with along with the antitank rifle vaclav carried a pistol to defend himself at close range the big piece was no good for work like that neither weapon was much use in a fight like this machine guns on both sides started yammering vaclav realized what a long way from home he was but he didnt want to be back in prague not with the nazis swastika flying over it mortar bombs whispered when they came down the first couple burst a few bays over from the sniper and the jewish sergeant vaclav had dug a bombproof into the forward edge of the trench with some help from halevy theyd reinforced it with bits and pieces of wood scavenged here there and everywhere both men dove into it now if a mortar round burst right behind them even the bombproof wouldnt help vaclav wished such thoughts wouldnt cross his mind they just made this business even more horrible than it would be otherwise what if they try to rush us halevy yelled through the din what if they do vaclav returned the machine guns will slaughter them thats what the machine guns had heavily protected nests even a direct hit from a mortar bomb might not take one out an ordinary soldier who got up on the firing step though was asking to get murdered before the war started jezek had figured jews for cowards hed got over that the ones in the czechoslovakian army hated hitler even more than czechs did which was saying something they made up a disproportionate number of the men who served under the governmentinexile and benjamin halevy held up his end of the bargain as well as anyone could want vaclav still didnt like jews he saw no reason why he should but he wasnt dumb enough to disbelieve what he saw with his own eyes jews werent yellow or no more yellow than anybody else little by little the firefight ebbed there was no particular reason for that any more than there had been for its start combat wasnt always rational not even a goddamn german general staff officer with a volume of clausewitz under his arm could deny that wounded men moaned or shrieked depending on how badly they were hurt off in the distance the same sounds rose from the nationalists positions suffering had a universal language stretcherbearers hustled wounded republican fighters to aid stations behind the lines if the men got there alive they had a pretty good chance to stay that way to his surprise vaclav had discovered that they knew far more about giving blood transfusions in the field here than they had in either czechoslovakia or france he crawled out of the bombproof and dusted himself off the stink of shit hung in the air maybe it came from men killed on the spot maybe from men scared past endurance hed fouled himself a time or two he wasnt proud of itwho would be but he wasnt anywhere near so ashamed as he had been when it happened he wasnt the only one it had happened tonowhere near in fact it was just one of those things sergeant halevy came out too such fun he said fun vaclav echoed in a hollow voice right if sanjurjo were watching the football game right now halevy said then what vaclav broke in id have to spot him id have to know he was there to spot in the first place hed have to be somewhere the rifle could reach id have to be somewhere i could shoot from and id have to hit him when i did snipers never talk about all the times they miss you know so why dont you give it a rest huh all right halevy said but sanjurjo does come right up to the front line to see whats going on whatever else you can say about the miserable fat turd hes no coward oh joy jezek answered men who hadnt seen action always figured the miserable turds on the other side wouldnt show courage but hed seen that the nazis were as brave as czechs or frenchmen or tommies no one here in spain had ever accused the nationalists of lacking balls brains yes but brains werent the same thing not even close im just telling you its not impossible youll get a shot at him thats all halevy wouldnt leave it alone and im just telling you its not impossible monkeysll fly out my ass next time i fart but im not gonna wait around till they do jezek retorted irritably he couldnt faze the jew with all the singe weve both eaten it wouldnt surprise me one damn bit halevy said singe was what the french called the tinned beef they got from argentina it meant monkey meat vaclav had never eaten real monkey so he couldnt say how much singe tasted like it he was sure nobody in his right mind would eat the stuff if he didnt have to he did say that spam the americans ship over is a hell of a lot better youre right halevy grinned and made as if to lick his chops it sure is its pork vaclav reminded him not without malice youre right halevy agreed once more it sure is vaclav thought that over then shrugged he wasnt a perfect christian why should he expect the french sergeant to make a perfect jew surabaya on the north coast of java was even hotter and muggier than manila pete mcgill hadnt dreamt any place could be hell included but there you were and here he was with the boise thanking the lord the japs hadnt sunk the light cruiser before she got here joe orsatti had an answer for the weather joe orsatti pete was discovering had an answer for everything sometimes he had a good one sometimes he was full of crap but the other marine always liked to hear himself talk were on the other side of the equator now he said so its summer here not winter no wonder its so fucking sticky we arent more than a long piss on the other side of the equator pete pointed out looks to me like itd be this way all the fuckin time here maybe thats what makes the local wogs so jumpy orsatti said shit if i had to live in a steam bath the goddamn year around you can bet your sorry ass id be mean too who says you arent pete thought that was one of joes crappy answers the javanese didnt look a whole lot different from filipinos at least to american eyes they were small and slight and brown when they talked among themselves their jibberjabber sounded pretty much the same as the filipinos too but a lot of filipinos knew english and some of the ones who didnt knew spanish instead if a javanese spoke any european language he spoke dutch and to petes way of thinking that was a big part of the problem right there when the united states took the philippines from spain it was with the notion that eventually the islands would turn into a country of their own that was how pete had heard it anyway americans tended to forget theyd fought a nasty little war against filipinos who wanted a country of their own right away holland by contrast didnt want to turn the dutch east indies loose as long as dutch forces in the indies were strong enough to squash revolts the locals put up with being ruled by a little country halfway around the world they might not like it but they put up with it now suddenly all that was tottering the japs were on the way they werent white men they were little and kind of brown themselves theyd made the boise bail out of manila bay like a cat running from a big mean dog they had troops on the ground in the philippines now and they were heading this way because they were desperately hungry for the oil and tin and rubber the dutch east indies and british malaya had in such abundance and it didnt look as if the dutchor the americans or the british or the australianswould be able to stop them against what japan could throw into the fight the white powers didnt have enough troops or ships or planes and what they did have wasnt good enough pete could see that he wouldnt have been in surabaya if the americans could have hung on in manila if he could see it didnt it stand to reason the javanese could too if they figured the japs were going to set them free or take them over why did they have to kowtow to white men any more how many of them listened to japanese propaganda on the radio every chance they got how many were quietly helping the invaders pete had no way to know stuff like that he did know the boise s skipper had put even the harborside dives off limits for the ships crew they were officially judged unsafe and not just because the local joy girls would give you the clap the dutch who were supposed to run this town wouldnt go through the streets in groups smaller than squadsized if they did they were much too likely to get their heads smashed with a brick or their throats slit a plane buzzed over the boise a dutch fighter with fixed landing gear everybody said the japs built junk everybody said that yeah but theyd sure done a number on the us army air force in the philippines the dutch plane looked hotter than an army peashooter but not by one whole hell of a lot joe orsatti eyed the dutch plane too and the orange triangles under the wings a fokker he remarked a motherfokker pete agreed orsatti sent him a pained look hardeharhar youghta take it on the road i did mcgill answered what do you think im doing here funny againlike a truss i know pete said but id sure rather see those triangles than the big old jap meatballs better get used to it orsatti said five wins you ten we aint gonna stick around here real long were useless here we gotta get up farther north if were gonna keep the japs from landing yknow what im saying uhhuh pete replied not altogether happily talk about sticking your head in the tigers mouth gonna be a shitass excuse for a fleet all right the other marine said us a coupla our destroyers some dutch tin cans that limey light cruiser should be fun getting all of us dancing to the same tune pete hadnt thought about that hed been away from ships too long before he found himself back aboard the boise trying to get skippers from three countries to act in concert fun right one thing for sure the japs wouldnt have that problem they might have others pete could hope so if they didnt the allies here were in a lot of trouble pete had seen enough of the japanese in china to have more respect for them than a lot of higherranking americans did they might not be white men but they were sturdy and tough and they were proud of not being white the same way a lot of americans and englishmenand evidently dutchmenwere proud because they were perhaps because orsatti had had a lot of shipboard duty his feel for what the fleet at surabaya would do next was pretty good they headed north two days later pete wondered if word had come in that japanese landing forces were on the way no one said sobut then nobody ever told the guys who would do the fighting and dying any more than they absolutely had to know sometimes not even that then the destroyers steamed away and left the light cruisers behind somethings goin on orsatti opined you oughta be a detectivea private dick like pete told him which won another dirty look they were practicing at the fiveinch gun uneasily aware that the practice could turn real any second lookouts constantly eyed the skies planes that appeared out in the middle of the ocean would be japanese did the enemy fleet have carriers along theyd struck at hawaii but that hadnt gone so well as they would have liked manila unfortunately proved a different story night fell the gun crews were on watch and watch so petes sleep got ruined he gulped hot coffee to keep his eyes open he wasnt the only one drinking java near java was almost funny the boise sliced through the java sea kicking up a phosphorescent bow wave and wake if any japanese subs were in the neighborhood with any luck at all were going too fast for em pete thought yawning he wasnt used to sack time chopped into little bits yeah it had been too long our destroyers are in contact with enemy warships and transports off borneo the intercom blared in harsh metallic tones they are making torpedo runs at the transports pete waited to hear reports of jap freighters blown to smithereens and he wasnt the only one but the intercom stayed quiet after that little by little he realized the silence wasnt a good sign so did the other leathernecks on the gun crew their high spirits faded the sun came up within a few minutes of as it always did in these waters a plane buzzed down out of the north to look over the allied fleet orders came to fire at it all the antiaircraft guns on the boise roared together the bursts didnt come close to reaching the plane it saw what it wanted to see and flew away and nobody said another word about the destroyers and what they might be doingor what might have been done to them pete kept his mouth shut along with everyone else but he knew damn well that wasnt a good sign a horse slogged up a road pulling a panje wagon after it the wagon had tall wheels and an almost boatshaped bottom russian peasants hadand neededplenty of experience building wagons that could plow through even the thickest mud thaws early this year ivan kuchkov thought more freezes would probably come but little by little the winter snowfall would melt and soak into the ground for the next four to six weeks nobody would go anywhere very fast no one in his right mind would order any major actions during the rasputitsa because action just bogged down in the mud the poles knew as much about the rasputitsa the mud time as their russian neighbors the germans had fought in the east last year and during the last war so they knew something ivan had heard they knew enough to steal as many panje wagons as they could anyhow their trucks got stuck in the muck just like everybody elses what the germans french and english lackeys knew kuchkovs lips skinned back from his teeth in a nasty grin he suspected the red army would teach them a few lessons he also suspected they wouldnt enjoy the instruction the few schoolmasters kuchkov had known used a switch to make sure their teaching sank in the red army had a bigger switch than even the meanest most brutal village schoolmaster and could swing it harder lieutenant obolensky squelched up kuchkov pretended not to see him it was at least possible that obolensky needed to talk to somebody else in the squad avram maybe the nervous little jew had his fingers in a million different pies ivan wouldnt have been surprised if he was nkvd but no obolensky looked around till he spotted kuchkov come here a moment sergeant he said i serve the soviet union comrade lieutenant that was never the wrong answer kuchkov added a salute the mud tried to suck off his boots as he made his way over to the junior officer when he got there he stood and waited let obolensky show his cards the lieutenant also waited but he was the one who spoke first what shape is your squad in sergeant ivan smiled to himself obolensky was an educated guy a city guyhis attitude his accent his very way of standing all said as much no way in hell he could outstubborn or outwait a man from a village where the creek was the only running water when it wasnt frozen anyhow well sir were kinda fucked we lost three guys taking that last village from those nazi dicks no ivan neither knew nor cared what was regular russian and what was mat we got one backcocksucking bullet only grazed the bitch yknow and we got a replacement but the pussys so green wed be better off without him so yeah were fucked to his surprise lieutenant obolensky smiled you sound just like every other sergeant in charge of a squad maybe the red air force isnt so different from the red army after all kuchkov was convinced the red air force was a damn sight better than the red army no one would ever have accused him of being bright but he had enough animal cunning to know saying so would only get him in deeper deeper in what he didnt know that either and he wasnt interested in finding out he waited some more maybe obolensky would go away and pick some other squad for whatever shitty job he had in mind maybe pigs had wings not around here though the lieutenant pointed west towardno pastthe birch and pine woods over there you know the fascists are set up in the fields beyond the trees uhhuh kuchkov only nodded the germans had dug in as well as they could while the ground was frozen now they had to be shoring up their trenches with boards and sticks and twigs and straw and anything else they could grab the mud would ooze through anyway it sure did here our battalion has orders to shift them obolensky said happy fucking day sir kuchkov said the whoremongersll have machine guns set up and waiting for us german machine guns scared the piss out of him and he wasnt ashamed to admit it we have orders obolensky repeated in a voice like doom this company is on the right wing i am going to place your squad as the last feather on the wing you will try to outflank the nazi position and roll it up what with one little pissdribble of a squad ivan burst out obolensky just looked at him he made himself nod and salute sometimes you got stuck with it and things could have been worse hed feared the lieutenant would send his squad in ahead of everybody else if that wasnt suicide then this might be he gave his men the news oh boy avram said and then gevalt talking like a german was liable to get him killed but sometimes he did it anyway he took off his submachine guns drum magazine and started cleaning the works anything he could keep from going wrong he would the trouble was you couldnt keep everything from going wrong they sneaked through the woods during the night as black began to yield to gray ivan and everybody else gulped a hundred grams of vodka it made him fierce it also made him even more whatthefuck than he had been before there was supposed to be an artillery barrage before the attack went in red army artillery was usually reliable not today a few mortar rounds woke up the fritzes without hurting them much they started yelling a machine gun and a few rifles fired at nothing gevalt avram said again kuchkovs mouth was dry the nazis would be waiting now no chance in hell to catch them by surprise kilometers back of the line some fat russian colonel was probably eating out his secretarys twat instead of telling the s to get busy no help for it yelling urra the battalion burst out of the woods and rushed the german trenches some men wore snow smocks some didnt some smocks were clean and white some werent with slushy snow dappling the mud the mixture camouflaged the russians as well as any more rigid scheme would have the germans opened up on them of course facing machinegun fire camouflage hardly mattered either a bullet got you or it didnt all luck either way something tugged at kuchkovs left sleeve when he looked down he found the leather of his flying suit had a new rip but he didnt hurt and he wasnt bleeding so he ran on a potatomasher grenade flew out of the forwardmost german trench and then another one ivan dove for the mud his tunic would never camouflage him against snow again but all the fragments went over him and none into him he yanked the pin from his own egg grenade and chucked it at the germans from his knees then he scrambled up and dashed forward again despite the grenade a german in a whitewashed helmet popped up and fired a mauser at him from pointblank range as often happened in the rage and terror of combat the fritz missed kuchkov gave him a burst from the ppd before he could work the bolt for his next shot it was like spraying a hoseyou didnt have to be a sniper to get two or three hits the german toppled with a groan his tunic front all over blood come on ivan yelled to his men still on their feet lets clean out these motherfucking cunts he jumped down into the zigzagging nazi trench grenades and submachine guns were the right tools for the job a german dropped his rifle and threw up his hands kamerad he squealed terror on his face kuchkov gave him a burst too considering what happened to prisoners he might have done the fellow a favor chances were he would have shot him anyway though the fritzes had been thinner on the ground than he expected they pulled back in good order what was left of the red army battalion began looting the corpses left behind in their trenches the russians had taken a devil of a lot of casualties themselves to win this hectare of blood and mud was it worth them kuchkov had no idea he was busy spreading meat paste from a dead germans tinfoil tube onto a chunk of black bread if the bastards eat like this all the time no wonder theyre so fucking tough he thought and squeezed the tube for more when samuel goldman came home from his laborers job unusual excitement lit his graystubbled face no one in germany had enough soap and jews rations were smaller than aryans he didnt shave very often whats up father sarah asked something isi can see it in your eyes youre right he said theyve finally gone and arrested the bishop of munster the gestapo took him away in an armored car oh oh my sarah said hes been asking for it hasnt he just a little bit father answered i knew himnot well but i knew himback in the days when knowing a jew didnt destroy someones reputation clemens august von galen is a proud stiffnecked man with a name like that hes an aristocrat too sarah said right again her father agreed hes not the kind to be happy when a jumpedup shoe salesman or whatever tells him what to do you can hear that in every sermon he preacheswell every sermon that doesnt have to do with foreign policy i mean sarah nodded hardly a german had ever had a good word to say for the vengeful treaty of versailles she hadnt herself back when she was a kid before the nazis took over yes shed partly been parroting her parents but even so maybe bishop von galen could forgive the war which was designed not least to give germany her proper place once more but he couldnt forgive the nazis for confiscating church buildings for expelling members of religious orders from the reich or for their program of what they called mercy killings he said so loudly from the pulpit after raf planes bombed munster he delivered a sermon on loving ones enemies not a word of that of course got into the local newspapers radio broadcasts kept quiet about it too the regime controlled every official news source it got around all the same people who heard bishop von galen speak spread word of what he said people who heard them spread it wider everyone in town knew the bishop and the nazis were on a collision course what will happen now sarah asked theyll keep him in jail or else theyll kill him father said i dont think theyll kill him right away they have other ways to put the screws to him he has a brotherfranz i think his name is the gestapo s already grabbed other priests from the diocese did they hope bishop von galen would take a hint sarah inquired samuel goldman beamed at her he might be tired but he was also proud how did you get so grownup when i wasnt looking he said sarah made a rude noise her father laughed but went on yes im sure they did hope hed do that but if he were the kind of man who took those hints he wouldnt be the kind of man who preached those sermons that made sense to sarah father usually made sense to her except for his hopeless unrequited love affair with being a real german she found the only question she could think of that really mattered what happens next do people let the nazis get away with it i dont know i dont think anyone else does either he said slowly but ill tell you this we heard theyd arrested von galen about an hour before quitting time and the whole labor gang was furious not just catholics everyone the men were cussing out the gestapo like you wouldnt believe when i was walking homejews couldnt use buses or tramsi heard more people up in arms about it too what will they do rally in front of the rathaus sarah laughed at the idea that would just give the blackshirts the chance to arrest all of them at once you might be surprised her father said the catholic church still has some clout and its always been more leery of the nazis than most protestant churches were no german christians among the catholics or not many anyhow he screwed up his face so did sarah socalled german christians believed nazi ideals were compatible with those of jesus as far as she could see that was well on the way toward being like the red queen in alice in wonderland who made a habit of believing two impossible things every day before breakfast but german christians dominated most protestant denominations these days didnt you also believe in impossibilities if you thought you could tell the nazis no and get away with it wheres your mother samuel goldman asked now ill have to tell the story twice shes out shopping sarahs voice was sour jews could only do it at the very end of the day when everyone else had already had the chance to pick over the little in the stores sarah added i was peeling potatoes when i heard you come in her father sighed bad food and not enough of it he flipped his hand up and down its not your fault i know its not you and mother do everything anyone could with what the reich lets us have thats not enough either if it were the reich wouldnt let us have it father said he paused then sarah could read his mind he was looking for the bestor worstway to make a pun about how the reich really wanted to let them have it he did things like that but before he could this time the front door opened behind him he looked absurdly affronted as he half turned on his good leg as if mother had squashed his line on purpose hanna goldman hadnt of course her little twowheeled collapsible wire shopping cart was almost as empty as it had been when she set out some sorry turnips some insectnibbled greens that kind of stuff might have done for fattening hogs people just got thinner on it as sarah had sad reason to know but mothers jadegreen eyes snapped with excitement theyve arrested bishop von galen she exclaimed we knew that by the deflationary way father said it he was miffed he hadnt got to make his horrible pun mother refused to be deflated did you know theres a great big crowd out in front of the cathedral did you know theyre yelling at the police and the blackshirts and throwing things at them too der herr gott im himmel father burst out sarah felt the same way germans mostly didnt do such things shed heard that when machine guns opened up on demonstrators in the mad berlin of the crowd fled across a park to escape the deadly firebut people obeyed the keep off the grass signs while they ran for their lives its true i saw the edges of it i got away from there as fast as i could afterward mother said i didnt want to wait till the blackshirts started shootingand i didnt want to give them any reason to arrest a jew either if each of us would have tried to take one of those pigdogs with him when they came for him for a moment father looked and sounded young and ferocious the way he would have in the trenches in the last war but then he sighed and shook his head and went back to his familiar self the nazis wouldnt care theyd thank us for handing them an excuse to murder us all they cant murder everyone out by the cathedral mother said distant gunfire seemed to give her the lie even more faintly sarah heard screams and shrieks and shouts she supposed theyd been going on before but she hadnt been able to make them out she could now people made more noise when bullets snarled pastor when they struck home theyll blame the communists for this father predicted there arent many catholic communists sarah pointed out they wont care samuel goldman said outside agitators theyll call them and theyll say von galen was working with them he spread his callused hands i mean otherwise theyd have to blame themselves and what are the odds of that chapter coming back into port should have been a relief for julius lemp and the rest of the us crew most of the time it was coming back meant theyd made it through another patrol raf bombs wouldnt sink them russian shells wouldnt tear through the uboats thin steel hide and send it to the bottom slowcrawling crabs wouldnt pick out lemps bulging dead eyes with their claws this time the men could shave their beards they could take proper showers they could eat food that didnt come out of tins they could go into town and drink and pick up barmaids and brawl they could walk off by themselves without someone else always at their elbow or they could lie on real mattresses and sleep and sleep it was wonderful most of the time every once in a while politics got in the way and politics in the reich turned bloody in a hurry theyd just come back in to wilhelmshaven when the generals tried to topple the fuhrer you didnt want to hear machinegun fire at the edge of the base especially when you werent sure who was shooting at whom or why now they were in kielat the edge of the baltic rather than the north seaand politics was rearing its ugly head again everyone should have been proud of them for sinking the destroyer and two soviet freighters on their latest patrol if lemps superiors were they had a gift for hiding their enthusiasm ja ja well done i am sure said the graying kapitan zur see who heard lemps first report the bare bulb above the senior officers desk gleamed off the four gold stripes on his cuffs he scribbled a note or two but only a note or two no doubt your log gives the full details if he wasnt a distracted man lemp had never seen one yes sir he said the captain looked up and seemed surprised to find him still there do you require something else uh lemp he had to remind himself who the squirt in front of him was considering some of the things that had happened to lemp he didnt know whether to be relieved or alarmedfor better and for worse he hadnt had the kind of career that lent itself to obscurity require no sir of course not sir lemp lied with great sincerity as a junior sometimes had to do with a superior but if its not too much trouble sir i would like to have some idea of whats going on he might have stuck the kapitan zur see with a pin what makes you think anything out of the ordinary is going on the older man demanded lemp didnt answer he didnt think that needed an answer the fourstripers sigh said he really didnt either he lit a cigarette it was only stalling and he and lemp both knew it his sigh sent a stream of smoke up toward the lightbulb tell me lempwhat is your religion my religion sir the uboat skipper would have been more surprised had the captain asked him which position he most fancied in bed but not much more surprised im a lutheran sir but i havent been to church in a while the senior officer blew out more smoke this time in obvious relief well i could say the same thing as a matter of fact i did say the same thing to my own superiors the other day lemp had to remind himself that even an exalted kapitan zur see had men to whom he needed to answer why on earth did they ask you sir he said in lieu of why on earth are you asking me a brief spark in the captains gray eyes said he also heard the question behind the question there are certain advantages to being away at sea tending to the reich s business he replied you wont have heard that the catholics are mm well some of them are mm unhappy about the way things are going sir lemp said this time in lieu of what the devil are you talking about its the bishop of munsters fault the fourstriper said he sounded like a man trying to convince himself or that could have been lemps imagination but he didnt think so the answer also explained next to nothing the kapitan zur see must have realized as much he stubbed out the cigarette with a quick savage motion he spoke out against the fuhrer s policy from the pulpit repeatedly and so the security services decided they had no choice but to take him into custody i see lemp said slowly you needed nerve to do something like that you needed to have your head examined was what you really needed there are demonstrations of unhappiness about this here and there in the vaterland the kapitan zur see said this is why i asked you you understand aber naturlich lemp said which seemed safe enough demonstrations of unhappiness what was going on in germany was the whole country bubbling like a pot of stew forgotten on the stove he wouldnt have been surprised you couldnt just go arresting bishops these werent the middle ages after all but the blackshirts didnt seem to care they were hitlers hounds do something they didnt like and theyd bite so thats where we are thats why passes into town are limited the kapitan zur see said schleswigholstein had been danish till a lifetime before and was solidly lutheran even so the less trouble we stir up the better for everyone the men wont like being restricted to base sir lemp said as the other officer had to know that was an understatement yes and so the kapitan zur see sent him a hooded look they arent the only crew here you know jawohl mein herr lemp knew a losing fight when he saw one ill tell them what they need to understand he rose saluted and got out of the fourstripers office as fast as he could by the time he returned to the barracks the us crew had already found that next to none of them would be able to go into town they werent happy about it which was putting things mildly what the shitheads dont think we deserve to blow off steam they can blow it out their assholes is what they can do that was paul the helmsmana chief petty officer and as steady a man as lemp had ever known if he was within shouting distance of mutiny the rest of the submariners had to be even closer lemp spread his hands in what looked like apology even though uboat skippers werent in the habit of apologizing to their men theres nothing i can do about it friends he said its politics is what it is he summarized what the kapitan zur see had told him he wouldnt have been surprised if the senior officer didnt want ratings to know such things well too damn bad for him if he didnt some of the sailors naturally were catholics some were convinced nazis the largest number cared little for religion or politics so this bullshit is whats keeping us confined to base one of them said thats nothing but quatsch if we want to get into fights weve got better things to brawl about than some stupid loudmouthed bishop do we another sailor said the government shouldnt tell us how to be religious they fought wars about that back in the old days a bishops got no business telling government what to do either the first man retorted they fought wars about that in the old days too by the way the two ratings glared at each other they were both ready to square off on the spot by the way their friends shifted toward one or the other everybody knew which side of the fence he stood on that will be enough of that lemp said sternly as you were all of you for a bad couple of seconds he didnt think theyd listen to him that was the worst feeling an officer could get obedience sprang from consent no matter how much the military tried to conceal that when men stopped listening to their leaders you got the end of all over again no german in his right mind wanted to repeat that long fall into chaos but then one of the ratings said ah fuck it its got nothing to do with crewmates after a moment the other man nodded tension left the barracks hall like water leaving a dive chamber when a uboat surfaced the rating went on if we cant go into town the least they could do would be to bring some broads onto the base and set up a brothel here all the sailors nodded in unison to that it seemed like a good idea to julius lemp too ill see what i can do he promised and headed back toward the kapitan zur see s office a few girls even homely ones who smelled of onions would go a long way toward making sure the men remembered what they were supposed to be doing and why theyd also go a long way toward making sure the men remembered their superiors cared about them and that would help them remember what they should be doing and why too some of the streets in bialystok had trees growing alongside them the locals bragged about their treelined boulevards and said they made bialystok just like paris only a bunch of provincial poles and jews could imagine that a polish provincial town was anything like paris but try and tell them that hansulrich rudel didnt for one thing life was too short for another hed never been to paris himself hed bombed the place when the wehrmacht fought its way to the suburbs but that wasnt the same thing hed promised himself leave in the french capital after it fell but it didnt so here he was two years later on leave in bialystok instead at the moment the trees were barebranched even skeletal but the leaf buds were starting to swell spring was on the way before long bialystok would be green again even if not parisian signs on shops and eateries were in incomprehensible polish and just as incomprehensible yiddish the one had the right alphabet but alien words the other pretty much familiar words in an alien script both added up to gibberish for him but hed come here before often enough to know where he was going from the train station if he had got lost spoken yiddish made far more sense to him than the written kind and bialystok was full of jews he could have asked one of them these days the town also had its share of chain dogsgerman feldgendarmerie their gorgets of office hung around their necks from chains he was glad he didnt need to talk to them the less he had to do with them the better a drunk pole reeled out of a tavern that would have been a cliche except the pole in a uniform of dark greenish khaki was arm in arm with an equally plastered german in feldgrau they were both murdering the same tune each in his own language drunken germans werent such a cliche which didnt mean hansulrich hadnt seen his share of them and then some as a matter of fact he was heading for a tavern himself though not this one another block up from the station half a block over he nodded to himself he recognized the polish sign out front even if it made no sense to him he walked in the place smelled of tobacco and sweat and beer and fried foodand stale piss from the jakes out back poles and germans drank together here too so did jews and germans which would have been unimaginable back in the reich the poles didnt like their jews but they didnt hit them with the same legal restrictions the germans did maybe they couldnt one person in ten in poland was a jew only one in a hundred in germany wehrmacht personnel here had orders to conform to local customs and laws a short swarthy barmaid sidled up to hansulrich she spoke in throaty yiddish you may as well sit down not that the bossll make a zloty off you if you keep on drinking tea hello sofia wont you at least tell me youre glad to see me rudel didnt grab her or kiss her in public she didnt like that did she go with other men while he was in the east fighting the war if she did hed never heard about it the way things were these days that would do im at least glad to see you she answered deadpan she wasnt exactly a jew she had a polish father which in the reich s classification scheme made her a mischling first class but she thought of herself as jewish and she was snippy like a jew back in germany hansulrich would have endangered his career by having anything to do with her he could get away with it herecould and did she took him to a corner and brought him a glass of tea she found his teetotaling as funny as most of his service comrades did she was also as nervous about seeing a germanand a nazi party member at thatas he was about going with a jewess in bed everything was fine the rest of the time hansulrich sometimes thought they came from different planets not just different countries sofia was well informed about his planet though along with the sweet milkless tea she gave him a mocking grin so even the catholics in germany say hitler cant get away with some of the stuff hes trying to pull she said as a lutheran ministers son his opinion of catholics had never been high a lot of that is just enemy propaganda he said none of it had come over the german radio or appeared in any army or luftwaffe newspaper that didnt mean he hadnt heard a few things or more than a few it did mean he wasnt obliged to believe themnot officially and not when sofia tried to rub his nose in them she quirked a dark eyebrow well if you say so she answered which meant she wasnt obliged to believe him either she went on the big switch was good for something anyhow i got a card from my mother the other day from palestine while england and germany were at war mail from palestinea british league of nations mandatedidnt travel to poland because it was friendly to germany now that england had joined the crusade against bolshevism things moved more freely theres rather more to it than that you know he said stiffly he often was more literalminded than might have been good for him sofia enjoyed getting under his skin as if having a mother who felt strongly enough about being jewish to go to palestine after the pole shed married a drunkard if you listened to sofia walked out werent enough if you say so sofia repeated big thingslike who would win the warmeant little to her or if they did she wouldnt let on a small thinglike getting a card from her mother after a long silencecounted for more i think youre trying to drive me crazy hansulrich said it would be a short drive she retorted which made him regretnot for the first timegetting into a battle of words with her he was a good flyer not such a great talker but everybody knew jews were born talking and in that sofia took after her mother rudel assumed as much anyhow without even thinking about it he tried to change the subject what time do you get off today why what have you got in mind she didnt just answer a question with another question she answered one with two whatever you want of course hansulrich said bialystoks nightlife consisted of a few movie houses a dance hall or two and a yiddish theater even with trees lining the streets paris it was not sofia laughed raucously whatever you want you mean and what else does a man ever want rudels ears heated well what if i do if i didnt youd think i was sleeping with somebody else and youd give me trouble on account of that i wouldnt give you trouble id drop you like a grenade noid throw you like a grenade she cocked her head to one side you mean you dont visit the officers whorehouse im sure theyve set one up somewhere not far from you they always do things like that dont they as a matter of fact they did an officers brotheland one for other ranksoperated in a village a couple of kilometers from the airstrip hansulrich knew sergeant dieselhorst had visited the one for enlisted men he hadnt called at the officers establishment that gave his fellow flyers one more reason to think he was strange though they knew about sofia and didnt think he was a fairy the girls there would just be doing it because they were doing it he said slowly trying to put what he thought into words they wouldnt be doing it because they wanted to do it with me and i do he waited for the barmaids jeers rather to his surprise it didnt come she eyed him as if she were seeing him for the first time that matters to you yes it matters to me he was in his midtwenties he often risked his life several times a day he gave sofia a crooked grin well most of the time anyhow he wondered if shed get mad instead he startled a laugh out of her youd better watch yourself if you arent careful youll make me think youre honest hansulrich prided himself on his honestyhe was a pastors son he started to get angry then realized she was teasing him you he said more or less fondly she grinned at him altogether unrepentant did you expect anything different before he could answer the soldiers at another table yelled for her to fetch them another round of drinks she fluttered her fingers at him and hurried away hansulrich realized she never had told him when she got off how much tea would he soak up before she finally did he wasnt even that fond of tea but he was fond of sofia and so he waited and ordered glass after glass alistair walshs principal use to the conservative conspirators against sir horace wilsons alliance with the reich was that he knew soldiers some of them had put on the uniform after the nazis invaded czechoslovakia but hed worn it for more than twenty yearsfor his whole adult life till his political unreliability led him to resign from the service and led the army to accept his resignation so he knew soldiers in ways the toffs didnt and he also knew soldiersliterally at one time or another between the wars hed served under most of englands prominent and highranking officers senior officers tended to remember senior noncoms those longserving veterans were the armys backbone they counted for more in the scheme of things than lieutenants and captains and sometimes even majors because they knew all the things the junior officers were just learningand more besides especially if you listened to them and walsh could do things in an unofficial capacity that would have raised eyebrowsto say nothing of hackleshad an mp gone about them if the conspirators talked to a general for instance sir horace and his none too merry men would naturally suspect them of skullduggery the prime minister and his henchmen would be right too but if alistair walsh called on general archibald wavellwell so what he was only an outtopasture underofficer for all scotland yard could prove he was asking for a job or maybe a loan that was also true for all general wavell knew he might not have had any idea of the company walsh was keeping these days he did know who walsh was though and did agree to meet him at general staff headquarters in baggy civilian tweeds walsh felt dreadfully out of place in that sanctum of creased khaki gleaming brass tunic buttons shoulder straps and swarms of the red collar tabs that showed officers of colonels rank and above in uniform himself he would have had to salute till his shoulder ached as things were his arm kept twitching as he fought down the conditioned reflex again and again wavell was an erect thinfaced man in his early fifties i can give you fifteen minutes walsh he said as he closed his office door to let them talk privately scotland yard might be able to plant microphones in many different places walsh judged but not here thank you sir the exserviceman said i appreciate it and so do my friends one of wavells bushy eyebrows rose an eighth of an inch your friends he let the word hang in the air by the look on his face he might have taken a bite of fish that was slightly off yes sir walsh said stolidly you may or may not have heard i was the bloke who had the bad luck to bring in rudolf hess after he parachuted from his messerschmitt were you now the generals gaze sharpened yes thats right you were i remember seeing the report now you remind me of it and so and so i wish id had a pistol with me and plugged him instead walsh answered then maybe we wouldnt be in bed with hitler now my friendshe deliberately reused the wordstill wish we werent wavell snorted they arent the only ones im sure but he checked himself its up to the politicians to set policy of course the militarys here to back their play when the usual peacetime methods fail invading russia sir walsh said isnt that going a bit far if your friends are of the pink persuasion walsh i dont think we have much more to say to each other twenty degrees of frost crisped up wavells voice theyre tories almost to a man churchill was one of them till he met that bentley walsh replied winston churchill hated the idea of helping hitler not that neville chamberlain cared a farthing what churchill thought people still wondered whether the rich young man behind the wheel of the auto that ran churchill down was truly as drunk as the bobbies claimed that was a bad business wavell said quietly so he might have been one of those wondering people he studied walsh so youre in with that lot are you no theyre not pinks no doubt of that i am sir it seems the best way to honor churchills memoryand to my mind he was dead right about the nazis walsh hadnt used the phrase with malice aforethought but he quite fancied it once it was out of his mouth dead right he repeated i cant imagine what you or your friends expect me to do about it though wavell said this isnt argentina or brazil or one of those places the army doesnt interfere in politics here it would be unthinkable walsh just sat there and waited if general wavell was talking about it he was thinking about it what he was thinking about it walsh would discover in due course the general glanced at his wristwatch well he said with forced briskness im afraid ive given you all the time i can spare at present there is a war on you know and someone does have to run it or at any rate to try certainly sir walsh got to his feet is there anything youd particularly like me to tell my friends tell them tell them they dont know what theyre playing at dammit i think they do sir i think its the prime minister and his lot whove gone off the rails not these other fellows you can say that youve taken off the uniform no i dont hold it against youno denying you had your reasons wavell said but i still wear it if i were to speak in the same fashion or to act in addition to speaking it would be treason nothing less general i dont know anything about that said walsh who knew far more about it than hed dreamt he would before he watched that lone parachutist descend on the scottish field taking a deep breath he continued i do know we cant go on the way were going it would ruin the country forever anything would be better anything at all or do you think im wrong i think wavell broke off shaking his head like a horse pestered by gnats i think youd best go walsh is what i think and deliver my message to your associates walsh did at a pub not far from parliament they kept no favorite table that would have made it too easy for scotland yard or perhaps the pms less savory associates to arrange to listen in walsh didnt think they could bug every table in the place the noise from the rest of the crowdmore politicos solicitors newspapermen and other such riffraffdrowned out the conspirators conversations he hoped like blazes it did anyhow ronald cartland slammed his pint mug down on the tabletop in disgust when walsh finished it wasnt empty some best bitter slashed out good lord the mp exclaimed the man has no more spine than an eclair one of you walsh is worth a thousand of him cartland had volunteered for service when the war broke out and fought in france as a subaltern that to walshs mind gave his opinions weight and made his praise doubly warming but walsh thought his dismissal of general wavell was premature i dont know about that sir he said he didnt have the military police arrest me for treason the way he might have done he didnt even chuck me out of his office he listened to me he may not be ready to move yet but he doesnt half fancy the way things are heading who in his right mind would said bobbity cranford another leader of the antialliance crowd but if he listened to you old man hed better watch out for bentleys the next time he crosses the road that produced a considerable silence around the table walsh broke it by loudly calling to a barmaid to fill up his pint again he needed the fresh mug cranford had reminded him they werent playing a game here nor was the government if it felt itself seriously threatened it would lash out anyone who didnt believe that had only to remember winston churchill luc harcourt unslung his rifle and carried it instead of leaving it on his shoulder his regiment was heading up to the front again and he wanted to be ready if they ran into any russians besides fronts here were far more porous than theyd been in france some enemy soldiers were bound to have leaked through what was supposed to be the line his boots squelched as he tramped up the road but only a little the mud didnt try to pull off his footgear as it would have a couple of weeks earlier pretty soon both sides would be able to start moving again there were prospects luc relished more up ahead lieutenant demange was singing obscene lyrics to the tune of a peasant song about spring luc had known demange since before the shooting started not many others from the old company survived and even fewer in one piece knowing demange as he did luc also knew those foul verses were a way for the reluctantly promoted officer to hide his own nerves about what lay ahead anyone who didnt know demange so well would assume he owned no nerves luc had for a long time but underneath the chromesteel salaud lay a human being a nasty human being but even so luc thought one thing demange didnt believe in was taking needless chances a soldier had to take too many that were necessary he carried a rifle instead of the more usual and less useful officers pistol and he carried it like luc he was ready for anything and things needed to be ready for him halt who goes there a sentry called in nervous germanaccented french give the countersign your mother on a pogo stick demange snarled he might be here but he still despised the boches questceque vous dites the sentry said a reasonable enough question he added give the countersign or i fire demange did which confirmed lucs thought about not taking chances he didnt have to the german passed him and the men he led well why not they were doing some of hitlers work so the rest of the fritzes wouldnt have to the trench system was well enough organized and shored up to show the lines hadnt moved much for a while what with the way russia turned to mud soup as the snow melted the lines couldnt very well move which didnt mean the reds were asleep behind their rusting barbed wire the regiment hadnt been in place for half an hour before an ivan with a megaphone shouted at them in much better french than the german sentry spoke here they are againcolonel eluards little darlings how did the bastard know luc wouldnt have thought any of the handful of russian peasants hed seen had paid the least attention to the frenchmen tramping up to the front he really wouldnt have thought they could tell one regiment from another and he really wouldnt have thought that even if they could theyd be able to pass the word on to their countrymen so fast that only went to show how much he knew with noxious good cheer the frenchspeaking russian went on now that youre back we should welcome you the way you deserve jump for the bombproofs boys demange shouted a good twenty seconds before mortar bombs started raining down on the trenches his instincts saved lives luc had already curled up in a place where fragments couldnt get him when the shooting started but not everybody was so lucky machine guns and german artillery kept the russians at bay stretcherbearers hauled off the wounded frenchmen those fucking stovepipes are bad news demange said lighting one more in his endless chain of gitanes how did the russians know who we were luc asked how doesnt matter but they knew all right that jeering prick he sounded just like a captain i served under in the last war that asshole stopped a or maybe it was a with his face hardly enough left of him to bury i hope the same thing happens to this son of a bitch too he was just the mouthpiece luc said its the ones who told him what to say who need killing they all need killing demange said and they think we all need killing and if everybody gets his way nobodyll be left when this stupid wars done and you know what the worldll be a better place after that for a little while till the cats or the rats learn how to lie heh luc said uneasily not at all sure the older man was kidding he decided to change the subject what are we going to do now i dont know about you but im going to shore up these works the best way i know how demange stopped an evil smile lighting up his face he shook his head no fuck that im an officer now right im going to have a bunch of sorryass privates shore this shit up for me sounds good lieutenant luc grinned with a sergeants hash marks on his sleeve he wouldnt have to thicken up the calluses on his palm with an entrenching tool so much either and then demange went on and then what im going to do is sit right here on my ass and not move a centimeter forward till some cocksucker in a fancy kepi makes me do it that sounds good too luc agreed but what about the crusade against bolshevism what afuckingbout it demange retorted im here arent i youre here arent you as much as youre ever anywhere i mean i love you too sir luc put in demange ignored him not for the first time and no doubt not for the last the veteran went on weve both shot russians if they come at us againno when they dowell shoot some more of them so they dont shoot us ill do whatever ive got to do to stay alive but if you think im enough of a jackass to give a fart about any of that political horseshit youre even dumber than i give you credit for mmp luc left that right there he looked up and down the trenches no one was paying special attention to him and demange except perhaps to see what kind of nasty orders the lieutenant and sergeant doled out next and whod get stuck with them lowering his voice luc continued some of the guys in the ranks are still reds you know they didnt come close to weeding all of em out before they sent us east oh sure lieutenant demange nodded but so what most of emll shoot ivans to keep from getting killed themselves and thats all theyve really got to do a few of emll desert a few of them have already deserted luc pointed out uhhuh demange nodded again and you know what i bet the fucking russians ate em without salt were only here because daladiers got his head up his ass those miserable russkis theyre here on account of the nazis and poles and us were in their country it makes all the fucking difference in the world even a sorry turd like you didnt fight too bad when the fritzes invaded france thats the nicest thing you ever said about me luc tried to sound sarcastic he did less well than he would have liked mostly because he meant it that was about the nicest thing demange had ever said about him yeah well you didnt know your ass from your elbow when you started out but you were luckier than most of the other poor stupid new fish the nazis didnt nail you or blow you up right away so you got the chance to learn demange said by now you know what youre doing one more time youd be even dumber than i figure you for if you didnt thanks a bunch luc said deflated hed been cut and scratched and bruised but he never did get badly hurt was that all it took to make a good soldier staying in one piece long enough to learn the ropes the more he thought about it the likelier it seemed even a good soldier though had to stay lucky all the time things had to keep missing him superiors had to steer clear of idiotic orders that put him in a place where things couldnt help hitting otherwise hed go down and thrash and scream just as loud as any clodhopper fresh out of training he knew that too chapter colonel otto griehl commanded the panzer regiment of which theo hossbach was a small and none too vital part theo didnt think the regimental commander was such a bad guy had the colonel known as much that doubtless would have warmed the cockles of his heart whatever the hell those were but even if griehl wasnt such a bad guy he did like to hear himself talk men weve been stuck in the mud too damn long he declared to the troopers in black coveralls with the silver panzer totenkopf on their collar patches now we can move around again so were going to go out and give the ivans whatfor some of the assembled panzer troopers clapped their hands adi stoss leaned close to theo and muttered whos this we he keeps going on about him and his tapeworm theo snickered he might not think griehl was a bad guy but that didnt mean he took authority any more seriously than he had to contemplating the exalted colonels equally exalted tapeworm was as good a cure for that as he could imagine and better than most hermann witt clucked in reproofmild reproof but reproof even so griehl comes forward with the rest of us he said ja ja adi said theo nodded it was true enough in a panzer regiment company commanders and the regimental co did lead machines of their own and did advance withsometimes ahead ofeverybody else they didnt inflict their wisdom on the troops from kilometers behind the line the way highranking officers had in the last war well witt was a sergeant himself and a panzer commander being a smallscale leader had to give him more sympathy for the worries of a largescale one theo had no urge to tell anybody else what to do he also had no desire whatsoever to have other people tell him what to do he wasnt an ideal fit for the wehrmacht then ideal fit or not here he was he glanced over at adalbert stoss adi wasnt such a great fit either he might not mind giving other people orders but he was even less thrilled about taking them than theo to theo other people were equals and equals had no business telling other equals what to do as far as adi was concerned other people were idiots until they proved otherwise he wouldnt have deferred to sergeant witt if witt hadnt shown he knew what he was doing that was part of the trouble hed had with the previous panzer commander the rest of that trouble though had been more on the order of two rams banging heads in the springtime heinz naumann wouldnt do any more headbanging he lay somewhere to the west under a cross unless the russians had desecrated his grave woolgathering meant theod missed some of the colonels harangue he wouldnt lose any sleep over that as he started paying attention again griehl was saying will surround smolensk in a ring of steel and fire along with our brave allies well smash the russians inside that ring he got some more applause theo marveled that he could talk like that with a straight face the english and french were here but didnt want to be the poles were more enthusiastic but short of everything bigger than a machine gun the less said about the magyars and the slovaks the better anyway they were farther south theo didnt know what to think of the romanians but the way theyd gone bellyup in the last war didnt make him figure stalins teeth were chattering i know youll serve the reich well i know youll serve the volk well and i know youll serve the fuhrer well colonel griehls arm shot up and out in the party salute heil hitler heil hitler the panzer men echoed the shout and the salute since the failed putsch against the fuhrer it was supposed to have replaced the traditional military salute and so it hadwhere anyone you didnt trust could see you saluting theo muttered something wordless to himself what was one more mask among the many he already wore he scrambled up into his familiar place behind the panzer iis turret away from the world and its caresexcept of course when it started screaming at him through the radio earphones the fighting compartment smelled of metal and leather and sweat and exhaust and smokeless powder it smelled like home to theo even if home was thinly armored too lightly armed and rapidly becoming obsolete from the turret witt said one of these days before too long well get ourselves a panzer iii instead god i hope so adi stoss exclaimed as he started the engine theo wasnt so sure he did yes a panzer iii had thicker armor a better cannon and a bow machine gun to go with the one in the turret but it also had a loader and a gunner in the turret along with the commander the radioman handled that bow gun was getting to know two new people scarier than attacking the ivans in this old crate to theo that seemed too close to call they didnt have the new panzer yet no matter what sergeant witt said reports that theyd get one soon were only scuttlebutt with a good crewwhich this machine did havea panzer ii could still do the job stoss put the beast in gear they not only could do the job they damn well had to witt rode with his head and shoulders out of the turret any panzer commander would do that when he wasnt in combat you could see a lot more that way unlike the iii and some french and english machines the panzer ii had only a hatch not a cupola there was talk that new iis would come with them but that didnt do this one any good a good panzer commander would stay headandshoulders out of the machine even in action the vision ports in the turret just werent an adequate substitute witt did heinz naumann had too that was how hed stopped something no one could fault naumanns guts not even adi whod hated them there are some frenchmen adi said over the maybach engines rattling growl and the squeak and clank of the caterpillar treads theyre by the side of the road trying to get their trucks going again surprise sour amusement filled hermann witts voice russian roads went from bad to worse road maps showed as paved were either rutted dirt tracks or more often not there at all theo didnt know whod made the maps some fool who believed soviet propaganda probably he did know that western european softskinned vehicles made to run on asphalt or concrete fell to pieces trying to deal with russian potholes and mud and engineabrading dust german trucks broke down as fast as their french and english counterparts in spite of his earphones theo started hearing gunfire the ivans knew when things could get rolling they did what they could to stop their foes from pushing deeper into russia witt ducked into the turret but only to grab his schmeisser then he popped up again like a jackinthebox infantry reporting enemy panzers in the woods ahead someone said on the radio theo relayed the message to sergeant witt oh they are are they now witt sounded almost gay well thats what were here for right theo didnt answer he had no idea why he was here he only knew he was and that he wanted to go on being here philosophy in the back of a panzer witt would never understand then half a dozen people started screeching in theos earphones at the same time oh my god hermann witt exclaimed while adi stoss yelled what a fucking monster one of the people on the radio said something about the biggest panzer hed ever seen so theo decided it wasnt king kong coming out of the woods after all which didnt mean it wasnt dangerous witt fired several mm rounds at the russian machine he slapped in another tenround clip and fired some more they just bounce off he said in horror beauty wouldnt kill the red beast and maybe nothing else would either witt came out with something even more horrifiedand horrifying dodge like hell adi hes aiming at us adi did his best to comply russian panzer gunners were often lousy especially against moving targets often but not always wham clanng the hit almost threw theo out of his seat the round didnt get through into the fighting compartment but the panzer ii slewed sideways and stopped out out fast adi shouted he knocked a track off if he hits us again he didnt go on or need to theo grabbed his schmeisser and bailed out the other two panzer crewmen left through his hatch which exposed them to less enemy fire than their own they huddled in the lee of the disabled panzer i dont know about you guys but i feel like a deshelled snail adi said theo nodded he did too he peered around the damaged panzer ii he wanted a glimpse of the machine that did the dirty work it was a monster it seemed twice the size of the light german panzer and mounted a gun that looked like a piece of field artillery the cannon belched flame wham clanng another panzer ii exploded into fire that crew had no prayer of getting away theo shuddered roasting inside your shell was even worse than coming out of it moscow speaking by the selfimportant way the words came out of the radio the whole city might have been talking through the speaker not just an announcer holed up in a studio somewhere or so it seemed to anastas mouradian anyhow he didnt share the conceit with his fellow flyers they already thought he was strange he didnt want to give them any more reasons red army forces have struck more and more heavy blows against the fascist and reactionary invaders west and south of smolensk the newsreader went on the enemys tanks continue to show themselves unable to face in the field the latest products of soviet engineering radio moscow gave forth with great steaming piles of propaganda anyone with an ear to hearwhich mouradian certainly ownedknew that here though as best he could tell the announcer meant every word the new heavy tanks named for general kliment voroshilov were bigger and tougher than anything the nazis or their friends built facing panzer iiseven panzer iiisa kv was like a bear against a pack of yapping dogs but the kvs came in evergrowing packs too farther south the radio newsman went on the soldiers of the glorious red army are being welcomed as liberators in bessarabia which the romanians stole while reactionary forces attempted to strangle the infant soviet union in its cradle that sounded impressive mouradian wasnt old enough to remember much about the russian revolution and its aftermath he remembered that armenia had been independent for a little while and then part of a bigger transcaucasian soviet socialist republic then after the whites and their foreign allies were beaten moscow reasserted its authority over the region no he didnt remember all the political details what he mostly remembered was going hungry all the time anyone whod lived through the revolution had memories like that if you were a ukrainian you had several sets of them and you were probably lucky to be alive rumors said lots of ukrainians welcomed german and polish soldiers the way the radio reported the bessarabians were welcoming the red army the louder and more stridently radio moscow denied those rumors the more stas believed them unrest in england against the governments unnatural alliance with the hitlerite barbarians continues to grow the newsreader said police have been uncommonly brutal in suppressing demonstrations against prime minister wilson he went on to talk about everswelling soviet war production plan after plan was overfulfilled quota after quota exceeded stas wondered if he was the only flyer listening who thought about what would happen if people demonstrated against stalin in red square the nkvd which was commonly brutal would be uncommonly so for something like that would captured protesters be killed out of hand or sent to the gulags so they had more time to think about what reckless fools theyd been an interesting question either way the poor devils wouldnt like the answer there was war news in the pacific too mouradian couldnt make much of it not least because the announcer kept stumbling over unfamiliar place names he gathered that japan was advancing and everyone else falling back having served for a while in the far east mouradian knew only too well that the japanese were no bargain now the rest of the world was discovering the same thing germany and her friends were no bargain either japan could annoy and gnaw at the soviet union and had done exactly that but thousands of kilometers separated her from the ussrs vitals if hitler paraded through moscow in a mercedes could stalin keep up the fight from sverdlovsk or kuibishev or some other town on the far side of the urals mouradian had his doubts he suspected stalin did too which meant the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union would move heaven and earth to keep the nazis out of moscow and as far from the ussrs capital as he could it also meant mouradian moved through the heavens toward mogilev which had recently fallen to the invaders along with him in the pe moved a thousand kilos worth of bombs stalin wouldnt care that a stubborn armenian was flying the explosives though the explosives would matter to the director of the soviet state the squadrons target was the railroad yard maybe withdrawing soviet troops hadnt torn it up well enough maybe enemy railroad men had got it back in operation faster than the russians figured they could keeping trains from going through mogilev would help defend smolensk and smolensk was moscows most important shield fires and plumes of greasy black smoke from burning tanks marked the front between mogilev and smolensk not all the burning armor came out of enemy factories soviet light tanks were still depressingly easy to kill and even the kvs could go up in flames maybe some german panzer iii got lucky or maybe the foe had a field gun in a good place in the pes cockpit ivan kulkaanen turned to mouradian and said the stinking fascists arent having it all their own way anyhow no they arent stas agreed yes that was true but he would have felt obliged to agree even if the nazis were driving the red army back headlong disagreeing with something like that would have been defeatism england might tolerate such disagreement in wartimeor if the morning news held any truth might not the soviet union never had and never would a few antiaircraft shells burst near the formation of pes stas didnt see any planes catch fire or go down that was good news they flew on once they got past the front things quieted down it often worked out that way if the germans didnt also have plenty of antiaircraft guns in and around mogilev though stas would be happily surprised after a while he didnt just hear the engines drone it became a part of him so that his toenails his muscles his spine and his spleen all vibrated to the same rhythm the oxygenenriched air tasted of rubber and leather kulkaanen pointed through the armorglass windshield a city lay ahead unless the squadron had really buggered up its navigation that had to be mogilev theyd dive to make the attack more accurate pes werent stukas they didnt stand on their noses to deliver ordnance they could also fly rings around the clumsy german bombers but they did have dive brakes and used them on attack runs that also brought them down closer to the flak gunners on the ground stas tried not to dwell on such things as the slotted flaps lowered and grabbed air be ready he called to fyodor mechnikov back in the narrow bomb bay what the hell else am i gonna besir the bombardier answered through the speaking tube behind goggles and oxygen mask mouradian grinned sure as the devil it was almost like flying with ivan kuchkov again the germans did have guns waiting for the soviet bombers stas wished he were more astonished yes theyd protect the railroad yards and yes theyd probably got a few minutes warning unlike russians germans knew what to do with a few minutes warning too had he flown through heavier flak he supposed he must have but he couldnt remember offhand just when something tore half the left wing off the pe diving next to his the stricken bomber spun out of control the crew had no chance to bail out now stas yelled through the speaking tube as soon as the bombs fell free he leveled out and scooted away at full throttle and low altitude any messerschmitt pilot who wanted to run him down was welcome to try he turned back toward sovietheld territory the railroad yard or something in its neighborhood had taken one mighty thorough pounding of course the bombs also came down on the heads of the people who still lived in mogilev stas superiors thought theyd do more harm to the enemy than to soviet citizens he had to hope they were right spring was in the air outside madrid spring and the stink of shit and garbage and unburied bodies and the occasional bullet or shell fragment but when things started turning green when the birds came back from the south chaim weinberg was less inclined to be critical mike carroll gave him a peculiar look when he started going on about birdsong chirp chirp the other abe lincoln said hot diggety dog its pretty chaim insisted and it doesnt sound the same here as it does in the states what the fuckin birdth thpeak thpanish mike put on a sarcastic castilian lisp no but theres different ones here chaim said he was going to get pissed off if his buddy couldnt see what he saw couldnt hear what he heard he could feel it coming like a rash sparrows pigeons starlings crows stop the fucking presses call walter fucking winchell mike was tall and slim and blond and handsome none of which adjectives applied to chaim at the moment the other american was also a royal pain in the ass only reason theres pigeons and sparrowsthese kindsa sparrowsand cocksucking starlings in the usa is that theyre imports chaim said and the crows here arent the same as crows on the other side of the ocean theyve got bigger beaks and they make different noises youd notice the stupid beaks mike said your mother chaim said without heat had somebody who wasnt his friend made even an indirect crack about his own very jewish beak he would have rearranged the guys face for him from mike though hed take it hows your wife the other yank asked with a leer chaim shrugged shes back in the city doing what shes doing and im here doing what im doing that hed made it with la martellita struck him as a marvel that shed been willing to tie the knot for the sake of giving their accidental kid a last name was whatever came one step up from a marvel mike tried to pinch off a hangnail with the other hands thumb and forefinger doesnt sound like the recipe for living happily ever after yknow yeah yeah chaim would rather have talked about birds he hadnt even started in on the hoopoes aerial ballet whatll you do when she dumps you after junior comes out mike found the sixtyfour dollar question all right all chaim could do was shrug again get drunk i guess shoot some fascists what else is there to do like mike he assumed shed dump him once the baby was born he also assumed the war in spain would still be going on this fall the way things looked right now the war in spain was liable to go on forever arent you tired of going hungry over there the enormous voice came from a microphone and speaker in marshal sanjurjos lines come over to our side well give you a big bowl of mutton stew before the fascists had tempted republican soldiers with chicken stew maybe theyd hired a new chef more likely theyd just put a new liar on the payroll chaim had captured nationalist troops they were every bit as skinny and miserable as the guys on his own side baa he bleated at the propaganda message baa mike carroll joined in baa he yelled even louder than chaim baa baa mutton stew delicious mutton stew blared from the speaker baa this time half a dozen abe lincolns bleated back before long the whole stretch of republican line northwest of madrid was going baa baa baa in ragged chorus now look what you went and started mike said chaim grinned he was proud of himself marshal sanjurjos men didnt think it was funny fascists in chaims experience had all had their sense of humor surgically removed when they were very small they had nasty ways of making their unhappiness known too machine guns rattled mortar bombs whispered down even a battery of old german s well behind the line started up naturally the internationals and the czechs and the spanish republican soldiers in that stretch of the line fired back now look what you went and started mike carroll repeated this time in an altogether different tone of voice a bullet cracked not far enough above chaims head he ducked automatically the fucking battle of the mutton stew he said it was a joke and then again it wasnt bleating at the silly propaganda set off the shooting sure no matter what set it off though men on both sides were getting killed and maimed he could hear wounded men screaming all because hed decided to make a noise like a sheep he didnt want anything like that on his conscience he told himself they would have got hit anyway himself told him he was full of it himself had a point too hed been in spain a long time hed seen how random war was this guy bought a plot the day after he came into the line that guy went without a scratch for years why if it was anything more than gods crapshoot chaim couldnt imagine what and when he remembered not to he didnt even believe in god after both sides hauled their wounded away for whatever help the docs could give them the fascist announcer started going on about mutton stew again he had a script and he had his orders this stretch of line was going to get so many repetitions then hed go inflict himself somewhere else fuck you chaim screamed almost as loud without the loudspeaker as the announcer was with it if he heard about mutton stew one more time hed snap or maybe he already had fuck you up the ass fuck your mother and fuck the sheep your fucking mutton stew comes from too that produced scattered cheers from the internationals he thought the only reason it just produced scattered cheers was that they didnt want to risk starting up the firefight again and to his amazement and delight it also produced a few scattered cheers from the nationalist trenches those had to come from men sure they were off by themselves so nobody could rat on them mike heard the cheers from sanjurjos side too wow man he said you really struck a nerve there bet your ass i did chaim replied whens the last time you figure one of those poor sorry dingleberries even smelled mutton stew let alone tasted any that clown with the mike probably drives them even crazier than he drives me carroll sent him a speculative stare oh i wouldnt say that the next day brigadier kossuth summoned chaim to his headquarters behind the lines like la martellita the internationals co used a nom de guerre though he was a magyar like his namesake i hear youve been running your mouth again he said in german he was old enough to have learned it in the dead austrohungarian empire thanks to yiddish chaim could follow german afraid so he admitted cheerfully yiddish didnt faze the brigadier why he asked with a glower that would have turned a basilisk to stone but nobodys glower was going to make chaim quake in his drafty boots hed been through way too much for that because i got sick and tired of all that crap about mutton stew he said kossuth eyed him the way a chameleon eyes a fly just before its tongue flicks out are all americans as deranged as you he asked with what sounded like clinical detachment and probably masked fury some of us are even worse chaim said he wouldnt let the country down oh i doubt that kossuth knew what he was up against all right and you managed to knock up that human hand grenade too tell me if you would how does one man find so much trouble i volunteered for it chaim answered i could have stayed back in the states everyone might have been better off if you had including you kossuth said spain wouldnt pride rang in chaims voice that basiliskpetrifying glower again when chaim refused to wilt under it the magyar brigadier sighed anything is possiblebut nothing is likely he jerked a thumb toward the tent flap now get out whistling chaim got peggy druce was getting the urge to travel again after her adventures and misadventures in wartorn europe she would have bet shed be contenthell be overjoyedto stay in philadelphia the rest of her days but things didnt work out like that after so long living by her wits and by what she could browbeat out of unhappy officials ordinary life seemed boring with a capital b she didnt put it that way to her husband it would have hurt herbs feelings which was the last thing she wanted to do then again she didnt need to say much to him it wasnt as if he didnt know how she ticked one morning at breakfast he set down his coffee cup and said you ought to do something for the war effort you know like what she said it wasnt as if the suggestion came out of the blue shed been thinking along those lines herself herb was a jump ahead of her though well youve seen a lot of stuff other people havent he answered you ought to go around and tell them what a mess europe is some of these chowderheads are still mad cause fdr wont let em sell stuff over there any more too bad for them she said shed been all for sending england and france everything but the kitchen sink when they were fighting the nazis now that they were fighting on the nazis side she was as ready to say to hell with them as fdr seemed to be but swarms of people whod made big stacks of cash by shipping them this that and the other thing were jumping up and down and bawling like a threeyearold throwing a tantrum herb chuckled you know how to win friends and influence people you do i looked at that stupid book when it was new peggy said i wouldnt waste my money on it it was a bunch of hooey nothing else but maybe so but the guy who wrote its laughing all the way to the bank her husband answered id like to have a quarter of what he raked in from the son of a gun that was bound to be true no matter how unfortunate peggy thought it was shed never been one to stay gloomy long though if she were her time in europe would have driven her nuts she brightened as a new thought came a lot of the big shots who want to go on doing business with europe will be making even more money pretty soon by selling the government what it needs to fight the japs there you go herb made silent clapping motions now youve got your text you can go and preach it all over the place like st paul i dont want to preach in st paul peggy said with malice aforethought if theres a duller town anywhere in the world i dont know where herb eyed her through a veil of cigarette smoke when you start making cracks like that you need to get out of the house all right and pdq too but getting out of the house wasnt so simple the government had clamped down on travel tires and gasoline were rationed that made sense since you couldnt win a modern war without rubber and petroleum it was still a pain and if she was going to head out on what amounted to the campaign trail she was damned if she wanted to spend her own moneyor even herbsto do it it wasnt that she couldnt afford to it was the principle of the thing so she told herself anyhow she rapidly discovered she didnt have to to most philadelphia main line families roosevelt was and always would be that man in the white house philadelphia democrats fell all over themselves to get help from someone in that group who didnt see him that way train fare yes maam hotel bills expenses yes maam they asked her if she wanted a speech writer she looked at them as if theyd asked if she wanted a positive wassermann i can talk for myself thanks she said coolly if you dont believe me ask my husband or ask hitler i got him to do what i wanted and i was speaking german then im better in english shed never heard so many stammered apologies in her life they were just suggesting they didnt mean to hurt her feelings to show they didnt they upped her expenses when she told herb that he guffawed squeeze em for all theyre worth he said theyve got more moolah than they know what to do with and most of it doesnt exactly belong to anybody so they can throw it around no matter how much money the philadelphia democrats had they didnt send her very far on her first runonly to york on the west side of the susquehanna she didnt blame them for that if she turned out to be a dud theyd want to know at minimum expense york sat in the valley formed by codorus creek it was a mediumsized town people or maybe a few more it had been a brickmaking center and many of the older neighborhoods were one brick home or apartment house after another the public buildings and the many gothic churches were of red brick with white trim as if theyd come from early nineteenthcentury england the local womens club had arranged for her to speak at the first presbyterian church a few blocks east of continental square it was another gothic brick building built in and rebuilt in for varietys sake perhaps its brickwork was painted gray the renovation added brownstone and wood trim loretta conway the woman who picked her up at the station told her the graveyard next to the church held the remains of james smith a signer of the declaration of independence thats nice peggy said her nonchalance flustered the woman from york but only for a moment then mrs conway turned pink i forgot youre from philly she said youve got more revolutionary war stuff there than you know what to do with dont you pretty much peggy answered she knew york had some too and she was ready to be a good sport if loretta wanted to show it off but the other woman didnt instead she talkedvery sensibly which meant her views matched peggysabout the need to knock the snot out of the japs and to keep hitler from getting too big for his britches she had a twentyyearold son whod just volunteered for the marines that brought the war home for her in a way peggy hadnt felt since herb got back from over there in maybe you should give the speech peggy said forget it loretta answered i go up in front of more than four or five people i freeze up like a block of ice peggy laughed okay you arent the only one heaven knows but whatever else they say about me im not shy she got her chance to prove it a little later the church wasnt packed but it came close the minister a whitehaired man named ruppelt introduced her here is a lady who can talk about the world situation because shes seen more of it than most people mrs peggy druce she got polite applause as she stepped up to the lectern thank you reverend ruppelt she said a lot of what i saw i wish i never did but thats the point about war isnt it thats whats happening to our boys in the philippines right now if the japs had been a little luckier it might be happening in hawaii too so weve got some work we need to take care of if hirohito thinks japan can do whatever it wants in the pacific fdrs going to show him things dont work that way more applause and more enthusiastic peggy warmed to her task when i finally did get to england a customs man there said welcome to freedom i was glad to hear it too but whats freedom worth if you use yours to take away somebody elses isnt that what englands doing in russia right now didnt she learn better right here in pennsylvania in and how can you expect to stay friends with us if youre friends with hitler too if shed been talking with herb she would have said in bed with hitler she almost did here she thought her husband would have been proud of her because she showed restraint you didnt talk about sex in church and she didnt need to the raucous clapping that followed showed people got the message even when she kept it clean the ones with minds that ran in the same gutter as hers could gloss in bed with hitler for themselves the others were dull but they were here too they cheeredsome of them stood upwhen peggy got done they bought bonds they contributed to the democrats and they made sure shed be on the road a lot from now on chapter before coming to pingfan hideki fujita had never had anything to do with americans the only white men hed dealt with were the russians whod tried to kill him in mongolia and siberia and the russian prisoners on whom the japanese microbiologists and biochemists experimented here you had to watch yourself with russians they were tough and they were sneaky if they saw an opening they would grab it in a heartbeat but as long as you made sure they recognized they couldnt get away with anything they grew docile enough pingfan held tens of thousands of russians most of the men whod surrendered around vladivostok were marched here afterwards not all of them made it herenowhere close fujita had been one of the soldiers herding them along he knew how many fell by the wayside he also knew how fast the japanese scientists were using them up still the experimental station had plenty left americans americans were different they were different all kinds of ways there werent very many of them the us marines had had only small garrisons in peking and shanghai a lot of the marines in both places had made the japanese kill them after war broke out between the two countries despite being insanely outnumbered theyd killed a lot of japanese too you had to respect men like that in the end though some of the marines did surrender perhaps to pay them back for the fight their comrades put up they got shipped straight to pingfan the japanese scientists were excited to have them american pows let them try to tailor germwarfare weapons against anglosaxons in particular which was finefor the scientists fujita and his soldiers had to ride herd on the americans in the meantime they had to keep them from making trouble and they had to keep them from escaping and fujita didnt need long to figure out that americans were born troublemakers russians would escape if you gave them half a chance too and chinese no one in his right mind would trust chinese to stay where they belonged unless you kept your eye on them every secondand they knew you were keeping your eye on them every second then they couldnt behave better but the americans played games with the system that fujita wouldnt have believed if they hadnt been messing around with him the essential feature in controlling them was the count they stood in ranks of ten which made it easy for the guards to know exactly how many of them there were on any given morning or evening or it should have made things easy somehow the marines managed to convince the japanese that there were three more of them than there were supposed to be how fujita didnt know obviously they were moving around in the ranks but not where anybody could catch them at it hed already worked out that one of the chief nuisances was a big burly fellow named szulc the american didnt understand japanese of course he didnt understand chinese eithersenior private hayashi was a smart fellow and knew quite a bit i am very sorry sergeant san but i think he really is ignorant and not faking hayashi reported to fujita how could he be fujita asked irritablyeverything about szulc irritated him these marines serve in china for years they must learn some of the language while theyre there it seems not sergeant san please excuse me but it does hayashi didnt want fujita working off that irritation on him fujita growled like an angry tiger a sergeant could do pretty much as he pleased withand tothe men under him but thumping hayashi wouldnt tell him how the americans were pulling off their stupid stunt neither would thumping szulc if nobody could understand him when he yelled as he got thumped sudden inspiration struck fujita snapped his fingers in delight some of our scientists went to the university in america neh theyll know english and theyll be able to talk to this szulc he couldnt even pronounce the roundeyed devils name in his mouth it came out something like shurutzu thats right they will hayashi said when a sergeant came up with a halfway decent idea of course a senior private sounded enthusiastic good glad you think so too fujita pointed to hayashi so you get one of the scientists to find out how the americans are doing whatever theyre doing its gone on for four days now thats too stinking long me why me shinjiro hayashi yipped but his heart wasnt in it youre the educated fellow fujita answered remorselessly as hayashi must have known he would so go use some of your education for a change fujita himself felt like an idiot whenever he had to talk to one of the microbiologists that no doubt was a feeling they did nothing to discourage sighing as if to say he didnt think life was fair hayashi went off to do as he was tolda definite good point in a subordinate fujita already knew life wasnt fair hed had his nose rubbed in it again and again before he made sergeant life wasnt fair now either but most of the time he found himself on the other end of the stick for a change hayashi eventually came back with a man who wore spectacles and a white lab coat as if they were extensions of his skinthe way say fujita wore a uniform here is dr doi sergeant san hayashi said he will ask szulc the questions you need good fujita bowed deeply to doi inferior to superior thank you very much for your help sir you are welcome i am glad to assist i am also glad for the chance to practice my english when you do not speak a language for a while it gets rusty armed guards brought szulc over to the compound he towered over them hed be a rough customer in a fight but who wanted to fight a man whod thrown away his honor by surrendering to dr doi fujita said please ask him how the americans are making the count come out wrong doi spoke english fujita could hear that he sounded slow and uncertain szulcs reply was a quick bass rumble that couldnt have sounded more different from the japanese scientists reedy tenor if it had burst from the throat of a buffalo dr doi frowned he says he does not understand what i say fujita frowned too ominously is that likely no one will ever think i am an american but he should be able to follow me doi answered that was about what fujita had expected all right then he said and nodded to one of szulcs guards the man gave szulc one in the side of the head with his rifle butt szulc yelled and staggered but he didnt fall over he didnt dab at the blood running down his cheek and chin either he did give fujita a hatefilled glare fujita cared nothing for that please ask your question again doi san please also tell him hell get worse if he keeps playing the fool more english from the bacteriologist whatever szulc said this time it was different from before it seemed less scornful a rifle butt to the side of the head would do that as fujita had reason to know he says he understands now but he knows nothing about how the count is disarranged doi reported thats funny but not funny enough to laugh about fujita said tell him this very plainlythe next time the count is out of order well kill enough americans to set it right that would waste an important resource dr doi protested in japanese please tell him anyhow sir let him and the others think we will do it that will make them behave themselves i can hope so anyhow ah all right i understand doi returned to english szulc studied fujita as if sniffing for a bluff fujita gave back his stoniest stare on his own he certainly would kill pows who complicated his life why not it wasnt as if prisoners of war were human beings any more they were just maruta szulc muttered something doi said he will take word of this back to camp even thoughhe claimshe knows nothing of the scheme he claims hai fujita gestured to the guards take him back as usual fujita had two different men run the count that evening before supper one reported the proper number of americans the other one marine too few fujita lost his temper he had all the americans lie down so they couldnt move without being instantly noticed he used gestures to explain to them that theyd get shot if they were noticed this time the count came out three men light zakennayo fujita shouted how long ago did they get away and how big a start on us do they have those were both good questions he had an answer for neither big strong white men should have been conspicuous around pingfan were the locals sheltering them from the japanese another good question fujita wasnt sure he had an answer for that one either but he could make a pretty good guess we need to report this senior private hayashi said regretfully i know fujita answered more regretfully still theyd catch it for allowing an escape and catch it again for not noticing right away but they couldnt cover it up somebodyd blab even the american marines might to get their guards in trouble zakennayo he yelled again even louder this time out of the frying pan into the fire that was how peggy druce thought of it anyway as soon as the people in philadelphia discovered she really could stir folks up about the war they sent her out to do it again and again after york lancaster red roses instead of white when she made that crack in lancaster somebody told her the two towns bushleague baseball teams actually did refight the war of the roses every time they took the field against each other she laughed but later she wondered why that showed more of a sense of history than was common in the united states not in europe they had a sense of history there all right everybody could give you all the reasons for the past or sometimes years that showed why he deserved to kick his neighbor in the teeth with a steeltoed jackboot and his neighbor had reasons just as numerous and just as ancient for kicking him and the japanese were responding to something ancient too for hundreds of years europeans and americans had lorded it over the proud ancient weak empires in asia theyd had the warships and the guns and the military doctrine that let them do it theyd had the arrogance that let them do it too what was that sign in the shanghai park supposed to say no dogs or chinsese that was it maybe the sign really was or had been there maybe it was just a story either way it showed an attitude that was definitely there now the japs had licked the russians twice so they thought they were strong enough to swing the bat against the white mens first team the united states was going to have to throw a high hard one right at hirohitos head to convince them they werent ready for the big leagues yet or maybe they were the war news coming out of the pacific was uniformly lousy the philippines were falling a bomb from a japanese plane was said to have blown general macarthur into dog food the japs claimed that at the tops of their lungs the usa said nothing one way or the other peggys time in europe had made her sensitive to the nuances of propaganda you didnt talk about what you didnt like by the same token the american papers werent saying much about the way japan was overrunning malaya and the dutch east indies you heard occasional stories about how heroic the handful of american ships in the area were if you paid close attention and checked a map you notice that fewer and fewer us navy vessels got mentioned by name even the survivors were reported as being heroic farther and farther south but how many people checked that closely how many americans knew off the tops of their heads whether borneo was south of java or the other way around peggy hadnt not till she looked and shed traveled a lot more than most folks timor sumbawa cerami they sounded like the noises your stomach made after you ate bratwurst and sauerkraut at least it wasnt liberty cabbage in this war then again germany still remained officially neutral toward the usa peggy didnt blame the administration for minimizing failures and playing up whatever small successes it could find if she had she wouldnt have gone to reading to easton to scranton to altoona to williamsport you did what you needed to do and you tried not to tell too many lies while you were doing it if you couldnt help telling a lie you tried not to make it a whopper she stuck to the principles she hoped the administration was also using it worked she got big hands everywhere she went war bond sales at her rallies were bigger yet so were contributions to the democratic party an election was coming next year after all it seemed as if an election was always coming next year if it wasnt it was coming this year instead the one place she didnt go was pittsburgh the world had a north pole and a south pole pennsylvania by contrast had an east pole and a west pole philadelphia was bigger and older and richer and snootier than pittsburgh pittsburgh was tougher and grittierand if you didnt believe it all you had to do was ask anybody who came from there pittsburgh prided itself on coal and steel the way philadelphia bragged about the main line if chicago hadnt called itself the city of the big shoulders pittsburgh would have and so even though pittsburgh was a more reliably democratic town than philadelphia peggy wasnt welcome there she got an invitation from wheeling west virginia so she traveled through pittsburgh going and coming back but she didnt get off the train there she also went to erie pennsylvanias only great lakes port erie cared nothing for either philadelphia or pittsburgh it might have turned its back on both of them it was a low spacious city with only one fourteenstory skyscraper projecting above the three and fourstory business buildings in the center of town she made her speech it went over as well in erie as it had anywhere else it might even have gone better there than most places a plump prosperous fellow who sold real estate came up to her after she was done and spoke in tones of wonder i dont recollect the last time philadelphia remembered we were alive much less did anything about it were all one state were all one country if a war doesnt remind us of that what will peggy said well i dont know my guess was that nothing would the realestate man answered after he went away a weatherbeaten woman in her late sixties came up to peggy and introduced herself as matilda jenkins the name was as ordinary as she was you spoke very well she said her voice almost painfully genteel no wonder you impressed my son so much your son peggy didnt remember meeting anybody named jenkins at one of her earlier rallies but that might not prove anything she didnt have a pols photographic memory for names and faces yes of course mrs jenkins saidshe wore a thin plain gold band on the ring finger of her left hand my son constantine at the american embassy in berlin he thought you were the cats pajamas he did oh peggy blurted she felt herself blushing she had no idea when shed last done that now that she looked she saw the resemblance but the suave embassy undersecretaryso suave shed guessed he was queerseemed more than an ocean removed from this mousy woman clinging so hard to lowermiddleclass respectability something more than oh seemed called for peggy tried again how about that he helped me a lot the second part was true the first usually safe matilda jenkins beamed he said you knew what you wanted and how to go about getting it just listening to you i can see that he said you were mighty sweet too constantine usually knows what hes talking about all right how about that peggy repeated this time through clenched teeth exactly how much about her had constantine jenkins told his mother he wouldnt have bragged about that would he not to his mother he said you had such a good time at the opera and afterwards mrs jenkins went on obliviouspeggy sure hoped she was oblivious anyhow after the opera in berlin what herb didnt know wouldnt hurt himshe hoped matilda jenkins kept burbling such a pleasure to get the chance to meet you i never dreamt i would how about that peggy said one more time wondering how soon she could get the hell out of erie colonel steinbrenner looked at the stuka pilots in his squadron hansulrich rudel looked around at them too not many faces were left from the ones hed seen when the balloon went up in czechoslovakia hed been shot down once himself and thanked heaven hed been able to bail out too many of his former comrades hadnt been so lucky things are heating up again steinbrenner said our infantry and armor can move forward now that the roads are drying they need air support he grinned wryly we have a chance to give it to them too because the runways are drying rudel chuckled though it wasnt as if the squadron co were kidding planes flying off forward airstrips had to deal with mud just like panzers and trucks and foot soldiers there were times when nobody could deal with it at times like those the jus stayed on the ground at times like those he always wished he could hop on a train and go back to sofia in bialystok if he couldnt do the reich any good at the moment why shouldnt he enjoy himself instead unfortunately luftwaffe higherups disapproved of such little jaunts as far as they were concerned it would always turn thirty celsius tomorrowday after at the latestand the deep russian mud would magically dry up so the flyers could get back to walloping the snot out of the reds well it had finally happened or enough of it had it wasnt thirty celsiusit probably wasnt even twentyand the mud hadnt cleared up by magic but it wasnt twenty below any more and neither was it pouring rain the stukas could get back to walloping the ivans after lighting a papiros german quartermasters werent too proud to dole out captured stocks of smokessteinbrenner went on the russians tried to knock us back from our bridgehead in the direction of smolensk during the winter but they couldnt bring it off so weand our alliesare going to keep pushing that way once smolensk falls i suspect it will be time to start thinking about moscow moscow driving stalin out of his lair taking the lair away from him no wonder an excited hum rose from the flyers napoleon had taken moscow away from tsar alexander but he hadnt had much joy afterwards he couldnt fight a winter campaign not in weather like what they got here he couldnt the wehrmacht had already proved it could questions steinbrenner asked he pointed toward a pilot who raised his hand whats on your mind helmut helmut bauer was big and blond and broadshouldered he seemed almost too wide to fit inside a stuka cockpit but fit he did and he flew with nearly as much reckless enthusiasm as hansulrich himself now he asked colonel with romania in the war what happens when things down south get screwed up youre assuming they will the squadron commander said his voice dry damn straight i am sir bauer agreed i know what the romaniansve got it isnt much and they arent what youd call eager to use it either heads bobbed up and down rudels among them he didnt care for having polish allies you couldnt say the poles lacked guts but most of their equipment was junk the romanians mostly used junk too and precious few germans had ever figured them for heroes hansulrich sure didnt even more dryly than before steinbrenner answered there may just be a few german soldiers along with the romanians to help remind them how to play the game and why theyre playing it the flyers chuckled hansulrich knew why the romanians were playing the game the fuhrer had promised them the black sea port of odessa and the adjoining lands on the far bank of the dniester if nothing else could get somebody moving good old greed would often turn the trick i do understand that sir bauer said but still the ukraines a hell of a big place if you know what i mean i hope well have enough men and equipment in place to bite off the chunks we needand to keep the ivans from bunching up down there and biting our flank helmut if they decide to move the squadron down to the ukraine to support our men and the romanians you cant do anything about it and neither can i colonel steinbrenner said im sure youll be able to find yourself another lady friend though more chuckles from the pilots and a snicker or two to go with them oh so am i bauer said unmistakable complacency filling his voice hansulrich wasnt nearly so sure he could find another girl he liked as much as sofia youll be safer if you find one who isnt half a jew he told himself the sd didnt like such liaisons neither did the national socialist leadership officer standing at steinbrenners elbow building a case against someone who wore the knights cross and who wasnt shy about saying he backed the fuhrer wouldnt be easy but it wouldnt necessarily be impossible either nothing was impossible if somebody important enough decided to build a case can we get on with the war we are fighting not the one we may be fighting some day steinbrenner asked nobody told him no so he did the ivans have a concentration in front of studenets southwest of smolensk our forces are in the neighborhood and so are the french if we bomb the enemys infantry and shoot up his panzers word will get back to paris that the froggies would be smart not to think about changing horses again so well do that gentlemen if its all right with you again nobody told him no he nodded briskly we take off in fortyfive minutes and they did the first ju kicking up dust from the unpaved strip and climbing into the air right on time hansulrich pushed back his leather flying glove and the sleeve to his furlined flight suit to check his watch and make sure ready albert he called through the speaking tube not me sergeant dieselhorst answered im still soaking in the bathtub and after i get out ill go pick flowers so i keep on smelling nice and sweet hansulrich snorted dieselhorst did deadpan even better than colonel steinbrenner when his stukas turn came he goosed the throttle the ju rattled down the runway then sedately got airborne the weight and drag from the underwing gun pods made the ungainly plane even more so studenets rudel repeated to the rear gunner as if they hadnt gone over it before takeoff gesundheit dieselhorst said so it was going to be one of those missions messerschmitt bfs clustered around the stukas the s had plenty of other things to do dive bombers got escorts only when the luftwaffe feared the red air force had fighters of its own in the neighborhood and the reds did bluntnosed stumpy polikarpov po monoplanes they were a long step slower than the messerschmitts but they could have made mincemeat out of the lumbering jus had the bombers had no friends as things were one of them tumbled to the ground trailing smoke two more made halfhearted runs at the stukas and then peeled off the rest decided to go somewhere else to some place where misfortunes like s never happened after that the stukas worked over the ivans positions in front of studenets with only ground fire to worry about that wasnt negligible however much hansulrich wished it were one ju took a direct hit from a flak shell and never pulled out of its dive exploding in a fireball when it hit the ground you had to ignore such things and do your job rudel did he shot up four panzers a couple of rounds of smallarms fire clanged into the plane but none of the instruments showed any damage the panzers were all ordinary soviet models he didnt see any of the kv mastodons that made german panzer men break out in a cold sweat what you didnt find you couldnt kill which given russian camouflage methods might or might not mean something but hed done what he could having done it he flew off to the west again studenets looked as if it would fall soon sullenly the red army pulled out of studenets the wehrmacht moved into the town from straight out of the west the french expeditionary force from the southwest luc harcourt saw a couple of men in khaki uniforms trotting away in the distance he raised his rifle to his shoulder and fired at them one of the men ran faster the other a smarter fellow dove behind a battered wall and thus out of sight he wished he still commanded a machinegun team as he had when he was still a corporal but that was beneath a sergeants dignity dignity or no a burst from the hotchkiss and those ivans wouldnt have got away if they were ivans the range had been long he might have seen feldgrau through the sights not faded soviet khaki he wasnt the only french soldier who thought of the same thing at the same time with a sly chuckle one of his men said wouldnt it have been a shame if those cochons were really boches instead of russians oh but of course jacques that would have been a real pity luc could only have sounded more sardonic had he been lieutenant demange demange was somewhere not far away luc could hear him swearing at somebody in the company jacques laughed out loud a pity you didnt hit em you mean i didnt say that you did now luc did his best to seem severe though jacques was rightscragging a couple of fritzes by accident wouldnt have broken his heart but he also had his reasons for sounding the way he did and watch what falls out of your big fat gob all right the germans are in town too remember and more of those cocksuckers know french than youd figure im not afraid of them jacques was all nineteenyearold bluster then youre an even bigger con than i give you credit for and thats saying something i sure am luc answered jacques eyes widened luc didnt care hed been through enough to admit fear without fearing to seem a coward and it wasnt as if he were lying anybody who didnt fear germans with weapons in their hands hadnt seen enough to know which end was up the boches were in town too like the french they were cleaning out the last few red army holdouts mausers banged off to the north their reports sounded harsher than those of french mass luc thought so anyhow there definitely was a difference whether it lay in harshness or what and then an mg opened up that fierce snarl still gave him the willies even if his country and the nazis had the same enemy nowadays the german machine gun fired so much faster than a hotchkissand faster than anything the english or the russians madethat you couldnt possibly mistake its malignant roar for anything else the noise went hand in hand with agony and maiming and limbsprawled death jacques was a new conscript hed never had to glue himself to the ground like a slug while mg bullets kicked up dry leaves and slammed into tree trunks and spanged off stones all the while trying to let the air out of his precious irreplaceable self he didnt get how very deadly that german toy was you dumb lucky fuck luc thought scornfully as the firing around here eased off russian civilians started coming up from their cellars and showing themselves a plump applecheeked babushka in a head scarf smiled showing a mouthful of startling gold teeth amis she said which startled luc again he didnt care about making friends with her her granddaughter now if she had one not all the people emerging from cellars and from under the bed and from wherever the hell else in studenets were russians some were jews the men dark and bearded and hooknosed in long black coats the women just as swarthy in scarves of their own and in even longer black dresses the russians looked relieved to be alive the jews looked relieved to be alive and even more relieved to be in a part of town the french had overrun like the babushka they said amis and they said kameraden and much else in yiddish and in more standard german luc understood little of that but some of the french soldiers here would follow more as hed told luc many germans could parler francais and probably just as many frenchmen could deutsch sprechen an old jew with a beard down to the second button of his shirtfront handed luc a bottle that sloshed here you take you like he said in broken french me i have nephew in paris he drive taxi he mimed steering motions luc did take the bottle he did like it too hed expected vodka potent but next to flavorless but no he got plum brandy fiery and sweet at the same time he gave jacques a quick nip then went looking for demange the lieutenant would make him sorry if he didnt share a prize like this lieutenant demange had men going through a warren of little shops for holdouts they seemed to be flushing out nothing but unarmed jews demange cradled a soviet ppd submachine gun it was ugly but good for killing lots of people in a hurryquite a bit like the veteran himself the inevitable gitane in the corner of his mouth twitched when he saw lucs offering what have you got there jew with a white beard gave it to me luc held out the bottle demange took it and drank a slow smile spread across his skinny ratlike face heyyy thats the straight shit all right lets hear it for the kike yeah lets hear it luc said not quite comfortably he thought there were a couple of jews among the men demange commanded but demange wasnt an antisemite or not particularly the race he despised was the human race he passed the bottle back to luc who killed it and tossed it in the rubble two stiff knocks of brandy didnt get him drunk they did mean he eyed the wreckage that was studenets with a slightly less jaundiced eye demange pointed toward where the center of town ought to be bring a few guys with you wed better make contact with the nazis long as everything stays nice and official the chance for some dumb fucking accident goes down happy day luc said his enthusiasm distinctly tempered it wasnt that demange was wrong because he wasnt but luc wanted to pretend france was at war with the russians and there werent any germans around for hundreds of kilometers theyd come closer to killing him than the ivans ever had and hed sure done for his share of them muttering he shambled off to obey he muttered even more when he saw that the germans in the town square didnt belong to the wehrmacht they came from the waffenss they wore the ss runes on the right side of their helmets and on the right collar patch of each mans tunic they looked like tough assholes the few times hed faced wafen ss troops theyd fought like tough assholes too he still would rather have shot at them than at the ivans a few more ss men herded some jews into the square one of the jews might have been brother to the guy whod given luc plum brandy laughing an ss sergeant drew his luger and raised it to the back of the jews head maybe he just meant to scare the graybeard maybe luc didnt wait to find out he had his rifle pointed at the ss noncoms belly button in nothing flat halt he yelled he didnt speak much german but he had that one down solid slowly his mouth dropping open in disbelief the ss man lowered the pistol an ss officer spoke in badly accented french but this foolishness is we are allies nestce pas and these are only jews other ss men looked as ready to fight their allies as luc was to plug that sergeant lieutenant demange dove behind some shattered masonry he shouted in german probably as lousy as the ss officers french then he translated for luc i told em id give em the whole fucking drum of ammo if they didnt leave the damn hebes alone the waffen ss officer quivered with outrage tell me your name he snarled at demange i shall to your superiors report you fuck off and die the lieutenant replied auf deutsch not breaking cover luc got that fine demange said something else in german then repeated it in french you want to report us for stopping a murder youll be at war with every frenchman in russia by this time tomorrow luc nodded so did the poilus hed brought along the ss man swore in his own language but he let the jews go and nobody reported the confrontation to anybodys superiors chapter the major standing by alistair walsh murmured to himself if it were done when tis done then twere well it were done quickly whats that sir walsh kept looking across the street toward what had to be englands most famous address thatthe majors handsome face set in disapproving lines at walshs ignorance and very likely at his accent too that is shakespeare macbeth to be precise he was the sort whod set great stock in precision yes the army needed that kind of man which didnt mean the bloke would have a great pack of friends we ought to move a bit not let ourselves be seen staring at the place walsh said he didnt think he himself was important in the grand scheme of things not in the other sides calculations at any rate he didnt know what kind of reports they had about the major he didnt even know the mans name what you didnt know you couldnt tell no matter how cleveror cruelthe questioner absently the major nodded quite he said and started mooching down the street sighing walsh went along the major was bound to be very good at well at whatever he was good at whatever that might be it wasnt acting he might have drawn more notice with a batterypowered signboard featuring flashing electric lamps on the other hand he also might not have walsh didnt notice anything out of the ordinary about the guards in front of the famous address of course if the other side was on the job he wouldnt but if the other side were on the job he wouldnt have been strolling along with the officer he did some murmuring of his own gunpowder oh weve got better toys than that these days the major said i meant the gunpowder plot sir guy fawkes day well dont equivocate then the major snapped say what you mean yes sir walsh replied with dour precision since he was nominally a civilian he couldnt salute even sarcastically but he had to remind his twitchy arm of that what i mean sir is that if we bugger this up little tykes a hundred years from now will take lessons about the second world war traitors and get browned off because theyve got to memorize our names little tykes a hundred years from now will take lessons about the second world war traitors regardless the major spoke with gloomy certainty the only question left is which list of names theyll have to memorize walsh grunted that was much too likely to be true a nicelooking blonde came up the street past him of itself his head swiveled so he could check her hip action too the little things in life went on no matter how grandiose the big things were a blackbird on a rooftop opened its yellow beak and poured out springtime song it hopped into the air and flew off right over walsh and the major the officer ducked away walsh eyed him sympathetically he must have had a rugged war if a thrush could remind him of a grenade or a shell fragment the ribbon for the military medal on his chest did nothing to argue against that but then the major said ought to be a bounty on those bloody things did you ever try to clean bird shit off your cap visor erno walshs sympathy evaporated stinking nuisance the major said before returning to the business at hand im told you know something of this business what do you think of our chances for success do i know something of this business walsh wondered hed planned and led attacks on strongpoints in urban settingsno doubt of that it made him more of an expert than most people even probably more of an expert than most soldiers he pursed his lips weighing what hed seen so long as we do keep the advantage of surprise chances look tolerably good to me if theyre waiting for us when we make the attempt were ruined for fair then the major finished for him which wasnt how walsh would have gone on again though that didnt make him wrong a boy on a street corner was waving the times of london and bawling out the latest war headlines the british expeditionary force and the rest of the nazis allies were advancing deeper into russia in malaya and burma the japanese kept pushing imperial troops back even singapore said to be the strongest fortress in the world might come under attack soon strange business the major said walking past without buying a paper hows that sir well the bleeding japs are supposed to be hitlers chums but were supposed to be hitlers chums too and were at war with japan and the russians are hitlers deadly enemies but theyve already had their war with japan so theyre neutral now and the usa and japan are fighting but russian ships can cross the pacific free as so many fish load up on guns in american ports and haul all that stuff back to russia to fire it off against the nazisand us when you thought of it like that it was enough to make your head swim walsh found one problem how many ships in the pacific have the russians got left now that vladivostoks fallen they have some yet and theres a road connectionnot a good one but its therebetween magadan and what the russians still hold of the transsiberian railway no the real question is how much can they bring in whilst the harbor at magadans not iced up walsh had never heard of magadan he had no idea where in siberia it lay or for that matter whether the major was simply inventing it to bolster his argument the officer ducked into a pub walsh followed a pint of bitter made him stop caring whether magadan was real beer steakandkidney pie more beer a french estaminet couldnt hold a candle to a proper pub two wars worth of experience on the other side of the channel and years of diligent experimenting in his own country left walsh as sure of that as made no difference the major wasnt the best drinking companion hed ever had but also wasnt the worst it was dark by the time walsh went back to his little furnished room londons lights were on again with germany friendly the need for a blackout disappeared sometimes conveniences came at too high a price walsh thought so anyhow the prime minister would have disagreed walsh reckoned disagreeing with sir horace wilson sure to put him in the right because of the beer hed taken on board the knock at the door took longer to rouse him than it might have he lurched off the bedwhich doubled as a sofa in daylight hoursready to give whoever was out there a piece of his mind but the two somber men in trenchcoats hadnt the slightest interest in listening to him youre alistair walshis that right one of them said what if i am walsh answered indignantly who wants to know both men produced scotland yard identity cards youre under arrest said the one who did the talking come along with usquietly if you please ice and fire chased each other along walshs spine the devil i will he blustered show me your warrant with startling speed the copper or detective or whatever he was produced a pistol a webley and scott mark vi a great mankilling brute of a revolver the same weapon british officers carried into battle heres all the warrant we need mate let out a peep and ill blow a hole in you they could throw a cat through the other scotland yard man spoke up for the first time dont tempt us either shootings better than a damned traitor deserves im no traitor walsh said wondering how many mps and army officers were being scooped up in the same net both men in the hallway laughedtwo of the nastiest laughs hed ever heard now tell us another one said the fellow with the webley and scott notell your stories at headquarters get moving right now this is your first last and only chance he gestured toward the stairway with the pistol numbly walsh got moving the fritzes had almost captured him a couple of times hed counted himself lucky to escape that fate now his own countrymen had him by the ballocks better if the nazis had got him at least they were enemies and honest enough about that at the time these bastards imagined they were patriots it only went to show how crazy and useless a thing an imagination could be pete mcgill hadnt thought of australia as a tropical country when he was on shipboard duty before he got posted to china hed put in at sydney and melbourne and perth they werent half badthey kind of reminded him of southern california hed never been to darwin before here he was in darwin now it wasnt the dutch east indiesit wasnt right on the equator no it lay all of twelve degrees south that made a difference as far as pete was concerned it didnt make nearly enough he was just glad hed got here in one piece and that the boise had got here under her own power most of the ships and sailors whod fought the japs with the american light cruiser farther north werent so lucky the dutch east indies were falling if they hadnt already fallen all that oil all that rubber all that tin they lay in japanese hands now how long the boise would be able to keep running under her own powerand how long shed stay in one piece herselfhe had no idea japanese bombers called on darwin night after night they were not to put too fine a point on it knocking the crap out of the place darwin was just a little town at the edge of nowhere the japs seemed intent on knocking it over the edge and so pete wasnt astonished when the boise steamed out of the harbor one evening just when the sun was going down if one of those bombers with the meatballs on the wings got lucky the light cruiser wouldnt go anywhere again except to the bottom so she was getting out while the getting was good it seemed that way to him anyhow joe orsatti was much less happy about it im sick of running from those shitass little yellow monkeys he groused as the marines manned the fiveinch guns in case an enemy plane or a sub or even an arrogantly aggressive destroyer spotted the boise who isnt pete agreed they hurried east scuttlebutt said they were bound for new zealand and ultimately for hawaii pete hoped the scuttlebutt was true he wouldnt be sure till they made it through the torres strait if they kept heading east after that new zealand it would be if they swung more to the south paralleling australias coast they were liable to be bound for melbourne or sydney he understood that the aussies needed to keep up the fight but so did america and he wanted to help he figured he owed the japs more than orsatti did the other leatherneck warmed to his theme im a white man god damn it to hell those lousy slanteyed cocksuckers got no business pushing me around plenty of marines in peking and shanghai had felt the same way pete wondered how his buddies were doing these days he wondered how many of them were still alive not for the first time guilt stabbed at him because he wasnt up there sharing their fate whatever it turned out to be he couldnt do anything about that of course but his impotence made him feel worse not better hed had some of that white mans arrogance himself but only some i saw a lot of the japs in china he said slowly theyre just as sure theyre hot shit in a gold goblet as we are yeah but theyre really nothin but cold diarrhea in a dixie cup orsatti replied which got a laugh from everybody in the gun crew including pete he went on you wait and see well make em wish they never took us on we get the whole fleet together at pearl then we sail west and bash em his voice went all dreamy the big fuckin pacific battle itll make jutland look like a couple of kids playin with toy boats in the bathtub there you go pete said there werent many sailors or marines who didnt daydream about the big fuckin pacific battle anybody with a brain in his head had seen that the usa would tangle with japan one of these days why else had both sides built all those battlewagons and carriers and cruisers and destroyers and subs if not to get ready for the day so wed put all of ours together theyd put all of theirs together and then both sides would bash heads and the winner would go forward while the loser what about the loser hed get what losers always got ts eliot without warning the boise heeled to port as hard as she could a split second later klaxons hooted torpedo attack the shout burst from the loudspeakers iron throats we are under torpedo attack theyd gone to battle stations as soon as the ship left port pete stood by the open ammunition locker ready to pass shells to the loader he couldnt do anything else except wait and worry and hope like hell he wouldnt get his ankles broken when the jap fish slammed into the cruiser theres the wake orsatti said hoarsely sure as hell a phosphorescent line arrowed through the tropical sea seeming to run straight for the boise s vitals nowhow many fish had the japanese sub launched holy crap here came another one much too soon after the first it sped along on a track almost identical to the other could the boise dodge them she was sure as hell trying smoke spurted from her stacks as the engines roared up to emergency full machine gunners opened fire on the torpedoes trying to detonate them before they could hit if they were going to hit hail mary full of grace orsatti rattled off the prayer the hand in his pocket was probably working a rosary pete wished he could pray that way hed seen how it made people feel better but hed never got the habit when he was a kid and talking to god now only made him feel like a phony he tried the next best thing saying i think the bastards are gonna slide on by us the boise had turned into the torpedoes paths and was running along them in the opposite directionstraight toward the sub that had turned them loose if that sub was still surfaced it would be mighty sorry mighty fast pete peered forward he saw nothing that looked like a periscope or a conning tower but how much did that say bow on the boise also offered torpedoes the smallest possible target they did slide past both to port one seemed close enough for pete to spit on he refrained no grinding rending crash told of a cruisersubmarine collision the boise threw a few depth charges into the warm dark water the deck shook under petes feet as they burst one by one the ocean boiled above the bursts i wish i thought we were really after those assholes joe orsatti said way it feels though is were just makin em keep their heads down fine by me pete profanely embellished that all were doing now is getting out of town any which way so well go and they can give somebody else a hard time next week the other marine grunted yeah you got somethin there i didnt look at it from that angle maybe youre smartern you act most of the time ahh up yours pete said without heat besides if im so goddamn smart what am i doing here that drew another laugh from everybody at the gun well if i remember straight your other choice was staying in manila orsatti answered like i said a minute ago maybe you aint so dumb after all pete wondered what he would have done if he hadnt come aboard the boise he didnt need to wonder long he would have picked up a springfield found a tin hat that came close to fitting and joined the americans and filipinos trying to hold off the japanese invaders from the reports trickling out of the philippines the defenders were losing ground day by day well the boise and the handful of other american ships in the western pacific hadnt done much to slow down the japanese attacks on malaya or the dutch east indies either here on the cruiser though he wasnt shivering with malaria he had plenty of chow it might not be great but it wasnt terrible either he wouldnt come down with amoebic dysentery if he ate it or drank water that wasnt heavily chlorinated if you wanted to fight a war in comfort a ship was the place to do itunless you got hit of course getting hit was bad news no matter where or how it happened it wouldnt happen right this minute that sub lurked somewhere deep in the sea with luck damaged by the ash cans the boise threw at it any which way the cruiser would be long gone before the sub surfaced again and then new zealand and hawaii sydney or melbourne in a way which choice hardly mattered they both meant that sooner or later the japs would get another chance at the boise and everybody she carried to say that the spanish republic wasnt rich only proved what a poor inadequate thing language could be sometimes vaclav jezek had heard that the republic had sent all its gold to russia for safekeeping and incidentally to buy weapons giving stalin your gold reserves struck him as the exact equivalent of handing a fox the keys to your chicken coop he might be here fighting for the republic but he had scant use for stalin because the republic was chronically broke soldiers pay chronically ran late he didnt much care about that he had little to spend money on but cigarettes and booze and he usually found enough in his pockets for those before long the spaniards doled out rank insignia so their people would know who was who and what was what among the czechs vaclav got two gold cloth stripes with red borders is the mark of a brigada the fellow who gave it to him said in german with a spanish accent strong enough to make it almost incomprehensible to jezek a sergeant they say in this language but im only a corporal vaclav answered also in german people from european armies we promote one grade the spaniard said you have combat experience soldiers from spain do not his face clouded the fascists they also this do with the men of the legion kondor oh terrific vaclav said fortunately in czech gaining a privilege because a pack of nazis also enjoyed it was the last thing he wanted but he damn well did have combat experience the locals lacked and if his pay went up to match the spanish rank hed get more money even if they stiffed him now and then so he managed to compose himself when he returned to german danke schon bitte the spaniard answered and showed himself a true student of kultur by clicking his heels germanstyle vaclav didnt tell him any czech despised that nonsense as a reminder of the notquitedeadenough austrohungarian past the fellow doubtless meant well then again when you thought about which road was paved with good intentions because benjamin halevy was already a sergeant the spaniards made him into a second lieutenant he took it for a joke which made vaclav think better of him i sure as hell never would have turned into an officer if id stayed in france the jew exclaimed maybe if youd gone to russia and done something brave the germans would have given you a battlefield promotion vaclav suggested with a sly grin halevy told him what he could do with any battlefield promotion won from the nazis it sounded uncomfortable especially if vaclav tried to do it sideways as the other man urged when the czech said so he found halevy remarkably unsympathetic by the time the spaniards got through none of the czechs had a grade lower than pfc and most of them were at least corporals it might matter when they dealt with the locals their relative ranks remained unchanged so for their own purposes the promotions gave some merriment but otherwise might as well not have happened more serious business for vaclav was picking off any of marshal sanjurjos officers who came within range of his elephant gun the nationalists made his murderous work easier by prominently displaying their rank badges and medals stupid he said after potting a fellow he thought was a colonel theyd be a lot safer if they showed off less but theyd be less macho halevy told him less what vaclav hadnt run into the spanish word before macho it means being tough for the sake of being tough it means if youve got a big cock you wear a codpiece so it looks even bigger its like elk growing antlers every spring so they can bang heads with other elk elk cant help growing antlers every spring vaclav protested spaniards or a lot of spaniards cant help showing how macho they are halevy said with a shrug if they had any brains they could jezek said that colonel would still be breathing if hed worn a privates tunic and kept his medals in the boxes they came in the way he was strutting around with all those gold stars and ribbons he might as well have written shoot me across his chest in big red letters if they had any brains vaclav how many of them would be officers in a fascist army benjamin halevy asked vaclav pondered that well youve got something there he admitted the next day the spanish papers that came out from madrid had big headlines the only problem was vaclav had no idea what those headlines said spanish was even more a closed book to him than french had been halevy who read french like the native he was could make a stab at written spanish just as a native czech speaker would recognize some written polish words and might be able to extract sense from a polish newspaper story somethings going on in england the jew reported somebodythe army i thinkdoesnt like the way the governments jumped into bed with the nazis and theyre trying to do something about it and vaclav said dont cocktease goddammit are they winning are they losing will england tell hitler where to head in thatd be something wouldnt it he imagined the royal navy and the raf pounding the hell out of germanheld europe again i dont know and halevy replied in an unwontedly small voice either the paper doesnt say or my spanish is too crappy for me to figure it out maybe theyre hanging traitors from lampposts or maybe the traitors are still running things and theyre translating deutschland uber alles into english right now give me that goddamn thing jezek snatched the newspaper out of halevys hand as usual the czechs and the men from the international brigade held adjoining stretches of the republican line the republic naturally grouped its best fighters together and the czech didnt take long to find somebody who could read spanish and speak german it just says theres unrest in england the international told him by the way the man pronounced his rs vaclav guessed he was a magyar had they met anywhere but in spain they probably would have quarreledhungary had sat on slovakia for centuries and mistrusted czechs for wanting to help slovaks here they both had bigger things to worry about whos winning vaclav asked as he had with halevy the magyar spread his hands well have to wait and see he said the guy who wrote this doesnt know hes trying to hide that so he wont look dumb but he doesnt vaclav made a disgusted noise down deep in his throat sounds like a newspaperman all right it sure does the magyar studied him the fellow had green eyes high cheekbones and an arrogant blade of a nose he looked the way vaclav would have expected a magyar to look in other words and he sounded faintly surprised when he added youre not such a fool are you for a czech he might have meant to magyars slovaks were nothing but bumpkins and czechs were a lot like slovaks so vaclav thought slovaks were bumpkins too and fascistloving bumpkins at that but he knew magyars were dead wrong about czechs how did he know by being a czech himself of course well i try he said dryly heh the magyar said he tapped the paper with his left hand the little finger was missing its last joint thanks for bringing this i hadnt seen it yet if england really is having second thoughts that could be big what do you think the odds are either shell change her mind or she wont right now you can toss a coin the magyar answered grimacing vaclav nodded if you tried to guess when you didnt know enough you were bound to end up looking like an idiot the magyar declined that dubious honor declining made sense vaclav still knew what he hoped theo hossbach didnt like any ss men as a general working rule he disliked the waffen ss less than the other branches though men who joined the ss intending to fight foreign foes took more risks than the ones who joined to hit prisoners who couldnt fight back these bastards were still bastards unlike their comrades in the black corps they were brave bastards hed seen that in france waffen ss units there went straight at obstacles the wehrmacht would have tried to outflank or would have ignored altogether sometimes taking a position was more expensive than it was worth so it seemed to the wehrmacht anyhow so it certainly seemed to theo the ss men looked at things differently sometimes they bulled through where the wehrmacht would have hesitated perhaps not least because the enemy often thought they wouldnt be crazy enough to attack here sometimes they got slaughtered for their trouble not that theo necessarily thought slaughtering ss men a bad idea he did disapprove of waste though even when the ss broke through its butchers bill was higher than the wehrmacht s would have been right now theo and adi stoss and hermann witt were messing with their panzer iiis transmission trying to figure out which gear in the train didnt want to mesh and whether they had or could get their hands on a replacement the ivans dont worry about shit like this adi said their drivers have a mallet next to their seat when a gear doesnt want to engage they give the stick a good whack that makes the son of a bitch behave youre making that up sergeant witt said i know the russians can be rude and crude with their equipment but thats over the line even for them lothar eckhardt the panzers gunner and kurt poske the loader watched without saying much they were both new men much less experienced than the three veterans theo wished it were a new panzer iii but no somebody else got the new machines this one was a handmedown not so old and beatup as the panzer ii that was now being cannibalized for spare parts if its carcass had been brought in and quietly rusting if it hadnt adi raised his right hand with the first two fingers raised and crooked as if he were swearing an oath in court honest to god sergeant ive seen the damn things with my own eyes me too theo rarely contributed to the conversation but a fact was a factand this one cost him only a couple of words well fuck me witt said mildly heinz naumann wouldnt have let his juniors get away with disagreeing with him even when they were rightmaybe especially when they were theo missed naumann not a bit and suspected adi missed him even less than that seeing that a fact was a fact even when it wasnt his fact was one of the many things that made witt a better panzer commander than naumann had ever dreamt of being adi pounced with a wrench three minutes later he held the culprit in the palm of his hand will you look at that he said one tooth gone and another one going no wonder things were getting sticky no wonder at all witt agreed have we got a new one we can swap in im pretty sure we dont adi said witt nodded unhappily im pretty sure youre right he tossed the toothed steel disk to eckhardt go on back to the maintenance section and get a replacement check it out before you take it too dont let em give you one thats had new teeth welded on theyll tell you its just as good but thats a bunch of crap the kid looked shocked he was very fair and couldnt have been above nineteenhe hardly needed to shave theyd try to dump defective stuff on us listen to me witt spoke with great conviction you know the russians are the enemy right but your own side will screw you just as hard if you give em half a chance go on now scoot theo wondered if witt would ask adi or him to go along with eckhardt but the sergeant didnt the new guys had to learn the ropes whenever you had the chance you broke them in a little at a time trouble was a fastmoving campaignwhich this one had become now that the mud was drydidnt always give you chances like that witt pulled out a pack of junos and offered everybody else a smoke we may as well take ten he said we sure arent going anywhere till he comes back with that gear new green grass was pushing up through the dirt and through the grayyellow dead growth from the year before theo sat down and sucked in smoke not far away a skylark sang sweetly the clear trilled notes couldnt drown out the distant rumble of artillery though theo cocked his head to one side listening to the guns ours he decided and relaxed fractionally another panzer crew was working on their machine at the far edge of the field resting infantrymen sprawled in clumps between the two panzers they all wore ss runes on helmets and collar patches they were eating or smoking or passing around water bottles that probably didnt hold water some of them lay with their eyes closed grabbing a little sleep while they could they were doing all the things wehrmacht foot soldiers would have done in other words theo still looked at them differently anybody could end up in the army he had for instance so had adi stoss you had to volunteer for the waffen ss and you wouldnt do that unless you were a convinced nazi they wouldnt take you unless they were sure you were a convinced nazi either so that worked both ways one of the guys propped up on an elbow maybe ten meters away bummed a chunk of black bread from his buddy and squeezed butter onto it from a tinfoil tube theos stomach rumbled he told it to shut up it didnt want to listen can you believe those stupid goddamn frenchmen the trooper asked after he swallowed a heroic bite of bread jesus christ but that was chickenshit for twenty pfennigs i wouldve blown the fuckin froggies a new asshole with my schmeisser answered the other man from the waffen ss theos stomach rumbled again once more he told it to keep quiet it might not want to listen but all of a sudden he did the first fellow who wore the runes couldnt have looked more disgusted had he tried for a week once we finish with the ivans were gonna have to do for the froggies all right he said its a hell of a note when we cant give the hebes what they deserve on account of our socalled friends dont like it he spat in the dirt damn straight his friend agreed damn straight this whole stupid stinking war its about reds and kikes if the frenchmen cant see that tough shit for them thats all ive got to say amen the first trooper said as if in church the fuhrer s gonna bring things around to the way theyre supposed to be even if hes got to wipe out all the goddamn jews to do it the other fellow with the ss collar tab nodded then started cleaning his submachine gun ever so casually theos gaze swung toward adi stoss he wouldnt have been surprised to find adi hopping mad or else sizzling inside and trying to pretend he wasnt but the panzer driver lay on his back his hands clasped behind his head staring up at the clouds drifting across the watery blue sky if hed paid any attention to what the infantrymen were saying he gave no sign lothar eckhardt came back with the gear he anxiously showed it to sergeant witt is it all right he quavered no doubt he was imagining bread and water if not a blindfold and a last cigarette at dawn if the answer was no the panzer commander carefully inspected the part if it wasnt all right he would go back to the maintenance section and give those clowns a piece of his mind but he nodded looks good they knew they couldnt pull a fast one on you so they didnt even try wow eckhardt breathed now you and kurt are going to install the son of a bitch witt said the more you know about keeping your panzer running on your own the better off youll be one of these days youll run into trouble where you cant go off to the mechanics eckhardt and poske both gulped im not sure we know how to do that sergeant the loader said which could only mean we have no idea how to do that witt chuckled he understood at least as well as theo adi and i will coach you he said it isnt black magic it isnt even real hard as long as you dont mind getting your hands dirty and youd damn well better not now come on both of you he led them back to the waiting panzer iii chapter going back to madrid was nothing new for chaim weinberg going back to madrid with money in his pocket was he was carrying the proverbial elephantchoking roll hed played a lot of poker since coming to spain hed played a lot of poker before he came to spain too which didnt hurt when luck and skill came together he shook his head in wonder hed never known a night when luck and skill came together like the night before fins sawbucks pound notes fivers it was just about all good money not asswipes like pesetas and francs poker after all was serious business it brought out the hard currency on rattled the ancient beatup french truck chaim tried to listen for aircraft noises over the engines farting and the rattle of stones off the undercarriage of course a nationalist bomber or a legion kondor messerschmitt would pick this exact moment to target this ratty truck but none did brakes squealinghell brakes shriekingthe truck shuddered to a stop raus the driver yelled he wasnt a german he was an estonian or something like that but he knew raus was something everybody in the back of the truck would get and everybody did out scrambled the soldiers the spanish kid who hopped down just in front of chaim mimed rubbing at his abused kidneys chaim chuckled and nodded he looked around as always madrid saddened and awed him at the same time you could kill tens of thousands of people if you bombed the crap out of a big city everyone between the wars had seen that clearly the heavyduty thinkers hadnt understood just how big a big city was though with the worst will in the world bombers couldnt smash all of one and bombing a city didnt cow the people it failed to kill instead it really pissed them off the heavyduty thinkers missed that one toomissed it by a mile they underestimated the proletariats resilience and the bourgeoisies though chaim had no great use for the bourgeoisie either so madrid looked like hell streets were cratered buildings had chunks bitten out of them there were mounds of rubble that had been buildings in happier times window glass was a prodigy whenever chaim caught a glimpse of some his head started to whip around as if toward a pretty girl communist party headquarters where his own particular pretty girl worked had taken a pounding naturally the nationalists wanted to knock it flat but you couldnt hit one building in particular with highaltitude bombingone more place where the theorists had it wrong and enough antiaircraft guns surrounded the place to make even the most fanatical stuka pilot think twice before tipping his plane into a dive men from one of the gun crews waved to chaim as he walked into the building they recognized him by now you lucky soandso one of them calledthey knew who la martellita was too chaim laughed and waved back if his spanish ladylove was glad to see him she hid it very well what are you doing here she snapped when she looked up from the report she was working on chaim couldnt read spanish upside down he wondered what the report was about and how many people would wind up in trouble because of it party reports always landed people in troublethat was what they were for he counted himself lucky that none of la martellitas reports had had his name in them what am i here for ill show you babe chaim reached into one of his front pockets and extracted the roll he wasnt dumb enough to carry it in a hip pocket where it practically begged to get stolen he started peeling off greenbacks and british banknotes and laying them on the desk one after another here you go these are for youand for the kid claro he startled her enough so she couldnt keep from showing it where did you get all this she asked as if sure he couldnt have come by it honestly i earned it by oppressing the working class communist or not chaim made that kind of joke without even thinking about it but he did have to think about it to translate it into spanish and thinking about it this time made him decide not to translate it la martellita wouldnt appreciate it that should have warned that they werent destined for many long and happy years together but she was stunning she tasted good and she felt even better infatuation had blinded plenty before him it wasnt likely to stop after he ran aground either instead of joking he said cards and let it go at that she was counting the money and he supposed turning the count into pesetas you dont win like this all the time she said accurately querida nobody wins like this all the time nobody who doesnt cheat anyhow chaim answered also accurately but at least i have the sense to use the money im not going to waste it and i didnt lose it all again as fast as i won it you didnt gamble the sun away before morning la martellita said it sounded like a proverb but it wasnt one chaim had heard before the sun he echoed one of the conquistadores in peru got a big golden sun disk as his share of the loot from the incas he lost it at dice before the real sun came up la martellita explained gotcha chaim knew plenty of guys like that spaniards werent the only ones who came down with gambling fever oh nonot even close she looked from the cash on the desk in front of her to him and back again you didnt waste it or lose it again she agreed slowly you brought it to me why why do you think he knew he sounded irritable but he couldnt help it because i want to take care of the baby the best way i can and because i love you speaking spanish imperfectly meant he had to say what was on his mind he couldnt beat around the bush as he might have in english saying what was on his mind didnt necessarily help him though by the look on la martellitas face she was on the point of laughing in his she didntquitedo that she did say the more fool you the peoples cause matters more than any personal attachments really he said what is the peoples cause if it isnt to make people happy with other people it has nothing to do with love la martellita insisted what a pity chaim answeredque lastima sounded much more pitiful to him than its english equivalent did a slow flush heated her oliveskinned face she tossed her head in annoyance as if that could make the blush go away she might have wanted to tell him where to head in but she didnt quite do that either not with all the money hed given her still sitting on top of her desk her elegant nostrils flared you enjoy being as difficult as you can she accused im sure marshal sanjurjos soldiers agree with you he said they probably talk about it a lot down in hell none of this would have happened if i hadnt got drunk that one night was she reminding him or herself you cant pretend it didnt happen though with a certain sardonic relish chaim added its part of the historical dialectic now after all those gullwinged nostrils flared again wider this time and i suppose youll tell me its part of the historical dialectic that i should sleep with you some more because you thought to bring me this money well ill tell you right now that the historical dialectic hasnt made me your puta chaim had been thinking about saying something like that if he could find a way to do it that wasnt quite so blunt since shed forestalled him all he said was the historical dialectic did turn you into my wife si la martellita answered that wasnt delight filling her voice no matter how much chaim wished it would have been i am trying to take care of you and take care of our child the way a husband ought to he said im doing my best si she said again a little more warmly this time maybe maybe ill do the things a wife ought to do as long as you dont try to make me do them that kind of reply should have made him bang his head against the wall coming from la martellita who was mercury fulminate in a sweetly curved wrapper it made a weird kind of sense whatever you say chaim told her which only proved him a born optimist alistair walsh had spent some time in the stockade and in civilian jails as well boys will be boys and soldier boys will be soldier boys sometimes the police military or otherwise showed up before the tavern brawl finished hed never hurt anybody badly in those little dustups and hed never spent long behind bars things were different this time and he liked none of the differences if they jugged you for rearranging a blokes face after he tried to smash a pint mug over your head you knew what youd done and you knew how long youd stay jugged on account of it if they jugged you for treason though in that case they were making up the rules as they went along hed asked for a solicitor they didnt laugh in his face but they didnt give him one either they might as well not have heard him but when they asked him questions they expected answers oh yes no one asked you questions after a barroom brawl except maybe why were you such a bloody idiot here they wanted to know everybody hed ever met what all those people had said in the past six months and what hed said to them they werent just building a case against him he was a minnow they were trying to use him to hook the big fish they werent fussy about how they went at it either bright lights lack of sleep no wonder you back the buggers who threw in with the nazis he told one of them the ss must have taught you all its tricks that won him a slap in the face they didnt bring out the thumbscrews and the hot skewers he wondered why not some lingering memory of the days when they were decent coppers it seemed too much to hope for they told him all the other traitors were in cells too they told him the others were singing like canaries they told him half a dozen people had named him as one of the earliest and most deeply involved plotters then you dont need me to tell you anything more do you he said he got another wallop in the chops for that when his ears stopped ringing one of the detectivesif that was what they weresaid you can make it easier on yourself if you give us what you know if you think im a traitor you wont go easy on me any road walsh said he might be sore he might be half drunk with sleepiness no matter what he was that seemed obvious to him the interrogators muttered amongst themselves things didnt seem to be going the way they wanted one of them gave him another whack talk damn you the bastard bellowed blood salty on his tongue walsh rattled off his name former rank and pay number the scotland yard man glowered you arent in the army any more and you arent a prisoner of war either then give me a solicitor walsh said yet again he got another slap for his trouble he also got frogmarched back to his cell he counted that a victory of sorts hed made them change plans which was worth what anything they didnt let him see newspapers of course they also didnt let him listen to the bbc that they still held him and went on knocking him around argued that sir horace wilson remained prime minister and that england remained allied to hitler if they decided he was too big a nuisanceor if they decided he didnt know anything they had to learnthey might just knock him over the head and get rid of his body they went on and on about traitors but they were at least as far outside the law as any traitors could be they fed him slop and precious little of it hed eaten more and better in the trenches he couldnt think of anything worse to say about prison rations then one day they opened his cell at an unexpected time alarm ran through him even before one of them pointed a service revolver at his head any jailbird quickly learns that breaks in routine arent intended for his benefit come on you the pistol packer snarled where why walsh asked shut up get moving you waste my time its the last dumb thing youll ever do the fellow from scotland yard seemed to be trying to sound like an american tough guy in the movies only his accent spoiled the effect something rattled outside if that wasnt a machine gun walsh had never heard one and if that was a machine gun walsh held out his hand here youd better give me that he said as if to a little boy you dont want the soldiers to catch you carrying it soldiers what soldiers im not afraid of no bleeding soldiers the copper kept talking tough the wobble in his voice gave him away outside the machine gun brayed again youll be doing the bleeding any minute now walsh said come on hand over your toy what do you think it can do against the kind of firepower the armys got anyway something blew up a lot closer than the stuttering machine gun helpfully walsh explained thats a mills bomba hand grenade if you like theyre going to get in here they wont like it if they catch you with a weapon in your hand glumly the copper handed him the webley and scott two other scotland yard men moving with slow caution laid their pistols on the ground walsh was tempted to plug each of them in turn after he scooped up the weapons not without regret he refrained pounding feet announced the arrival of soldiers no one not in the military stomped with that percussive rhythm over here walsh called ive got em some of the men carried rifles with fixed bayonets one of the bayonets dripped blood a police official must have made a fatal mistake at the soldiers head was the major with whom walsh had examined downing street he cradled a tommy gun as gently as if it were a baby hullo old man he said were in the driving seat now first job of this sort in upwards of two hundred and fifty years but weve brought it off thats one of the scotland yard men began the tommy guns muzzle swung in his direction he went pale as skimmed milk whatever his detailed opinion was he kept it to himself he wasnt a complete fool then walsh had had his doubts elections soon the major went on well let the people have their say about what weve done if theyre daft enough to want to go along with the nazis he rolled his eyes to show what he thought of that but in the meanwhile our troops in russia are ordered to hold in place against anyoneanyone at allwho attacks them well get them out of there quick as we can but what if old adolf goes after them hammer and tongs walsh knew he sounded worried and well he mighthe had more than a few friends fighting in russia theyre hostages to the fritzes you might say its possible but i dont believe its likely hitler would have to be raving mad to do anything like that hed be handing stalin four prime divisions on a silver platter eh the major replied that made perfect sense walsh wondered why hearing it didnt reassure him more probably because when dealing with hitler the most perfectly sensible things turned out to be nonsense after all as often as not changing the subject looked like a good idea where are sir horace and the cabinet theyre safe none of them tried anything foolish the major answered without giving details which didnt surprise walsh the scotland yard man whod handed over his pistol worked up the nerve to ask what does the king think of all this one of the reasons edwards off in bermuda is he was too pally by half with adolf and musso the major said as soon as general wavell brought his majesty word the government had ah changed king george knighted him on the spot and queen elizabeth god bless her kissed him all the captured coppers seemed to shrink in on themselves theyd been following orders and theyd been just as sure they were following the path of righteousness almost everyone was walsh supposed even hitler didnt face the mirror when he shaved each morning and think today ill go out and do something really evil but if enough others thought that was what he was doing well in that case england got the most abrupt change of government since james ii bailed out one jump ahead of the incoming william and mary and a good thing too he thought or else they would have hanged me lieutenant colonel tomashevsky looked out at the assembled soviet flyers in his squadron today we bomb west of chernigov he said our targets are the german and hungarian troops in the area noti repeat notthe english expeditionary force the english have seen reason they are no longer hostile to the workers and peasants of the soviet union which means hitlers fascist hyenas and the jackals who follow them are now hostile to the english if a quarter of what the soviet radio and newspapers were saying was truealways an interesting question as anastas mouradian had reason to knowthe nazis were doing their level best to smash the english expeditionary force for presuming to change sides and as any soviet citizen had reason to know the nazis level best was liable to be entirely too good do noti repeat do notbomb english positions tomashevsky went on english soldiers are crossing the soviet lines they will be repatriated so they can rejoin the struggle against fascism english troops will mark their positions with union jacks spread out on the ground all sorts of interesting questions occurred to stas on account of that the union jacks might ward off soviet bombers but theyd surely attract the luftwaffe which worried the english more and how would those soldiers get back to their homeland by sea from murmansk or arkhangelsk running the uboat gantlet or would they go down through persia and take ship there again running the uboat gantlet questions tomashevsky asked stas hand went up tomashevsky pointed to him the armenian didnt ask any of those questions he knew he wouldnt get an answer for them no the one he did ask was purely practical excuse me comrade colonel but what do we do if we suspect the germans are setting out union jacks to keep us from bombing them bomb those positions the squadron commander answered but youd better be right if you do our superiors will not be happy if they hear reports from the english that the red air force attacked them youll end up in the gulag if you bomb englishmen mouradian had no trouble working out the underlying meaning there by the looks on the faces of the men around him neither did they when he and his bombaimer went out to their pe the young karelian said well have to be careful about what we hit he wanted to make sure stas got it yes i figured that out thanks mouradian answered dryly ivan kulkaanen nodded back his expression remained serious and he seemed not the least bit embarrassed staying out of the gulag was important business at least as important as fighting the foreign invaders sergeant mechnikov greeted his superiors with so its back to bombing the nazis is it well the bombs dont care whose heads they fall on plainly he didnt care whose heads he dropped them on and why should he his work stayed the same no matter who the enemy was one of the crews had for stalin painted on its pes fuselage in big red letters right behind the soviet star did that make them more likely to be reckoned politically reliable or did it just make them more likely to get shot down if it made both more likely did the one protect more than the other endangered soviet life was full of interesting questions the pe jounced down the unpaved runway and climbed into the air a lot more power than the old sb stas remarked as he leveled off well i should hope so kulkaanen exclaimed it was a hot plane once upon a time mouradian said one of these days this beast will be just as obsolete oh sure the bombaimer said thats the way things work he took it for granted if his narrow new soviet manstyle soul held any room for nostalgia he wouldnt be so weak as to show it im supposed to be a new soviet man too stas thought for some reason the indoctrination hadnt taken with him the way a smallpox vaccination sometimes didnt he wondered what had gone wrong in his case maybe it was just that he was an armenian he wasnt so good at swallowing things whole as most russians were although plenty of his countrymen were or at least seemed to be ideal new soviet men and women a few badly aimed rounds of antiaircraft fire came up at them as they droned southwest they were still over terrain the red army held some new soviet men down below feared they belonged to the luftwaffe that made those nervous gunners new soviet idiots but it happened on almost every mission sergeant mechnikov expressed his opinion of the antiaircraft crews through the speaking tube the chimp couldnt have put it better mouradian wondered howand whetherkuchkov was doing these days what should have been the front was mostly confusion english troops were crossing the soviet line red army men were rushing in to take their places and tear a hole in the enemy position the germans were doing their damnedest not to let any of that happen bombs burst among the english positions stas looked around wondering whether some of his squadronmates were dropping too soon but those bombs didnt come from soviet planes the luftwaffe had bombers in the neighborhood too mouradian spotted two stacked vs of dos the flying pencils were unmistakable and not just because of the yellow band the nazis painted on the fuselages of their ostfront aircraft no one else built bombers with such skinny bodies even the germans used that flying pencil nickname for their dorniers no matter how slim the dos were they didnt perform much better than the ussrs obsolescent sbs stas current mount could fly rings around them the pe was pretty skinny too since it was originally intended as a heavy fighter and so stas swung the pe into a sharp right turn what the kulkaanen exclaimed im going to get after those germans stas answered a moment later another startled question came from his radio earphones he gave the squadron co the same answer several silent seconds followed as lieutenant colonel tomashevsky considered it at last he said our mission is to keep the fascists from harassing the english now that theyve come to their senses youre doing that good luck spasibo stas said dryly he noticed that none of the other pilots was peeling off to attack the dorniers that made his own job harder it also made his russian comrades as imaginative as so many oysters he chuckled sourly tell me something i didnt already know he thought one of the things he did already know was which flying pencil he wanted the last and highest in the second v that was the fellow least able to protect himself and also the one whose buddies could help him least the dos pilot and crew didnt notice him till he was almost close enough to open up only one machine gun at the back of the cockpit would bear on him he had two forwardfiring machine guns and two mm cannon to go with them as tracers whipped past the pe he watched chunks fly off the german bombers wing flame licked caught spread the dornier went into a spin the pilot hadnt a prayer of controlling kulkaanen whooped good shooting he yelled thanks stas wanted more german planes but the flying pencil hed attacked must have radioed a warning to its friends before it went down the rest of the dos dove for the deck as fast as they would go he might have caught them had he chased them then again s might be on the way to give them a hand a pe could give a good account of itself against a messerschmitt but it wasnt something you wanted to try unless you had no choice he did have a choice and made ithe flew back toward the rest of the soviet bombers he also had a mission to fulfill even though hed shot down the german plane he still needed to do that orders were and always would be orders to say hideki fujita was not a happy man was to prove the power of understatement hed got demoted to corporal for letting the three americans escape from pingfan and hed got a hell of a beating besides then when neither japanese nor manchukuan patrols managed to stumble across the white men on the loose he got another beating this one worse than the first adding insult to injuryliterallyhe remained on watch at the americans compound his superiors left him in no doubt about what would happen to him if any more yankees got away that would be the last mistake he was ever allowed to make selfpreservation made him tighten things up even more than was usual at pingfan the americans compound ran by the clock as if it were a factory cranking out fords any prisoner in there who was late for a roll call or a lineup or even slow in bowing to a japanese guard got pounded on with fists and boots and rifle butts fujita would have done worse than that to them had the scientistofficers who ran pingfan not made it plain they needed the americans in relatively good shape that disgusted him he couldnt even wallop the yankees as hard as his own people had walloped himsome of his bruises were a long time fading where was the fairness in that on the other hand those scientistofficers didnt take him inside the enormous walledoff facility that was pingfans beating heart he didnt know what happened to the maruta who went in there not in any detail he wasnt interested in finding out either and unless you were a scientist yourself once you went behind those high walls you didnt come out again not alive anyhow for a little while hed feared hed infuriated the authorities enough to make them decide to turn him into a maruta next to that fate a couple of beatings didnt seem so bad the sergeant soon set over him a bruiser named toshiyaki wakamatsu made him remember all the reasons hed despised sergeants before becoming one himself wakamatsu was loudmouthed and brutal he fawned on officers but wouldnt listen to anyone of rank lower than his own was i like that fujita wondered he hoped not but feared he might have been he couldnt ask the enlisted men from his squad theyd never give him a straight answer any more than he would give one to wakamatsu giving straight answers was a most unjapanese thing to do you told your superiors what you thought they wanted to hear if they had any sense they knew how to interpret what you said if they didnt their heads swelled up with all the praise you lavished on them sergeant wakamatsu had his own way of dealing with the americans he couldnt talk to them any more than fujita had been able to fujita had learned that some of the americans knew scraps of chinese senior private hayashi spoke chinese fluently fujita said not a word of that to the man now holding down his place neither did hayashi his silence made the demoted noncom feel good the clever senior private still felt loyal to himor at least didnt want to do the blowhard whod taken his slot any favors instead of talking to the americans wakamatsu gestured to show what he wanted when the prisoners didnt catch on fast enough to suit him he clouted them that helped him less than hed seemed to think it would bakatare bakayaro he roared at the yanks had he really expected them to cooperate if he had he was an idiot himself even if he called them by that name prisoners might have lost their honor simply by letting themselves be captured but they didnt go out of their way to help their captors anyone with a gram of sense should have been able to see that since sergeant wakamatsu couldnt fujita did his best to stay out of the sergeants way his new superior was setting himself up to crash and burn fujita didnt want to catch fire when wakamatsu did he hardly cared if the authorities gave him back his old collar tabs he kept an eye on the american named herman szulc wakamatsu still hadnt figured out that szulc was a leading troublemaker and szulc had a buddy a smaller fellow called max weinstein one look at that fellow and anyone with a suspicious mind would hear alarm bells weinstein knew some chinese fujita had heard him jabbering with the laborers who did the work around pingfan that the japanese didnt care to do for themselves sergeant wakamatsu must have heard him too did wakamatsu take any special notice fujita was convinced wakamatsu wouldnt have noticed his own cock if he didnt need to piss through it now and then what is the american saying fujita asked senior private hayashi when ive heard him hes been trying to get extra food from the chinese the conscripted student answered what do you suppose hes talking about with them when youre not around to hear fujita persisted please excuse me sergeant san i mean corporal san but how am i supposed to know that hayashi sounded and looked as exasperated as an inferior could afford to do when responding to a superiors stupid question but fujita still didnt think it was so very stupid come on use your fancy brains he snapped is the american a red have the chinese reds infiltrated our labor force the japanese often worried more about communists in china than they did about the forces that followed chiang kaisheks government the communists were sneakier than the regular chinese forces and they made more trouble they were committed to what they did in ways the regular chinese forces couldnt approach all the same senior private hayashi replied how can an american be a red the yankees hate communists almost as much as we do maybe fujita replied in tones that declared he didnt believe it for a minute and he had his reasons too in that case how come theyre cheering when england stops helping germany and starts helping the miserable stinking russians again he knew exactly how he felt about the russians how else could he feel considering the too many times theyd come too close to killing him to his surprise senior private hayashi had a comeback i think its because hitler scares roosevelt corporal san he said hitler scares just about everybody he would scare us too if he werent on the far side of the world nothing scares japan fujita declared of course corporal san hayashi might have been humoring a boy who was too little to know hed come out with something silly nothing does dammit the nettled fujita said if anything scared us would we have beaten the red army if anything scared us would we go to war against america and england at the same time as were fighting in china hayashi pursed his lips as if wondering how much he might safely say he and fujita had served side by side in mongolia and siberia before coming to pingfan even so he chose his words with obvious care i hope it doesnt happen that we bit off more than we can chew dont be silly the navy is kicking the crap out of the american fleet fujita said the yanks are on the run the philippines are falling if the americans want a war with us theyll have to fight their way through islands that belong to us honto honto hayashi said because it was true somehow though even his agreement sounded dubious fujita didnt push it hed lost face as well as rank he didnt want to antagonize someone who still seemed to respect him he went back to what theyd been talking about before do pay attention to that weinstein if he starts talking to the chinamen about anything but food shall i tell sergeant wakamatsu hayashi broke in oh yes of course thats just what you should do no one could claim fujita hadnt given the proper response if his tone didnt match his words well how could you report something like that he and hayashi both smiled yes they understood each other all right chapter bam bam bam a battery of german mm antiaircraft guns thundered away at the russian bombers high overhead willi dernen watched puffs of black smoke appear among the planes none of them caught fire and fell out of the sky though how many thousands of meters up there were they however many it was they didnt make easy targets even though the gunners kept missing willi waved to them as he trudged past their position he liked having s around they might have been designed as flak guns but the high muckymucks had made sure they could do other tricks too they had armorpiercing rounds in their inventory for instance and a highvelocity ap round from an could make even a kv say uncle when the huge soviet panzers laughed at almost every other weapon in the german inventory come on dernen get it in gear arno baatz barked jawohl herr unteroffizier willi answered as abjectly as if awful arno were a field marshal not a lousy corporal he did get it in gear toofor half a dozen paces as soon as baatz started yapping at someone else willi slowed down again he hadnt figured it would take long and it didnt naughty naughty adam pfaff said in a prisonyard whisper awful arno would never hear ahh your mother willis reply was no louder they both chuckled as they marched on hating the noncoms set over you was as old and as universal as soldiering willi was sure the ivans privates couldnt stand their corporals and sergeants either he would have bet the japanese and the amis felt the same way caesars legionaries must have felt the same way too so did king davids warriors chances were when willi told that to pfaff his buddy snorted who cares what davids guys thought said the landser with the gray mauser they were nothing but a bunch of kikes willi laughed but nervously he eyed pfaff from under the beetling brim of his stahlhelm was pfaff joking or did he mean that willi had no enormous use for jews but he didnt get all hot and bothered about them he figured the nazis hot air was just that and no more most of the soldiers in his outfit seemed to feel the same way most but not all some landsers took all the hot air as seriously as ss men would and some of these russian villages and towns were chock full of jews hed watched some bad things happen he hadnt joined in but he also hadnt tried to stop anything or report anybody reporting he knew instinctively was a waste of time at best and might land him in trouble better to look the other way so far as he knew pfaff hadnt killed kikes for the fun of it or soaked a jews beard in oil and set it on fire or done anything else along those lines so far as he knew his buddy hadnt gangraped any jewishor russianwomen either but that was only so far as he knew one of the things he knew for sure was that he didnt know very far artillery shells howled past overhead those werent from the s they were s searching for the russians on the ground and it didnt sound as if any of them would fall dangerously short you were just as maimed if your own sides shell blew off your leg as you were when the enemy did it to you mgs rattled off to the northeast slowerfiring russian machine guns answered willis stomach knotted the way it always did when he got close to places where he could get hurt he unslung his rifle and made sure he had a cartridge in the chamber ready to have some fun he asked aber naturlich adam pfaff said as gaily as if he were a girl willi had invited to dance but this was the totentanz and not everyone would get up after the drumbeat of death stopped lets go forward well give the untermenschen the hiding theyve got coming to them awful arno shouted he was a true believer in all the stuff dr goebbels cranked out sure as hell but then he said the magic words follow me he might beas far as willi was concerned he had to bethe biggest unwiped asshole in the history of the world if only he were yellow that would have made the perfect finish for his personality such as it was a maraschino cherry on a bowl of ice cream so to speak but whatever else you could say about arno baatz you couldnt call him a coward he was as brave as anyone could want a soldier to be and then a little more besides and anyone who yelled follow me commonly found men who would follow a noncom or officer laying his own life on the line got landsers to do the same even colonels and generals led from the front in this war people whod gone through the mill the last time talked about how their superiors stayed kilometers behind the line and ordered them to their doom no more those mgs were firing from hastily dug foxholes not from a regular trench line with the front so fluid there was no regular trench line soldiers in feldgrau crouched in other foxholes and sprawled behind scrapes that might or might not stop a bullet some of them got up and advanced with the newly arrived units others stayed right where they were they did lay down supporting fire for the troops moving forward willi gave them some credit for that a bullet cracked past his head he threw himself flat and wriggled forward on his belly through grass tall enough to hide him from the russiansas long as he didnt do anything stupid like sticking his butt in the air anyhow every so often hed go up on one knee fire and then flatten out again nobody was tracking his movements anyhow the proof of which was he didnt get killed when he popped up he wondered how the russians used this stretch of ground when no one was fighting over it did they graze sheep or cattle or horses on it or did it just lie here not doing anything germany didnt have much land like that but russia seemed full of it the country was so goddamn big that even though it had a lot of people it didnt have nearly enough to use all these vast sweeps of ground this one might have been forgottenor for all willi knew maybe no one had ever paid enough heed to it to begin with for anybody to forget it now the direction from which enemy fire came told him which way to crawl the grass smelled all green and growing a rich scent rose from the black earth too willi might be a city boy but his nose said the ivans were missing a bet by not raising wheat or beets or something right here then that nose of his almost ran into the snub nose of a red army soldier crawling through the grass toward the german positions both men yelped in horror neither had had the slightest idea the other was there till the sea of grass parted and they nearly banged heads willi tried to aim his mauser at the russian the ivan had a rifle too but jerked his hand away from it as if it were redhot kamerad he bleated and freund after that he gabbled out a stream of russian of which willi understood not a word he could have murdered the red army man in cold blood he had no doubt awful arno would have plugged the ivan without a second thought or even a first one but the guy was trying to surrender willi supposed he was anyhow the russian didnt say boo when willi grabbed his rifle then willi frisked himhe didnt want to send the guy on his way and end up catching a grenade like the english the russians used round bombs they held less explosive than a german potatomasher but you could throw them farther willi confiscated the three on the ivans belt and his sheathed bayonet too he found the soldiers identity book it had a photograph of the guy and a bunch of writing in an alphabet that was just squiggles to willi he handed it back to the ivan why not it wasnt any use to him he jerked his thumb toward the southwest the direction from which the german advance was coming the russian gave forth with what willi guessed were thanks he was pretty sure spasibo meant danke anyhow go on willi said roughly hoping he hadnt missed any lethal hardwareor that if he had the dirty scaredlooking sorry son of a bitch in khaki wasnt inclined to use it off ivan went what happened to him afterwards willi never knew he cared very little the guy didnt double back on him or have a spare grenade willid missed that willi cared about he crawled on the landsers behind the line could send the russian to a pow camp or they could shoot him if they decided theyd sooner do that it wasnt willis worry the red army men still ahead were out through the kiel canal the abrupt change in the us motion would have told julius lemp when they got out into open water even if hed been below but he was up on the uboats conning tower as soon as the north sea waves started slapping the boat she began rolling in the way hed found so familiar for so long one of the ratings up there with him didnt take the new motion for granted like the skipper fuck me the sailor said gulping id forgotten how rough it gets out on the open sea if youve got to puke hans dont puke into the wind lemp advised the idea is to get rid of what ails you not to wear it right hans gulped again if you cant keep scanning ill send you below with a bucket and call up somebody who can lemp said now that englands turned her coat weve got to worry about the royal navy and the raf again they arent halfassed like the russians give them even a piece of a chance and theyll sink us ill stay skipper hans said quickly lemp would have said the same thing in his unhappy place up here the fresh air fought seasickness down inside the reeking pressure hull the boats rolling would have a potent pungent ally all the same lemp knew he would have to watch hans as well as the horizon he hadnt been joking anyone inefficient up here would have to go you might get away with taking chances against the sloppy slavs against the english a good thing everyone had a will on file diesels thrumming through the soles of lemps shoes the u made fifteen knots on a course a little west of due north the boat would round norways southwestern bulge and then follow the countrys coastline farther north and east too many tommies on the ostfront had made their way through soviet lines the easiest fastest way to bring them back to england would be to ship them out of arkhangelsk or murmansk the fuhrer didnt want them to come homeand who could blame him sooner or later probably sooner theyd get back into the war against the reich better to send the freighters or liners carrying them to the bottom then germany wouldnt need to worry about them any more perfidious albion lemp muttered his breath smoked spring might be here but the north sea was damned if it wanted to admit it whats that skipper hans asked nothing just swearing at the damned limeys theyre a pain all right the rating agreed hows your insides not too bad as long as i dont think about em maybe ill cuss england out too somebodywhether it was hans or not lemp didnt knowgave back a meal inside the hull before they put in at namsos on their way north that made the stink in there worse but not by so much as an outsider might have expected it wasnt the first time somebodyd heaved in the boat and an overturned bucket meant the nasty stuff had got into the bilgewater once that happened a stench would stay with the u as long as the boat lasted the kriegsmarine had started to fit namsos out as a uboat base after the town fell then with the war against england and france suddenly forgotten the work was forgotten too now the waror part of it anywaywas on again and so was the work namsos probably hadnt been an exciting place before the wehrmacht took it away from its defenders it was a real mess now german crews with torches went about carving up the english warships and freighters that had gone down in shallow water trying to resupply and evacuate the town the steel would be useful whatever could be salvaged intact even more so namsos itself could have used cutting up and salvaging too bombing and artillery meant hardly a building didnt have a chunk or two bitten out of it lemp saw only a few norwegians most of them looked sullen if they were delighted to have come under german occupation they hid it very well two or three men wore the uniform of the nasjonal samling the norwegian equivalent of the german nsdap the head of the ns a former officer named vidkun quisling helped the germans govern norway the only problem was that his party unlike the nazis enjoyed next to no popular support german bodyguards accompanied the ns men walking through the harbor the head of the base a kapitan zur see named waldemar bohme was blunt when he discussed the issue with lemp as fresh food went into the u anybody who doesnt belong to the ns figures anybody who does is a traitor bohme said gloomily and nobody belongs to the ns lemp glanced toward one of the uniformed norwegians it wasnt quite a german uniform but it was in the same general style he does the uboat skipper remarked there are a handful of them bohme agreed it would almost be easier if there werent any then we wouldnt have to waste our own men keeping the rest of the norwegians from murdering these people had he known lemp better he might have called the ns officials worse but you never could tell who might report you staying innocuous was safer quisling must have some support lemp said some ja bohme still sounded glum the nasjonal samling got less than two percent of the vote in down from a hair over two percent in and as soon as the fighting started here half their membersmore than halfbailed out and picked up rifles and tried to shoot us shrewdly lemp said but now that the fightings over and we won going along with us will look like a good idea to some people that has happeneda little bohme admitted most of the squareheads would still sooner spit on us though as long as we can get on with the war what difference does it make lemp said with england back in it who knows captain bohme seemed determined to look at the cloud not the silver lining now the norwegians wont have to be reds to have somebody wholl help give us trouble im sure youll manage sir lemp said by which he meant im damn glad its your worry and none of mine the wry quirk of one of bohmes bushy gray eyebrows meant he understood that all too well narvik north of the arctic circle was a smaller even more battered base than namsos because it was so inaccessible except by sea it had stayed in allied hands longer than the country farther south without the warm waters of the gulf stream the place would have been uninhabitable and without the last gasps of the current from the far southwest murmansk and arkhangelsk would have stayed frozen up the year around and lemps mission would have had no point but up toward the barents sea the u went it wasnt summer yet but daylight stretched and stretched in these latitudes lemp had heard about the white nights of st petersburgleningrad these days he was ten degrees of latitude north of st petersburg now the sun set in the far far northwest and soon rose again in the far far northeast while it ducked below the horizon twilight never got dark enough to show any but the brightest stars that meant the us crew had to stay alert around the clock a rating might spot a troopship at any hour of the day or suppositious night on the other hand an english plane or a russian one might come across the uboat at any time or nothing might happen no matter how long it stayed light the ocean was vast troopships full of tommies might slip past unseen for all lemp knew there were no troopships full of tommies the kriegsmarine brass had plenty of bright ideas that didnt pan out a whale spouted a couple of hundred meters to port the great beast wasnt that much smaller than the uboat lemp watched it with awe from the conning tower it paid the u no heed that suited lemp fine a collision with a whale would be like a truck hitting an elephant on the autobahn except the truck wouldnt sink afterwards he cruised his assigned area awaiting new orders from berlinor even from namsos in due course new orders came once decoded they read continue current assignment lemp was anything but thrilledas if his superiors cared continue he did luc harcourt had just got a fire going on the floor of a halfwrecked peasant hut when a private stuck his head through a hole in the wall and said excuse me sergeant but could i please talk to you for a little while sighing luc asked what dyou want charles whatever it was it would be trouble whenever a private asked that question in that tone of voice it had to be trouble maybe charles father was desperately ill and he wanted compassionate leave right now of course maybe his girlfriend was twotiming him and he needed a shoulder to cry on or permission to go back to france and whale the stuffing out of the loose stupid bitch or maybe what are we doing here sergeant charles couldnt have been more than nineteen his voice still cracked sometimes he was trying to grow a mustache but only looked as if he had dirt on his upper lip after hacking the top off a ration tin with his bayonet luc heated monkey meat over the flames what do you mean what are we doing here do i look like a priest to answer a question like that he sounded even more like sergeantnow lieutenantdemange than he realized almost everything he knew about soldiering and about dealing with inferiors in the army hed learned from the veteran demanges sarcasm had rubbed off on him too charles flushed i dont mean it like that sergeant i mean what are we doing here in russia the englishmen packed it in why cant we as far as luc was concerned that was a damn good question he gave the only reply he could when daladier wants us to quit we will till then youd better fight you think the ivans wont cut your dick off youd better think again it isnt fair charles whined since when is life fair yes luc sounded like demange you can joke all you want charles said which since luc was a sergeant was true enough but were liable to get killed for no reason at all and that isnt funny his nostrils twitched as if he were an angry rabbit as a matter of fact he was wrong luc had seen both enemies and friends die in ways idiotically ridiculous enough to make him laugh like a jackass anyone whod been up at the front for a while could say the same thing most of the laughter sprang from relief that you were still alive to giggle but that wasnt the point the savory aromaif you got hungry enoughof sizzling bully beef distracted luc but he answered i dont know what you want me to do about it if you think im going to cross over to the russians lines youre even crazier than i give you credit for they put out all those safeconducts charles displayed one sure as hell it promised that the bearer would be treated well if he deserted its written in good frenchbetter than the ones the boches used to throw around luc said but so what see you call them boches too and now theyre on our sidei mean were on theirseven though we still hate them and even though we almost started shooting at them on account of what they did to those jews charles nostrils quivered some more wouldnt you rather fight against them than for them five gets you ten theyre still doing that horrible shit to jews only in places where we cant catch em at it he was no jew himself luc was sure of that and luc hadnt thought he was a red either as a matter of fact luc still didnt think so but the question was a lot harder to deal with when charles put it that way slowly luc said the russians arent nice people either dont forget that for a minute so many russians and ukrainians and whatnot wouldnt fall all over themselves to help the fucking nazis if they liked stalin right most reluctantly charles nodded i guess so other thing to remember is the russians never signed the geneva convention even the germans did that luc went on so who gives a rats ass what that safeconduct says once the reds have you they can do whatever they damn well please nobodys gonna stop em the red cross never gets a look inside their pow campsif they bother keeping pows alive long enough to put em in camps you understand what im saying youre saying you like hitler better than stalin charles might have been accusing him of picking his nose and eating the boogers no no god damn it to hell im saying i cant stand either one of those shitheads and you cant trust either one of them luc paused to take the tin off the fire the monkey meat was as ready as it ever would be his stomach growled gratefully when he stuffed a mouthful into his chowlock after a gulp an anaconda might have used to engulf a halfgrown tapir he resumed its like i told you before i dont set our foreign policy and neither do you we go where they tell us and we do what they tell us to do there and if we dont our own sidell make it rougher on us than the nazis and reds put together artillery rumbled not far enough away charles gestured in that direction asking how they can jail you they can shoot you too and they can make life hell on earth for your kinfolk if your brother keeps getting fired if your son when you have a son ends up in a crappy school and blames you for it they remember its how they stay on topremembering and paying back his words made the youngsterthree or four years younger than he was nowrecoil in horror they wouldnt do anything like that they couldnt get away with it my ass they couldnt luc scooped more hot bully beef out of the tin youre no help at all dammit charles stomped away from the hut in dudgeon as high as a corpse four days gone luc finished the tin of monkey meat then he hunted up lieutenant demange he recounted the conversation with charles adding youd better tighten up the sentries sir hes liable not to be the only one wholl try and go over to the other side yeah chances are youre right demange shifted his gitane to one side of his mouth and spat in disgust out of the other that stupid fucking russian asswipe of a safeconduct jesus god the clowns like charles are smart enough to see that their own government lies to them every chance it gets so how come they arent smart enough to see all the other governmentsre full of bullshit too beats me it seemed as obvious as an axiom of geometry to luc had he thought that way before the war broke out he had trouble remembering he didnt believe he hadhe hadnt worried much about politics at all then so what though lies and incompetence hadnt come close to sinking france then things looked different these days charles didnt try to desert luc dared hope hed put the fear of god into him a couple of nights later though two other poilus did slip away lieutenant demange swore in furious disgust supplies came up in horsedrawn wagons both french and german trucks literally fell to bits when they had to deal with what were alleged to be soviet roads horses didnt break down and wagons were easier to repair than motor vehicles as long as luc kept getting ammo and food he didnt care how with the germans on their left flank and hungarians to their right the french pushed forward fighting well was the best way to improve your chances of staying alive luc didnt have anything in particular against the russians the way hed had against the wehrmacht men when they tried to overrun his country he shot at them anyhow to keep them from shooting at him and before long the advancing french troops came upon a fresh grave in the woods with an adrian helmet for a tombstone they dug it up in it lay one of the deserters he hadnt stopped a mistaken bullet the ivans had sported with him for a long time before they let him die the french soldiers quickly buried him again wheres your safeconduct luc asked charles feel like using it now no sergeant the kid answered in a very small voice as if on the training ground luc snapped what was that i cant hear you no sergeant charles said again rather louder this time all right then luc let it go he didnt need to worry that charles would skedaddle not after the youngster saw what was left of that other damn fool the russians would have drawn more deserters had they treated people who went over to them well but if they wanted to play the game the other way theyd soon discover the french could too ivan kuchkov patted the round drum that held his ppds ammunition with almost the same delight he would have used to pat a barmaids round backside he never wanted to have anything to do with an infantry rifle again you didnt need to aim a ppd you just pointed it and fired if one bullet didnt do for a fascist the next would or the one after that a nazi with a mauser could hit him from much farther away than he could hit the fritz with his submachine gun in the kind of fighting they were doing in woods and villages and towns that seldom mattered you mostly didnt see your enemy till he was right on top of you then you needed to kill him in a hurry the ppd was made with just that in mind his outfit kept falling back toward smolensk it infuriated him he wanted to drive the germans west not to dance to their tune the red army counterattacked whenever officers thought they saw a chanceor whenever orders came down from above sometimes the russians gained a little ground even when they did they rarely held it long he wasnt sure about the name of the village where they were fighting now it might have been called old pigshit a handle it would have kept for centuries or it might have been rechristened something like leninsk after the glorious soviet revolution either way it was a stench in the nostrilsand a lot like the miserable hole in the ground where ivan had grown up one way in which it differed from that particular hole in the ground was the broad expanse of grainfields and meadows to the north south and west couldnt be better country for panzers said lieutenant vasiliev ivan was convinced the political officer fucked pigs but even a pigfucker got it right every once in a while about half the villagers had been rash enough to stick around instead of hightailing it to the east maybe they thought the red army would push the nazis back in which case they were optimists or maybe they thought things would get better once the nazis took over in which case they were really optimists any which way the politruk took charge of them he set them digging deep wide ditches across their fields and meadows not so much to stop tanks as to channel their movements toward antitank guns a peasant with a gray mustache had the nerve to complain how the devil can we farm after we tear up the land like this lieutenant vasiliev drew his tokarev automatic from the leather holster on his belt he held it up to the peasants head and pulled the trigger the report was harsh flat undramatic the peasant fell over he kicked a few times and lay still blood puddled under him a wrinkled woman in a headscarf shrieked any other questions the politruk asked pleasantly reholstering the pistol vast silence but for the womans sobs the politruk nodded all right then get back to work and they didall of them including the babushka whod just lost her husband sometimes life could be very simple some of the soldiers dug alongside them others turned the village into a strongpoint field fortification was a russian art maskirovka camouflagewas another making buildings into places that were much stronger than they looked combined the two they got less done than ivan wished they would have german artillery started probing early in the afternoon not even the politruk s pistol could keep the muzhiks working after that they ran for the trees more afraid of the big shells burstingand with reason artillery was the great butcher everything else was an afterthought beside it the soldiers stolidly labored on every so often they flattened out in the antitank ditches when incoming shells sounded close after the shelling moved on for a while they stood up again brushed themselves off and went back to digging a few shells hit in the ditches a man or two walking around above ground got wounded by fragments scouts fell back toward old pigshit or whatever it was skirmishing as they came stupid germans arent far behind us one of them said as he jumped into a trench close to ivan nemtsi the russian word for germans meant tonguetied ones or mumblers it went well with the notion of stupidity the scout lit a papiros let me have one of those fuckers will you ivan said the scout glanced his way saw he was a sergeant and gave him a smoke kuchkov had expected no less after a couple of drags he asked have they got tanks along i saw some the scout answered he carried a ppd too a red army soldier was more inclined to believe in firepower than in god they would the clappedout cunts ivan muttered one of the scouts eyebrows twitched all soldiers swore but ivan was in a class by himself he found another question are their peckers up why not theyre advancing the scout said bleakly ivan glanced over his shoulder maybe a company of kvs would clank forward and save the day like the warriors who whipped the teutonic knights in alexander nevsky now there was a flick for you and maybe green monkeys will fly out of my ass too ivan thought mocking himself life wasnt like a movie tanks didnt show up from nowhere just because you needed them like anything and wasnt that a goddamn shame german soldiers appeared in the distance fieldgray blended in about as well as khaki but the nazis black helmets stood out on the horizon the germans had tanks along three czech machines either captured or newly built in conquered factories they were better than panzer is and iis not so good as iiis about like any soviet tanks this side of the kv cautiously the tanks with the whiteedged black crosses on them advanced foot soldiers loped between them a soviet mortar started thumping earth fountained up as the bombs hit the nazi infantrymen dove for cover one of them was blasted off his feet ivan didnt think hed get up again a tank crew thought about crossing a ditch but the obstruction proved too wide and too deep the machine came straight toward the village then as the defenders had planned a hidden antitank gun opened up on it the gunners needed several shots before they scored a hit but the tank stopped and began to burn when they did that told the other enemy tanks where the gun was though they shelled it into silence then rolled forward with greater confidence another antitank gun knocked one of them out in nothing flat the last tank scuttled back out of range red army men with rifles fired at their german counterparts a machine gun in a tavern opened up on the fritzes too the germans hit the dirt and started digging foxholes they were veteran troops they werent about to make things easy for their foes well weve stopped em the scout said neither he nor ivan had fired a shot the fascists hadnt drawn close enough to turn their submachine guns deadly for now yeah right here yeah ivan said the red army could usually stop the germans right here and for now then somehow theyd break through a little later somewhere else and stopping them right here for now wouldnt matter any more youd have to retreat or else theyd close the ring behind you and grind you to pieces at their leisure lieutenant obolensky and the politruk wanted to make the germans fight a regular battle for old pigshit unfortunately the officers in charge of the advancing nazis had too much sense to bang their heads into a stone wall they were like water they slid around obstructions before long their s started pounding the red army men who held the woods a few kilometers south of the village ivan could follow the fighting to the south by ear the russians in the woods gave way the germans pushed through that meant old pigshit would start flying the swastika pretty soon maybe the place would have held if troops from here had helped the handful of russians in those woods maybe not but maybe no one thought to weaken the strongpoint though and so instead of weakening it the company had to abandon it they retreated in good order theyd be ready to fight again somewhere else before long the soviet union was vast it could afford to trade space for time but you couldnt win a war with endless retreats could you chapter something in the mail for you dear sarah goldmans mother handed her an envelope for me sarah couldnt remember the last time shed got a letter it wasnt as if saul could write after all not having any idea where her brother was she had to hope he was all right this was no letter the envelope bore an appallingly official eagle holding a circled swastika in its claws the eagles tiny printed eye caught and held hers as if commanding her to obedience one of the things that made the nazis so scary was the attention they gave even such picayune details german thoroughness run mad and in power youd better open it mother said i suppose so sarah agreed insincerely attention from the reich was the last thing she or any jew wanted the best you could hope for most times was to be overlooked but the envelope in her hand wouldnt go away if she didnt open it whatever the nazis were telling her they would do they would do whether she read about it first or not better to know ahead of time well it might be anyhow a reluctant fingernail slid under the flap the envelope opened easilyalmost too easily even mucilage was of an inferior grade these days she unfolded the notice inside and read it nu hanna goldman asked if you open your mouth any wider a bug will fly in or maybe a bird sarah hadnt noticed her jaw drop she wasnt surprised it had though she couldnt remember the last time shed been so astonished she held up the document as if it were a bream shed just hauled out of a creek its she had to try twice to get the words out its my permission to get married theyvetheyve approved it shed shivered in line more than once waiting to duel with the nazi bureaucrats at the munster rathaus back then her breath had smoked shed worn her shabby old coat which didnt do nearly enough to hold out winter nevertheless shed wear it again when frost came back a jews meager clothing ration wouldnt stretch to getting her another one no need for a coat now spring burgeoned outside birdsong sweetened the air grass was green flowers bloomed in perfumed rainbow profusion butterflies flitted from one to another to another bees buzzed the sun blazed down from a blue blue sky dotted with friendly little white clouds mother rushed up and hugged her oh sweetheart thats wonderful you see even they couldnt say no in the end if she didnt want to name the nazis who could blame her took them long enough to say yes sarah answered tartly theyre what they are her mother said sarah couldnt imagine a worse thing to say about germanys masters mother went on it doesnt matter any more though you have their permission they cant take it away again of course they could if they decided they wanted to but even sarah saw no reason that they should she smiled a secret smile it was a good thing permission had come when it did she wasnt in a family way but not because of lack of effort she and isidor spun the roulette wheel every time they lay down togetherrubber was a war material too important for much to be allotted to prophylactics they also made some of sheeps gut but so few that jews had no chance of getting their hands on any you could do other things in bed besides that you could and they did but the other things however good they felt also felt like substitutes ersatz filled life in germany how could anybody not want the original here if you took a chancewell fine you took a chance her mothers smile seen from a few centimeters away seemed uncommonly soft and tender grandchildren hanna goldman murmured did she know she might have had one sooner than she would have wished if she did shed never said anything about it that was as much discretion as a daughter could hope for sarah wasnt sure she wanted babies not in this day and age hostages to fortune were truer words ever spoken was this world and this particular part of the world a fit place for bringing up little jews not likely but that coin had two sides if you didnt want children if you decided to let things end with you the nazis won by default they wouldnt hate jews any more if they had no jews left to hate she hadnt talked about any of that with isidor theyd worried about her getting pregnant before they could marry not afterwards all the same she had a good notion of how shed feel he was more downtoearth about such things than she was like her father she pondered and worried before she acted isidor just went ahead chances were hed go ahead with a family too and then see if he could get it through the war in one piece well have to see if we can knock a doorway between your room and the one that used to be sauls mother said the two of you could almost have your own little flat then almost was the word all right theyd still have to share the kitchen and the bathroom with her parents even so she quickly said well manage whether we can knock the door through or not isidor already lived in a flat with his folks thered be no room for sarahwhich didnt stop new inlaws from moving in when they had no other choice here for once they did like any choice this one had its downside too mother said its a shame hell have to go across town every day to get to work hes got a bicycle sarah said with all private cars vanished from the streets except those belonging to doctors and with jews banned from buses and trams a bike was the best way to get around aside from shanks mare and possibly roller skates a bike was about the only way to get around hanna goldman rolled her eyes nonetheless if you want to call it that she said isidors bicycle had to be older than he was it had been a cheap rattletrap when it was new and neither he nor any of the people whod used it before him had kept it up very well in happier times anyone in his right mind would have been ashamed to be seen riding such a rickety contraption permission to wed still in her hand sarah made herself look on the bright side no one will want to steal it mother laughed but answered you never can tell these days and that sadly was also true because so many people had so little and because they could legitimately buy even less a lot of them took what they needed or what they wantedor whatever caught their eyewhen they saw the chance anything not nailed down was liable to disappear and anybody with a claw hammer was liable to draw out the nails and steal them too sarah knew all that perfectly well she couldnt even say shed never pilfered what else were jews going to do when they got even less than aryans she could say i still think that bicycles pretty safe and mean it her mother didnt try to tell her she was wrong either her father kissed her when he got home then he fell asleep in his chair before supper he woke up enough to eat another meager unexciting meal after that he fell asleep in the chair again when mother and sarah went upstairs to bed he staggered along with them like a man coming out from under the ether cone sarah sank deeply into sleep herself when you were hungry all the time it was easy and sleeps anesthetic meant you didnt feel how hungry you were if only she could have slept all the time till the wedding anyhow she didnt get to sleep all night tonight some time after midnight munsters airraid sirens began to wail sarah thought it wasthought it had to bea drill one more example of nazi thoroughness run amok since jews werent allowed to use public shelters anyway she stayed under the blankets till flat harsh thuds outside and windows rattling in their frames told her the raf had come back to germany and was playing for keeps again calling to one another she and her parents whod also stayed in bed as long as they could stumbled down the stairs and huddled under the diningroom table the best protection they had engines droned overhead flak guns barked after an hour or so the raiders went away nothing came down too close to the house sarah hoped the brucks had come through all right too shed have to get over there and see if isidor didntmaybe couldntget over here first as father creakily crawled out from under the table he said well i wont go short of work for a while happy day filling in bomb craters was a long way from lecturing about the coming of the barbarians at the end of ancient history or maybe it wasnt who but barbarians would set things up so a university professor could live only as a roadgang laborer sarah chewed on that while she went upstairs along with the raid it kept her from getting any more rest till dawn pearl harbor honolulu when pete mcgill got back to hawaiigot back on american soil for the first time in much too longhe found he had a third stripe waiting for him making corporal wasnt that hard sergeant sergeant meant youd been a leatherneck for a while well he damn well had repair crews swarmed over pearl like ants on sandwiches forgotten after a picnic the japs attack had done more damage than us authorities were letting on to the folks back home he was amazed their carriers could have got near the place but they damn well had two carriers and a couple of battlewagons had been badly damaged and a heavy cruiser charging out of the channel to go after the enemy fleet had taken a torpedo amidships from a lurking japanese submarine and gone down with almost all hands that sure hadnt made the evening news a couple of bombs had started fires in the vast fuel dumps alongside the harbor one of those still sent greasy black smoke up into the sky how many gazillions of barrels or gallons or whatever of fuel oil had burned how badly would that screw up american operations in the pacific god surely knew and maybe the brass here and back in dc even as a newly minted sergeant pete mcgill hadnt the faintest idea he took the streetcar into honolulu when he got a seventytwohour pass promotions didnt happen every day hed blow a lot of the pay bump he hadnt seen yet buying drinks for the other marines from the boise and getting his ashes hauled he mourned vera he missed her too more than hed ever missed anybody he really had loved her as well as an american marine could love a white russian taxi dancer but she was dead dammit and he was here in hawaii without having even seen a woman since manila it wouldnt be the same as it had been with her he wondered if anything would ever be that good again but it was still pretty fine when you bought it from a hooker who would rather have been doing her nails than you honolulu felt funny it always did whether you were coming from the us mainland or the orient it was neither the one nor the other and seemed pulled both ways at once it was crawling with soldiers and sailors and marines most of the signs were in english and most of the english you heard on the street had one familiar american accent or another but most of the faces that didnt belong to military personnel had narrow eyes high cheekbones low noses and golden skin japs chinamen filipinos koreans more japs than any other group white people included a leatherneck on leave didnt go into the neighborhoods where they lived japanese restaurants japanese movie houses buddhist temples even japanese christian churches for converts and the children of converts pete saw none of that though he knew it was there on the mainland they were shoving japs into internment camps in case they felt more loyalty to tojo than to fdr they couldnt do that here even if the authorities might want to too goddamn many japs in hawaii the place would grind to a halt without them and nobodyd actually proved they were giving tokyo a hand so a jap bartender poured pete a scotch on the rocks and congratulated him on his promotion it was crappy scotch but hey there was a war on and it could still get you smashed next to that everything else ran a distant second before long they headed off to another joint one joe orsatti knew the hibiscus blossom was closer to hotel street honolulus main drag for joy bought and sold it was a rowdier place than the one theyd just left barmaids in short tight skirts and halter tops fetched drinks the one who took care of pete and his pals was also a jap if only her eyes were blue she would have looked like a siamese cat orsatti patted her on the ass after she brought the second round of drinks she glared at him dont handle the merchandise mac she snapped in tones not far removed from hoboken or long island the marine leered back if its merchandise sweetheart how much are you peddling it for more moolah than youve got charlie however much that is she retorted somebody at another table waved to her off she went the way she moved a football referee would have flagged her for backfield in motion orsatti sighed as he watched if shes playing mata hari for old hirohito i bet she hears all kinds of good shit listen to her talk without looking at her and youd bet shes never even heard of fuckin hirohito pete answered for all we know she hasnt fat chance orsatti said pete didnt argue with him he was bound to be right the other marine went on sides i like looking at her for a slantyeyed gal shes pretty goddamn cute pete wouldnt have bothered with the qualifier but then hed had his long tour in china even though hed ended up falling for a blueeyed blonde it wasnt because he didnt like the way asian women looked they took a little getting used to but so did beer and scotch and cigarettes and other good stuff orsatti had never drawn duty in peking or shanghai oriental girls still seemed exotic to him when the barmaid came back with another round he tried to pick her up again this time a little more smoothly he still wouldnt have given gregory peck or cary grant anything to worry about and he struck out like a highschool kid flailing against bob feller well hell lets get outa here he said after she wiggled off once more as if it were the hibiscus blossoms fault he had bad luck and worse technique they wound up on hotel street as pete had known they would bars strip joints whorehouses masquerading as hotelsanything the horny heart could desire was there for the takingif you had the jack naturally military men packed the street so did mps and shore patrolmen pete had his pass checked three times inside of fifteen minutes since it was legit he didnt mind showing it somebody who was there without proper authorization swung on the shore patrolman who asked for his papers that wasnt exactly phi beta kappa the sp and his buddies drastically revised the jerks phrenology with their billy clubs then they slung him into a paddy wagon it hauled him off to the brig man if you want to fight dont fight those assholes pete said more expensive than its worth that sorry sob was screwed any which way one of his friends said soon as they found out he was awol he was gonna catch it yeah but he didnt have to bleed too pete was a practical man sometimes you just feel like brawling and you dont care who the friend said well sure it wasnt that pete had never walked into a bar looking for a fight it wasnt that hed never found one either but even so when you took on the sps your movie wouldnt have a happy ending his night did at one of the joyhouses along hotel street if the blonde he chose looked a little like vera he didnt consciously think about that till later on polly wasnt from russia by way of harbin she told him she came from fargo north dakota so whyd you end up in hawaii then pete asked they had time for a chesterfield afterwards having been away from women for so long hed come in a hurry maybe hed rise again fast enough for another go he hoped so in the meantime she laughed you go where the customers are at jack in my line of work this here is the promised land and besides if you was ever in fargo through the winter youd get the hell outa there like your pants was on fire that makes sense he agreed honolulu was bound to have better weather than some pissant burg in north dakota honolulu had better weather than anywhere possibly including heaven he stubbed out his cigarette hows about you go down on me for a little while then i think i can do it again hows about you give me another fin first for somebody from fargo she imitated his bronx accent pretty well of course he wouldnt be da foist guy she evah hoid who talked liked dat he pulled an engraved portrait of abe lincoln out of his billfold she stashed it in the nightstand next to the bed in the bare little room they went on from there alistair walsh felt like a new man with the uniform back on he shook his head when that thought crossed his mind it wasnt quite right he felt like his old self again was what he felt like hed felt like a new man in civvies and he hadnt fancied the way the new man feltnot a farthings worth he hadnt but hed left the army out of shame at neville chamberlains bargain with hitler and out of suspicion that the bentley that ran down winston churchill after churchill loudly and eloquently denounced the deal wasnt driven by a drunk but by someone who knew just what he was about englands new government was still looking into that as it was looking into a great many things its predecessor had done under chamberlains lead and then under sir horace wilsons but one thing that didnt need looking into was the bargain with hitler that went straight into the dustbin the war was on again the former government had put a lot of soldiers out to pasture men who like walsh couldnt stomach the big switch and whom the civilians whod made the switch couldnt trust to stay loyal that was funny if you liked george vi had gone on the bbc saying the change in government and the change in policy had his blessing in a separate address of her own his wife had done the same walsh had read somewhere that hitler called queen elizabeth the most dangerous woman in europe considering the source there was a compliment to be proud of no matter what the king and queen said the putsch had horrified many many britons the army hadnt shot sir horace the way walsh was convinced the collaborating polecat deserved instead it put him into what some higher up with an unfortunately bureaucratic turn of phrase called preventive detention if only walsh knew what the detention was supposed to prevent it didnt prevent horace wilson from getting endless complaints out and seeing them printed in the times and the other papers that had fawned on him while he was pm the army didnt come down on the papers for printing that selfserving drivel either the generals running the country bent over backward to show they didnt intend to abridge free speech or any other fundamental rights meaning no disrespect to you sir but its bloody ridiculous walsh complained to ronald cartland the buggers we ousted were more tyrannical than we dare be cartland nodded and waved to a barmaid for another whiskey they sat in the pub near the houses of parliament where theyd done so much conspiring no great surprise there the mp saidno the captain because he was back in uniform too no matter how odious sir horaces government was it was constitutionally legitimate that meant it could do all sorts of outrageous things and get away with them because we are extraconstitutional we have to be much more scrupulous or everyone will start wailing that were worse than hitler ironic what oh perhaps a trifle walsh allowed he smiled at the barmaid let me have another pint too would you dear she was young enough to be his daughter but he was old enough that a girl young enough to be his daughter could look delicious to him which sadly wasnt the same as saying he was likely to look delicious to her another pint okeydoke she said in a pseudoamerican accent she must have picked up at the cinema for all the warmth in her voice he might have been a posta thirsty post but a post nonetheless he sighed he was getting to the age where if he wanted a young pretty girl to make him happy he had to lay silver on the dresser beforehand that was an even bigger shame than any of the troubles related to the change of government she brought the pint of bitter and went off without a second glanceat him anyhow ronald cartland she noticed well he was younger and of higher rank and therefore probably richerand betterlooking if you were going to complain about every little thing the real danger of our position is that weve damaged all the principles this countrys run on the past two hundred years and more cartland said anyone who tries to overthrow us will have as much right to do so as we did to throw out sir horacewhich is to say none we may not have had the right but we had justice by god walsh said if we didnt what was i doing in a cell when id committed no crime youd plotted treason old man and the people with whom youd plotted it brought it off too cartland answered with justifiable pride since he was one of those people next interesting question is what does old adolf do now that the rafs in the air again walsh said no the question is what can he do the officer replied hes got the luftwaffe heavily committed against the russians how much can he take away and turn against us he could have the frenchmen do his dirty work for him theyve got plenty of planes left at home alistair walsh had crossed the channel in two wars to help pull french chestnuts out of the fire familiarity with englands nearest neighbor did not warm to liking or trust cartland looked horrified daladier would never do that i dont think we arent at war with france god willing we never shall be were at war with the fritzes france is on their side in russia the froggies dont look like giving up the fight there if were at war with them and france is on their side we arent speaking about axioms of geometry i hope like blazes we arent any road cartland still sounded worried maybe the nasty possibility hadnt crossed his mind walsh hoped it had occurred to someone in charge of running england these days he thought of something else is anybody listening to us we were certain the pms people were before we threw out the rascals are they still no this time cartland sounded sure he also sounded more than a little relieved he could sound sure we were certainand we were damned well right some changes have been made at scotland yard yes indeed they have in case it makes you feel any better the blokes who jugged you and grilled you afterwards have got their walking papers draining his pint walsh considered that as a matter of fact sir it does make me feel better id sooner see the buggers behind bars themselves because they were playing fast and loose with the law but we were too so what the deuce if theyre scrounging dogends from the gutter and cadging pennies off their betters im happy enough by god he knew he was stretching things bastards like that didnt have to fall back on begging no matter how much you wished they would not all of their friends in high places had fallen foul of the new regime the ones whod kept their noses clean would give the sacked coppers a hand you never could tellthey might need their services again one day if the new military government looked like losing the war it had restarted those quiet powerful men might need the excoppers services again quite soon that thought came back to alistair walsh with painful force two nights later londons airraid sirens began to scream the blackout had been reimposed but it was still spotty too many folks didnt care to believe the war had picked up again the luftwaffe bombers wouldnt have had much trouble finding the english capital walsh stumbled to a tube station in the moreorless dark it was packed with frightened people and smelled as bad as some trenches hed known up above ground antiaircraft guns thundered searchlights would try to pin enemy planes in their beams for the guns tethered barrage balloons would make the nazis fly high and with luck drop inaccurately drop they did big explosions mingled with the guns shorter sharper reports once or twice the ground shook under walsh as he lay on a straw pallet and tried without much luck to sleep people around himnot all of them womensquealed those hits werent close but he didnt blame the londoners for panic and inexperience he went back to his room after the allclear sounded fire engines clanged toward blazes that scarred chunks of the horizon with orange and gold none of the fires was close or likely to trouble him his room had no damage he promptly fell asleep once more in the morning the bbc claimed thirtyone german bombers shot down by guns and night fighters that seemed like a lot to walsh but then his own side wasnt immune to the attractions of propaganda or maybe they were telling the truth stranger things had happened hadnt they vaclav jezek was gloomily certain he would never learn any spanish if a man had grown up speaking czech the sounds and vocabulary of this new language were too strange to stick on his tongue or in his memory and finding a spaniard who knew any czech made the loaves and fishes seem a minor miracle when he got leave and went into madrid he did find some spaniards who knew a bit of german his own accent wasnt perfectnowhere close the locals wanted to impose the staccato rhythms of their own speech on the alien tongue they werent used to making noises in the back of the throat either comprehension was always an adventure he could get drinks the word for wine didnt change much from one language to another the spaniards used some horrible lisping word for beer though most barkeeps understood bier but spanish beer wasnt worth drinking not if you had a czechs standards so he mostly stuck to wine or hard stuff he could get laid too brothels were easy to find and not too expensive unlike czech whores a lot of girls in the republic seemed proud of what they did they even had a union so another soldier on leave told vaclav anyway he thought that was the funniest thing hed ever heard but the international swore up and down it was true so maybe it was and maybe it wasnt they going to strike for a raise in pay he asked the other guy better working hours too and maybe softer mattresses the international said his german was better than jezeks he was a dutchman named jan though and got pissed off if anybody took him for a german they went on to invent other demands striking prostitutes might make those got sillier and lewder the longer they went on of course they drank more and more while they were at it too vaclav wondered if hed remember any of it when he sobered up the way his head felt the next morning he wished he didnt remember his name let alone last nights foolishness strong coffeethe spaniards didnt fool around when they brewed the stuffand the hair of the dog that bit him helped bring him back to life aspirins were hard to come by here but a bit of brandy took the edge off his headache jan looked more bedraggled yet he bore down harder on the brandy and went easy on coffee after a while he started reviving too i hurt myself he said mournfully red wine will do it to you all right vaclav agreed isnt that the sad and sorry truth jan said of course bullets and bombs and shell fragments would also do it to you and they wouldnt give you any fun while they did no wonder vaclav and so many other soldiers drank and screwed as if there were no tomorrow whenever they got the chance for too many of them there would be no tomorrow and they knew it whether in the head or more often in the belly and the balls vaclav was anything but thrilled about going back into the line when his leave ended he was even less thrilled when he got there spanish spring packed the punch of central european summer the sun blazed down out of a sky a brighter less washedout blue than you ever saw in prague dust was everywhere it even smelled baked and the stink of dead flesh seemed nastier than hed ever known before meat spoiled in nothing flat in weather like this when vaclav complained about the reek benjamin halevy said you notice it more because you got away from it for a while you lucky son of a bitch ahh your mother jezek replied without rancor thats part of it but i dont think thats all the heat really does make everything smell worse and how much hotter will it get in the summertime well find out the jew said the internationals talk about salt tablets and heatstroke some of thats probably just bullshit to make us turn green vaclav wished hed phrased it differently the way he made it sound some of what the internationals said probably wasnt bullshit well theyd been here longer than he had chances were they knew what they were talking about dammit shouldering his antitank rifle convinced him the monster had got heavier while he was on leave he couldnt blame that on the warm spanish spring pretty soon though he got used to listing to the right whenever he slung the rifle on his shoulder he started looking for targets well behind the nationalists lines he blew the head off some bigwig just getting out of a mercedes remembering what halevy had said a while earlier he hoped it was marshal sanjurjo but evidently not the republic didnt claim sanjurjos scalp and the nationalists didnt go into mourningor hystericsbecause theyd lost him they did try to pay back the czechs and the internationals artillery and mortar fire rained down on their positions the bastards might have been saying you want to play that way well make you sorry in fact that had to be exactly what they were saying a lot of the artillery rounds were duds which saved some lives vaclav had noticed that a lot of the rounds the republicans fired were duds too which meant what that spanish munitions factories werent everything they might have been evidently vaclav was a careful thorough sniper he didnt let himself fall into routines he didnt keep coming back to the same hideouts day after day snipers who made stupid mistakes like that didnt last long when deciding to go right or left along the line hed toss a coin and do what it told him if he didnt know what hed do till he did it the shitheads trying to slaughter him couldnt outguess him he potted another nationalist officer a few days later it was a hell of a long shot going on two kilometers he was proud as hell when he watched the fellow grab at himself and slowly crumple the nationalist seemed much closer through the telescopic sight but not that close everybody on his own side congratulated him when he reported the kill only later when he drank some spanish peach brandy with benjamin halevy did he think about what hed actually done mother of god he said everyone thinks im the best thing since sausage because i can murder people farther away than the other guys can the jew looked at him his eyes were bottlegreen you just figured this out nooo vaclav let the word stretch but it kind of hit me more than it usually does well if it makes you feel any better maybe that was the son of a bitch who ordered the artillery barrage after you nailed the last big shot halevy said even if he wasnt he was no friend of ours you think hed worry if hed just shot you who knows who knows anything these days vaclav said maybe the brandy was hitting him harder than hed thought it would or maybe he was looking at what he really did in the war something few frontline soldiers could ever be comfortable trying this is a fuck of a way to decide who gets to do what what would you rather do roll the dice halevy said suppose the other guy doesnt go along with losing then what you bash the asshole over the head with a rock thats what that was what all right force had a brute simplicity nothing else could match if the other guy was dead he couldnt stop you if he feared youd kill him he wouldnt have the nerve to try to stop you how does that make us any better than wildcats and wolverines vaclav asked halevy reached out and tapped the antitank rifles long barrel with the first two fingers of his right hand wildcats and wolverines have to get close to do their dirty work he said were civilized we can kill from a long way off lucky us vaclavs voice sounded hollow even to himself he picked up the brandy bottle and tilted it back sometimes not thinking was better nice civilized brandy took care of that all right chapter once upon a time hansulrich rudel counted every mission he flew that didnt last long as soon as the german wheel behind paris failedas it had in it became obvious the war would be long in a long war youd keep going till you got killed or till your side finally won whichever came first why keep track of how often you went up then he and sergeant dieselhorst were up again now hunting red panzers somewhere west of smolensk down below shellbursts and fires marked the front and the region west of it the region through which the wehrmacht had just advanced the russians were brave and determined that much had been obvious from the start of the campaign against them what had also been obvious was that neither soviet soldiers norespeciallytheir officers were skilled fighting men the trouble with that was the ivans could learn the longer they stayed in the ring the more likely they would and russia was a big place hansulrich had known as much going inknown in his head anyhow one glance at a map told you how enormous russia was but you had to fly over it you had to come hundreds of kilometers through it and realize how many more hundreds you still needed to go you had to see the swarms of foot soldiers and panzers and well everything the commissars could throw at you before you began to feel the enormousness of the place you also had to wonder whether germany was taking on more than she could handle the kaisers armies had smashed the ivans again and again theyd knocked the reds out of the war but they hadnt conquered russia beaten her and occupied her and held her down could the fuhrer s forces manage that now if we cant what are we doing here what am i doing here rudel wondered but he knew what he was doing looking for panzers kvs by choice the landsers had a devil of a time knocking out those monsters a strike from the air could do it hansulrich saw russian panzers down below a heartbeat later he saw a biplane fighter pop out of a cloud and buzz straight at him if it was a biplane it just about had to be russian had he entertained any lingering doubts the muzzle flashes from its twin machine guns would have given him a hint were under attack he shouted to sergeant dieselhorst who of course faced the other way its a chato the name came from the war in spain and meant flatnosed chatos were officially obsolescent which didnt make this one any less dangerous to him it was faster than his stuka tough and far more maneuverable which meant it meant he was in trouble dammit what are you going to do dieselhorst asked instead of answering hansulrich did it his right index finger came down hard on the firing button that worked the mm guns under the jus wings hed shot down a french fighter with them and a russian job more modern than this one the chato was almost on top of him by then maybe hed get lucky one more time and damned if he didnt as recoil staggered the stuka in the sky one of the armorpiercing rounds smashed into the enemy fighters flat nosethe front of the engine cowling it probably plowed all the way through the engine and maybe through the pilot too instantly a mass of flame the chato tumbled toward the ground i got him if hansulrich sounded surprised it was only because he was as he had in france and earlier here hed mostly been trying to scare off the enemy with the mms ferocious muzzle flashes hitting him was an unexpected bonus way to go youre more than halfway to making ace sergeant dieselhorst said they both laughed and well they might have a stuka especially a stuka burdened with the heavy panzerbusting guns was a most unlikely candidate for an aces mount that russian was stupid rudel thought if hed attacked from behind especially from below the stuka would have been as near defenseless as made no difference but hed decided to rush straight in and hed walked into a haymaker war seldom forgave mistakes the ivan would never make another one that was for sure hansulrich hoped the ap round had killed him going down trapped in a flaming crate was a fate he didnt wish even on his enemies his own heart still hammered in his chest combat grabbed you by the throat in an instant it was much slower letting go it wasnt as if he and dieselhorst were out of danger for this mission either those panzers down below hadnt gone away if he didnt do for them theyd do for some of his countrymen he swung the stukas wing over and tipped the plane into a dive he thought a small sigh came through the speaking tube did dieselhorst think theyd done their duty for the day by shooting down the fighter hansulrich didnt ask him he was the pilot responsibility for what they did lay with him besides he might have been wrong those were kvs all right even from a good height they were noticeably bigger than the other russian panzersand noticeably bigger than even the biggest german machines embarrassing that the slavic untermenschen could come up with such formidable monsters as he had when the chato filled his windscreen he hit the firing button a split second later he pulled back hard on the stick yanking the stuka out of its dive you got him sergeant dieselhorst yelled jubilantly hes burning like a crazy son of a bitch how many men inside the panzer five if it was crewed like the larger german models they were probably burning inside the chassis hansulrich felt less sympathy for them than he had for the chato s luckless pilot the flyer had been a member of his guild even if he was on the wrong side these guys maybe somebody down on the ground would waste time feeling sorry for them rudel didnt he climbed again to attack another kv as he dove this time big muzzle flashes greeted him from the ground black puffs of smoke appeared around the stuka jesus fucking christ dieselhorst said they brought their flak up toward the front with them the blasphemy made hansulrich frown but all he said was i noticed thanks some soviet officer had had a rush of brains to the head if the germans were going to attack your armor from the air why not try your best to shoot them down while they were doing it blam blam the mm guns thundered again he mashed the throttle down clawing for altitude as hard as he could sergeant dieselhorsts whoops told him hed hit another panzer that didnt make him as happy as it might have he felt as if the stuka were just hanging in the air waiting for the ivans to bite chunks off it and they did fragments tore into the back of the fuselage you all right albert he called ja dieselhorst answered weve lost some of the tail assembly though does she still answer rudel cautiously tried the controls the plane respondedmore slowly than he would have wanted but it did the airflow felt rougher than it should have too he made up his mindhe wasnt going to take on any more russian panzers today he wasnt going to take on any more russian flak guns either not if he could help it he turned southwest the shortest way back to his own sides lines good thing this beast can take it dieselhorst said fondly it sure is hansulrich agreed but then he added dont jinx it albert we arent back yet if another chato dove on them he didnt know what hed do no as a matter of fact he did know hed crash that was what he drew smallarms fire crossing the line nothing worse some of the smallarms fire came from the landsers down there he took the lords name in vain himself something he did only when badly provoked the controls got mushier dieselhorst said im looking back at it and it wont hold together much longer he didnt sound so fond any more right hansulrich had been afraid of that time to set her down then no airstrips in the neighborhood but there was a reasonably straight dirt road one luckily without a column of german panzers or trucks rumbling along it the landing was rough but it was a landing not a crash he brought the stuka to a halt and shoved back his section of the canopy they always said any landing you could walk away from was a good one by god they were right well well willi dernen said what have we here but he knew what they had there a scopesighted sniping mauser with a bolt that bent down so a man could work it without interfering with the sight if you want it its yours the quartermaster sergeant said i remember you used one in france for a while uhhuh willi nodded unfortunately that hadnt lasted long the oberfeldwebel who was teaching him how to pot enemies at long range got his own head blown off by a sniper from the other side awful arno was only too eager to reel willi back to ordinary duty so i figured since i got my hands on it id give it to somebody who knew what to do with it the quartermaster sergeant didnt say how hed got his hands on it maybe hed won it at skat maybe it had fallen off a truckor maybe hed swiped it from one that stopped at his depot any which way he held it out to willi now and willi took it thanks he raised it to his shoulder and peered through the sight yes his hand still remembered where to go to find the bent bolt might be embarrassingcould be fatally embarrassingif he reached out and missed he asked have you got any of the fancy ammo thats supposed to go with a piece like this a couple of boxes the middleaged supply sergeant handed those over too god knows if ill be able to get hold of more though save this shit for when you really need it use the regular rounds most of the time gotcha will do willi said snipers rifles werent just ordinary mausers with a funny bolt and a sight slapped on they were generally better made better finished and more accurate firing rounds of equally special manufacture they gave a marksman a decent chance to kill a man at a kilometer and a half at ordinary ranges in ordinary fighting though ordinary ammunition would do the sergeant eyed willi you and the guy who runs your squad dont exactly get along do you will he let you use that rifle the way youre supposed to he did have a good memory all right willi shrugged who knows what awful arno will do next half the time i dont think he does yeah he isnt long on brains is he the quartermaster sergeant said that made willi laugh out loud the way unexpectedly finding someone else who thinks like you often will predictably corporal baatz gave him the fishy stare when he ambled back up to the front whered you get that he demanded as if he suspected willi had stolen the rifle he probably did but willi answered with the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth quartermaster sergeant issued it to me sure he did now tell me another one awful arno said so help me willi raised his right hand in the german oathtaking gesture you think im a liar go ask him yourself baatz paused his little piggy eyes narrowing further you think you can bluff me into believing your bullshit he said at last well im here to tell you i didnt fall off the turnip truck yesterday i will ask him and then ill pin your ears back for bullshitting me you can kiss that chickenshit pip on your sleeve goodbye the likes of you a gefreiter ha he stomped away adam pfaff looked up from cleaning his own graypainted mauser where did you get the fancy piece he inquired willi grinned at him youll find out fifteen minutes later awful arno came back his face a thundercloud it wasnt the first time hed made somebody under his command out to be a liar and wound up with egg on his face knowing him it wouldnt be the last either he said not another word about the scopesighted rifle instead he reamed out a new replacement who hadnt done a single thing that willi could see that was arno baatz through and through he wouldnt blame himself for picking the wrong time to call a bluff oh no hed take it out on somebody else somebody who couldnt hit back schoolyards were full of bullies just like him unfortunately so was the army be damned pfaff said as he stowed his cleaning kit the supply sergeant really did issue it to you he really did and if awful arno doesnt like it too bad willi kept his voice down baatz had rabbit ears damn him even as things were his head whipped around yes he knew when his name was taken in vain that was perhaps his lone resemblance to god but he couldnt pick out the soldier whod used the nickname he hated it wasnt as if willi were the only candidate after s pounded the russian positions in front of them the germans moved forward again the artillery fire hadnt squashed the ivans it never did they dug like animals and popped out of their holes as soon as the shelling stopped rifles and machine pistols machine guns and mortars greeted the wehrmacht willi soon got the chance to try out the new mauser he knocked over a russian at about meters it wouldnt have been an impossible shot for an ordinary rifle but it would have been a damn good one with the sight and the silkysmooth action on this baby it felt routine that ivan must have been an officer and one the reds didnt want to lose they tried to avenge themselves by smashing the germans with artillery the russians were brave but they made crappy tacticians a lot of the time they used guns to do what brains couldnt huddling in a scrape he kept deepening every time he got the chance willi wished the russians were smarter then they wouldnt use so much brute force he hung on to the rifle in case the reds followed up their barrage with a counterattack right now that didnt feel likely they were just trying to murder as many landsers as they could when the shelling let up willi heard wounded men screaming and wailing he winced and bit his lip under pressure like this what kind of soldier he was hardly mattered if a shell came down on his hole he was a dead or wounded soldier he couldnt do anything about it one way or the other a kid just out of basic training cowering in another foxhole might live where he died fool luck nothing else but it hardly seemed fair hed had thoughts like that ever since the war started he was still here of course so was awful arno if that didnt prove how basically unfair the world was willi might not have been able to do anything about the russian artillery on his own but the wehrmacht could a fieseler storch buzzed over the battleground scouting out the ivans positions the german army coop plane could take off and land on next to no ground at all it was ridiculously maneuverable it could even hover like a kestrel in a strong headwind and it could let an observer see what he needed to see not long after the storch flew offby all signs undamaged despite the storm of smallarms fire the ivans threw at ita squadron of stukas worked over the russian batteries one of the stukas got hit during its dive and didnt pull out a column of black greasy smoke marked the end of the plane and its crewmen the others did what divebombers were supposed to do a kg bomb would knock any artillery piece ass over teakettle and what it did to the poor sorry bastards serving the gun had they not been doing their damnedest to blow him into catsmeat willi might have spent more sympathy on the ivans then again he might not he hated all artillerymen no matter where they came from they murdered honest foot soldiers without needing to worry about getting shot themselves divebombers were just what they deserved the only reason he put up with german artillerymen at all was that they sometimes helped the stukas keep the other sides gunners anxious whistles squealed officers shouted follow me willi and the rest of the groundpounders did for once everything was easy the russians who didnt surrender ran away he cherished the feeling he knew too well he wasnt likely to meet it again any time soon out between the nationalist trenches and the ones the republicans held somebody had lain dead for too long or maybe it was a donkey or a horse but chaim weinberg didnt think so their stink was different from a dead mans he couldnt have said exactly how it was different but it was the wind blew from the northwest so there was no escaping the horrible reek he wished he could turn off his nose werent you supposed to start ignoring bad smells after a while everybody said so but old everybodyd never had to contend with a stench from hell like this one all the abe lincolns in the trench bitched about it they all said someone ought to go out into nomansland find the dead soldier or donkey or whatever it was and shovel some dirt over it nobody volunteered for the job though not even at night odds were the nationalists knew exactly where the heap of corruption lay and had a sniper just waiting to pot any enterprising international who tried to clean up the mess it aint fair chaim groused they dont even have to smell it most of the time cocksuckers just sit around and let us suffer and so mike carroll said so fuck it chaim lit a gitane that was fighting one stench with another but harsh tobacco improved on dead meat he supposed it did anyhow mike looked wistful chaim doled out a cigarette he wouldnt have if the other american had suggested that he go out there and scoop dirt over the corpse mike hadntquite so he earned a smoke for himself cigarettes were too soon gone the death stench endured where were vultures when you really needed them people talked about smells so bad they would gag a vulture chaim had always believed that was nothing but talkif vultures werent made for rotten meat what were they made for but they didnt seem to want anything to do with whatever that was out there you know whats crazy mike said besides you you mean chaim returned nu what funny man ha ha mike said patiently then he went back to what had been on his mind before whats funny is were only like fortyfive minutes by car away from madrid and weve got to put up with this shit all the time front was a lot closer than fortyfive minutes from madrid when we got here hell the front then was fuckin in madrid were the ones who pushed it back chaim said not without pride he looked up and down the trench too many longfamiliar faces he didnt see those of us whore left anyway aint it the truth mike carroll took a flask off his belt raised itnot high enough to let a sniper see himand said absent friends before drinking he handed it to chaim absent friends chaim echoed adding thanks before he drank too it was spanish brandy snarlystrong the spaniards called it cognac but that was a libel on the genuine good stuff chaim coughed as he gave back the flask shitll put hair on your chest like you dont have enough already mike said chaim knew he had more than the other american theyd bathed in creeks side by side often enough he wondered if not having so much bothered mike if it did he picked dumbass things to worry about he was tall and slim and blond and handsome not being any of those things sure as hell got under chaims skin but im the one whos laying la martellita dammit chaim thought when she feels like it when she can stand me even with the qualifications that came as close to heaven as a good secular marxistleninist expected to get as far as chaim was concerned laying la martellita was as close to heaven as pius xii was likely to get and if pius xii got a look at la martellita chaim figured the pope would agree with him unless his holiness liked chorus boys he would and maybe even then la martellita was plenty to make any fag ever born want to try switchhitting the front was only fortyfive minutes from madrid and madrid was only fortyfive minutes from the front supplies came up with easewhen there were supplies anyway the republican forces had been hungry for foreign munitions since france and england jumped into bed with hitler and jumped on stalins back spanish factories did what they could but the ammo they made was junk cartridges misfired or jammed shells too often didnt burst if you had mexican or french or german rounds those these days came only from nationalist corpses you saved them for when you really needed them and so chaim was surprised and delighted when trucks brought case after case of french cartridges up from the capital whered these come from he asked a driver they find em in a warehouse they forgot about or something no se senor a spanish shrug was a much more dignified production than its french equivalent they loaded them into my truck they told me to take them to the fighting men this i have done anything beyond what hed done he plainly considered none of his business mike said the crates dont look weathered like they would if theyd been sitting in a warehouse or something and the brass on the rounds is shiny too stuff seems new it does doesnt it chaim scratched his head with almost the determination he would have given to pursuing a louse but thats crazy why would the froggies send us fresh ammo when theyve gone fascist or close enough beats me mike answered cheerfully you know what though i dont care im gonna shoot it at sanjurjos boys and ill hit more of em with it than i would with the spanish crap weve been using you got that right chaim said but he was someone who cared about why he always had been he wouldnt have been a marxistleninistand he wouldnt have been in spainif he werent he hunted up a french international he knew denis was older than he was a great war veteran the frenchman drank too much but he was a good fellow to have around when things got tough he also shared chaims relentless itch to know and since he was a frenchman chaim hoped hed got word of which way the wind blew in his native land chaim spoke no french denis knew no english his german was limited to obscenities and the kinds of commands you might give to prisoners he and chaim stumbled along in spanish neither was perfectly fluent and each had an accent that sometimes puzzled the other but they managed how much do you want to bet even the war ministry doesnt know whats going on with the ammo denis said maybe the spaniards spread some money around and loosened things upunofficially of course oh of course chaim fought dry with dry but the republic is always broke where did it get the money denis spread his hands they looked a lot like chaims the nails were short and ragged and the callused palms had dirt ground into them i dont know mierda like that maybe they got their gold back from the russians sure maybe they did chaim exchanged a knowing look with denis now that stalin had the republics gold reservesto protect them and to pay for war supplieshow likely was he to send them back no matter how good a marxistleninist chaim was he didnt believe it for a minute the cynical glint in denis eye said he didnt either but he didnt come out with anything like that not out loud talking too much could land you in more trouble than you ever wanted to see in musing tones denis said i wonder how happy the fucking nazis would be if they knew france was juicing their little friends worst enemies here theyd be enchanted chaim answered with a sly grin just enchanted encantar the verb to enchant bore an obvious resemblance in spanish to cantar to sing after a beat chaim realized the relationship to a singing word was there in english too but it wasnt so plain in his native tongue fuck em all enchanted or not denis said if daladierd ever spit hitlers cock out of his mouth he shook his head too much to hope for any which way weve still got these cartridges chaim said no matter who at whatever level in the french chain of command had turned a blind eye the crates were here they wouldnt go to waste either as peggy druce crisscrossed pennsylvania and made forays into other states to promote the war effort she found herself facing an odd fact the fight might be on but it didnt seem to make much difference for one thing it was so far away two thousand miles from pennsylvania to the pacific another two thousand from the pacific to hawaii and another two or three thousand miles after that to where the guns were actually going off hitlers fight against stalin was closer than fdrs battle with tojo and hirohito and for another it hadnt affected the country much grocery stores were still full of unrationed food most gasoline went to the military and you couldnt get new tires for love or money that turned the sundayafternoon drive into a thing of the past but it was about as far as restrictions went it was more than enough to make people piss and moan as if complaining were going out of style peggy thought they were nuts of course shed seen germany one look at what went on there would have been plenty to make the grumblers turn up their toes no gas at all for any civilians but doctors no tires eitherin fact the germans took tires and batteries from civilian vehicles so the wehrmacht could use them rationed clothing all the new stuff was shoddy or else made of cheap synthetic fibers and the food next to no fruit precious little meat milk for kids and expectant mothers only lots of potatoes and turnips and cabbage and black bread awful cigarettes and even worse ersatz coffee the germans bitched about it not even the ss could stop that but bitching was all they did they let off steam and then they went back to the serious business of conquering their neighbors by the way a lot of americans carried on they wanted to string roosevelt up from the nearest lamppost he said he wouldnt get us into a war and then he went and did if peggyd heard that once shed heard it a thousand times it was commonly followed by who the devil cares what goes on way the devil over there across the ocean youd be singing a different tune if the japs had hit pearl harbor as hard as they wanted to she would answer if if if the naysayers said who gives a darn about mighthavebeens it didnt happen so what are you jumping up and down about it for what would really have got pennsylanias attention was a war closer to home had hitler declared war on the usa but he hadnt he had warned that german uboats would go after american ships in the atlantic now that england was fighting him again but that was as far as hed gone he seemed to be telling roosevelt if you want to declare war on me go right ahead be my guest peggy had a picture of fdr doing that right next to it she had a picture of congress refusing to ratify the declaration the japs had started shooting at the same time as they declared war on america that didnt leave anybody much choice hitler for once seemed content to let his opponents make the first move and because he did he confused american politics that plenty of people wanted to see stalin roasted on a platter with an apple in his mouth sure didnt hurt why are folks so blind peggy asked when she got back to philadelphia after one of her politicking swings herb looked at her no one in this world so far as i know has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people he quoted with obvious relish is that barnum peggy asked nope herb paused to light a cigarette old phineas taylor said theres a sucker born every minute same sentiment different words the other ones from henry louis instead oh mencken peggy said with faintor maybe not so faintdistaste back in the day i used to think he was the cleverest man alive thats okay sweetie so did he her husband said peggy snorted and went on but he started wearing thin when he went after roosevelt like a stray dog chasing a car and hes one of the jerks who stand up and whinny when they play deutschland uber alles she shuddered whenever the nazis announced a victory on the radio they preceded it with the german national anthem and the horst wessel lied the partys song he always has been he left the baltimore sun for a while during the last war because he liked the kaiser too well herb said did he i didnt remember that peggy confessed the other funny thing is how come two of the snottiest soandsos the countrys ever seen both went by initials instead of their names well i kind of sympathize with barnum herb said if i got stuck with phineas i wouldnt want the world to know about it either but theres nothing wrong with menckens monicker maybe he just needed a short waddayacallit byline peggy said yeah one of them herb nodded youre right though its funny looking back at things the kaiser wasnt such a bad guy peggy said she watched herb bristle as shed known he would after all hed put on khaki and gone over there to settle wilhelms hash a generation earlier all the same she stuck out her chin and went on well he wasnt darn it compared to hitler he was a regular rotarian honest to god compared to hitler stalins a rotarian for crying out loud herb said unless youre a rotarian yourself i mean or unless youre mencken peggy put in or unless youre mencken her husband agreed of course he doesnt like jews much either one more reason for him to root for the nazis against the reds i know mencken doesnt like jews but i dont think he has any idea how much hitler hates them peggy said slowly you know who the luckiest people in the world are all the jews in poland herb blinked how do you figure that polands on hitlers side if it werent hed be murdering the jews there i mean murdering no two ways about it the poles dont love jews either but they dont want to see them dead not like that anyhow herb took a last drag on the cigarette stubbed it out in a brass ashtray on the end table by his chair and lit another one a thin straight whisper of smoke rose from the ashtray till he noticed and did a proper job of killing the butt in a low troubled voice he said you see stories buried at the bottom of page nine in the paper pieces where the russians claim the germans are massacring jews uhhuh you do you dont see a heck of a lot of stories where the germans deny it either peggy said i know herb smoked the new cigarette in quick fierce puffs id always thought it was because claims like that werent even worth denying know what i mean now i wonder ive wondered all along said peggy whod seen the fun the nazis had with jews ever since the day they invaded czechoslovakia shed done more than wonder in fact shed believed every word we should do something about that herb said toss me your cigarettes will you peggy said liking him very much he was the best kind of american show him something wrong and he wanted to set it right the only trouble was europe didnt work that way so much history piled up on the hatreds there that sometimes pinning the blame was impossible after all this time which didnt stop people from slaughtering one another in carload lots to try to drown an ancient slight in blood good american tobacco helped her not think about any of that for a little while maybe if all the europeans and the japs were this prosperous they wouldnt want to smash in their neighbors skulls with pickaxes any more or maybe they would but theyd choose a fancier grade of pickaxe to do their dirty work that struck peggy as much too likely she shook her head the more you looked at this old world the more fouled up it seemed to be and she hadnt even started drinking yet chapter theo hossbach knew the way to smolensk whenever his panzer iii and the other machines in the regiment turned toward the soviet stronghold the ivans fought twice as hard as they did the rest of the time and considering how much trouble they made any time at all he didnt think the old panzer ii in which hed gone through so much with hermann witt and adi stoss would have survived this campaign no sooner had that gone through his head than he laughed at himself of course the old panzer wouldnt have survived the campaign it damn well hadnt so now hed had to get used to two new crewmen all things considered he would have been happier charging a red army machine gun with a luger the russians could only kill him they wouldnt want to try to get to know him he had new duties too but that wasnt so bad now he sat up front in the panzer next to adi with the radio set between them he could see out he needed to see out because he was in charge of the bow machine gun as well as the radio he could use them both at once if he had to controlling the gun with a padded mount that accommodated his forehead getting used to two new peoples habits seemed much harder kurt poske liked to sing and whistle to himself sometimes the loader didnt even realize he was doing it theo wanted to reach back and smash his kneecap with a wrench it might have been better had poske managed to stay on key on the other hand it might not he still would have been there lothar eckhardt by contrast cracked his knuckles everybody probably did that once in a while but the gunner did it all the time it sounded like gunfire coming from behind theo he could have come up with a million noises he would rather have heard a panzer iis turret had room for only one man sergeant witt had had to command the panzer and load and fire the cannon and the coaxial machine gun that left him as busy as a onearmed paper hanger with the hives but he did it for a long time he didnt need to any more not with this bigger more modern machine but everything seemed to come with a price driver and bow gunnerradioman could talk to each other without their crewmates hearing they could but mostly they didnt theo didnt talk much no matter what adi made more noise but he respected his comrades peculiarities that was one of the things that made soldiering beside him a pleasure as they rattled along one morning theo found a question escaping him you all right with the new guys adi glanced over in surprise a sentence from theo was like a couple of chapters from anybody else ja he answered pitching his voice so it wouldnt carry back to the turret pretty much wed all be dead by now if they didnt shoot straight he had that right no two ways about it eckhardt had been a pretty good gunner before he got this slot the reich s training centers took care of that and sergeant witt with his own wealth of experience made the kid better than he had been except for singing and whistling poske did all right in action too loader was the most junior position in the fiveman crew none of that had much to do with what theo meant though he tried again they give you a hard time nah stoss shook his head no worse than usual nothing a guy cant handle know what i mean theo nodded even the usual kind of ragging could rub a man raw if heinz naumann the guy who commanded the old panzer ii before sergeant witt hadnt got killed he and adi would have fought it out theo was sure of that he was also pretty sure adi would have done for the late sergeant lucky it didnt happenlucky for everybody but naumann one more question formed in theos head he didnt ask it like a cat he had a very clear sense of limits an authoritative voice spoke into his earphones look for ivans ahead map square red red i hear you theo responded and relayed the news to witt a brief pause followed no doubt the panzer commander was checking his maps german maps of russia werent nearly so good as the people who printed them thought but you did the best you could with what you had profanity followed the pause now they tell us witt said were already in square redfucking as if on cue machinegun bullets clattered off the right side of the panzer iiis hull if not for the hardened steel some of them would have punctured theo they sounded like pebbles tossed onto a corrugatediron roofbut not enough like that pebbles on an iron roof might startle but they wouldnt scare the piss out of you though he had a vision port over there he didnt want to open it that might have let in a bullet or two and he would rather have dealt with angry wasps wasps only made you wish you were dead the russians used oldfashioned heavy watercooled machine guns like the german maxim from the last war they werent very portable which didnt mean they wouldnt chew holes in you once they did get set up panzer halt sergeant witt ordered and adi stoss hit the brakes the turret slewed sideways witt gave crisp commands eckhardt firedonce twice shell casings clattered at the bottom of the fighting compartment the stink of cordite filled the panzer witt grunted in satisfaction forward again adi he said and traversed the turret so it faced the front once more that machine gun wouldnt bother anyone else theo still wondered how many other ivans lurked over to the right german foot soldiers would find outprobably the hard way no trees off in that direction so there probably werent any red army panzers lurking there he could hope not anyhow he couldand he did he peered out through his forward vision port that one boasted thick armor glass like the stuff in a stukas windshield it also had a steel shutter to keep the glass from getting nicked when bullets started flying scars and divots on the armor glass said the shutter didnt always get used you needed to know what was going on didnt you back in the panzer ii theo had never known what was going on or no more than the radio and his crewmates told him now he could see out monkey curiosity made him keep doing it too though as often as not he couldnt change anything he could and did tell himself it was line of duty he had the machine gun after all but a lot of the time he was just nosy he stiffened in dismay at the same time as adi let out a horrified yip fucking ivans where the devil did they come from one second nothing the next a swarm of riflemen springing from the ground like the warriors old whatshisname the greek got when he sowed the dragons teeth well theo had some dragons teeth of his own the bow machine gun chattered spitting brass out of the side of its mouth the turret machine gun hammered away too the russian infantrymen went down in waves like threshed barley but the ones who didnt get shot kept coming they were brave too damn them and they wouldnt just have rifles some of them would carry molotov cocktails theo didnt want to think about blazing gasoline dripping into the panzerno not even a little bit so many things that would catch fire from paint to explosives to precious flesh theyd have grenades one of those through a hatch could ruin your day or bigger charges would blow off a track a stuck panzer was like a hamstrung bull waiting to be slaughtered firing short steady bursts wasnt easy he wanted to burn out the mgs barrel so he could kill as many russians as fast as he could discipline held though in its own harsh way wehrmacht training was a marvel so was whatever the ivans did to their men theo was sure he would have run away the russians stolidly kept coming till two stukas screamed down out of the sky and landed big bombs on them close enough to the panzer iii to make it try to rear that did the trick not even the reds could take a divebombing in stride the handful still on their feetnone near the panzerskedaddled adi laughed shakily all in a days work he said aber naturlich theo answered after refueling and resupplying at narvik which the kriegsmarine had quickly fitted out as a barebones uboat base julius lemp took the u back up to the barents sea he understood why the navy wanted to use the little town it lay pretty close to the barents sea itself as far as he was concerned that ended its advantages the uboat had got what it needed at narvik his men hadnt they couldnt drink and screw and blow off steam there a uboat base without a brothel what was the world coming to there was a club for sailors but it seemed a halfhearted affair with bad watery beer and not enough of it no wonder the ratings grumbled when they put to sea again in their shoes lemp would have grumbled too he would have grumbled in his own shoes except a skipper had no one aboard to grumble to he intended to take care of that when he got back to the reich he didnt want to put anything in writing but some of his superiors would get an earful the one good thing was his men were too busy to complain as much as they would have with more time on their hands here up past north latitude the sun stayed above the horizon most of the summer perpetual daylight kept everybody hopping all the time you never knew when you might spot a british convoy bound for murmansk or arkhangelskor when it might spot you prowling russian seaplanes were another danger lemp had met one of those in the baltic he didnt care to repeat the experience topside watches took all the concentration a man had you couldnt stretch people out past two hours with unending daylight to face ratings whod never stood a topside watch before got the chance to try it lemp got the chance to worry that they might miss something an old hand wouldnt have he gulped bicarbonate of soda to soothe an acid stomach wondering why hed ever wanted to become a naval officer navigation also got interesting the compass deflection was enormous accurate sun shoots became vitally important with no stars in the sky the sun was the only clue to direction they had none of the manuals talked about times like thisuboat men hadnt needed to worry about them in the last war that was another discussion lemp wanted to have with his superiors and even in summer the ocean was bitterly cold without the gulf stream it would have been colder yet without the gulf stream murmansk and arkhangelskand likely narvik as wellwould have been as icebound as antarctica then i wouldnt have to come up here lemp thought that wouldnt be so bad blackandwhite auks and puffins and murres bobbed on the sea now and then diving after fish or taking off with small hardworking wings they werent quite penguins but they came close enough to satisfy anybody this side of a relentless nitpicker the kriegsmarine sent out a coded message that a convoy had sailed from aberdeen bound for one russian port or the other lemp admired the british sailors courage and decided his own superiors werent the only ones with problems that convoy would have to face not only uboats but also landbased planes from norway talk about running the gantlet sure enough the planes soon found the convoy not only did they raidthey also shadowed relaying its position its course its speed diesels thrumming through the soles of his shoes lemp brought the u southwest to block its path he had to be careful destroyers or corvettes would be escorting the convoy on the surface they could sink him and he wouldnt be able to submerge then come back up later and escape under cover of darkness here there was no darkness so he made sure he had men who knew what they were doing up on the conning tower when the u neared the advancing convoy that convoy had already taken damagehe didnt know how much uboats transmitted only when they had to to keep the enemy from using their signals to work out where they were one thing he was sure of the freighters in the convoy would make more smoke than the u did hed find the british ships before they knew he was around after that was when things would get interesting the sun skimmed low above the northern horizon when one of the ratings spotted the smoke from the enemy lemp changed course so he could attack with the sun at his back the harder he could make things for the english the happier he would beand the better his chances of doing it again soon up went the schnorkel s stovepipe by now lemp took the gadget for granted more and more of the kriegsmarine s uboats used it these days it wasnt a punishment any more it was a tool of war one hed come to rely on but the royal navy had its own tools of war sharp almost musical pings echoed through the us hull after the boat went to schnorkel depth what the fuck is that gunter beilharz asked reaching under his stahlhelm to scratch his head they have an echo locater lemp answered its mentioned in my latest briefing reports it isnt perfect but its better than anything they used before beilharz eyed him in something approaching horror they can get range and bearing from the echoes thats the idea lemp allowed their toy isnt everything it ought to be though it had better not be the schnorkel officer said if they can find us whenever they please theyll sit on top of us and drop ash cans till we either cave in or have to come up and fight it out on the surface a uboat that got into a surface engagement with a warship designed to fight up there was dead meat everybody knew it lemp would have been happier not to get the reminder and he would have been much happier if the periscope hadnt shown him a royal navy corvette speeding his way with a bone in her teeth that damned echo locater did work he didnt want to take on a warship he could sink her with an eel before she got close enough to hurt him he could if he was good enough and if he was lucky enough and if he felt like telling the other english warships where he was ping ping with that miserable gadget they already had a pretty good notion but then other noises came through the us steel hull the unmistakable heavy crump of a torpedo exploding and after that the sound of a ship breaking up that dreadful creaking and crackling made any man who went to sea flinch it also made the royal navy corvette spin through as tight a turn as she could make and dash back toward the vessels she was shepherding half a dozen men inside the u gave forth with various profane variations on whats going on well i dont know for sure lemp answered but unless theyre sinking their own ships id say we arent the only uboat in the neighborhood an elk struggling through deep snow would draw a pack of wolves a convoy crossing dangerous waters might draw a pack of submarines another torpedo slammed into a freighter this ship by the sound of it didnt break up right away maybe the sailors would have a chance to make the boats and get picked up for their sake lemp hoped so the poor devils wouldnt last long bobbing in the barents sea those two hits made the enemy forget all about lemps boat the escorting warships were hellbent on hunting down the wolf that had already bitten them with the schnorkel getting into range of a fat freighter belching coal smoke was almost unfairly easy she even obligingly zigzagged to present her flank torpedo one los torpedo two los lemp commanded as soon as he had the shot lined up twin wet whooshes meant the eels were on their way both hit one was a dud it thunked off the coalburners flank but the other eel tore a hole in her stern before lemp really started swearing she soon began to settle in the water by then lemp and the helmsman had swung the u toward another target this one a bit more than a kilometer off a longish shot but he launched only one torpedo he saved the last one in the forward tubes for selfdefense reloading was a slow sweaty job and his boat wouldnt stay forgotten now that hed announced himself cheers echoed through the uboat when the eel struck home as soon as it did lemp pulled away from the convoy the snort let him go twice as fast underwater as he could have without it and you had to sense when you shouldnt get greedy there would be plenty of other chancesprovided he didnt throw himself away on this one had corporal hideki fujita stood any straighter and stiffer anyone seeing him would have thought hed been carved from wood but would a sculptor have included a saluting mechanism of such mechanical perfection requesting permission to speak to you captain san fujita said his voice an emotionless rasp captain masanori ikejiri returned the salute hai nan desuka he could have just told fujita to dry up and blow away that he asked him what it was instead showed he didnt despise the very ground on which the demoted noncom walked that was something anyway it was more than most of fujitas superiors seemed willing to admit please excuse me sir but i am not useful here now that my bungling has made me lose face if fujita was going to grovel hed grovel as hard as he could no sense to half measures not here not now and he was sure groveling was his only chance to escape this humiliating situationunless he killed himself of course that was always a possibility but he didnt want to die not yet let me serve the empire somewhere else in some different way please sir let me go forth with my rifle and kill the empires enemies ikejiri eyed him if the captain wasnt from a noble family fujita would have been amazed he had the air of effortless ease and style plenty of people tried to imitate but rarely with much luck you needed to be born to it to take it for granted to bring it off as you should he also had any japanese officers uncompromising attitude if you fail you must take the consequences he said coolly yes sir but here at this place i dont have much chance to make up for failing fujita replied put me in front of the enemy captain san and ill show the emperor what i can do there are more kinds of courage corporal than the one it takes to charge a machinegun position ikejiri said captain san all fujita really heard was his new reduced rank corporal was a grade a man should hold on the way up to something better holding it again on the way down from something better burned like lye you have to be brave dont you to do your job in spite of any trouble you had the captain said yes other people will know what happened but your duties here at pingfan are still important sir i want to kill something fujita blurted desperately even the maruta laugh at me hard to be laughed at by a log ikejiri said in musing tones cant you make them afraid to open their mouths while youre close enough to hear them oh yes sir and i do fujitas hands folded into reminiscent fists but the sons of assfucked whores go on laughing at me behind my back i know they do you couldnt pound a man into the ground for an amused glint in his eye even if the man was also a log american maruta were too scarce and too valuable to let guards smash them around for the fun of it some of the bacteriologists experiments required subjects in good condition prisoners at pingfan often got plenty to eat because of that not the starvation rations men base enough to surrender deserved hmm captain ikejiri rubbed his chin we dont usually give men back to the ordinary military once they get stationed here they know too many things that are nobody elses business i wouldnt blab sir by the emperor id never say a word not a peep fujita had been proud of knowing things about japans war effort that not many people kneweven if as a noncom off a farm he didnt understand much about the scientific details now he would gladly have forgotten everything in another army ikejiri might have mentioned the risk of his getting captured to do so here would have been an unbearable insult the captain knew fujita would rather die again he could have just told fujita to shut up and do as he was told fujita had been more than half expecting that maybe he would have obeyed maybe he would have obeyed for a while and then blown his brains out even he wasnt sure and if he wasnt how could captain ikejiri be rubbing his chin again the officer said how would you like to get away from this encampment for a while corporal doing what sir you know we are making weapons hereweapons to use against the chinese and the americans and anyone else who stands in the way of the coprosperity sphere oh yes sir fujita nodded remembering the ride deep into the country to test the germ bomb on the russian maruta relief filled him hed feared ikejiri would give him something worthless something useless to do but finding out how to kill chinese in carload lots sounded important all right then captain ikejiri spoke quickly now with the air of a man whod come to a decision you may do that we have air bases that deliver special weapons where they are needed i will transfer you to one of those thank you sir oh thank you fujita said all but jumping for joy with any luck at all the people who served on that air base wouldnt know what kind of bakayaro hed been here one thing sure he wouldnt have prisoners laughing at him any more maybe you shouldnt thank me just yet masanori ikejiris voice was dry you will be going into more danger than youre likely to face here make sure your rifle is clean and well oiled it is sir fujita assured him all i have to do is throw a few things in my duffel and im ready to leave hed been eager to come to pingfan now he was even more eager to get away dont get too excitedit wont happen quite so fast the captains voice stayed dry we have to go through the proper channels and the paperwork will take a while but ill put in the transfer right away something in his tone said right away meant as soon as you quit bothering me for a wonder fujita realized as much he wanted to grab the officers hand and kiss it for another wonder he had sense enough to see that wouldnt do him any good he saluted againa salute extravagant enough to come out of a movie and to make a drill sergeant snarl curses at him he figured captain ikejiri had earned this one the only person he told about the upcoming transfer was senior private hayashi theyd served together for a long time and hayashi had or at least showed more sympathy than most soldiers good luck he said i hope the fellow who takes your slot isnt too big a chucklehead why should you worry fujita said with a wry grin after all youve had enough practice putting up with me you arent bad youve never been bad hayashi said you beat us when wed earned it but not just for the sake of showing us what a big cock youve got what more could a private want from a noncom by the way he said it wanting even that muchor that littlewas an exercise in optimism and so it was back before fujita got promoted plenty of brutal corporals and sergeants thumped him for no better reason than that their rank gave them the right that was how things worked in the japanese army fujita couldnt imagine things working any other way getting the transfer took longer than he thought it should only fear that captain ikejiri would rescind it if fujita bothered him kept the corporal from asking what had gone wrong he made himself wait he couldnt think of many tougher things hed done as a soldier at last the precious form came through with it came a note that said a truck would take him to harbin once there he would ride the train and then well it got complicated then hed end up in yunnan province or maybe in burma depending on how things went before he arrived he couldnt have found yunnan on a map to save his life he wasnt so sure about burma either he didnt care he could go to the other end of the world for all the difference that made to him more than half of him hoped he would if nobody knew him when he finally arrived wherever that was wonderful what more than a fresh start could a man down on his luck hope for they pinned the order of the red star on anastas mouradian for shooting down a flying pencil he wished winning the medal would have meant more to him what it did mean boiled down to two things first hed taken a chance and lived through it and second the authorities might cut him a little more slack with the medal than they would have if he hadnt won it sadly he understood he couldnt count on the second one to hold true if the nkvd decided he was a nuisance hed end up in a gulag or dead as fast as the chekists could arrange it if they only wondered the medal might make them give him the benefit of the doubt well it might with the war not going so well he needed any goodluck charm he could grab the powers that be in the soviet union were like badtempered children when they didnt get their way they threw tantrums badtempered children smashed toys or maybe dishes badtempered soviet commissars and their flunkies smashed people instead mouradian didnt worry about his own side more than he did about the germans hitlers minions were actively trying to kill him the nkvd wasnt he didnt think it was anyhow still he couldnt help noting that in a perfect world he wouldnt have had to worry about his own side at all what this world was imperfect what a surprise what a disappointment if this were the perfect world or even a better world the nazis and their parasites wouldnt be closing in on smolensk but they were despite the soviet armed forces bestcertainly most ferventefforts to stop them radio moscow tried its hardest to deny that these days though luftwaffe bombers could reach the ussrs capital once theyd knocked radio moscow off the air for several hours only once but stas didnt take it for a good sign and if this were the perfect world or even a better one the soviet move against romania would have bothered the fascists more a blow against their soft underbelly only the underbelly turned out not to be so soft these days the fighting wasnt in eastern romania it was in the western ukraine no doubt because it was radio moscow mentioned it as seldom as possible so stas relied on things he heard unofficially you couldnt always rely on such things then again you couldnt always rely on radio moscow either though saying so or even lifting an eyebrow at the wrong time could cost you your life unofficially some ukrainians were greeting the nazis as liberators giving them bread and salt and strewing flowers in the path of their armored personnel carriers unofficially things in the ukraine had been very bad before the war soviet authorities were bound and determined to liquidate the kulak class and well they might have beenthe richer peasants hadnt cared to give up their land and flocks and tools and join collective farms the authorities broke them nobody knew how many ukrainians diedstarved or shotin the collectivization process or if anyone did know he wasnt talking if some of the survivors didnt act like good soviet citizens now whose fault was that theirs of course or it would be if the ussr won then theyd look down the barrel of another round of retribution in the meantime maybe they were getting some of their own back stas did wonder how much he also heard unofficial things about how the germans behaved in soviet territory some of those things were hard to believe if the nazis acted that way in the ukraine theyd wear out their welcome in a hurry maybe they wouldnt be so stupid down there or maybe they would stas wouldnt have been surprised it wasnt as if stalin hadnt acted like a bloodthirsty monster enforcing his will there the armenian flyer sighed after he got back to his tent he was alone thereit was safe enough as safe as anything could be these days anyhow no when stalin behaved like a bloodthirsty monster he wasnt acting he was showing what he really was and so was hitler which one made the worse bloodthirsty monster stas was damned if he knew the english had had an affair with hitler and decided they would rather dance with stalin the french by contrast stayed in bed with the nazis so did the poles but they would have slept with stalin had hitler jumped them first stas almost welcomed the next mission wasnt a clean chance of getting killed better than the muddy ocean of doubts that had filled his thoughts lately he could make himself believe it right up till the moment when shell fragments slammed into the pe as soon as that happened he discovered how much he wanted to live the engines still sounded all right there was no fire he gave the instrument panel a quick frightened onceover the fuel gauge stayed steady so did oil pressure he cautiously tried the controls all seemed in working order bozhemoi he saidwith feeling i didnt think wed be that lucky another german antiaircraft shell burst close to the bomber the pe staggered in the air but no more clangs or rattles warned of another hit ivan kulkaanen frowned he fiddled with his earphones his frown deepened radios out he reported no one was talking in stas earphones at the moment either was that because no one was talking or because nobody could get through mouradian did some fiddling of his own then he eyed the sets dials he hadnt done that beforehed had more urgent things to worry about sure enough every needle lay dead against its peg well it could be worse he said we can get back without a radio and theyll slap in another one or splice the cut wires or do whatever else needs doing sure kulkaanen nodded nobody can order us to do anything stupid now either no one would ever do anything like that virtue overflowing filled mouradians voice he and the young blond karelian in the other seat exchanged amused looks of course their superiors were always wise and careful of course no one would warn them if messerschmitts attacked the squadron either stas spent the rest of the flight wishing for eyes in the back of his head wishing failed to produce them he got back to the airstrip anyhow and put the pe in the hands of the repair crews he hadnt been down long before the squadron commander summoned him saluting he said i serve the soviet union do you lieutenant colonel tomashevsky growled then why didnt you move up in the formation when i ordered you to dammit sir i never heard that order mouradian explained what had happened finishing you can check with the groundcrew men theyll tell you im not making any of this up tomashevsky eyed him i wont check but if i ever find out you were lying youre dead no demotions no camps no punishment details dead he spoke without melodrama stas might have wished to hear some that would have left him less than sure the squadron commander meant it as things were he had no room for doubt tomashevsky kept looking at him waiting for him to say something willing him to say something so he did sir if i ever lie it wont be about anything where you can catch me i should hope not the senior officer said youd have to be stupid to do something like that darkhaired men arent stupid they have other things wrong with them but they arent stupid russians often lumped armenians and georgians and jews together that way stas mildly resented it so did most armenians and georgians and he supposed even jews with a crooked smile he answered sir i didnt come here to pick your pocket i came here to blow up germans always a worthy cause tomashevsky agreed dryly but if a pocket walks by begging to be picked will you hold back maybe not stas admitted but then would you for a moment he feared hed cut too close to the bone but the squadron commander laughed and waved him away away he went before tomashevsky could change his mind chapter this was the biggest damn fleet pete mcgill had ever seen if it wasnt the biggest damn fleet in the history of the world that sure wasnt from lack of effort on the us navys part it stretched from horizon to horizon pete was sure it stretched over the horizon the destroyers and cruisers and battlewagons and carriers stayed well separated from one another to make sure the japs couldnt do too much in any one spot that didnt worry pete if i was that cocksucker tojo id be shaking in my boots right now he declared got that right ace joe orsatti agreed the gun chief waved expansively all the firepower were bringing to the dance we wont just lick the fucking jap navy well sink their lousy islands too there you go pete liked the sound of that planes from the combat air patrol droned overhead the american fleet hadnt come far from oahu yet but the brass already knew the japs liked playing with naval air power the fighters up there were f wildcats the japanese zero was supposed to be hot shit it was hot shit pete had seen as much in the philippines but he had confidence in good old american knowhow if the wildcat couldnt mop the floor with the jap fighter something was badly wrong somewhere and if the american fleet couldnt mop the floor with the japanese navy something was badly wrong somewhere too pete didnt know the details of the attack plan such things were not for marine sergeants to worry about like most of the tens of thousands of other men in the fleet he did grasp the basic idea theyd steam west till they ran into the slanteyed sons of bitches steaming east then theyd knock the living snot out of them and clear their garrisons off all the pacific islands they infested what could be simpler a pair of albatrosses scudded past the boise their wingspan didnt seem much smaller than a wildcats pointing to them orsatti asked ever shoot the shit with a guy who was stationed on midway i dont think so pete answered how come thats where the gooney birds lay their eggs like when its mating season or whatever the hell they call it theres thousands of em must be something theyre amazing in the air orsatti grinned you sure as hell never talked with no midway marine yeah the gooneys are great while theyre flying but you know what their landing gears shot to shit they come gliding in they put down their feetand they crash land every fuckin time ass over teakettle like you wouldnt believe theyre just lucky they dont carry avgas on account of theyd burn like mad bastards if they did this isnt bs pete was wary of getting his leg pulled honest to god truth the gun chief held up his right hand so help me hannah it is like something out of a disney cartoon only its the genuine article i wouldnt mind seeing that for myself pete paused considering well if seeing it didnt mean going to midway holy christ mantalk about the ass end of nowhere there is that orsatti said but its probably why the gooney birds go oohlala there i mean whos gonna bother em till we got there there wasnt anything to bother em i guess till that moment pete hadnt worried about where albatrosses went to make whoopee for all he knew they checked into hotels like everybody else but thinking about midway made him think about other islands too i wish like hell the japs hadnt grabbed wake and guam guam was gonna catch it that was in the cards look at a mapits the meat in a japisland sandwich orsatti said wake yeah wakes a bitch they hit it when we were still jumping up and down from the raid on pearl so now its their forward outpost instead of ours uhhuh thats what worries me you gotta figure the slopesre flying planes outa there now pete said so what happens when they spot us they let the rest of the buddhaheads know right listen to your uncle joe orsatti said seriously first thing is the wildcats arent just flying over us theyre out ahead of us too so they may knock down the jap snoops before any word gets back but even if they dont so what we want to do for the japanese navy right well sure when you put it that way mcgill replied only i dont like it when they know what were up to while we go in blind wont matter when the shooting starts orsatti spoke with serene confidence if admiral kimmel the man in charge of the american fleet shared that confidence he didnt let it go to his head men on the boise got called to battle stations at all hours of the day and night and it was bound to be the same on every other ship petes heart pounded whenever he ran to the gun would this be the time it wasnt a drill or this or news crackled out of the intercom it is reported that an enemy reconnaissance seaplane has been attacked and shot down it is not known whether the personnel were able to signal that american aircraft were in the vicinity if the japs hadnt been able to radio a warning the pacific was a big place the biggest place in the whole world an airplane alone on the ocean was far smaller by comparison than a single mosquito buzzing around an elephant so many things could go wrong a plane that didnt come back wouldnt necessarily be blamed on enemy action necessarily that was an interesting word wasnt it then a japanese sub fired a torpedo at one of the destroyers out ahead of the fleet the torpedo missed the destroyer did its damnedest to sink the submarine it also failed but the cat was out of the bag were american submarines prowling way the hell off to the west if they spotted the oncoming japanese fleet would they send back a warning would they try to thin out the herd so to speak the answer to the first question was obviously yes to the second the fewer warships flying the rising sun pete had to worry about the happier hed be first things first though the first thing the fleet had to worry about was reclaiming wake island admiral kimmel approached the flyspeck on the map by night his ships ringed it when the sun came up as soon as the japs in the garrison spotted them they opened up with field artillery big guns answered them so did divebombers flying off the carriers in spite of all the hell coming down on their heads the japanese managed to get a few planes of their own into the air as pete had seen in manila their divebombers looked oldfashioned like german stukas they had fixed landing gear also like stukas they could be deadly if they got a chanceor even half a chance one of them swooped down on a heavy cruiser that was in the same task force as the boise curtains of antiaircraft fire rose above the big ship as far as the enemy pilot was concerned they might as well not have been there if something got him it would get him he didnt seem to care one way or the other and he dropped his bomb from no more than fifty feet above the cruisers stacks something did get him as he roared away just above the waves his plane cartwheeled into the pacific he wouldnt have had anywhere to land on wake anyhow but he made the americans pay an enormous price for shooting him down that bomb must have reached one of the cruisers magazines because the ships whole bow blew off what was left sank hideously fast the boise hurried over to help pick survivors from the water there werent many most of them were hurt all seemed stunned im handing dave a shell an next thing i know he aint there no more an im in the drink one guy said which seemed to sum it up for everybody clumsy landing barges waddled toward wake jap shells fell among them one scored a direct hit bodies flew through the air as the barge sank most of the men were bound to be marines like pete all the same he wished he were riding in one of those barges landing on enemyheld beaches was what leathernecks were for a sailor could do the job he had now he could imagine nothing worse to say about it hey harcourt yeah im talking to you get your sorry ass over here that rasp always made luc wonder what hed done wrong nowno what hed got caught doing wrong now it always made him feel he was a private just out of basic and sergeant demange had nabbed him with his hand in the cookie jar no matter that he was a sergeant himself now and demange an officer the old feeling didnt go away luc didnt suppose it ever would what do you need sir luc almost called demange sergeant it wouldnt have been the first time habit died hard cmere i said dammit the cigarette in the corner of demanges mouth twitched as he talked luc wondered if he kept that gitane there even when he got laid it wouldnt have surprised the younger man one bit demange gestured peremptorily walk with me whatever you want sweetheart luc said demange didnt rise to the bait he just stomped away from the french encampment lucs legs were longer but he had to hustle to keep up the air smelled of dust no human habitations lay anywhere near luc had never dreamt how vast russia was the last frenchmen whod got this deep into the country marched with napoleon he hoped hed come out better than they did he still carried his rifle demange had one too along with an officers sidearm you didnt want to let the ivans catch you no matter how enticing their safeconducts seemed to jerks the front was supposed to lie a few kilometers off to the northeast but one thing you could always count on was russian infiltrators whats up luc asked after a little while keep walking demange answered i dont want any of those cons to hear this he spat out the latest gitanes mortal remains ground them under his bootheel and lit a fresh one am i in trouble no more than any of the rest of us lieutenant demange paused to blow out a stream of smoke then hurried on some crazy shit is going on thats all and i want to talk to somebody about it youve got your head on pretty straight and you dont run your mouth when you arent supposed to gee thanks lucs sardonic tone couldnt hide how pleased he was he would rather have got that kind of praise from demange than to have won a medal and brushed cheeks with general weygand to weygand he would be just another poilu demange knew him well enough for his judgment to mean something any time kid demange paused and looked back no none of the other french soldiers would overhear them now off in the distance artillery rumbled german guns luc thought recognizing the reports he was glad those s would come down on the ivans heads not on his of course the red army had plenty of artillery of its own but getting shelled by the boches still struck him as the definitive experience so whats the crazy shit he tried to keep his voice as casual as he could its political thats what demange couldnt have sounded more disgusted if he were talking about syphilis youre not one of those crazy reds or i wouldnt say boo to you but you dont wish you were wearing a german helmet either i should hope not those fuckers are heavy luc had handled them plenty of times dealing with dead or captured fritzes he preferred the lighter adrian helmet he had on right this minute but that was beside the point what do you mean political if you had your druthers who would you rather fight hitler or stalin if i had my druthers luc echoed demange nodded luc spoke without the least hesitation if i had my druthers sir id take off this uniform and burn it then id go home and try and forget everything thats happened to me the past going on three years salaud you dont get that many druthers the nazi or the communist whos in your sights first he was serious seeing him serious made luc think it over harder than hed expected to at last he said the germans live right next door that makes them trouble no matter whos in charge in berlin when its a cochon like hitler i mean stalins no bargain either but hes way the hell over here the boches are the ones who can really do us in there you go i knew you werent as dumb as you look lieutenant demange saidpraising with faint damn certainly but praising even so thats how it looks to me too but so what lieutenant here we are in the middle of russia if we dont go after the ivans theyll sure kill us demange got rid of another dead gitane this time he gave luc one after lighting up himselfanother sign he was pleased suppose a little bird told you theyre quietly working on stretching the maginot line from the belgian border all the way to the channel whered you hear that luc asked if demange met a little bird hed clean it and pluck it and roast it preferably stuffed with mushrooms never mind where what you dont know nobody can squeeze out of you demange might have been talking about interrogation by the enemy not by his own side he went on what you do need to know is this isnt somebody who talks out his asshole or i dont think so anyway huh luc said and then what do the germans say about that one of the big reasons the nazis had invaded france by way of the low countries was that they hadnt wanted to bang their heads against the works of the maginot line france had figured holland and belgium and luxembourg would make shield enough now that france knew better if the germans know what were up to they havent said anything about it the veteran replied thats what i hear huh luc said again more thoughtfully this time why arent they screaming their fool heads off quiet nazis it sounds unnatural demange rewarded him with a twisted grin it does doesnt it heres the best answer i can give you i dont know why if i was hitler me id be having kittens yeah me too luc agreed if somebody who showed hed gone over to your side by sending several divisions to help you fight your other enemies suddenly started strengthening his border against you you had to have something wrong with you if you didnt wonder why didnt you luc looked around yes he was glad none of the other soldiers could overhear them so what happens now do we cross over to the russians side of the line the way the tommies did or do we wait till somebody counts three and then turn our guns on the boches i mean i wouldnt mind but what happens now we keep on doing what weve been doing till somebody with clout tells us to do something else then we fucking well do that instead demange paused considering and you never heard word one about this crap from me understand try and say anything different and you wont live to enjoy it im no rat luc said genuinely affronted yeah yeah i know that i wouldntve said anything at all if i thought you were lieutenant demange replied but this is dynamite youve got to remember its dynamite otherwise youll get your hands blown off and youll be standing there bleeding and wondering what the hell happened to you a russian machine gun opened up not close enough to worry about a few seconds later a french machine gun answered maybe the diplomats were doing mysterious things behind the scenes the men who fought and died were still fighting and dying demange listened to the dueling murder mills with his head cocked to one side and that wry grin still on his face its all merde you know he said every goddamn bit of it uhhuh luc nodded all he wanted was to keep from getting ground between the gears hed managed so far another russian machine gun started firing pretty soon the artillery would join in how long could he stay lucky be careful what you ask for you may get it hideki fujita must have heard that before he requested a transfer away from pingfan sadly though it hadnt stuck and captain ikejiri had wasted no time in ridding the bacteriologicalwarfare unit of someone whod screwed up when fujita heard he was being transferred to yunnan province hed assumed he would travel down through china to wherever the devil yunnan was as things turned out the province lay in the far far south on the border with burma he couldnt simply hop on a train and go there because japanese control in china stopped well north of the area no things werent that simple the train took him from harbin to shanghai from there he took a ship to hong kong in hong kong newly seized from the british he had to wait two days for a plane to hanoi newly taken from the french after another flight he landed at the airport in mandalay burma too had belonged to england till the war got rolling then he took the train up to myitkyina near the chinese border the train trip was an adventure all by itself even before the fighting started the line must have been an afterthought of empire during combat english soldiers had sabotaged it here and there and the japanese broom of conquest hadnt come close to sweeping clean englishmen with rifles and mortars still roamed the countryside so did burmese bandits fujita fired out the window several times he wasnt always sure at whom he was shooting he didnt much care either nobody who was shooting at him was likely to be friendly myitkyina lay in the middle of steaming jungle snowcapped mountains corrugated the horizon to the east and north signs at the train station were written in characters he couldnt read he grabbed the first japanese soldier he saw and askedalmost beggedto be taken to the local army headquarters since the soldier he grabbed was only a private the fellow couldnt tell him to get lost he didnt look happy though well come on then he said gruffly four other japanese soldiers whod got off the train with fujita eagerly followed they seemed just as lost and confused as he was not surprisingly the functionaries who made southern army go had claimed the best hotel in town it was a fourthrate copy of a thirdrate hotel in a secondrate city in some happier english colonial possession getting shelled in the conquest did nothing to improve it the clerks there rapidly dealt with the other newly arrived japanese soldiers each of those men had a slot and they fit him into it no one seemed to have any idea what to do with fujita from the kwangtung army from manchukuo to here a senior sergeant shook his head in disbelief eee someones played a dirty trick on you corporal or maybe on us you dont have any records that show where im supposed to go fujita asked you might as well have fallen from the moon for all i know you did the sergeant seemed to think he was a funny fellow but thats crazy if fujita sounded desperate it was only because he was they not only didnt have a slot for him they didnt even have a board with slots to find out where he fit and here he was lucky not to have got killed before he made it to this miserable place hed thought captain ikejiri was doing him a favor ikejiri must have hated his guts well lets try a different angle the sergeant said what did you do when you were in manchukuo before fujita could answer several more soldiers from the train found their way to the hotel the military bureaucrat dealt with them and seemed to forget about fujita the other soldiers were easy he wasnt and he had to be careful about what he said well before i got here i served in colonel ishiis unit he replied when the senior sergeant had time for him once more zakennayo that worthy exclaimed who in blazes is colonel ishii what does his damned unit dobesides sending people all over the coprosperity sphere i mean fujita wondered how he should answer that he feared he shouldnt answer it at all he also feared he would end up in trouble if he didnt but when the senior sergeant shouted colonel ishiis name a skinny little superior private with glasses pricked up his ears please excuse me sergeant san he said and drew the noncom off to one side they talked together in low voices for a couple of minutes oh the senior sergeant said loudly hes with those people he turned back to fujita why didnt you say you were with those people again fujita didnt have to answer because the bespectacled senior private did some more urgent murmuring the senior sergeant threw his hands in the air he made as if to clout the younger man who flinched frightening someone seemed to make the sergeant feel better fujita knew that feeling security the sergeant said as if it were the filthiest word he knew maybe it was he glowered at fujita if you dont tell us what youre good for how can we send you where you need to go if i do tell you i violate the orders i got to keep that work secret fujita answered unhappily bah the senior sergeant sounded disgusted go to yanai then he pointed at the senior private hell write you orders to get you out there out where fujita wondered well hed find out and so he did superior private yanai wrote out the orders saying this will take you out to unit in the th infantry division theres a shed next to the train station you get your transport there a shed next to the train station fujita knew he sounded dismayedor maybe furious a kilometer back to where hed just come from in this heat and humidity he wasnt looking forward to that shigata ga nai corporal im sorry yanai spread his hands in what looked like real sympathy whether it was or not he was right it couldnt be helped wearily fujita slung his rifle over his shoulder and trudged away from the hotel unfamiliar gaudy birds chirped in the bushes the shed smelled like a barn both soldiers on duty there were drunk fujita had to shout at them to discover what they called transport a creaking ox cart they were in charge of a dozen or so carts with the oxen to haul them hither and yon the oxen no doubt explained the smell the first driver the men in charge of the shed hunted up had no idea where unit was stationed they swore at him but he insisted hed never been there things had been ragged out on manchukuos border with sovietbacked mongolia here they would have had to shape up to seem ragged this was the raw edge of conquest that japanese soldiers ruled here near burmas chinese frontier should have been inspiring that the soldiers actually at the frontier were less than the shining lights of the japanese army shouldnt have been surprising fujita had traveled too far too fast to stay tolerant he screamed at the stablemen one of them was a corporal too he didnt care if the other fellow felt like fighting he intended to maim him for life he was almost disappointed when the other corporal quailed instead even a drunk could tell he had murder in his eyes and the next driver the stablemen hunted up did know about unit ive been there before he said i can find it again he eyed fujita keep your piece handy while we go though you might want to fix your bayonet too things can get pretty hairy around here i found out about that on the way up fujita unsheathed the bayonet and snapped it into place under his arisakas muzzle he could have walked to unit as fast as the ox cart brought him there he would have had to work harder though the trail they followed wasnt much wider than the cart anything or anyone might have burst out of the jungle before fujita or the driver could do anything about it the oxen took their own sweet time splashing across streams it was almost sunset when they reached the clearing that held unit no fancy compound herenothing but tents no officer of rank higher than captain either and nobody from that captain down to the almost toothless old burmese woman who cooked for the unit had the slightest idea that fujita was coming or what to do with him now that he was here demons take it the captain said at last youre really from unit he might have been a skinny little wouldbe wrestler talking about someone from a famous sumo dojo yes sir i really am fujita said how about that im sure youll do a lot of good here then with all the things youre bound to know for now get some rice pour some of the old gals stew over it and find somewhere to unroll your blanket or sling your hammock weve got a lot going on here im sure youll fit right in yes sir thank you sir fujita knew better than to argue with an officer he also knew better than to ask the burmese woman what all went into the stew it didnt taste half bad even if it was spicier than he fancied better not to wonder where the meat came from hed had stews like that before as long as it filled him up he wouldnt complain la martellita looked daggers at chaim weinberg if this was the kind of love wives were supposed to show husbands he sure didnt want to see how shed act when she was pissed off at him as a matter of fact he had seen that and more often than he wanted her hands cupped her bulging belly you did this to me she screeched more or less accurately they were walking along a street in madrid la martellita didnt care she let him have it any which way other people within earshot turned to listen street theater was the best and cheapest entertainment in town it was a hell of a lot more interesting than the crap either the republicans or the nationalists put on the radio chaim knew about street theater growing up in new york citys lower east side he couldnt very well not know about it but he enjoyed watching and listening to other people more than being watched and listened to take it easy magdalena he said trying to soothe his inamorata till they got to some place where she could scream at him in something resembling privacy and dont call me by that name she told him still at top volume dont you dare call me by that name youve got no business knowing that name im the little hammer do you hear me si magdalena chaim answered easily if she was going to work like a stakhanovite to piss him off the least he could do was return the disfavor she said something so incandescent that a little old woman with a face like a roman bust that was starting to crumble crossed herself in the aggressively anticlerical spanish republic that was shock indeed someone might denounce you for showing you believed as for chaim he understood most of what his very pregnant sweetheart called him he would have murdered any man who said a quarter of that to him and not a jury in the world would have convicted him either plenty of spaniards would have decked a woman who talked to them like that some would have got a shiv in the ribs after decking them too spain was a lively country hed already proved he was a soft americanand no one who tried belting la martellita would have had joy of it afterwards so instead of making a fist and playing the goon he gave her his blandest stupidest smile que he said sweetly she started to explode then she saw he was waiting for that she sent him a glare acid enough to etch glass instead of shrieking she asked are you playing games with me in a deadly quiet voice youre the one whos been playing all the games chaim answered yes youre going to have a baby i didnt rape you i did marry you what else do you want from me unfortunately he knew what else she wanted she wanted him not to be so short and stumpy she wanted him to have a handsomer face he wouldnt have minded a handsomer face himself but he was stuck with the mug hed been issued his looks werent the real problem though even his being jewish wasnt the real problem though in a way it came closer the real problem was he wasnt a good enough communist to suit her maybe that had something to do with his being jewish it sure as hell had something to do with his being american he was so used to thinking for himself he did it without thinking so to speak la martellita was made for knocking unorthodoxy flat she would have been great in the inquisitionshe had the full measure of spanish zeal if hed really wanted to hurt her he would have told her so you didnt rape me she agreed and well she mightany man who tried to have his way with her without her consent would leave his cojones behind but i wasnt sober when you did me either neither was i the first time chaim said which was at least partly true but we both were the next morning there wouldnt have been a next morning if there hadnt been a first night chaim sighed that was also true dammit he spread his hands all we can do now is try and make the best of it yelling at me all the time doesnt help it just gives me a headache i dont yell at you all the time la martellita said when youre up at the front i cant no all they can do up there is kill me chaim said she looked at him in incomprehension it wasnt his spanish either hed said what he meant but she didnt get it she was beautiful she was dangerous the combination was irresistible to chaim much as a tigers terrible beauty had to be to a beasttamer one split second of inattention one tiny mistake with the chair and youd be lying on the ground in the middle of the center ring bleeding your life out and all the marks in the bleachers would go oooh life with la martellita was a lot like that too much like that for what had to be the first time chaim wondered yes she was beautiful yes she was dangerous yes the combination was intoxicating but when you got right down to it how bright was she really intoxicated chaim had never stopped to worry about it hed never stopped to think it might matter not thinking was most unusual for him and telling testimony to just how head over heels he was about her most of the time he thought convulsively propulsively continuously if he hadnt turned red he would have made a yeshivabukher to be remembered for generations if he thought about la martellita instead of remembering what touching her felt like why are you looking at me like that she asked like what chaim feared he knew like what but he didnt want to acknowledge it evenespeciallyto himself for a while you imagine that something broken will put itself back together by magic but magic is in desperately short supply in the material world like the way youre looking at me thats like what it was obvious to la martellita like i just died or something no not you chaim said sadly hed never imagined himself a prophet but he could see the future all too clearly now it was a future where he didnt see the son or daughter swelling in la martellitas belly it was a future where he didnt see her either and probably one where she told the child nothing but bad things about its father hed just watched his love die and he had no idea what he could do about it what then she demanded it wasnt obvious to her he could see why not too shed never been in love with him if hed thought she was it was only because hed made her reflect what he most wanted to see he could tell her what difference would it make not much which was part of the problem but like a wounded soldier who wont look to see how badly hes hit chaim didnt want to bring out the fatal words he said never mind instead hoping against hope the wound wasnt mortal after all chapter nothing in central europe or france had braced vaclav jezek for summer outside madrid dust blazing sun air that sucked moisture from your body like a vampire the only thing that hadnt changed was the stink of death that stayed the same everywhere it was bound to be the same in hell assuming this battlefield wasnt one of satans ritzier suburbs vaclav wasnt the only one to feel the heat either several of his countrymen got carried off the field with sunstroke he heard later that one of them had died through it all benjamin halevy went about his business as calmly as if it were an april day in paris or prague he might have been made of metal whatever he was made of the savage spanish heat couldnt melt him why arent you baked like the rest of us vaclav snarled the weather left him shorttempered too its hot halevy said but my people came out of the desert remember i guess the memory of its still in my bones he sounded serious as jezek had seen though he often sounded that way when he was anything but desert my ass the sniper said well if your ass seems cooler than the rest of you maybe it came out of the desert too halevy eyed him have to say you dont look like youve got any jews in the woodpile what first sprang to vaclavs mind was something about halevys mother but he could see for himself how halevy would parry that you didnt want to get into a manure fight with a guy who ran a fertilizer factory halevy thought faster and nastier than he did and that was all there was to it instead of being bitchy jezek asked have you heard anything about when marshal sanjurjo will inspect the trenches again he waved toward the nationalist lines taking care not to raise any part of his arm above parapet level benjamin halevy grinned crookedly ive finally sucked you in huh you want him bet your sweatless ass i do vaclav answered and the jew laughed out loud undeterred vaclav continued if i pot the fat old bastard theyll pin a medal on me theyll promote me so i get some extra pay for real and more besides in promises theyll send me back to madrid and let me drink and fuck as much as i want maybe theyll even pay for the spree so yeah if sanjurjo shows up ill punch his ticket for him youve got all kinds of good reasons halevy allowed and on top of it it might even help the war effort that too vaclav agreed the damned jew started laughing again vaclav couldnt see why if it had provoked him enough he might have taken a swing at his buddy halevy was an officer now so that could have been a capital crime worrying about it wasnt what held vaclav back the sensible concern that hed wake up in the bottom of the trench with a sore jaw and maybe a couple of broken teeth had much more to do with it instead of decking the jew jezek lugged his antitank rifle down the line and spied on the nationalist positions the enemy soldiers carried on in plain sight of him he could have killed some of them but to what end theyd tighten up and get more wary that was the last thing he wanted almost the last thing a spanish sharpshooter had hunted him for a little while the wouldbe marksman was now of concern only to his next of kin it wasnt that he hadnt been brave it wasnt even that he hadnt been a good shot but he must have got what he knew about concealment out of some badly translated manual from the last war the nationalists wore germanstyle helmets which made them familiarlooking enemies those helmets were pretty good but they wouldnt stop an ordinary bullet let alone the fat ones vaclav used that sniper got only one lesson in the art a very final one there were steel loopholes along the line from which vaclav could inspect the enemys trenches as was his habit he stayed away from them an ordinary soldier couldnt put a bullet through one except by luck and from what hed seen spanish soldiers were often less than ordinary but you never could tell the nationalists might have a few real experts or they might talk to their italian allies or to the germans of the legion kondor for someone who knew what he was doing a loophole was a challenge not something too tough to bother with he crossed into the trenches the international brigades held they greeted him in several languages some of which he understood aprobablemagyar spoke in german havent seen any elephants around here for a long time i keep snapping my fingersthats why vaclav answered in the same language the international made a horrible face vaclav trudged on down the line the americans in the abe lincoln battalion or maybe it was a brigade even they didnt seem sure had more trouble talking to him than most of the other internationals they knew english and some of them had picked up enough spanish to get by neither of those did him much good and they were unlikely to speak any other tongue one exception wassurprise a jew from new york city chaim understood vaclavs german and vaclav usually managed to cope with his yiddish the abe lincoln didnt look very happy right now whats up vaclav asked my girl and meits gonna go down the drain chaim mimed a little whirlpool in case vaclav didnt get it but he did its gonna go down the drain he echoed it hasnt happened yet maybe it wont its gonna chaim repeated gloomily some stuff you see coming way ahead of time you cant stop it not unless youre superman maybe not even if you are not unless youre who vaclav asked superman ubermensch itd be in german but the english doesnt make you sound like a fucking nazi the guys a comicbook hero lemme show youa buddy sent me a couple from the states and they honest to god got here would you believe it theyre pretty good chaim rummaged in his pack till he grunted in victory and pulled out a gaudily printed comic book the text was in english of course vaclav knew even less english than spanishhe could get beer and some food in spanish now and was starting to be able to swear when he didnt get them fast enough to suit him but there wasnt a whole lot of text anyway the pictures carried the action and pictures were a universal language for what he couldnt get from them chaim made an enthusiastic translator and explainer see metropolis is pretty much like new york city the american jew said not exactly but pretty much im from new york city so i should know right new york city is like that vaclav pointed to one of the panels superman was rescuing a scantily clad girl with one hand and picking up an enormous locomotive in the other the bad guys tommygun bullets ricocheted off his chest as if he were armored like a tank well not exactly chaim sounded a little embarrassed but the look of the placethe skyscrapers and the cars and the clothes and allthats pretty close and the newspaper office where superman works when hes being clark kent that looks like a newspaper office i mean its bigger and cleaner than a real oneive been in em so i knowbut its got the idea right anyway vaclav had been in a newspaper office in prague it was tiny and airless and dark housed in some building left over from the eighteenth century it smelled of ink and beer and tobacco and unwashed people how it turned out a newspaper every day god only knew the editor plainly had no idea next to that even a rougher version of what the comic book showed seemed very much like heaven america must be a strange place vaclav said man you got no idea chaim answered if you lived there why did you come here for freedom for adventure for love the jews face twisted and i got em all and they aint worth shit women are crazy you know you cant live with em and you sure as hell cant live without em not much originality there but great feeling carefully vaclav said you arent the first guy who ever found this out i guess not but that dont make it hurt any less chaim replied and vaclav found himself without a comeback for that willi dernen sewed his pip onto a patch with a chevron then sewed the chevron onto the left sleeve of his uniform tunic not just a gefreiter an obergefreiter the promotion gods had smiled on him again presumably because hed stayed lucky enough not to stop anything he was a very senior private indeed he found it obvious that if and when a bullet finally found arno baatz he could step right up and do awful arnos job better than arno did himself corporal baatz unsurprisingly held a different opinion you think youre such hot shit dont you baatz said well puff and blow all you want they wont make you an unteroffizier if you live to be a million blow me arno willi thought aloud he said how about that it was a pretty safe phrase any old time well they wont dammit awful arno insisted you have to go to noncoms school to learn to do all the stuff an unteroffizier has to do it takes weeks youd never hack itno way in hell as far as willi was concerned if awful arno had made it through noncoms training school anything this side of hans the counting horse could probably do the same telling him as much was a great temptation regretfully willi held back life was too short he supposed so all he said was i notice youre wearing your shoulder straps upside down so the ivans dont spot the pips on them i should hope i am baatz said importantly most noncoms do you know the reds understand that were what makes the army tick theyd sooner shoot a corporal than a private any old day willi had never dreamt he would sympathize with the red army but all of a sudden he did again letting baatz know everything on his mind struck him as less than a good idea he hoped he sounded patient as he answered i understand that but my pips on my sleeve where i cant hide it and the chevron only makes it stand out more shall i cry for you awful arno said and willi sympathized with the russian sharpshooters more than ever luckily not understanding that baatz went on anyway youve only got it on one side from the right the russians will just figure youre an ordinary miserable noaccount private wunderbar willi said at least baatz hadnt added instead of an ordinary miserable noaccount obergefreiter he was probably thinking it though the same way willi was having unexpected kind thoughts about the ivans no matter what he thought about them they didnt love the wehrmacht several batteries of s opened up on the german positions southwest of smolensk willi and corporal baatz both dove for a foxhole it was big enough to hold the two of them though willi would have bet baatz was no happier about being cheektocheek with him than he was smelling awful arnos stale sweat if a shell came down on top of them theyd both head for the pearly gates at the same instant willi looked forward to passing through while demons with pointy pitchforks dragged the unteroffizier down to a warmer place he would cherish the look on baatzs face damned if he wouldnt that was an unchristian thought he knew as much knowing and caring were two different beasts somebody a couple of hundred meters away shrieked for an aid man that sobered willi no he didnt want a round to come down on them after all not when he had no guarantee of dying instantly hed seen too many slow anguishfilled ways of passing to want to experiment baatzs cheesepale face said he wasnt thrilled about what was going on either damn russians have too many guns baatz yelled through the din too right they do willi agreed with great feeling and then things got worse he hadnt dreamt they could something screamed down out of the sky trailing a tail of fire no not one something but dozens of them spread through a square kilometer or so all screaming the way willid imagined arno baatzs damned soul doing and then over no more than a few seconds they all slammed into the ground and they all exploded gott im himmel willi shouted as loud as he could he hadnt a prayer of hearing himself awful arnos lips were moving too but willi couldnt hear him either he had trouble breathing and tasted blood when he coughed to try to clear his ears he suspected he was luckyif he was luckythe blast hadnt finished him altogether he looked around the russian rocketshe supposed they couldnt be anything elsehad left the ground a smoking moonscape bodies and pieces of bodies lay scattered at random across it and the german soldiers who survived were panicking like a bunch of dutchmen suddenly up against panzers mouths wide open to let out cries of terror willi couldnt hear landsers raced toward the rear some still carried their rifles or machine guns others had thrown them away so they could run fasteror else just forgotten all about them here and there officers and feldwebels tried to stem the tide they had as much luck as king canute willi might not have heard those frightened yells but even his battered ears caught the rising screams in the air to the northeast oh no not again he wailed and curled up in a ball like a pillbug the second rocket salvo caught too many panicked germans out in the open between shattering blasts and scything shards a man standing up without shelter didnt have a chance side by side with willi arno baatz also tried to squeeze himself into as small a space as he could willi could read his lips as he howled make it stop jesus make it stop jesus unfortunately wasnt in charge of that the soviet high command was the rockets didnt come again but a wave of red army foot soldiers surged out of their trenches and swarmed toward the battered german line willi supposed they were yelling urra they always did when they charged he sure as hell couldnt hear them though if they got close enough they would kill him no matter how blaststunned he was he could see that his fine new snipers mauser found its way to his shoulder without his quite realizing how it got there he could hear the report and the kick helped bring him back to himself an ivan fell over willi swung the rifle a little to the left he potted another russian arno baatz uncoiled and started shooting too so did other landsers here and there the rockets hadnt taken out or terrorized everybody but that khaki russian wave kept coming there werent enough germans left to stop it and wouldnt have been even if the discombobulated ones were still able to fight willi could see that could awful arno or would he get sticky mouthing exaggeratedly willi shouted weve got to get out of here what baatz mouthed back willi repeated himself the corporals eyes showed white all around the iris baatz bit his lip then he nodded they both scrambled out of the foxhole and staggered toward the reartoward a place where god willing things like this didnt happen they werent the only ones either something in willis chest loosened when he saw adam pfaff he first recognized his buddy by his rifles gray paint job pfaff himself was too filthy to put a name to willi guessed he was no cleaner himself pfaff waved a russian bullet cracked past between him and willi they both ducked pfaff said something willi held a cupped hand to his ear to show he couldnt hear pfaff mimed shock horror and disbelief then he turned and fired a couple of shots to slow down the oncoming ivans that struck willi as a brilliant idea he did the same thing himself corporal baatz also sent a round their way arno might be awful but he did have balls then a chattering machine gun really slowed the russians cannon shells burst among them too panzers to the rescueand willi hadnt even realized they were around till they started firing he wondered if his hearing would ever come back or had the rockets scrambled it for good right this minute he didnt care it looked as if he might get out of here pretty much in one piece next to that nothing else mattered ivan kuchkov had never gone to the ukraine before now that he was here he wouldnt have minded getting the devil out the locals talked funny a lot of them were antisoviet and hardly bothered to hide it they seemed to be waiting for the nazis to run the red army out of their neighborhood as far as kuchkov was concerned they could all go for once he and the politruk were on the same side show traitors no mercy lieutenant vasiliev said furiously think what theyll do to you if they get half a chance and dont give it to them the men listening to the political officer nodded by their wide eyes some seemed not to have had any such notions on their own were they really so wet behind the ears kuchkov feared they were milkfed too damn many of them if you didnt learn to watch out for yourself you could bet somebody would jump on you with both feet too in hobnailed boots and vasiliev added one thing you dont need to worry about the victory of the glorious soviet union over the debased and degenerate jackals who nibble at her is certain certain i tell you was it as far as kuchkov was concerned the only certain thing was that sooner or later somebody would screw you or sooner and later more likely and if victory was so bloody certain why had his division been shipped south to try to slow down the nazis here and how come all the fighting these days was on soviet soil shouldnt things be moving the other way questions the politruk added one of the reasons he asked was to see what kind of questions he got and from whom kuchkov kept his right arm down by his side what kind of idiot were you if you gave them extra rope to hang you with they could build a case against you out of nothing if they wanted to it was a million times worse if they really had something the germans would kill you but so would the people you were supposed to be fighting for that had to be why so many ukrainians were ready to raise a hand in the nazi salute ivan kuchkov grunted to himself well at least now it made sense he knew he still had to plug the worthless bastards without hesitation if he thought they had anything to do with the feldgrau boys there were romanians in the neighborhood too but he didnt worry about them the poles farther north hadnt had as much fancy equipment as the germans but they meant it when they fought you and that counted for more marshal antonescus swarthy soldiers nah the only reason they were here was that theyd get it in the neck if they tried to bail out you did have to be careful not to mistake them for your own guys because they wore khaki too but their uniforms had a different cut and they used funny helmets easy to recognize since they were so long fore and aft the germans were the trouble though and the ukrainians and his own superiors fuck it he thought nobodys done for me yet he and half a platoon of soldiers cautiously entered a village the next day not long after sunup the peasants stared at them with expressionless faces ivan didnt quite point his submachine gun at a guy with a cloth cap and a big bushy white mustache how you doing grandpa he said seen any fritzes around here grandpa came back with a paragraph of ukrainian for all the good it did kuchkov it might as well have been portuguese he glanced at his own men to see if any of them made sense of it some russian dialects were closer than his to the crap they spoke down here a private said i think he says there havent been any around that was what ivan thought the old geezerd said too but he hadnt been even close to sure he noddedunpleasantly search the houses boys we find any nazi propaganda shit well clean out this whole whore of a place he rather looked forward to it one of the ukrainian women screeched like a cat after a door got slammed on its tail grandpa put his head together with some of the other old farts only a couple of young men here maybe the rest were in the red army or maybe theyd run off to join the hitlerite swine you never could tell all at once though grandpa spoke russian an ordinary human being could understand pavel here he says maybe the germans are that way not too far he pointed west then toward one of his drinking buddies pavel looked as if he didnt need to be singled out too bad cocksucker kuchkov thought how do you know the sergeant growled pavel looked blank that failed to impress kuchkov how do you know cuntface you better sing out cause youll be fucking sorry if you dont pavel did in the fields yesterday afternoon i saw dust from their tanks and trucks had to be theirs none of yours in that direction yours should have been ours ivan could have nailed him for that he would have too but he had bigger worries just dust he snapped no soldiers nyet pavel said no soldiers ivan considered if there had been fritzes in eyeball range then chances were his halfplatoon would have had to clear them out of this pissy hole in the groundor would have walked into an ambush one so chances were the local wasnt bullshitting not right this minute anyhow all right kuchkov turned back to his men georgi you and avram go half a kilometer out that way see what the fuck you find go on get your sad asses moving if you see fritzes georgi you come back and tell us otherwise both of you hang on there avram sent him a wounded look ivan pretended not to notice avram was a hebe you could count on him to fight the germans and he made a damn good point man not least because he was so jumpy if anybody could stay out there and not draw the enemys notice he was the guy georgi was pretty good in the field but not as good as the jew if the nazis were coming up avram was the man to keep an eye on them off they went both glum and well they might have been because a mauser barked almost as soon as they left the village one of themivan didnt see whichfell the other dove for cover well fight em in here kuchkov declared house to house if we have to misha go back and tell the captain we need help doublemotherfucking quick scram the ukrainians started screeching again they didnt want their village smashed up well how often in this lousy old world did you get what you wanted he wanted to have a mortar team here for instance wouldnt that make the fritzes howl he dashed into a tavern at the west end of the village as soon as he did he grabbed a bottle this was a hell of a lot better than the red armys daily hundred grams he swigged and whistled the vodka was better than the gasolinetasting stuff the army issued too he peered out through a knothole sure as hell the germans were coming up life sucked sometimes he sucked too at the vodka bottle best thing in the world except maybe a pretty girls tit smooth fire ran down his throat he grabbed another bottle just in case in case of what the nazis had a panzer ii with them maybe he could turn the virgin bottle into a molotov cocktail or maybe hed go ahead and drink the son of a bitch the panzer ii sprayed the village with machinegun bullets kuchkov had hoped the fritz commanding it would be dumb enough to drive inside but no such luck one of his men fired at the tank from another house the round clanged off steel but so what the enemy tanks cannon fired several rounds into that house no more rifle fire came from it maybe the soldier had learned his lesson maybe he wouldnt need to learn any more lessons from now on but you couldnt not shoot not with the german foot soldiers advancing theyd sure as hell shoot you kuchkov stuck the muzzle of his ppd out through the knothole and gave them a burst then he threw himself flat on the rammedearth floor sure as shit machinegun bullets stitched through the woodwork half a meter above his head vodka bottles shattered noisily fucking waste ivan mourned then he heard a noise like an accident in a machine shopa bad accident he put an eye up to one of the brand new holes in the wall the panzer ii was blazing as if it had just gone to hell the fritzes on foot had stopped and were staring in the same horrified dismay hed felt a moment earlier machinegun bullets stitched through them from right to left they all went down some dead or wounded others just sensibly hitting the dirt sometimes your officers actually knew what they were doing sometimes you got lucky instead a pair of brand new ts stopped the german advance on the village the nazis couldnt do anything against the latest soviet tanks a panzer ii was nothing but a snack for their mm guns the fritzes who could legged it back to the west at top speed and ivan kuchkov drank from his liberated vodka bottles till the newly ventilated tavern spun dizzily around him the nazi official at the munster rathaus couldnt have looked more disgusted if hed found rotten stinking fish on his supper plate and been compelled to eat it sarah goldman didnt care if anything she enjoyed seeing that look on his face she wasnt rash enough to show what she was thinking of course beside her stood isidor bruck his features also stayed carefully blank behind him stood his parents as sarahs mother and father stood behind her despite everything the reich s bureaucracy could do to make things difficult for them sarah and isidor had finally finished all their paperwork theyd won the states very grudging permission to marry moses isidor bruck and sarah sarah goldmanthe penpusher with the swastika armband used the first names the nazis had forced all jews to adopt sarahs renaming with her own name never failed to make her giggle at least insideyou have conformed with the requirements the reich and the national socialist german workers party place on marriages for persons of the hebrew religion you have also paid all the necessary fees to complete the process sarah somehow felt her father stir behind her she could tell what he was thinking it wasnt on account of the fees which were fat the professor in him wanted to correct the nazi flunky for calling the religion hebrew for a heartbeat she feared he would he didnt odds were no jew in the reich would have been so rash but she knew he wanted to scowling the official went on this being so the reich recognizes and permits the marriage he glanced sarahs way you are now sarah sarah bruck your identity card and records will be altered to reflect the new situation she made herself nod she made herself hold her face straight while she did it beside her isidor nodded too he even smiled a little that was more than she had in her she waited for the man in the armband to congratulate them she should have known better he seemed surprised to discover the halfdozen jews were still standing there in front of him with a brusque impatient nod he said that is all you may go it wasnt quite now drop dead but it might as well have been they left in a hurry before the fellow changed his mind isidor pulled something out of his pocketa thin gold band he put it on the index finger of her right hand the place where jewish women traditionally wore wedding rings she took it off and put it on the fourth finger of her left hand both her mother and isidors kept their rings there too they wanted to fit in with the german majority that wasnt so easy when you wore a yellow star that screamed jew at the world i love you isidor said i love you sarah wondered if she really did this wasnt a fairy tale where you got married and lived happily ever after but it was a world where you had to grab whatever happiness you could if you didnt you knew youd never see it again she added lets go home from now on home would be the flat over the brucks bakery her folks had made the mistake of asking for permission to put that door through between her room and sauls abandoned one new construction for jews impossible the arrangement wouldnt be ideal but nothing in munster was ideal for jews there should have been a reception with music and dancing there should have been more food than a regiment could eat and more liquor than a division could drink there should have been all kinds of things there was a loaf of bread from the bakery and a couple of stewed rabbits samuel goldman had unofficially and expensively obtained from one of the other men in his labor gang the way things had gone for jews in germany the past couple of years that would do for a feast and there was schnapps somehow there was always schnapps no matter how bad things got it wasnt the best schnapps perhapsit wasnt the best schnapps certainlybut it was schnapps sarah drank enough to let her know shed been drinking she evidently drank enough to let other people know shed been drinking too isidors father said you dont want to get too shikker you know he laughed in a peculiar almost goatish way to sarahs surprise and to her mortification her own fathers laugh sounded identical her mother and isidors sniffed at their husbands but then they laughed too sarah stuck her nose in the air that only made the older people laugh harder isidor put his arm around her as if defending his new bride their parents laughed some more it wasnt as if the older goldmans and brucks werent drinking with her and isidor she couldnt remember the last time shed seen her fathers cheeks turn pink his hard work and bad diet usually left him sallow pink he was though and the meat he cut from the rabbits made him looked remarkably content sarah understood that she had trouble remembering the last time her own belly had felt so happy well puffing on a pipe charged with the same kind of nasty tobacco her own father smoked david bruck stretched the word out he gathered his wife and sarahs father and mother by eye what do you say we go downstairs for a while maybe take a little walk hey now why would we want to do that samuel goldman said for all the world as if he couldnt think of any reason everybody except sarah laughed again she was sure her cheeks werent just pinkthey had to be on fire all the older people left isidor stared as the door closed behind them this is the first time ive ever seen my mother go out after we eat without washing dishes first he said she looked at him do you want to think about your mother now she asked then she blushed again had that really come out of her mouth as a matter of fact it had and the way isidor looked at her left her with no doubts his mother wasnt the first thing on his mind she thought she would blush one more time but the warmth spreading through her started lower down come on isidor said when they got to the doorway to his room he picked her up and carried her over the threshold she squeaked he silenced that by kissing her as he put her down then he shut the door behind them even though they were alone in the flat the door had a hook and eye to keep it from being opened from the outside isidor fastened that too he looked on what hed done and found it good in very short order he and sarah were officially man and wife youre squashing me she said sorry isidor didnt sound sorry he couldnt have sounded much happier if hed tried sarah was pretty happy toomaybe not quite so happy as shed imagined she would be on her wedding day but her imagination hadnt taken into account the way things were for jews in germany these days after apologizing isidor rolled off her that also made her happy he didnt roll far he couldnt not without falling off the narrow bed they would have to get a bigger one somewhere somehow sometime his hand roamed her she let it happen pretty soon she started enjoying it and the other things he did before long they were making things official again sweat beaded on sarahs skin she was doing a warm thing it was a warm summers day and the room was above the ovens after a while she said again in surprise again isidor answered proudly what if they come back what if they do the doors shut they wont come barging in and even if they break down the door or something youre my wife right we dont have to sneak any more he sounded like a boy with a new toy too much like that sarah wasnt sure she liked the new toy too but three times things wouldnt go well if she said no on her wedding day she turned toward him and kissed him instead that seemed to be the right thing to do at least for the moment and three times it was even if the third round wasnt so easy as the first two had been if he tried for four she was going to tell him no enough was enough and she was getting sore he didnt he fell asleep instead quite suddenly and quite deeply sarah was miffedtill she fell asleep herself even though she hadnt expected to when she woke up she and isidor were entangled almost as intimately as they had been before noises outside the closed door said isidors parentsand she recognized a moment later hers as wellwere back what do i do next she wondered for now nothing seemed a good answer her new husbandher new husband was still snoring but her life had just changed forever much too soon shed find out how chapter something was wrong peggy druce knew that she also knew she was afraid she knew what it was the complicated insideout reasoning should have made her laugh instead it left her more afraid than ever most of the time she would have taken the bull by the horns she had a low tolerance for bull generally as even the nazis came to understand without that low tolerance she knew she would still be stuck in europe but going nose to nose with somebody you couldnt stand was one thing going nose to nose with the man you loved more than anyone else in the world was something else again boy was it ever most of the time herb also spoke freely at least when he was talking with her he might be might be hell he was more circumspect than she was in public but she always got to find out what was on his mind or she had till she got back from england of course if this went wrong it would blow up in her face she knew that too did she ever and what was liable to happen if it did what was liable to happen if it did was plenty to make her keep her big trap shut for months not talking about something though could prove as toxic as talking about it obviously was that silent poison might be sloweracting which didnt mean it wasnt there and so one thursday evening after dinner and a couple of highballs peggy said herb i think we need to talk her husband neatly folded his copy of the daily news the evening paper so he and peggy wouldnt have to depend on the radio or wait for tomorrow mornings inquirer to keep up with what was going on stubbed out his cigarette in the pocket of a bronze ashtray shaped like a baseball glove and said whats cookin even though peggy was sitting down her knees wanted to knock all the same she said i think you know about us herb made a small production out of firing up another pall mall he held out the pack to her she got up took one let him light it for her and retreated to her chair he dragged deeply then blew a long stream of smoke toward the ceiling he looked up at the smooth plaster as if watching for enemy bombers but all there was to see was the smoke disappearing little by little his sigh might have come straight from camille damn he said without heat who told you who told me what peggy echoed foolishly i figured you were bound to hear sooner or later i thought you must have already otherwise you wouldnt have said we need to talk like that herb sounded resigned and a bit mad at himself or maybe you would who the who knows but people do gossip and what do people gossip about peggy chose to rephrase that why would people gossip about you listening to herself she thought she sounded resigned too she didnt think she sounded mad at herb which was good he sighed again even more deeply he knocked ash into the bronze glove and set the cigarette down then staring down at the comfortably shabby persian rug under his slippers he said you know you were away from home a lot longer than we thought you would be when you headed for europe i sure was she agreed what about it he kept looking at the rug which wasnt like him even then i told myself id tell you if you ever asked me dammit i messed around with one of the girls from the typing pool for a month or so it didnt mean anything and im sorry i did it but it happened youre sorry now peggy said what about then then he looked uphe seemed to make himself look upwith a familiar crooked smile on his face then i got so sick of playing with myself i mightve ended up in bed with somebody a lot homelier than gladys peggy knew she couldnt have picked gladys out of a police lineup of clerktypists assuming there was such a thing that was probably just as well she also knew herb had just handed her the moral advantage if she wanted to hang on to it she could but she realized that was another kind of slowacting poison the idea was to air things out on both sides wasnt it that seemed to be their only chance of getting back to where they had been and so she let out a sigh of her own well she said and then bogged down this was even harder than shed expected herb was a man dammit how would he take what she was about to come out with she hadnt got up on her high horse but that didnt necessarily mean he wouldnt if he did shed deal with it as best she could that was all well she repeated and then made herself go on well its not like you were the only one there it was out nowwould the sky fall herbs eyes widened he started to say something then shook his head and visibly swallowed it as she had he tried again a moment later he managed one word you fraid so hon peggy didnt want to look at him now ill be whatever herb would be he didnt want to finish it peggy didnt suppose she could blame him howd that happen he asked after a long long pause it was after the opera in berlin i got smashed i thought the guy who took me was a fairy but he turned out not to be not all the time anyway peggy still felt like a jerk about constantine jenkins which did her no good whatsoever only the once herb asked yeah peggy said and left it right there it was true she would gladly have told him shed swear on a stack of bibles but she knew her man that would have left him more inclined to doubt her not less how about that he said more to himself than to her he looked at his cigarette most of it had burned away while they were talking so had most of peggys herb put his out she did the same he started to take another one then stuck the pack back in his pocket instead he gathered himself i guess youve got the edge on me cause i did it more than once not a whole lot more than once but i did dammit you dont sound exactly proud of it peggy said nope herb eyed her neither do you i was snockered peggy said and i was dumb i dont want to mess around its more trouble than its worth amen herb said as if responding to a sermon from father divine he might have had the same thought for he added you can sing that in church peggy said maybe now we can quit looking at each other out of the corners of our eyes the way we have been thatd be good herb lit another pall mall after all peggy made a small pleading noise so he gave her one too he went on i wondered if youd noticed we were doing it uhhuh peggy nodded this felt like going to the dentist any minute now the novocaine would wear off and how much would things hurt then it ought to get better now that its out in the sun and air her husband said as long as it stayed covered up it was going to go bad and there isnt much worse than gas gangrene such glancing references were as close as herb came to talking about things hed seen over there the only thing peggy knew about gas gangrene was that it sounded horrible no she knew something else she didnt want to think about it not right this minute she had something else in mind we ought to celebrate getting it out in the open she declared celebrate huh herb gave her another crooked smile she nodded back the smile straightenedsome the wench grows bold he said damn right peggy answered up the stairs they went peggy didnt know if it was a celebration but it was pretty good better than it had been while they both kept secrets she thought so she hoped so she also hoped it would keep getting better again that was the point to all this wasnt it she also wondered if she could find some way to do gladys a quiet bad turn whoever the roundheeled little chippy was and there was one more thought herb didnt need to know anything about alistair walsh wanted to fight the germans that was the point of putting on the uniform again wasnt it the only trouble was heand the rest of the british armyhad no convenient place to do so land in the low countries or france and theyd get slaughtered land in france they couldnt england and france werent at war with each otherand a good thing too as far as walsh was concerned even raf planes avoided french airspace when they flew off to bomb hitlers towns would french fighters really rise to try to help the luftwaffe shoot down english bombers if they did rise how hard would the french pilots fight nobody seemed to want to find out or to have the nerve by god your excellency i wish churchill were still alive walsh told ronald cartland in the pub near parliament hed make the froggies show whether they meant it or not nothing halfhearted about winston the mp agreed draining his whiskey and waving to the barmaid for a reload he was catnip to the female of the species no two ways about it walsh knew she wouldnt have come over half so fast for him he drank whiskey or brandy or anything else he could find on the continent when he could get a pint of decent bitter he liked that better sooner or later parliament would start working again the provisional government kept promising elections soon and also kept pushing back the day people were starting to grumble walsh worried lest creeping chamberlainism reassert itself when the votes were finally cast if that happened then what another coup detat he wouldnt have been a bit surprised cartland asked did you catch mussos speech on the shortwave last night afraid i didnt walsh admitted wouldnt have done me much good if i had either when i go to one of those restaurants with the redandwhite checked tablecloths i can tell the dago with the pencil behind his ear i want a plate of spaghetti and meatballs my italian starts and stops right there ah cartland said politely i should have thought of that cant say i ever studied it myself not in any formal way but i speak french and i did endless latin so i can muddle along after a fashion ill bet you can walsh thought without either rancor or envy the mp would have picked up his education at some posh public school and then at cambridge or oxford walsh often thought hed got his own such as it was at a jumble sale considering how easily he might have spent his whole life grubbing coal out of a seam he hadnt done too badly for himself and so what did the bugger with the big chin say then called us traitors to the cause of europe if you can imagine the cheek as any aristocrat might have cartland seemed more affronted than anything else he said that since hitler was busy giving stalin whatfor and didnt have time for puppies like us puppies walsh broke in musso has the gall to call us puppies he wanted to laugh and to haul off and punch somebody both at once he would have felt that way if a waiter in one of those checkedtablecloth eateries had called him the same thing too he did indeed the mp replied sipping from his fresh drink he said hed have to go on and let us have a proper hiding himself since adolf was busy and then you wake up alistair walsh exclaimed the fritzes now theyre proper soldiers say what you will about the bleeding fuhrer but the italians it came out of his mouth as eyetalians which only made his pique plainer quite cartland spoke with the same frozen disgust a society matron might have used in carrying a dead rat from the drawing room by the tail in his minds eye walsh studied a map the clearer the mental picture got the more it enraged him hes mad as a balloon he is the welshman said with the air of a judge sentencing a bungling burglar barking mad how does he propose hiding us when we hardly even touch he could cause trouble for egypt from libya i suppose and for malta from sicily he might even use abyssinia and italian somaliland to go after british somalilandassuming hes balmy enough to want british somaliland i should say ronald cartland plainly had been eyeing mental maps longer than walsh and spreading them wider walsh had never been stationed in british somaliland he knew several regulars who had though from everything hed heard cartland was spoton chances were not even the somalis wanted to drive their sheep and camels through land so miserablenot that italian somaliland was any improvement he wasted no more time worrying about the horn of africa even if mussolinis legions there carried all before them all they would have was the goddamn horn of africa egypt on the other hand wouldnt be so good if the bloody italianshe pronounced it the same way he had beforeparaded through alexandria or took the canal away no it wouldnt if cartlands laconic agreement wasnt british understatement at its best walsh didnt know what would be the veteran noncommissioned officer did some more considering ronald cartland was better suited to the general staff than he would be himself if he lived to be a hundred which didnt mean he couldnt cope at need his calculations were quick and he thought accurate mussod need more than luck to bring it off hed need a miracle or as near as makes no difference ive heard that before from others cartland said i like it better from you i respect your judgment thank you very much sir walsh suspected pleasure was making his ears turn pink he was happierprouder anyhowthan he would have been had the pretty young barmaid whispered a suggestion that they go find a room together he didnt despise animal pleasurefar from it but the opinion of a man he admired was a weightier business altogether for what for telling the truth cartland waved his gratitude away as unnecessary for thinking it is the truth walsh wasnt about to let the aristo get away with that he was going to be grateful dammit and that was all there was to that have it your way sergeant now the mp spoke in a way walsh understood completely like a junior officer addressing a senior noncom officers had rank and class on their side sergeants had experience and the knowledge that came with it more often than not that left the advantage with them senior officers knew what their juniors often didnt sergeants were more important to the army than subalterns if i had my way sir id go to egypt right now thats the kind of thing mussolini would try and id love to be there to help give him what he deserves walsh said is that truly what you want if it is i daresay i can arrange it walsh felt like whooping and turning handsprings all he did was give back a small dignified nod he didnt even smile not where ronald cartland could see him do it but what was the point to having wellconnected friends if you didnt make the most of it once in a while egypt cartland said in musing tones have you been there before i spent a yearwell not quitein cairo in the twenties walsh remembered the amazing heat and the crowding and the smells which made your nose sit up and take notice even after youd been on a battlefield not much like good old blighty but we need to hang on to it even so that we do lord knows how wed manage without the suez canal cartland said my sister and i visited once ill never forget the pyramids that was in the twenties too well before the depression perhaps we were there at the same time yes sir perhaps we were long odds walsh thought but so what keeping your officers happy and interested in you was yet another skill sergeants needed to cultivate and getting back into action would be good even if he was only going up against the dagos theo hossbach still had trouble getting used to the radiomans position in a panzer iii for two and a half years hed stayed hidden away from the war the radio set in a panzer ii lent itself to that now all of a sudden he could see out he not only could he had to along with the radio he had an mg to take care of how many ivans had he done for by now hed lost track in a way that embarrassed him when your occupation was something as serious as killing people shouldnt you remember how many you were responsible for but to do that properly he should have started counting as soon as the original panzer ii rolled across the frontier separating germany and czechoslovakia hed been part of a killing team since october after all the score from the obsolescent machines little cannon and machine gun went partly to his creditor to his blame depending on how you looked at things the only trouble was any kind of count along those lines was impossible because he hadnt been able to see out he didnt even know where to begin he couldnt very well ask ludwig rothe or fritz bittenfeld either they were both dead as was heinz naumann adi stoss might be able to give him an approximate score for the second panzer ii and for this newer larger machine theo didnt plan to ask him about it if they ever did talk seriously they had other things to hash out first besides might be able to wasnt the same as could theo didnt knowhed never askedwhether adi was running his own tab and the way things worked these days keeping track of how many russians you slaughtered wasnt the only game in town or the most important one making sure the russians didnt slaughter you had become much more urgent their light tanks were nothing german panzers couldnt handle even in a thinly armored panzer ii theo hadnt worried about them much but the kv was a whole different kettle of cabbage yes it was clumsy and slow but it was about the size of a whale a panzer iii the wehrmacht s main battle machine could hurt it only by luck or from behind had the ivans had more of the damned things or used them with greater skill the kvs could have been even worse news than they were anyhow as for the t it was hot inside the panzer iii but thinking about the reds newest and finest panzer made theo shiver all the same it had all the kvs virtuesa powerful engine thick armor and a big gunand so far as he could see none of the other beasts vices ts werent slow and clumsy anything but in fact and whoeverd come up with their armor scheme deserved the biggest gaudiest medal stalin could pin on him german engineers had never considered armor shape except perhaps insofar as the simplest shapes were also the easiest to manufacture if you needed more protection in a particular place you made your steel plates thicker there but all those plates were pretty much vertical czech french and english designers worked from the same basic principles it wasnt as if there were any other way to go about things except there was relying on the russians inborn simplicity and fondness for the bruteforce approach didnt always pay some soviet designer had had a better ideaa much better idea as a matter of fact if you sloped your panzers armor at say a fortyfive degree angle a lot of shells that would have penetrated vertical plate ricocheted away instead and even the ones that did dig into the armor had to go through more of it to do damage for shots coming in from most directions sloped plate was effectively thicker than the same amount of vertical armor would have been once you saw the stuff in actiononce you watched your best shots bounce off a t without hurting the metal monsterthe idea seemed obvious everything seemed obvious after you banged into it nosefirst but if it was so goddamn obvious how come no german engineer in a clean white lab coat had twiddled with his slide rule till he came up with it first the russians were untermenschen werent they hitler and goebbels loudly insisted they were if they were untermenschen though and the swastikafollowing aryans were ubermenschen why did the red army have better panzers if the ivans just had more panzers which they also did that wouldnt have been so corrosive to nazi ideology the ussr was a hell of a big country having seen more of it than hed ever wanted to theo knew that right down to his toes and he also knew the tand to a lesser degree the kv as wellmade every german panzer look like a model from the year before last he said as much to adi the panzer iiis layout put them side by side at the front of the hull not only that theo trusted adi further than he trusted well just about anybody else you couldnt count on people to keep quiet if security forces started hurting them short of that theo was sure adi would never betray him he was pretty sure sergeant witt wouldnt either but only pretty sure the new guys who fattened up the crew he hadnt made up his mind about them yet it wasnt as if there was any hurry adi nodded theyre mighty good all right not perfect but mighty good not perfect close enough theo was stung into volubility or as close to it as he came the gun the armor der herr gott im himmel the armor the diesel engine so they dont burn the way our beasts do ja ja adi sounded like a man indulging a little boy that infuriated theo till the driver went on the commanders up in the turret all by himself though the way hermann was with the panzer ii hes got to shoot the cannon fire the machine gun and command the panzer and hes got more panzer to command than hermann did with the ii oh theo thought that over he didnt need long with a sheepish shrug he admitted youre right stoss shot him a sour look how am i supposed to have a proper argument with you when you go and say things like that sorry theo answered but im not going to lie too bad we could probably keep wasting time till sundown if you did adi said now weve got to find ourselves something else to talk about instead irony glinted in his dark eyes he could come out with something like that confident theo wouldnt take him seriously plenty of soldiers would have they didnt need to look for a new topic for very long off to the left at the edge of an apple orchard a russian machine gun snarled to malignant life the watercooled russian gun was much heavier and clumsier than a modern aircooled mg it didnt shoot as fast either once in position though it made a more than adequate murder mill panzer halt hermann witts voice traveled the speaking tube from the turret to the front of the hull halting adi answered as he hit the brakes witt traversed the turretsmoothly and quickly with the hydraulics in case of battle damage he could also use a hand wheel and gearing to crank it around it was too big and heavy for him to wrestle it into place with handles as he could have in a panzer ii the cannon spoke twice after a moment though the russian machine gun spat more defiant death at the germans back in the turret sergeant witt swore theo would have too he presumed the panzer commander knew what he was aiming at and had hit it if the machinegun crew was still in business it was operating out of a concrete emplacement witt snapped armorpiercing the cannon fired twice more this time witt grunted in satisfaction got the fuckers he said some poor sorry shithead lugging a flamethrower wont have to try to fry them before they puncture him instead forward adi forward the driver echoed putting the panzer iii back in gear in a low voicetoo low for witt or either of the new guys in the turret to hearhe went on who knows what all else is lurking in the trees our foot soldiers will find out oh wont they just that same thought had occurred to theo he wouldnt have said it out loud not even quietly to a friend he trusted there lay one of the big differences between him and adi stoss they had others of course but the fact that adi would speak his mind seemed the most important it did to theo anyhow to hansulrich rudel the woods southwest of smolensk looked like well woods they were less manicured than a carefully maintained german forest would have been the ivans had so much land they had forests coming out of their ears they had everything coming out of their ears from iron and coal to wood to people that was the only possible reason they were giving the reich so much trouble from meters overhead hansulrich wouldnt have been able to tell that the panzers in front of the woods belonged to the wehrmacht if some of them hadnt draped themselves in swastika flags as an identification symbol even seeing the banner that united party and reich didnt leave him a hundred percent sure the reds sometimes captured those flags and used them as shields against the luftwaffe hansulrich chuckled there alone in the cockpit a swastika flag might keep german planes from bombing soviet panzers but how many of the enemy panzer outfits that used it had suffered attacks from the red air force that kind of crap happened too often even to germans whod carefully briefed their air support about the ruse of war they were using given the russians slipshod procedures they were bound to go through it even more these are the right woods arent they rudel asked through the speaking tube he wanted to make certain he didnt do anything idiotic sergeant dieselhorsts quick you bet sir went a long way toward reassuring him dieselhorst might not respect the fuhrer as much as he should but he was the kind of man who went to extraordinary lengths to keep from endangering anybody on his own side sure enough he went on the river curls behind the trees and then goes into them just like it does on the map for a change the map and the landscape match up great were where we ought to be all right good if i put the bombs in amongst the trees then theyll come down on top of the russians hansulrich said using stukas for a job ordinary bombers might have done wasnt efficient a blind man could see that but if no ordinary bombers could be spared bombs from stukas were better than nothingas long as they landed where they were supposed to he yanked hard on the bombrelease lever the explosives under the jus wings and attached to the fuselages midline fell away he watched the bombs tumble down toward the treetopsbut only for a moment because sergeant dieselhorsts rearfacing machine gun suddenly gave forth with a long burst a rata a fucking rata dieselhorst yelled the names marshal sanjurjos soldiers and their german allies had hung on russian fighters in the spanish civil war stuck even if the germans were facing them thousands of kilometers from spain these days biplane polikarpovs were chatos the shape of the cowling for their radial engines made the nickname fit later polikarpov monoplanes also had flat noses but the spaniards and legion kondor flyers called them ratas ratsto distinguish them from the biplane fighters they were no match for a bf when you flew a ju though that seemed much less comforting bullets slammed into the stuka from behind the rata flashed past and swung into a tight turn obviously intending to make another pass this time from dead ahead no matter how grossly inferior to a the polikarpov fighter was it could outrun and outmaneuver a divebomber as if the junkers plane were nailed in place in the sky rudel did everything he could he fired bursts from his twin forwardfacing mm machine guns he tried to turn away from the ugly little monoplane with the big red stars on its greenpainted fuselage the rata looked as if it were homemade possibly by someone who didnt know much about airplanes but hansulrich might have been trying to fly a rooster against a hawk a bullet scarred the stukas windscreen if that hadnt been made of thick armor glass the round would have scarred rudel too or more likely left him too dead to heal and scar more rounds hit the armored engine compartment and the wing even if the engine was armored the instrument panel screamed that the ju was losing fuel at a hideous rate and overheating even faster some of those rounds got home despite the protection the engine coughed farted ran smoothly for a few seconds and then coughed again smoke started pouring out of it you there sir sergeant dieselhorst sounded worried and with good reason too im here hansulrich answered i was hoping you were we going to have to bail out well hansulrich didnt want to say yes german parachutes left a lot to be desired even if merely having a parachute would have made a pilot from the last war jealous the idea of coming down nearor maybe amongthe ivans didnt thrill him either but the engine coughed one more time then crapped out altogether a stuka glided better than a brick but not a whole lot better sometimes the outside world answered questions for you yeah albert weve got to bail out dieselhorst tried to make light of it not like weve never done this before right right rudels voice sounded hollow even to him theyd been shot down once before over france had the poilus caught them they probably would have been taken prisoner no guarantees with the ivans none at all but if they didnt get out now they were guaranteed dead pilot and rear gunner had separate sliding cockpit canopies maybe that wasnt such a terrific design feature if one of them got stuck they didnt not this time and neither hansulrich nor dieselhorst mashed himself to strawberry jam by hitting the tail as he scrambled free of his enclosure nothing left to do but fall yank the ripcord and hope later rudel realized he should have done some praying while all that was going on he consoled himself by remembering he was just a trifle busy at the time whump when the chute filled with air it felt as if a mule kicked him right in the chops his vision grayed out for a moment then color and motion came back to the world he floated downward off to his left sergeant dieselhorst waved to him from under another silk canopy hansulrich waved back he yanked on the lines to spill wind from one side of the canopy and steer himself away from the redinfested woods he also anxiously looked around for that rata russian fighter pilots had the charming habit of machinegunning helpless parachuting german flyers it wasnt sporting but they didnt care to his relief the rata was nowhere in sight russian soldiers on the ground did fire at him and dieselhorst a bullet thumped through the taut silk above him if the hole turned into a tear hed regret that all the way down but not afterwards he didnt worry about a bullet thumping through him till hed almost reached the ground he wondered why the devil not stupidity came to mind as the ground rushed up below him he had to worry about his landing hed sprained an ankleonly luck he hadnt broken itthe last time he came down in a chute he didnt want to be out of action for weeks now he bent at the knees and at the waist as training suggested another russian bullet cracked past him too close for comfort training never talked about distractions like that thud he made it not a pretty landing but the moving parts all seemed to work he cut himself free of the parachute then grabbed for his lugersoldiers were loping toward him but his hand fell back they wore feldgrau and helmets of a familiar shape nowdid they realize he was a countryman good job one of them yelled waving hansulrich grinned and waved backthey did he looked around albert dieselhorst was free of his chute and on his feet too theyd be flying again as soon as they got a new bus chapter stas mouradians latest airstrip lay not far in front of smolensk the germans and their allies kept coming forward despite everything the red army and air force could do to stop them if smolensk fell stas wasnt a member of stavka the soviet general staff but he could see how bad that would be smolensk was the great bastion on the road to moscow if moscow fell the game would be up he could see that too maybe stalin would find refuge somewhere beyond the urals having traveled the width of the ussr stas knew how vast the country was but could you keep fighting with your capital gone would anyone follow your orders if you tried but that was a worry for another day probably a worry for another year the red flag with the gold hammer and sickle still flew over smolensk the swastika was still hundreds of kilometers from moscow that stas could wonder what would happen if the capital fell said things werent going the way soviet authorities wished they would it wasnt that serious yet maybe it wouldnt get that serious but if stalin hadnt been greedy if he hadnt decided he could take wilno away from poland on the cheap the war between the ussr and the reich might well have stayed a war in name only till smiglyridz asked hitler for help the soviets and the nazis couldnt get at each other without violating some buffer states neutrality that would have been more dangerous than it was worth would it have been more dangerous than thinking that stalins greed had led him into an enormous mistake now there was an interesting question for any soviet citizen to contemplate as long as you kept your mouth shut you had a chance of staying safe from the nkvd anyhow the luftwaffe was a different story but mouradian had heardas who in the soviet union had not of people arrested for no better reason than an expression some chekist didnt fancy those people went into a camp as readily as the ones brave or crazy enough to criticize the regime out loud they came out of the camps as readily too which is to say just about never the distant rumble of artillery distracted stas from such gloomy reflections he cocked his head to one side listening those were russian guns that was good noit was better he would really have had something to worry about if he heard german guns from here but the squadron had been flying out of this airstrip for only about a week when the pes got here you couldnt hear anybodys guns stas had been used to fields farther forward hed been used to if not happy about the sound of guns once or twice hed had to fly off a runway enemy artillery was suddenly able to reach being out of earshot of the front had felt relaxing now he wasnt any more he wasnt so relaxed either at the edge of the airstrips a technician wearing earphones manned a sound detector that looked like nothing so much as half a dozen enormous hearing trumpets they could pick up approaching enemy planes at distances greater than the naked eye could reach they could some of the time at any rate when everything went just right when other noise didnt distract or confuse the technicians there has to be a better way stas thought if he knew what that way was theyd pin a hero of the soviet union medal on him in a flash at a guess it had something to do with radio everything modern and scientific seemed to his guesses stopped right there he was a pretty good pilot but hed never make an electrical engineer the technician jerked off the earphones and ran to a bell mounted on a nearby post he rang the bell as if his life depended on it and his life was liable to for he shouted theyre coming theyre coming a kicked anthill would have shown more chaos but not a lot more people ran every which way antiaircraft gunners manned their cannons and pointed them west the technician was pointing in that direction but stas couldnt tell whether the gunners followed his lead or simply knew german planes were most likely to appear from that direction pilots and groundcrew men jumped into zigzagging trenches to shelter from the expected attack some of them had rifles if they fired at the luftwaffe planes it might make them feel better it was unlikely to do anything else stas realized he was the only man just standing there he wasnt running he wasnt jumping he wasnt training an antiaircraft gun in the desired direction or chambering a round in his mosinnagant now he could hear the ominous drone of german airplane engines without the fancy sound detector their note was different from that of soviet powerplants it seemed deeper and somehow imbued with sinister purpose maybe that was stas imagination on the other hand he knew he was far from the only soviet fighting man who imagined the same thing what the hell are you doing there you stupid fucking idiot growing roots like a beet a groundcrew sergeant shouted you dont get your cock in gear theyll plant you all right where the rising drone from those bombers hadnt unfrozen stas the sergeants profanity did that might have been because it was aimed at him personally unlike the bomb loads that would come whistling down any second now he sprinted toward the closest trench he hadnt even got there before the antiaircraft guns started pounding away for all they were worth he jumped in somebody down below caught him and steadied him thanks he said without noticing who any time lieutenant colonel tomashevsky didnt even sound sarcastic squadron commanders caught on the ground in a bombing raid needed to run for their life like anybody else when they jumped into a trench they had to hope somebody would grab them and keep them from falling on their face it was of course simply an application of the golden rule no matter how much scorn a good marxistleninist would heap on the book from which that rule came during the last war someone had claimed there were no atheists in the trenches stas didnt know if he would have gone that far he did know he had to make a conscious effort to keep from crossing himself when the luftwaffe bombers came overhead you didnt dare reveal too much his hand twitched but that was all it did even when the bombs started bursting on and around the strip lord have mercy christ have mercy a man in mechanics coveralls was too scared to worry about what he gave away he crossed himself again and again as if possessed he was only a corporal maybe he thought he was too small a fish for the nkvd to care about if so he was an optimist or maybe he believed none of the other frightened men in the trench with him would betray him to the nkvd well he had a chance of being right about that how good a chance stas wasnt willing to risk it something not far enough away blew up the ammunition store for one of our gunsmaybe for a battery lieutenant colonel tomashevsky said mouradian nodded that was what it had sounded like to him too something else was on his mind where are our fighter planes comrade colonel he didnt think they could possibly be where tomashevsky suggested for one thing hed always supposed the devil was male but wherever they were they werent here and that was a crying shame of all the german bombers only the ju had anything close to the soviet pes performance the dos and hes overhead would have been easy meat for even biplane polikarpov fighters let alone their monoplane cousins or the hotter faster new migs would have been some of the saddest words in russian or any other language at last after doing what theyd come to do the germans went away soviet fire had brought down one of them the shattering roar when its whole bomb load blew as it hit the ground almost shook stas fillings loose but when he stuck his head up to look around he grimaced for all the destruction the nazis had worked they hadnt paid much of a price most of the buildings around the airstrip were either gone or burning the strip itself was cratered like photos of the moon and four columns of greasy black smoke marked red air force bombers funeral pyres stas hoped none of them was his without revetments it would have been worse even with them it was plenty bad enough and stas had no idea if any bombs had come down in the trenches where men huddled he also had no idea where the squadron would fly its next mission from he was sure of only one thing it wouldnt be from here not for a while little by little narvik improved as a uboat base as far as torpedoes and diesel fuel and repair facilities went there had never been anything wrong with it you couldnt take on as much fresh food there as you could at a base in germany or even farther south in norway that made the ratings grumbleit made julius lemp grumble toobut it wasnt the end of the world but a uboat base a proper uboat base didnt just tend to the boats it also took care of the men who sailed them when sailors came back from a long uncomfortable cruise where like as not their lives had been in deadly danger they wanted to blow off steam they needed to blow off steam they wanted good booze and bad women bad booze would do in a pinch but good women were right out in germany and the low countries of course there were brothels in towns full of sailors people in those towns might not have been proud of that but they understood it was part of the way things worked norway was different the locals didnt even approve of drinking like america the country went through a spasm of prohibition after the last war though norway gave up on it in as for friendly fornication or even fornication for hire narvik wasnt a big city like the ports farther south you couldnt be a whore here without all of your neighbors knowing and most of them disapproving narvik was probably a nice place for kids to grow up assuming they didnt freeze to death or go berserk during a long winter night but the town had never heard of privacy drinking at clubs supported by the kriegsmarine took the edge off the one problem the authorities didnt seem to know what to do about the other ill tell you what to do by god lemp said to the base commandant after the u came back from its latest cruise in the arctic ocean bring in enough girls from germany to keep the crews happy the commandant was a commander named robert eichenlaub he outranked lemp but the uboat skipper was irked enough not to care and being sure theyd never promote him again because of his earlier foulups gave him an odd advantage he was free to speak his mind unless he got himself chucked in the brig they couldnt do anything to him worse than what they were already doing commander eichenlaub looked pained its not so easy as you make it sound lieutenant he bore down on lemps rank trying to put him in his place lemp was in no mood to let him get away with that why not commander he bore down on the commandants rank just as hard you can get volunteers in kiel or wilhelmshaven and ship them up or you can just grab some theyre only prostitutes for heavens sake by the way he talked about them they might have been gaskets or valves or anything else you requisitioned from the quartermaster that was how he thought of them too it wouldnt work we dont even have female secretaries hereand if we did they wouldnt want to associate with the working girls eichenlaub said neither would the norwegians ill bet some of them would lemp retorted shrewdlyand lewdly no doubtbut that doesnt help us either commander eichenlaub said so youre worried about keeping the whores comfortable and happy then lemp said they may be whores lieutenant but theyre also human beings eichenlaub answered how about worrying about keeping my men comfortable and happy then lemp snarled they may be uboat sailors commander but theyre also human beings too im pretty sure about most of them anyway they glared at each other maybe commander eichenlaub wasnt sure why lemp seemed immune to disapproval from on high but he could see that the junior officer was he didnt like it either i know the uboat service takes wild men lemp but you go over the line he said his voice starchy with distaste why because im trying to make my men think this is a place they might want to come back to not dachau with polar bears lemp said that will be quite enough lieutenant lemp a note on this conversation will go into your file the commandant snapped lemp left but he left laughing which was bound to delight eichenlaub all the more the us diesels were getting an overhaul that the base at narvik could handle lemp went out to the docks to see how things were going he found that another uboat had come in while he was having his useless discussion with commander eichenlaub hed known the skipper a shortand shorttemperedfellow named hansdieter kessler for a long time here we are happy day kessler said this place is a goddamn morgue its an icebox even in the summertimeit sticks us on a shelf and freezes us out of the fun what fun lemp asked good point kessler agreed they ought to do something about it either that or they ought to give us enough leave so we can go down to some place where they remember how to have a good time julius lemp smiled a slow conspiratorial smile why dont you go tell the commandant exactly what you think hansdieter kessler cocked his head to one side and studied his fellow skipper what you think i fucking wont you think i dont have the balls no i think you will and i know damn well youve got the balls lemp answered truthfully and i think commander eichenlaub needs to know im not the only guy who figures his men get a raw deal every time they have to put in here he may not want to listen to you once you get going aha kessler pounced so you just reamed him out did you who me lemp said kessler laughed he headed off toward eichenlaubs office with purposeful strides of course he had more of a career to lose than lemp did hed never been so careless as to sink an american liner by mistake the powers that be might still visit higher rank upon him lemp climbed the iron ladder to the top of the us conning tower then descended into the submarines hull theyd had all the hatches open for days airing the boat out theyd cleaned in there as they never could at sea and she still stank the reeks of diesel fuel and puke and sour piss and unwashed men and stale food were in her paint or more likely in her steel he liked the mechanics working on her engines they reminded him of his own ratings they were utterly indifferent to spit and polish foulmouthed and damn good at what they did an enormous brawl broke out that night in one of the taverns the kriegsmarine maintained for a while it was touch and go whether the shore patrolmen would be able to put it down one of them had to fire a shot in the air to make the drunken riotous sailors pay attention to him and his comrades not a few men from the u distinguished themselvesif that was the wordin the action commander eichenlaub wasted no time summoning lemp back to his office do you know how much damage your your hooligansyour barbarianshave done the commandant snarled not to the pfennig sir lemp answered i do knowexpecting the summons hed made a point of ascertainingthey werent the only uboats crew in the scuffle are you calling in the other skippers too scuffle sweet jesus christ it was about three centimeters this side of an insurrection and never mind the other skippers im talking to you but eichenlaub suddenly didnt sound so selfrighteous lemp knew hed made a shrewd guess yes sir he said his voice mild as boiled milk eichenlaub told him he was a bad boy and that he commanded a pack of savages lemp nodded not without pride the commandant fretted and fumed till he got it out of his system lemp knew it wouldnt come to anything in the end he saluted and left as far as he was concerned the unhappy sailors had made his point for him better than he could have done himself its a boy chaim weinberg passed out cigarsharsh twisted coalblack cheroots which were what he could getto the abe lincolns in the trenches northwest of madrid the news had just come up from the city he swigged from a flask of brandy too and offered it to his buddies along with the stogies what are you gonna name the little bastard mike carroll asked hes no bastard we did it by the numbers la martellita and me chaim said if you didnt do it by the numbers you wouldntve knocked her up mike said and i dont care if you and her did tie the knot any kid of yours is bound to be a bastard right ahh your mother chaim growled and started on down the trench he would have tried to murder a lot of guys who said anything like that but he and mike had been in spain together a hell of a long time if anybodyd earned the right to razz him carroll was the guy hey wait a second he called after chaim what are you gonna name him carlos federico weinberg chaim answered isnt that the goddamnedest handle you ever heard his mother wanted to name him for marx and engels and how could i tell her no wouldnt be easy mike agreed unspoken in the air between them floated the thought that youd probably get purged if you tried to tell a party functionary she couldnt name her son for communisms founding fathers carroll did ask what would you have called it if it was a girl carla federica chaim spread his hands as if to say what can you do when la martellita made up her mind it was by god made up nothing this side of the end of the world would make her change itand maybe not that either well mazel tov mike said where did he pick up the yiddish probably from chaim he found one more question before his buddy went away how come you dont look happier man oh im happy i just didnt tell my face about it as if to prove as much chaim took a big gulp from the flask then he got out of there in a hurry before mike could ask him anything else he didnt want to answer la martellita hadnt married him because she loved him no matter how drunk he got he knew better than that shed married him so her kid would have a namea curiously catholic notion in a staunch red but there you were and here chaim was carlos federico weinberg had his name all right which meant what chaim knew too goddamn well what it meant it meant la martellita didnt need him for anything at all any more divorce had been next to impossible in prerepublican spain in the parts of the country marshal sanjurjo ruled it still was in the republic it was easy as pie so chaim figured the next piece of news he got from madrid would be that la martellita was dropping him like a live grenade if she hadnt got so drunk she needed him to get her back to her flat if she hadnt been so drunk she didnt say no when things went on from there ah cmon you shlemiel you knew this wasnt gonna have a hollywood ending even while you were shtupping her chaim nodded yeah hed known all right he just hadnt given a rats ass and he couldnt think of any man who would have when he poised himself between her open legs either so this is what you bought dumbfuck he nodded again and answered his scolding self yeah yeah yeah but now im doing the paying goddammit well off to the left an enormous report rang out chaim nodded again this time in mere recognition that was the crazy czech who went sniping with his antitank rifle he was a pretty good guy which didnt mean he wasnt meshuggeh you had to be nuts to lug that huge heavy hunk of almostartillery across half of europe all the same chaim hoped hed hit whatever he was aiming at he also hoped the fascist on the receiving end was at least a major the bastard must have been and that czech must have blown his reactionary head off too the nationalists didnt get their knickers in such a twist when a sniper exterminated one of their ordinary assholes machine guns sprayed sudden death toward the republican positions a moment later sanjurjos big guns started shelling the republican trenches the fascists wanted payback and they wanted it bad chaim didnt want to be part of the payback he dove into a scrape someone had dug in the forward wall of the trench it wasnt a proper bombproof but it was better than nothing if a came down right on top of it chaim made himself not think about that getting buried alive wasnt the way he wanted to cash in his chips if the nationalists followed up the shelling with an infantry attack he was in more trouble than he knew what to do with he didnt have his rifle with him he had the brandy and cigars instead would one of sanjurjos men take a cigar in exchange for not bayoneting him they didnt make deals like that sad to say but the nationalists would have taken casualties in an infantry attack they didnt want that they wanted to dish them out so they could avenge whichever officer the czech had potted with his honking big rifle they got what they wanted too wounded abe lincolns screamed and moaned some were americans some the spaniards who filled out the ranks of all the international brigades these days all wounded men sounded pretty much the same regardless of country or politics in a rational world something like that would convince people all men were brothers they wouldnt try to kill one another any more but who ever said the world was rational and even being brothers might not make men like each other any better look what cain did to abel after all chaim shook his head the bible was just another book of myths and superstitions there never were any such people as cain and abel he had no trouble believing that with the top part of his mind the part with roots down to the core of him the part that wasnt marxistleninist had other ideas if la martellita heard about this bombardment would she hope a shell killed him then she wouldnt have to go through the paperwork of divorcing him she could get on with her life as the widow of a heroic soldier she could milk it for all it was worth after a moment chaim shook his head his ladylove was no hypocrite if she wanted him dead shed come right out and tell him so she might do him in herself no she just wanted to be rid of him he hated that and he hated the certain knowledge that he couldnt do anything about it even more almost everybody went through life wishing he could get what he most wanted from the moment chaim set eyes on la martellita she was what he most wanted hed got her too even if she was so smashed the first time he did that she hardly knew he was doing it and hed made the all too common discovery that getting exactly what you wanted could hurt even worse than mooning after it forever as long as you kept on mooning after it you always thought it was perfect once you got it you were much too likely to discover what a jerk you were for wanting it to begin with beautiful women were there to be wanted of course to men they often seemed to be there for no other reason but how many of the men who actually got one stayed happy afterwards not many unless chaim missed his guess he knew too well he wasnt what were you supposed to do turn into a queer even if you could wouldnt you get into the same kind of stew about gorgeous guys besides he wasnt a queer he liked women he liked the beautiful kind better than the homely ones too he didnt know anybody who didnt you couldnt win you didnt have a chance the czech with the antitank rifle fired again some fascist shithead probably discovered he didnt have a chance whether he laid beautiful women or homely ones hed be laid out now hasta la vista fucker chaim thought no barrage followed maybe this time the sniper just blew out a corporals insides if ever a movement prided itself on class consciousness it was sanjurjos but for all the wrong reasons or maybe the czech missed stranger things had happened damn right chaim thought ive got me a kid named carlos federico he swigged from the brandy flask again in russia the sky seemed wider than it did anywhere else willi dernen had ever seen that might have been because the countryside seemedand waswider too but willi wasnt so sure about it he wasnt sure about anything any more hed been here too long and done too much and victory still looked as far away as whatever lay under the far end of that vast russian sky he had other reasons for keeping an eye on the clouds drifting across the wide sky too adam pfaff noticed him doing it as they tramped along a dirt roadonce you got out of the cities russia had no other kind whats up pfaff asked you cant do anything about the weather my ass i cant willi said i can worry about it and i damn well do itll start pouring rain pretty soon and all these shitty roadsll turn to glue then we freeze our nuts off for the next six months some fun huh well sure what would you rather be doing pfaff said drinking and fucking what else is there willi sounded honestly surprised his friend considered well theres pfaff shook his head he thought some more or theres another rejection this time with a thumbsdown nah more thought still he grinned ruefully youre right thats about all there is thats worth doing ohmaybe filling up on mutton stew too there you go willi said but we get to do this crap instead arent we lucky were lucky if we come through alive answered the man with the gray mauser dernen arno baatz shouted are you lowering pfaffs morale not a bit of it corporal willi said hes lowering mine beside him on the dusty road pfaff giggled softly awful arno didnt think youre funny dont you well you listen to me just because nobodys made a charge stick on you yet doesnt mean nobody will you mark my words willi was about to tell baatz where to put his wordssidewayswhen the section point man came trotting back toward the main body of men johann stallinger made a good point he was short and skinny and anxious he nodded ahead in the direction from which hed just come somethings in those fields he said the way the grain was moving its not from the wind are you on the rag again stallinger awful arno asked if you dont like the job i do corporal you can put somebody else up there the point man answered whatever else he might have thought his pale pinched face didnt show it you could watch baatz working through it you could and willi did arno did want to go forward if youre having vapors he growled but he knew stallinger might not be johann was point man for a reason if the fields were full of russians the section was asking to get bushwhacked baatzs pudgy features cleared as he made up his mind braun yes corporal gustav brauns face said he wished he were a thousand kilometers away from here you got that big drum on your machine pistol let stallinger take you up to the fields hes having spasms about and you shoot the whole thing off if that doesnt flush the ivans nothing will on account of there wont be any there baatz said willi blinked the order actually made good sense he wouldnt have thought awful arno had it in him braun carried a russian ppd submachine gun instead of a schmeisser the russian piece came with a drum that held seventyone rounds it took mm cartridges instead of mm but the germans had captured plenty the big magazine made it heavy to cart around every once in a while though you needed the extra firepower this looked to be one of those times even braun could see as much right corporal was all he said if he didnt sound thrilled well willi wouldnt have been thrilled with an order like that either no matter how much sense it made stallinger did have a schmeisser a point man often found himself in positions where he needed to spray around a lot of lead in a hurry he also seemed less than delighted about going back to where hed sensed trouble but hey there was a war on you did all kinds of things you werent delighted about the rest of the landsers spread out into a loose skirmish line nobody told them to no one needed to tell them they knew what was what willi knew he had a round in the chamber he knew it but he made sure anyway he noted the best place to dive for cover and also the next best place stallinger and braun went forward if the russians had a machine gun in amongst the barley if they had a machine gun in there hell was out to lunch because they could mow down the rest of the section too braun knew his business he didnt just squeeze off one long burst as he fired the muzzle would have pulled up and to the right and he would have shot over what he was trying to flush out he fired two three four rounds at a time willi didnt know exactly when he hit something the ivans might have been disciplined enough to keep quiet when they got shot but one fellow couldnt help making the grain around him sway in unmistakable fashion as he toppled over tiny in the distance stallinger waved urgently awful arno waved back get away that meant but giving the order was easier than following it the russians figured out that they werent going to be able to take the whole section unawares they grabbed what they could get and opened up on stallinger and braun both men went down maybe they werent dead but willi didnt like the odds he was already trotting forward before awful arno told him to so were the rest of the landsers you didnt let the russians take your buddies alive not if you could help it you didnt even want them grabbing german corpses they mutilated them for the fun of it and to intimidate live germans who came upon their handiwork bullets reached out toward the advancing men in feldgrau one cracked past willi viciously close he had to make himself keep moving by main force of will his body animal thing that it was wanted to throw itself flat or else to run the barley still concealed the ivans but not perfectly not as he got closer to them he spotted khaki through green going gold when he raised his mauser to his shoulder the russian showed plainly through the telescopic sight he fired he got a splitsecond glimpse of most of the mans face contorted with pain then he worked the bolt lowered the rifle and trotted on that enemy soldier wasnt likely to trouble them any more ambush spoiled the rest of the red army men slipped off to the east their rear guard kept firing to make sure the germans didnt chase them too enthusiastically if they wanted to retreat willi was ready to let them awful arno kept yelling for the section to push harder then he yelled again wordlessly this time he held his rifle in his right fist his left arm hung uselessly blood darkening the fieldgray sleeve im hit he said disbelief filled his voice and why not hed stayed lucky for going on three yearshe must have thought nothing could bite him well that showed how much he knew the landser next to him slapped a wound bandage on his arm go back corporal the fellow said the aid men will patch you up can you manage on your own or shall we send somebody with you send somebody willi wasnt sure he was the senior obergefreiter but he spoke up anyway he cant handle his weapon onehanded if weve bypassed any ivans theyll do for him if hes by himself they took his orders baatz and a protector headed for the rear willi didnt know what hed do without awful arno to goad him on he looked forward to finding out though when the germans got up to the point man and his comrade they found braun dead but stallinger still very much alive though down with a leg wound more men hauled him off to the rear they buried braun in a shallow grave and set his helmet on it they might have marked the grave with a bayoneted mauser too the ppd was too valuable another landser grabbed it and brought it along chapter the farther south and east into the ukraine the germans and romanians drove the red army the more familiar things became for ivan kuchkov more of the people spoke russian for instance it was ukrainianaccented russian with guttural hs replacing proper gs but he could more or less make sense of it real ukrainian hovered right at the edge of comprehensibility for him which pissed him off people farther south and east here didnt seem so ready to prick up their ears and whinny at the sound of a crappy german oompah band either they remembered they were soviet citizens maybe the nkvd had left them too scared to forget kuchkov wasnt inclined to be picky as long as they didnt give the hitlerite swine a helping hand he didnt care why he wished more ts would come into the fight the fritzes shit their drawers every time they see one of those fuckers he said as his section cooked this and that around a fire built from the planks of a blownup barn the pussiesd all run for home if we had enough his men nodded for one thing he was obviously right for another arguing with him was a losing proposition he backed up his words with fists knees teeth a knife he carried in his boot and anything else that might come in handy even the politruk had quit agitating that he should join the party in the middle of a war a political officer could meet an untimely end just like anybody else and chances were the authorities would be too busy with bigger stuff to ask a whole lot of questions off to the north a soviet machine gun fired a couple of short bursts no german machine gun answered so maybe the guy at the trigger was shooting at shadows or maybe hed scragged a nazi kuchkov hoped so all of his men had cocked their heads in the direction of the gunfire when it petered out they nodded or smiled and went back to whatever theyd been doing so did he that wasnt trouble it wasnt trouble for his section anyhow which was the only kind of trouble he worried about the smart fuckers with the fancy rank badges on their uniforms cared about how the whole front was going this tiny piece of it was plenty for him one of the soldiers turned coarse tobacco from a pouch and a strip of old newspaper into a cigarette he lit it with the tip of a burning twig after blowing out a long gray smoke stream he said maybe well get to stay here awhile watch your dumb cunt of a mouth vanya kuchkov said without heat huh vanya wasnt the brightest star in the sky but even he got it after a couple of seconds oh sorry comrade sergeant sorry s all right for me theres plenty of pricks whod stick sorry right up your sorry ass though kuchkov growled more to make the soldier remember than because he was really angry officers went on and on about squashing defeatism wherever it stuck up its ugly head the nkvd squashed people it imagined to be defeatists usually for good if somebody here ratted on poor slow vanya kuchkov didnt know there was an informer in his section but he would have been surprised if there werent unlike the poor jerk with the rollyourown he understood instinctively how the system worked he had his own reasons for hoping the red army could hold the line in these parts even if he wasnt dumb enough to come out with them there was a village maybe a kilometer and a half behind this campfire and his eye had fallen on one of the girls there a cute little blonde named nina shed smiled back at him too damned if she hadnt some women liked handsome kuchkov didnt have a prayer with them he knew it he didnt like it but what can a guy do about his own mug some women though some women liked strong and with those broads he had a fighting chance he wasnt pretty and he wasnt smart but he could break any two ordinary jerks over his knee like skinny sticks a smile the right kind of smile was all it took if he could get nina alone especially if he had some vodka along he knew damn well hed be able to slide his hand under her skirt the war was won as soon as you did that but if the germans drove the red army back before he got the chance some nazi son of a bitch with broad shoulders would end up balling her instead that would be a waste nothing else but kuchkov tore off his own strip of pravda or maybe it was izvestia or red star the army paper since he couldnt read he didnt care he wiped his ass with newsprint and he rolled smokes with it let me have some of that makhorka vanya he said sure comrade sergeant the soldier passed him the pouch vanya might be dim but he was as eager to please as a dog with deft fingers kuchkov formed a cigarette he lit it the same way the other man had he had food he had smoke in his lungs he might get laid before too long the germans seemed pretty quiet life could have been worse since the germans stayed quiet through the night at sunrise the next morning he made up an excuse to go back to the village no one asked him any questions an ugly mug and a strong hairy back made other people mind their own business he knew what they called him when that back was turned when he overheard it he broke some heads that worked let them mock as long as they feared he reached the place just as the peasants were going out to their chores waving he called nina come here he didnt go come here you bitch for him it was the height of suavity she waved back which made his hopesamong other thingsrise what do you need sergeant you but that would be for later he pointed to a nearby stand of brushy woods hed noticedthe best privacy you could find around here lets talk about you whipping up a big tub of stew for my guys hey where do i get the stuff to put in it she asked the obvious answer was from your village that would leave the people there hungry but he just said well we can talk about that he hopped over a bush and walked into the woods nina followed he offered her his water bottle here have a knock of this first sweetie calling it a knock warned her her eyes didnt cross when she swigged red army vodka calling her sweetie probably warned her too but she was smiling when she handed back the water bottle you should drink some fucking right i should he titled his head back fire slid down his throat and exploded in his stomach like a he held out the vodka have some more sure best way to start the day nina was a russian all right almost the best way kuchkov grabbed her she squealed and she giggled and she made a token try at pushing him away but then they were rolling on the ground together and kissing when he did reach under her skirt she laughed again and then she purred who ended up on top was a matter of luck she undid his fly sucked him for a minute to make him even harder than he was already and impaled herself on him his hands clutched her meaty backside while they thrashed she had plenty to hold on to she threw her head back and mewled a moment later he grunted as joy shot through him a moment after that before he could decide whether to slide out or start again german shells started landing on the russian line and reaching back toward the village that made up his mind and in a hurry he threw nina off him even his rude chivalry forgotten she let out an indignant squawk he didnt care he scrambled to his feet shoving his cock back into his pants and doing up the buttons then he took off on the dead run back toward his section fun was fun but killing the fucking fascists really mattered he ignored the shell bursts if one got him it got him none did he wasnt as fast as an olympic track man getting back but an olympic track man didnt run in boots and carry a submachine gun he reached his men before the barrage stopped and the ground attack came in hold on to your dicks boys he called when the artillery let up ninad sure had hold of his well slaughter the clappedout cunts they didnt the germans were veterans and didnt assume the shelling would make their advance easy they came cautiously by small groups firing and moving where they met strong defensive fire they held up and started digging themselves foxholes they werent going to let their officers get them killed if they could help it if they hadnt been nazis they would have been sensible men for a wonder russian tanks showed up before the germans brought up any armor the fritzes retreated sullenly maybe i can fuck nina again tomorrow kuchkov thought you never knew till you tried pete mcgill passed fiveinch shells as fast as he could the japs had more divebombers than carter had little liver pills sweat poured down his bare back hed be sunburned like nobodys business if he lived but that was the least of his worries hed got way too hot and sticky to stay in his shirt most of the guys at the gun wore nothing but a helmet above the waist you needed a helmet you needed one bad what went up eventually came down and lots and lots was going up fragments rained down all over the pacific youd feel like a jerk if one of them smashed your unprotected skullbut not for long worse luck for you the fiveincher bellowed again pete heard it as if from very far away if he had any ears at all left by the time this got done hed count his blessings a shell casing clanged on the deck somebody kicked it out of the way to keep from tripping over it it didnt roll far too much other brass had already been kicked pete grabbed the next round and passed it to the loader into the breech it went the gun lowered a little to bear on the divebomber blam the cycle began anew the jap plane didnt give a damn about the boise it was swooping down on a heavy cruiser shells burst all around it black smoke puffs soiling the clean moist pacific air the pilot ignored everything but his target he released the bomb and zoomed away bare yards above the ocean a shell clipped his wing then his plane broke up as it went into the drink fire floating on the sea was the only grave marker hed ever get too late came the hit the bomb burst right alongside the american ship it wasnt a killing blow but blast and fragments would do their worst and their worst was no damn good the boise had taken blows like that and suffered from them yet one fucker wont be back joe orsatti shouted everybody at the fiveinch mount yelled as loud as he could it was the only way the marines had a prayer of making themselves heard even as things were pete might not have understood if he hadnt read the gun chiefs lips how many more have they got he yelled back orsatti didnt answer by the nature of things he couldnt know neither could pete but that was the question all the guys with the fat gold stripes on their sleeves whod made up the american attack plan seemed to have missed something the japs had turned their midpacific islands into unsinkable aircraft carriers they had sinkable carriers too the americans had sunk one but no american carriers remained afloat and the us fleet had yet to see any japanese naval craft at gun range no that wasnt quite true one jap sub incautiously surfaced near a battleship whose big guns happened to be trained its way a few seconds later nothing was left of that sub but paper clips no twilightofthegods superjutland here no matter what the plannersand pete mcgillhad figured this fight would look like no joe louismax schmeling instead the japs were making like some superfast lightweight hank armstrong on benzedrine maybe they jabbed and jabbed and jabbed and when you tried to hit back they werent there and they wore you down one punch at a time pete had guessed the big freeforall would happen somewhere near the philippines and it might have if the us fleet had been able to get that far but even guam still lay far to the west and reaching guam would be no cureall the stars and stripes didnt fly there any more how many japanese planes would come up from all their islands and attack the remains of the american force how long before theyd be more than all the antiaircraft guns aboard the surviving ships could hope to knock down if the admirals went on being stubborn that day might come soon if it did pete probably wouldnt even get a brief patch of fire on the pacific to mark where hed gone down an oil slick would be about it he didnt want to die not yet he didnt have nearly enough revenge for vera four red rings circled his fiveinch guns barrel each one signifying a plane orsatti was sure theyd killed the rings and the rest of the paint on the barrel were blistered and scorched from the heat of all the shells that had gone through it took a hell of a lot of firing to knock a plane out of the sky way more than anybodyd figured before the war got rolling the boise s engines picked up pete felt the new vibration through the soles of his shoes the light cruiser swung into a long turn carving a white wake into blue water when the turn ended she was heading east now hear this blared from the loudspeakers at the orders of the fleets commanding officer we are withdrawing toward hawaii i say againat the orders of the co the fleet is withdrawing from these waters so it wasnt just the boise it was everybody everybody who was left anyway pete wasnt even sure of the current cos name admiral kimmel went down with the arizona when she sank probably figuring that was easier than having to explain failure back home well if the new guy was throwing up his hands and hightailing it back toward pearl his name was also likely to be mud whoever the hell he was the secretary of the navy and the president would blame him for not blowing the japs out of the water after all if another admiral fell onor was pushed ontohis sword less blame would stick to his superiors then again if the americans kept pushing forward no matter what it wouldnt be long before they had nothing left to push with going into this war everybodyd wondered how sea power stacked up against air power now that the returns were in they didnt look encouraging for the poor bastards in ships it had been a running fight between airplanes all the way west across the pacific now that the us navy was out of carriers the fleet went on taking it on the chin no matter how much antiaircraft fire the ships threw up pete nervously scanned the sky just because the fleet was on the lam that didnt mean the japs would leave it alone kick em while theyre down was good advice in bar brawls and in war if the other guy didnt think hed almost licked you he wouldnt jump on you again any time soon now the us navy was trying to get up off the floor and brush away the sawdust and the spilled beer some of the other ships were still firingmaybe at japanese planes maybe at nothing around the boise it was quiet for the moment pete suddenly realized how very stiff and sore and weary he was fuck he said orsatti must have read his lips because he didnt say it very loud the gun chief nodded he looked like hell unshaven bags under his eyes his face thin and drawn pete probably looked the same way but he hadnt seen himself any time lately hed been living on coffee and sandwiches and snatching sleep curled up on the deck next to the gun like a dog since he couldnt work out since when it had been a while now he knew that one of the other guys pulled a crumpled pack of luckies from his dungarees and gave everybody a cigarette pete took his gratefully the nicotine seemed to help a little with the haze of fatigue that dogged him fuck he said again this time the rest of the crew nodded in mournful agreement didnt never figure wed get licked orsatti said speaking slowly and loudly not by the japs pete could have said i told you so hed known the emperors finest were tougher than most americans wanted to believe he kept quiet sometimes being right cost more than it was worth but then he did say fuck one more time after another drag on the luckysome luck he amplified it whats gonna happen to the poor sorry assholes stuck on the islands we took away from the slanties maybe well make pickup while we go orsatti said but he didnt sound as if his heart was in the words pete could see why if the fleet was doing its goddamnedest to get away from the japs would it want to stop for anything that was asking to get worked over again but to leave leathernecks behind to try to hold off hirohitos bastards with whatever they happened to have that was the worst kind of losing proposition sweet jesus was it ever or was it really wasnt getting killed trying to take them off and then leaving them stuck for the japs anyway worse still an admiral was bound to think so the admiral in charge of the fleet did think so pete was a marine for two cents change he would have torn the goddamn admirals head off and pissed in the hole married when sarah goldman no she was sarah bruck now she had to keep reminding herself she was sarah bruck had thought about being married before she actually was she hadnt thought much about what came after she went through the ceremony oh shed thought about some of it but you couldnt do that all the time even when you were newlyweds and very young she hadnt thought about what her life would be like after the wedding she had expected she would eat better and she did the brucks were bakers after all even if they were jews even if the nazis watched them three times as hard as the aryan bakers in munster they found ways of making flour silently vanish from the official allocation some they baked into stuff they ate themselves they traded the rest with other people who dealt in food nobodynobody below the rank of generalmajor anyhowate well in the third reich but the brucks did very well for jews and better than some aryans sarah hadnt expected she would work so much harder isidor might have got himself a wife his mother and father had got themselves a brandnew employee they didnt have to pay they made the most of it she knew next to nothing about baking when she started sharing isidors little room they set about giving her a crash course to be fair they started her on simple things as if she were a child she could tell time obviously they could trust her to open the ovens and take out the loaves after half an hour they could also smear ointment on her hands when she burned herself doing itit wasnt as if theyd never got burned they could let her mix the various flours that went into war bread no none of them is sawdust david bruck assured her amusement in his voice was there any in the last war she asked people always say there was there were things nobody talked about the government issued them to us and we used them it was use them or not bake anything isidors father no longer sounded or looked amused that was a very hard time this isnt sarahs flourcovered hand reached for but didnt touch the sixpointed yellow star on her blouse david bruck wore a star too he considered we were hungrier then but we were happier too people werent banging on the tea kettle at us all the time because we were jews sarah smiled her mother would use that homely phrase for raising a ruckus every now and then her father always looked pained when mother did it wasnt the kind of thing herr doktor professor goldman was used to hearing his expression said herr doktor professor goldman was doing all kinds of things these days that he hadnt been used to and so was sarah besides the burns unfamiliar work made her arms and shoulders ache her feet hurt because she was on them so much she was tired all the time she sometimes wondered if this was what shed signed up for it would have been worse if she hadnt seen that all the brucks isidor included drove themselves harder than they drove her that made her feel silly about complaining but she slept as if someone hit her over the head with a boulder as soon as she lay down when she slept as the hours of darkness got longer raf bombers started showing up over munster more often there werent many of them and they didnt drop a lot of bombs but they wrecked the nights when they appeared she and isidor and his parents would go downstairs and huddle under the counters it was no better than hiding under the diningroom table had been at her parents if a bomb knocked the building down on top of you youd get squashed if one blew out a side wall it would blow you up too the aryans in the neighborhood like the aryans in her old neighborhood had proper bomb shelters verboten for jews of course jews took their chances isidor took his chances in the blackout darkness shed never got felt up during an air raid before she wanted to laugh and she wanted to belt him both at the same time she couldnt do either not without giving away what he was up to every couple of weeks she and isidor would walk over and see her folks she enjoyed that more than she wanted to show the brucks talked about bakery business and neighborhood gossip and the music on the radio and that was about it at her own house talk ranged all over the world and across thousands of years shed thought it would be the same for everybodytill she discovered it wasnt coming back to such talk felt wonderful she said so once while isidor was using the toilet her fathers smile twisted a little the brucks are nice people they aredont get me wrong but theyre not very curious so they might not seem very exciting either not very curious she echoed nodding that was it all right that was exactly it the brucks knew what they knew and they didnt worry about anything else socrates talked about people like that in the apology if she tried to tell isidor so he would look at her as if shed suddenly started speaking ancient greek herself it wasnt that knowing all the strange things she knew ever did her much practical good but it gave her things to think about she wouldnt have had otherwise when she was with other people who had the same strange set of mental baggage it also gave her things to talk about that she wouldnt have had otherwise when she was with the brucks a flush from the bathroom said isidor would be coming out she put that one on the back burner was this what marriage was about giving up part of yourself you hadnt even been aware you had in exchange for love she had no doubt that isidor loved her she loved him too it wasnt that he made her abandon that part but he didnt have its match so showing it to him seemed pointless but he had points of his own as he sat down beside her he said i heard this one from an aryan the other day if you can believe it hitler goebbels and goring are on a plane that crashes everybody aboard gets killed who is saved something in the way her fathers mouth twitched told her he already knew the joke but all he said was nu who she was glad because she hadnt heard it and she didnt think her mother had either the german people isidor answered and exploded into laughter if there were microphones in the house they were all in trouble sarah knew as much she laughed anyway so did mother an aryan told you that father asked isidor he was also laughing even as he went on was he an ss man seeing if he could land you in trouble because you thought it was funny no no isidor shook his head not like that it was one old guy talking to another one on the street i heard it walking by ach so samuel goldman relaxed that should be all right then nobody seems happy with the way things are going we continue the advance on the important soviet citadel of smolensk isidor amazed sarah she hadnt dreamt he could imitate a selfimportant newsreader so well he surprised sarahs father too samuel goldman let out a sudden bray of laughter then looked at isidor as if hed never really seen him before maybe he hadnt and maybe now he saw some little piece of what sarah saw in the bakers son walking back to their little room after the visit isidor said i like talking with your mother and father theyre interesting peculiar but fun sarahs voice was dry isidor kicked a pebble down the sidewalk you said that i didnt you sure meant it though sarah thought she cocked her head to one sidea gesture her father might have usedand asked do you think im interesting too this time isidor didnt hesitate for a second darn right i do he was undressing her with his eyes not like that dummkopf she said though the eager stare warmed her like my folks i mean oh to him that seemed less important but he nodded after a moment yeah i guess so you kind of think lefthanded if you know what i mean if sarah hadnt thought that way she wouldnt have as things were she batted her eyes at him and murmured you say the sweetest things if you couldnt always leave them happy sometimes confused worked almost as well the ivan struggled out of his hole blood from a small wound to his ear dripped onto his baggy khaki tunic he left his rifle behind and kept his hands over his head freund he said hopefully kamerad luc harcourts lip curled in scorn you stupid sack of shit im no fucking german he answered in his own language mon dieu cest vrai vousetes francais to lucs amazement the russiancorporal if he was reading the rank badges the right wayspoke a french as near perfect as made no difference the fellow went on the boches were in this sector yesterday and i did not even think to look at your uniform a thousand apologies monsieur ten thousand sure as hell german tanks had passed through here the day before the french infantry was helping to clean up the pocket the armor had carved out if i was a boche odds are youd be dead right now luc said vousavez raison the russian agreed once more i thank you for your mercy luc didnt know how long hed stay merciful prisoners were a pain in the ass but a prisoner who spoke french as if he were educated at the sorbonne might be worth something intelligence sure wouldnt have any trouble interrogating him luc gestured with his rifle well cmon get moving but of course the russian put a hand to the side of his head naturally it came away bloody how badly am i hurt just an ear those always bleed like mad bastards but its only a little wound luc answered with rough sympathy then he said hang on take off your beltnice and slow dont do anything stupid you can hold up your pants with one hand afterwards oui monsieur the ivan obeyed the belt had several grenades on it only after it lay on the ground and the prisoner had straightened up again did luc relaxa few millimeters worth anyhow now get moving he told the guy and the russian did after a few steps he asked how come you speak such good french it is the language of cultureand i am or i was a student of french history yevgeni borisovich novikov at your service the pow made as if to bow but didnt follow through culture right luc thought the socalled student of french history looked like any other captured russian dirty whiskery in a baggy tunic and breeches the splatters of blood from his ear were just accents but for the blood and the cut of his uniform luc didnt look much different himself after a few steps he did ask what was on his mind if youre so educated and everything how come youre only a crappy corporal and not an officer why should he worry about offending a prisoner hed never see again only a corporal novikov barked bitter laughter for me getting promoted was a miracle i come from a kulak family do you know what kulaks are were i should saynot many of us are left alive kulaks are rich farmers right luc hoped he wasnt confusing the russian word with something else altogether but the captured cultured corporal nodded rich enough to have a few cows anyhow richer than the ordinary muzhik richer because they worked harder than the ordinary muzhik and didnt drink as much rich enough that they didnt want to get herded into collective farms and give up more than they got rich enough to get called enemies of the state and go to the wall he grimaced im lucky to be alive let alone a corporal he might have thought that would impress luc and it didbut only up to a point happy day buddy luc said doesnt mean you wouldntve shot me if you got the chance ive been in this shit since tell me about lucky to be alive it could be though that you were allowed to be a human being before the war began novikov replied allowed to be a human being luc chewed on that till he spotted lieutenant demange if anyone ever stood foursquare against the notion of letting people be human beings demange was the man he waved to luc what the hell you got there he called as if luc had brought in some exotic animal instead of an ever so mundane pow russian who speaks french bettern you do lieutenant luc answered sweetly demange said something about lucs mother that he was unlikely to know from personal experience luc grinned hed got under demanges skin which he didnt manage to do every day the lieutenant glowered at yevgeni novikov so what the fuck you got to say for yourself prickface i am glad your sergeant here did not kill me when he could have novikov told him i hope you will not either he knew what could happen to captured soldiers then well who didnt and demange looked comically amazed you con he said to luc the asshole does speak better frenchn me better than you too im not arguing luc said the guys who question him wont have to fuck around with german there were french interrogators who spoke russian but only a very few but lots of frenchmen could get along in german and so could lots of russians conducting an interrogation in french would be a luxury lieutenant demange nodded youre right i bet he speaks better french than the clowns who squeeze him too he chuckled unpleasantly and a whole bunch of good thatll do him go on and take him back harcourt will do luc would have taken novikov back any which way any excuse to move away from the front line where people were liable to shoot at you was a good one now i only have to worry about shells and bombs luc thought with perfectly genuine relief had he tried to imagine that before the war he would have decided he was nuts he had to give novikov up at regimental headquarters a scattered handful of tents any selfrespecting boy scouts would have laughed at they would at least unless a french picket plugged them before they could get close enough to laugh the picket was invisible till he called a challenge hed definitely earned his merit badge in foxhole digging luc didnt know the headquarters password a rigid russian or german might have shot him for that the sentry laughed at him and then passed him through the guy could see and hear he was a frenchman the officers at the hq werent thrilled to see yevgeni novikov one more powjust what we dont need their attitude declared then he opened his mouth they fell on him with glad cries after that especially when they discovered he would sing like a skylark they even gave luc a cup of good burgundynot pinard heaven forbid they were after all officersand a pack of gauloises as the bringer of good news thus fortified he started up to the front again he took his own sweet time getting there if lieutenant demange didnt like it too damn bad but demange wouldnt care not about something like this back when he was a sergeant he would have taken his time returning too anybody would who in blazes wanted to come straight to the killing zone that thought made luc stop again when you were heading to the front any excuse was a good one so it looked to him at any rate but there were a few white crows who were never happier than when they were mixing it up with the nazis or reds or whoever the enemy happened to be most of the time dumb cons like that didnt last long they got too eager and somebody on the other sideprobably some scared fuck who would rather have been in an estaminet somewhere with a barmaid in his laptook them out not many people missed them once they were gone either they tended to get their comrades killed too every once in a while though by all accounts hitler had been that kind of ferocious loner hed spent just about all the last war as a runner at the front and hed come through with hardly a scratch you couldnt begin to figure the odds on that the way it looked to luc god had dropped the ball there he laughed at himself fat lot anybody can do about it now he said and lit one of his new gauloises chapter instead of flying out of an airstrip in front of smolensk stas mouradian was flying out of one east of the city that suggested that the fighting wasnt going the way the politburo and general secretary stalin had in mind of course other such hints had appeared long before this when the war started stas had flown out of an airstrip in slovakia slovakia lay a long way west of where he was flying from now so did poland so did byelorussia hed flown from airstrips in those places too looking at that progression even if you ignored his detour to the far east which also hadnt turned out well you might start to suspect that soviet leadership left something to be desired as a matter of fact stas had started suspecting as much even in slovakia hed also suspected hed better keep quiet about it the enemy could kill you so could your own side defeatism was a capital crime if the nazis shot you down you at least had a chance of getting things over with in a hurry once the chekists started in on you theyd take their time and really make you sorry he wondered how long his squadron would be able to keep flying lately days had been dawning with clouds massing in the northwest and drifting across the sky covering it ever more thickly the fall rasputitsa was coming airstrips roads between towns and everything else would turn to mud he also wondered why red air force engineers hadnt built more paved airfields around here they might have given the soviet union a vital edge in its fight with the fascists and their allies maybe the engineers had had other things to do things they found more important what those things might be stas couldnt imagine even saying there should be paved runways near smolensk or wondering aloud why there werent was one more thing that might make the nkvd notice you stas knew they had a dossier on him well they had a dossier on everybody but the folder with his name on it would be thicker than most every so often he couldnt stop himself from hinting that not all the men who led the union of soviet socialist republics were grand and towering geniuses the squadron took off from its dirt runway and flew north and a little west toward velizh another town threatened by the nazis if the enemy swung around behind velizh the fortress might fall even if it wasnt immediately overrun the germans had shown how good they were at biting off pockets with their armor and then using guns and infantry to chew up the soviet forces still inside lieutenant colonel tomashevsky stayed in the clouds as much as he could he had to be navigating by compass and dead reckoning and perhaps a little unsoviet prayer all the same stas thought he would have flown the same way were he leading the squadron unlike the sb the pe was no clay pigeon for the bf it was about as fast as the german fighter but the messerschmitt could outclimb outdive and outturn it dogfights with s remained a bad bet when tomashevsky ordered the red air force bombers down below the cloud layer down to where they could seeand be seenonce more stas expected them to have to grope around for velizh russia was full of fields and forests hed traveled all the way across it to the far east he knew how enormous it was and how lucky you had to be to find anything on the first try bozhemoi ivan kulkaanen exclaimed as the last rags of mist blew away from the windscreen and the horizon stretched out to kilometers they were right over the town their bomb loads were supposed to defend i couldnt have put it better myself mouradian said was the squadron commander that good a navigator or had he filled an inside straight stas didnt think he could do it again but hed done it once and nothing else mattered for this mission the war was laid out below them as if on a situation map soviet trenches in front of velizh kept the nazis from storming in but the red army had to defend long lines and its strength was spread thin the germans were forming assault columns if one of them broke through the soviet soldiers in the trenches would have to fall back to keep from being bypassed lieutenant colonel tomashevskys staticdistorted voice resounded in stas earphones we will bomb the central fascist column acknowledge bombing the central columnplane eight acknowledging mouradian replied other pilots also showed theyd heard again stas would have made the same choice that german force looked thicker and more muscular than either of the other two how would it look after a good many tonnes of high explosives came down on its head as a matter of fact tomashevsky didnt bomb the head of the column he released his presents several kilometers to the west the other pes followed him in they were supposed to bomb the same place he did but followers never did they didnt want to hang around any longer than they had to the nazis were already throwing up fierce antiaircraft fire because of all that the pe pilots following the squadron commander didnt drop their bombs right where he had they bombed shortand progressively shorter as plane after plane unloaded stas was no more immune than anyone else hed seenand been part ofthe effect on every mission hed flown what hed never seen before was someone taking advantage of it lieutenant colonel tomashevsky understood ahead of time what his flyers would do their bombs fell ever more toward the front of the german column and probably smashed the hell out of it if hed blasted the head of the column himself most of the rest of the squadrons bombs would have landed short some of them might have come down on the poor bastards defending velizh doctrine as stas knew was for the squadron leader to put his bombs exactly where they belonged doctrine decreed that the other pilots would of course place their loads right where he had in the red air force no less than the red army doctrine carried the weight of holy writ what lieutenant colonel tomashevsky had done worked better than doctrine it couldnt have been an accident or an error stas admired the squadron commanders cleverness he thought it was a shame tomashevsky wouldnt be able to spread the improvement to other officers who led squadrons when he submitted his report he would have to say hed conformed to orders in every particular officers who did anything else wound up explaining themselves to the nkvd which no one in his right mind wanted to do back to base tomashevsky ordered again stas acknowledged he was never sorry for permission to get the hell out of there kulkaanen peered down at the german column as mouradian turned the pe toward the neighborhood of smolensk once more he shook his head in pleased surprise boy we walloped the snot out of them didnt we he said we sure did stas agreed dryly did his copilot have the slightest idea of how theyd walloped the snot out of the nazis if he did he was doing his best to hide it that thought brought mouradian up short ivan kulkaanen might be doing his very best to conceal any surplus intelligence he owned maybe you would get promoted if you showed you had more on the ball than the other junior lieutenants around you or maybe youd get what was the word farmers used culled that was it a sunflower that stood taller than the others in the field almost begged for the scythe marx said communisms doctrine should be from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs but what if your abilities were of the sort that made your superiors nervous youd be sorry that was what or youd turn into a chameleon so theyd look right at you without seeing you or at least without noticing you were any different from the rest was that what kulkaanen was up to stas didnt think so but he hadnt imagined even the possibility till now and something else occurred to him was that something he should be doing more of himself he knew he was brighter than most of the other pilots in the squadron his superiors likely did too all of a sudden he wondered whether that was good or dangerous no nkvd men waited to haul him off to a fate worse than combat when he landed the pe the chekists had plenty of other things to worry about if he was on their list he hadnt yet come to the top since his own side didnt feel like killing him yet the germans would get another chance one day soon to an englishman egypt even in what should have been autumn came with only two settings on the thermostat too hot and much too bloody goddamn hot alistair walsh donned khaki drill shorts that showed off his pale hairy legs even in tropical uniform he sweltered he started out wearing a solar topee a fancy name for a pith helmet but another veteran sergeant whod had a go at the halfarsed desert warfare with the eyeties set him straight about that go any place where they might shoot at you and you want a proper tin hat pal the other man said that ugly thing youve got on your head you mean my face walsh broke in they were pouring down pints in a makeshift sergeants club somewhere between sollum which was in egypt and tobruk which was in italianowned libya just a big tent actually and the beer came from bottles but it could have been worse the other sergeant laughed ive seen worse mugs my own for instance but you do want a tin hat even if its already khaki paint it again and throw sand on the paint while its still wet that kills sun glare better than anything else weve found nice walsh nodded appreciatively i wouldnt have thought of that nor i his drinking partner said ive heard we nicked the notion from mussos boys but i cant swear to it interesting how much in earnest are they really well it depends his new chum answered it often does walsh agreed his voice dusty the other fellow chuckled and isnt that the bloody truth they were brave enough against the austrians the last goround not exactly the first string on either side in that match walsh said too true they havent covered themselves with glory in spain by all accounts most of them never wanted to go there and theyve fought that way here it depends more on the unit and the officers with the eyeties than it does with the fritzes the other sergeant said with the fritzes they always mean it walsh said with feeling you know what youre getting with them same as with navy cuts in aid of which he lit a cigarette and offered his new friend the packet with a nod of thanks the other man took one im joe billings he said and stuck out his hand walsh shook it and gave his own name and just as much a taffy as youd expect from the handle he added if he said it first the other fellow couldnt use it against him but billings only nodded heard it in the way you talked he said and no more by his own accent he came from englands industrial midlands he went on some of the italian regiments they arent worth tuppence hapenny others othersll give you everything you want and more besides for a while i should say theyre all short of staying power not the men by what you say walsh was trying to put pieces together not in those outfits some damn fine soldiers there billings said rifles machine guns grenades that kind of thing one blokes kit is about as good as the others but theyre short on artillery theyre woefully short on tanks and the ones theyve got are oldfashioned junk heh walsh drained his pint back in france i would have said the same thing about ours the germans chased us a deal more than we chased them and thats the truth you arent fighting the germans any more though billings said this is a different business how different it was walsh discovered anew when he ducked out of the tent to ease himself a million stars blazed down on him the milky way was a pearly mesh cast across black black sky you never saw night skies like this in england or france too much moisture in the air and till the blackouts too many lights sullying the darkness oddly the only place hed ever known the heavens like this before was in norway on a few of the rare clear winter nights but this wasnt norway either hed frozen his ballocks off there despite a sheepskin coat nights got cold hereyou did want your greatcoatbut not cold like that the wind smelled different you didnt breathe in ice and pine trees here you smelled sand and dust and petrol and exhaust english forces here were far more motorized than they had been in norway walsh sniffed again as he did up his trousers he didnt know what he was sniffing for camel shit something like that he supposed hed seen a few camels since he got to egypt the natives used them so did the english and the italianswhen they ran short of lorries you could also eat them if you had to walsh hoped like hell hed never have to could anything that ugly possibly taste good he went back into the tent joe billings had bought them both fresh pints while he was outside pretty soon hed buy a round himself theyd both be pissing all night long he was nursing a headache the next morning that didnt keep the personnel wallahs from sending him up to his new slot senior underofficer for an infantry company all the young lieutenants eyed him as if he were a leper and well they might they had the seniority of rank but he had that of experience they could order him around and they didnt have to do what he told them to donot by military law they didnt but they might land in worse trouble for ignoring him than he would for ignoring them one of them asked him did you go through it the last time around yes sir walsh tapped his leg bought part of a plot but not the whole thing he grinned crookedly weathers better for it here than it is back in blightyill tell you that hardly aches at all the subaltern nodded his name was wilf preston he had a sunburned windchapped face full of freckles and he looked hardly old enough to have escaped from public school his posh accent said hed likely gone to one he hesitated before continuing speaking of blighty were you ah in london when the government ah changed yes sir walsh repeated by the way preston asked the question he already knew the answer thats interesting walsh thought my reputation goes before me they arent leery just because staff sergeants are supposed to eat second lieutenants without salt he wasnt used to having that kind of reputation for the rest of his life he would be the man whod brought in rudolf hess the man whod known winston churchill the man whod helped topple horace wilson in a military coup he might be a lowly staff sergeant but people with far more power than lowly lieutenants would look sidelong at him from here on out who are your friends theyd wonder what can you do to me if i cross you if he shouted boo young wilf preston would probably jump right out of his skin it was temptingdamned if it wasnt instead he pointed west and asked could you tell me what mussos lads are up to sir theyre just patrolling for the time being preston answered with transparent relief so are we mainly they havent shown a great deal of push since we drove them back over the border we have the feeling that the only reason they attacked at all was so benito could show adolf he was strafing us for ducking out of the alliance against russia pity he cant be his own fool instead of hitlers walsh said up at the front a mile or two from where they talked gunfire started up walsh began to unsling his leeenfield but noticed preston wasnt getting excited they always open fire around this time of day the subaltern said we think they have orders to shoot off so many rounds every morning and this is how they make their quota war shouldnt be about work rates walsh said if it were all the soldiers would unionizeand likely go out on strike then youd need to hire blacklegs if you wanted any killing done preston looked at him in yet another new way youre quite daft arent you he said who me walsh shrugged i do my best hansulrich rudel woke to a soft drumming against the canvas of his tent he was afraid he knew what that was but he might have been wrong he stuck his nose outside to see said nose and the rest of his face met raindrops he didnt take the lords name in vain even now he remembered he was a ministers son but he did say something that never would have come out of his mouth before he joined the luftwaffe the rain poured down from a pewter sky hansulrich squelched over to the mess tent some of the flyers in there had already started drinking one of them raised a flask in salute to him have a snort rudel you know i dont do that rudel answered you may as well we sure as hell arent going up for a while peter took a long pull at the flask did his cheeks and nose turn redder or was that only hansulrichs sanctimonious imagination preferring not to dwell on it rudel said it may stop the ground may dry up again he didnt believe himself either hed been in russia the autumn before he knew what these rains were like so did peter who laughed raucously go talk to a virgin pal this weathers fucked us before and its fucking us again since hansulrich feared he was right he walked over to see what the field kitchen had turned out it was a thick stew of boiled buckwheat groatskasha the ivans called the stuffand onions and carrots and bits of flesh pointing to one of those bits in his mess tin hansulrich asked what is it meat the fellow whod ladled out the stew gave back a laconic answer i figured that rudel said with exaggerated patience but will it neigh when i bite down or bark or meow as long as it doesnt ask you for a loan herr oberleutnant odds are youre better off not knowing the cook replied sighing rudel decided he was likely to be right he sat down on a bench and spooned up the stew theyd never serve it at the adlonalthough food inside the reich was nasty these days too the meat had been boiled so long he couldnt tell what it had started out as it tasted meaty he emptied the tin tray faster than hed expected he would have gone back for seconds if he hadnt worried that the cook would laugh at him there was a strange thing around his neck hung the knights cross proof that he didnt fear anything enemy flak might do to his stukaor to him yet the thought that an enlisted man who needed a shave might mock him kept his behind glued to the planking courage and then again courage before the war started he hadnt understood that it came in different flavors and what kind of courage was required for an aryan holder of the ritterkreuz to sleep with a halfjewish barmaid to love her hansulrich shook his head it wasnt like thatquite even having anything to do with her though took bravery unlike either bearding a cook or diving on an enemy panzer it took a certain amount of moral courage though rudel himself was unlikely ever to see it in that light colonel steinbrenner ducked into the mess tent at a training base in germany no doubt the flyers would have stopped shoveling in kasha and mystery meat they would have put down the vodka jugs no they wouldnt have had any vodka jugs to begin with and they would have leaped to their feet stiffened into attention and saluted the squadron commander a couple of them nodded one man paused in lighting a cigarette long enough to wave the rest went on with what they were doing steinbrenner took that for granted he shed his officers cap and scowled at the drops of water on the patentleather brim fucking wet out there he remarked too right it is said the pilot with the cigarette one of the men passing around the jug held it out to the colonel he laughed shook his head and went over to the pot full of stew the cook filled his mess kit then steinbrenner caught hansulrichs eye wordlessly asking may i sit next to you hansulrich nodded and did his best to look eager and inviting discipline at the front didnt work the way it did in the reich during peacetime but you needed some mighty good reason to tell your squadron commander to get lost and he had none hows it going steinbrenner asked as he parked himself in this weather sir its not going anywhere rudel said youve got that right anyway the landsersll just have to live without air support for a while well so will the russians steinbrenner dug into breakfast he chewed thoughtfully before delivering his verdict ive had worse but ive sure had better whats the meat dont know hansulrich admitted didnt you ask steinbrenner said yeah but the cook said id be better off not finding out rudel answered the squadron commander turned and shouted at the guy behind the cauldron hey klaus what did you kill before you dumped it into this slop he didnt worry about the enlisted mans precious sensibilities and klaus didnt worry about his either sir i believe thats your granny he replied the mess tent erupted with laughter colonel steinbrenner spooned up some more meat his jaws worked again he shook his head nah grannyd be tougher than this no matter how long you stewed her more laughter the cook held up the ladle in salute acknowledging the hit hansulrich knew he couldnt have done anything like that he could sass sergeant dieselhorst that way and maybe a couple of the other flyers he felt comfortable with but not a cook he didnt care a pfennig for one way or the other yes colonel steinbrenner was older than he was but rudel suddenly realized more than age and rank went into running a squadron he didnt go on from there to realize steinbrenner had asked to sit next to him for a reason he was a gear with a worndown tooth or two and didnt fit smoothly into the squadrons mechanism had he realized something like that he would have taken another step toward being ready to lead such an outfit so what are you going to do now that flying gets tricky steinbrenner asked him then the colonel shook his head once more now that flying gets stuck in the mud i should say oh i dont know sir maybe ill see if i can con a furlough out of my squadron commander rudel said blandly some people can drink so that weeks seem to go by in days if you dont drink though weeks stuck in the mud seem more like years best argument for drinking ive heard lately colonel steinbrenner remarked hansulrich hadnt intended it as anything of the kind but he could see how the older man might hear it that wayand jab him with it steinbrenner went on if you did get a furloughby some miracle you understandwhere would you go what would you do and anywhere away from here isnt a good enough answer now hansulrich chose his words with care well i might take a train back to poland to get away from the war for a bit to ah bialystok why deny it steinbrenner knew about sofia he nodded yes he was unsurprised and hows your girlfriend there thats what id like to find out sir she ah she doesnt write much rudel said in point of fact sofia didnt write at all hed never told her not to but she knew getting love lettersor any lettersfrom a mischling wouldnt be good for him colonel steinbrenner nodded that may not be the worst thing in the world was all he said but it told hansulrich he not only knew about sofia but also about her racial makeup if they wanted to make a case against me they could the weight of the knights cross on his neck felt most reassuring to rudel but that kind of thing wouldnt stop them if they decided you were disloyal it might slow them down but it wouldnt stop them the only thing that would stop them was obvious unswerving loyalty to the reich and to national socialism hansulrich had it in abundance he also had a halfjewish girlfriend would that make them doubt the other all he could doif he didnt want to give sofia up and he didntwas hope not you explain how you messed up you promise not to do it again and you mean what youre saying from the bottom of your heart after that the suns supposed to come out and everythings supposed to be wonderful just the way it was before its straight out of a hollywood script peggy druce was discovering that real life didnt work out the way movies did it was nothing she hadnt suspected before but despite confessions she and herb couldnt seem to go back to the way theyd been before she sailed for europe in late summer they could talk about forgiving each other meaning it was harderharder than shed ever expected it wasnt anything showy or dramatic he didnt haul off and belt her one she didnt smash crockery over his noggin they still enjoyed each others company at the diningroom table and even in the bedroom they werent going to end up in divorce court nothing like that but all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put humpty together again peggy felt the lack the way shed felt it when she woke up from the ether without her wisdom teeth she could still go back there with her tongue and remember when shed had them she could remember this other thing that was missing now too theyd given her codeine to keep the extractions from hurting so much she wished there were also a pill for this she tried bourbon but that seemed to make matters worse not better herb was drinking more these days he wasnt drinking what anybody would call a lot but he was drinking more peggy wondered if she should say something about it at least let him know shed noticed in the end she kept her mouth shut she also wondered whether she should have done that about their adventures while apart she didnt think so this was better than the looming thing in the room with them that neither had wanted to admit was there the trouble was shed thought that better would turn out to be the same thing as what kids called all better nope and the difference between the one and the other was enough to tempt her back toward the old grand dad bottle again then one dreary rainy earlydarkening afternoon herb came through the door with more bounce in his step than shed seen since she got back from europe ha he said as he hung his topcoat on a peg so it would drip on the tile floor ha peggy asked ha he said it again even more emphatically for good measure he added hoohah then he lit a cigarette okay now i get it peggy said youre all excited because glenn miller just took you on as a scat singer he coughed blowing out ragged puffs of smoke dont do that he wheezed youll make me choke to death sorry she did her best to sound properly contrite it wasnt easy she still wanted to laugh maybe i wouldnt need to if youd tell me whats really going on well i was going to herb took another cautious drag on the coffin nail this time he didnt try to explode when he exhaled needed more finagling than i ever thought it would but i finally did it thats nice peggy answered did what persuaded uncle sam i could do something that would help give the war effort a kick in the pants her husband looked proud enough to bust the buttons on his vest and well he might have hed been trying to do something for the country ever since japan attacked the philippines and tried to hit hawaii the january before the troubleor at least part of the troublewas the government was deluged with middleaged men offering their services most of them were too old and too far from war service to be worth anything with weapons in their hands getting men to fight and giving them the tools they needed to fight with had to be washingtons top priority even that wasnt going so well as people wished it would stories about waste and inefficiency and fraud and profiteering showed up in the papers almost every day and in the news magazines almost every week but the war departments worries about everything else ran only a distant secondwhen they ran at all what will they want you to do peggy asked it might have been will i ever see you again that wasnt even close to fair not when shed gallivanted all over pennsylvania and beyond telling eyewitness tales of how nasty fascism was so prosperous peopleand those not so prosperouswould fork over the cash to let the government take care of whatever it decided needed taking care of make things run smoother herb said efficiency expert is what it boils down to only theyll pay me more than a runofthemill efficiency expert cause i wont be dealing with stuff on the shop floor im supposed to make whole factory systems run better how much is more was peggys natural next question herb named a number she whistled softly that was pretty good all right then she asked are they going to draft you so you can do it unhunh he shook his head theyd have to make me a colonel or something to give me enough clout to do the job and they dont want to make colonels out of guys who were corporals the last time around and got out of the army as fast as they could afterwards cant say i blame em either so ill be a civilian with a fancy letter from the secretary of waror maybe from the president dunno yetthat says i have the power to bind and to loose peggy looked suitably impressed wow can i touch you she reached out as if to tap him gently with the very tip of her forefinger he grabbed her and squeezed her you darn well better babe she squeezed back she liked being in his arms it felt like the right place to be she only wished there werent that little something in the back of her mind once upon a time gladys the clerktypist had been in his arms too and once upon a time peggy herself had wound up in that american diplomats arms none of that would happen again if she hadnt been sure of it she wouldnt have liked being in herbs arms any more all the same the shadow lingered countries in europe remembered slights and defeats at the hands of their neighbors that went back centuries sometimes even in this day and age they chose their alliesand their warson account of them that had always struck a sensible nononsense applepie american like peggy as insane once something was over it was over wasnt it well as things turned out that depended she and herb were finding out for themselves that memories werent always so easy to shove aside and if people who loved each other had trouble doing it how much harder was it for countries that hated and feared and mistrusted one another peggy started to tell herb that all at once she understood why european nations went off the rails every generation or two but she didnt go ahead and do it it would have involved reminding him theyd gone off the rails themselves they were both doing their best to forget that whose fault was it that their best didnt seem to be good enough it probably wasnt anybodys fault exactly it did you say something herb asked so she must have made a noise after all she shook her head not me must have been the goldfish we havent got a goldfish herb pointed out they grinned at each other from a distance of about six inches how many times had one of them or the otheror as here both of them in collusionmade that same silly joke it was one of the things they shared one of the things that made them a couple gladys wouldnt have known how to finish it neither would constantine jenkins were like an old sock and a shoe herb and me peggy thought we fit and were comfortable together that wasnt such a bad thing not when you considered the alternatives chapter if anything was more fun than changing a panzer track in mud and rain theo hossbach had trouble imagining what it might be the job resembled nothing so much as a bout of allin wrestling with the added chance of getting squashed if you were careless having a fiveman crew instead of three did help more hands couldnt make this work light but they did make it a little lighter and the gunner and loader complained just as much as the three men whod come out of their little panzer ii together which didnt mean those three didnt complain these fucking things better work is all ive got to say adi stoss growled plying spanner with might and main this beast should have come with them lothar eckhardt said the gunner wiped a wet sleeve across his equally wet forehead and went on i mean they knew all along what things in russia would be like right adi and hermann witt both laughed raucously even theo snorted sergeant witt said lothar they didnt know their ass from their elbow highways on the maps are horrible dirt tracks on the ground secondary roads on the maps arent there at all they didnt realize wed need wider tracks on our panzers till we screamed at em that the russians could keep going where we bogged down and its taken a fucking year to get the ostketten out to us so we could dance like this ostketten east tracks panzers hadnt needed wider tracks in czechoslovakia or the low countries or france they sure did here in russia this wasnt much of a civilized country or much of a civilized war eckhardt stared at hermann witt but hasnt the general staff come out and looked at this ground dont bet anything you cant afford to lose adi said son of a bitch eckhardt said with feeling if they havent somebody ought to stick em in a penal battalion maybe theyd learn some sense if they lived through that and if they didnt whod miss em penal units were a soviet idea the wehrmacht had borrowed take a bunch of guys whod disgraced themselves by cowardice or some other mortal sin give them a chance at redemptionthrow them in where the fighting is hottest if they try to retreat shoot them yourself if they die in action oh well chances are theyll shake the enemy doing it and if they happen to live you can turn them back into ordinary soldiers again or if youre so inclined you can fill up the holes in the penal battalion with new fuckupsthere are always new fuckupsand throw it into action somewhere else the system had an elegant simplicity theo was surprised the nazis hadnt thought of it for themselves but then theyd never been shy about stealing ideas from other people instead of talking about thatwhich might have made him learn more about penal battalions than hed ever wanted to knowtheo went on manhandling the ostketten into place on the road wheels and the idlers and most important of all the drive sprocket after close to two hours they finished a couple of them had vodka in their canteens instead of water say what you would about vodka but it didnt give you dysentery the haves shared with the havenots socialism was real at the front everywhere else as far as theo could tell it was only a sour joke smacking his lips adi said no dumb cops gonna write me a ticket for drunken driving not today if anybody tries mash him like a potato hermann witt said he eyed their backbreaking handiwork lets see if we can go mash some ivans now ostketten wouldnt keep out shells from a t or a kv of course but the panzer crew had lashed the old narrow tracks to the glacis they might help turn an enemy round there or of course they might not but it was worth a try theo had seen several other panzer iiis similarly decked out more and more crews would improvise improved armor as more ostketten arrived at least the panzers engine started up right away hard freezes hadnt begun yet let alone the kind of weather that made a mockery of german antifreeze and motor oil mechanics swore this years antifreeze and lubricants were better than the stuff the wehrmacht had used the year before theo hoped that meant they wouldnt have to build a fire under the engine compartment to thaw things out enough to start he hoped but he didnt really believe it he dripped on his seat when he took his place inside the panzer the radioman and bow gunner was as far from the engine compartment as he could get in the panzer ii theos station had been right on the other side of the fireproofeveryone hoped bulkhead hed warmed up in a hurry there no such luck in this machine over on the other side of the centrally positioned radio sat the driver at sergeant witts command adi put the panzer iii in gear it rattled and clanked ahead the engines grinding growl seemed a long way off to theo whod been used to listening to it right at his elbow theo glanced over at his comrade but adi was paying attention to what he was doing how does it seem theo asked if he wanted to find out he had to spend some words feels a little better maybe adi answered after a judicious pause i dont want to charge into the thickest slop i can find you know just to see if the ostketten ll pull us through it theyre liable not to and then youd have to call a recovery vehicle to fish us out everybodyd love me for that if by love he meant scream at he was right otherwise otherwise he was a sarcastic cynical veteran panzer man just like thousands of others in the wehrmacht well almost just like thousands of others as long as the authorities didnt notice the difference everything was fine it had been fine for quite a while now theo hoped it would stay that way german authorities werent the only ones who could foul things up of course the russians werent thrilled about having other peoples tanks gallivanting across their landscape theo wondered why now that he could see out he could see what a broad bleak country this was it might not have looked so bad when the trees had leaves and the grain was greening toward gold but the harvest was over and cold and rain had done for the leaves the word that crossed his mind for the land hereabouts was haunted if you were a german panzer man the landscape damn well was haunted russians wore mudcolored uniforms to begin with and they took camouflage very seriously more seriously than the germans did for sure they wouldnt mind rolling in the mud and rubbing it on their faces to make themselves harder to spot theyd daub mud on their panzers too or drape netting over them to disguise their outlines you might not suspect they were around till a shell slammed into your side armor from a direction you hadnt worried about adi hit the brakes hermann witts voice came through the speaking tube whyd you stop ground up ahead doesnt look quite right stoss answered whats the matter with it just looks like ground to me the panzer commander said ill go ahead if you want me to but id sooner back up and go around adi told him do that then witt said you dont usually get the vaporsand if you have em this time well shit youre entitled once in a while thanks sergeant youre all right you know that adi put the panzer into reverse theo wondered what would have happened were heinz naumann still in charge here no he didnt wonder he knew naumann would have ordered adi to go straight ahead just to show him who the boss was and then they would have seen whatever they would have seen as adi was making his loop another panzer iii did head straight across the stretch of ground he hadnt liked it did fine for about thirty meters then it hit a mine that blew off its left track curses from the other panzers radioman dinned in theos earphones now those guys would have to wait for a recovery vehicle or else come out of their steel shell and try to repair things well enough to limp away if the reds aimed an antipanzer cannon at them while they were stuck that would be hard luck for them hermann witts voice came through the speaking tube again good job adi thanks boss the driver answered theo wondered what naumann would have said after they charged into the minefield at his orders since the other commander had stopped one with his head nobody would ever know now and maybe that was just as well for everyoneexcept naumann of course vaclav jezek sprawled under a battered chunk of rusting corrugated iron between the republican lines northwest of madrid and the nationalist positions rain drummed down on the iron the ground around the czechs hideyhole was getting muddy no by now it had already got muddy every so often a little chilly rill dribbled in with vaclav summer was over spanish autumn warned that spanish winter was coming some yellowing bushes concealed where the muzzle end of vaclavs antitank rifle stuck out from under the sheet iron the bushes also made it harder for him to peer through the telescopic sight but he didnt mind a snipers first commandment was dont let them spot you if you didnt honor that commandment and keep it wholly you wouldnt live long enough to learn the second one and naturally the rain also cut down on visibility that blade also had two edges yes vaclav had more trouble finding likely targets but marshal sanjurjos men would also have more trouble noticing him if he made a mistake he gnawed on a chunk of spicy spanish sausage his tongue thought spaniards put peppers and garlic in everything this side of ice cream they were even worse than magyars for hotting up their food the sausage actually wasnt too bad now that hed got used to it he wished for a cigarette he had a pack in his pocket but lighting one now would be a kingsized mistake even through the rain an alert nationalist might spot smoke leaking out from under the iron sheet some of the american internationals chewed tobacco when they got into a spot where they couldnt light up vaclav thought about it but not for long the idea seemed too disgusting to stand he could deal with the nosmoke jitters till night fell then he could either have a careful cigarette heremaking sure the struck match and the coal didnt showor go back to the trenches and smoke his head off in the meantime waiting was a big part of the snipers game if you werent patient you wouldnt last one of these daysone of these yearsvaclav wanted to go home to a free czechoslovakia letting some spanish fascist asshole pot him before he could wasnt in his plans he moved the antitank rifle a few millimeters through the scope he eyed a new stretch of the nationalists rear entrenchments it seemed no more interesting than the old stretch had the spaniards there were more careless than they were at the front where an ordinary rifleman could pot anybody who unwarily stuck his head up over the parapet they thought they were far enough away to be safe the hell of it was they were right he could have blown some of their brains out sure seeing them in helmets so much like the ones the nazis wore made him want to do it too but he wasnt about to waste his precious ammo on ordinary joses and jorges if you were going to snipe at long range you wanted to get rid of the officers the highpowered guys whose loss hurt the enemy out of proportion to their numbers like this bastard for instance he wore an officers cap with a high crown and a brim not a helmet or a service cap the brim helped keep the rain out of his eyes but it also told the world what he was there were stars above the brim how many small or large that would say how big a fish vaclav had in his sights at this range and in this weather he couldnt be sure whoever the jerk was he pointed a finger at one of the ordinary soldiers and told him off in no uncertain terms that decided the sniper watching him from afar anybody who thought he was such a big shot deserved whatever happened to him vaclav took careful aim inhaled exhaled and pressed the trigger the elephant of a gun slammed against his shoulder the stock was padded but that helped only so much and the report always fearsome seemed four times as loud under the sheet of corrugated iron but the nationalist officer fell over which was the point of the exercise vaclav quickly chambered another round had the nationalists seen the muzzle flash when he shot their officer if they had would they come after him and try to pay him back no one came he wouldnt have wanted to hunt snipers in the rain either you never could tell though sometimes people got upset when you murdered their officers sometimes no doubt the regular guys in the trenches hoisted one in your direction when you blew the head off some jackass they couldnt stand that was the kind of thing you were unlikely to hear about which had always struck vaclav as too damn bad he kept watching through the sight he didnt intend to fire two in a row from the same spot not unless he got a terrific target hed think twice even then shooting two in a row without moving felt almost like signing your own death warrant after a while he took a small swig from his canteen cheap spanish white wine tasted different from cheap french white wine but no better with regret he kept it to the one small swig the less you drank the less you needed to get rid of he didnt have much room to piss under here unless he wanted to lie in it some more sausage some chewy barley bread this wasnt the ritz or the adlon no two ways about it where was the barmaid with the big tits to bring him another bottle of bubbly wherever she was she wasnt anywhere around here he didnt find any more overbearing officers to shoot at you could peer through a sight for only so long once he decided he wouldnt spot anything more he pillowed his head on his arms and fell asleep it was dark when he woke up under the iron sheet it was black as hitlers heart he needed a second or two to realize he hadnt died or been buried alive he had a way out a way back to his friends fuck he muttered he had to give his own heart stern orders not to try to pound its way out of his chest his hands shook of course that was partly because he hadnt had a cigarette in much too long he carefully backed out of the little artificial cave where hed sheltered it was still raining no one in the line challenged him till he was clambering over the parapet good going guys he said as he dropped down into the forward trench and fumbled for his cigarettes i could have been a nationalist with a machine pistol you never would have known the difference till i opened up he cupped his hands so he could strike a match in spite of the waterworks from on high nah you wouldve made more noise getting through stuff if you were one of the other czechs answered you hope i would vaclav said some of those guys know what theyre doing though it started coming down harder he kept a hand over the cigarette so the raindrops wouldnt put it out after so long without he needed more than just a drag or two to feel right we heard you fire the other czech said get the guy you were aiming at bet your ass the sniper said not without pride he wont be telling anybody what to do again so some other jerk will do it instead that cynicism came from benjamin halevy with exaggerated patience vaclav answered the idea is if we kill enough of them theyll run out of menor the ones they have left wont be worth shit yeah thats the idea all right the jew agreed sure is taking it a long time to work though vaclav looked at himlooked through him really if you dont like it you can always go back to france the rest of us were fucking stuck here we arent going back to czechoslovakiathats for goddamn sure the nazis heldheld downtwothirds of what had been his country slovakia the remaining chunk called itself independent it might be able to sneeze on its own it couldnt wipe its nose afterwards though till hitler countersigned the order bite me jezek halevy said without heat im not going anywhere and you know it i volunteered for this shit same as you maybe that proves you really are a dumb sheeny after all you dont usually talk like it though vaclav replied they swore at each other in a companionable way nobody would be going anywhere much till the rain quit for a while and they both knew it rain sleet a little snow mixed in for goodor badmeasure julius lemp wondered why hed brought the u up to the surface he could hardly see the uboats bow from the conning tower let alone anything farther away stumbling over a target in the stormtossed barents sea would be purely a matter of luck true the boat could go faster surfaced than submerged again so what if all he saw was this tiny circle yes hed sweep out more area cruising along at fifteen knots but enough to matter he doubted it still and all that didnt mean he didnt try he wore oilskins over his peacoat and a widebrimmed waterproof hat he was soaked anyhow sleet stung his cheek whenever he faced into the wind which seemed to have come straight down from the north pole the waves that slapped the submarine had taken a running start from that wind too one of the ratings on the conning tower with him tried to clean salt spray off binocular lenses for the third time in ten minutes he looked through the zeiss glasses again then let them thump down to his chest on their strap with a disgusted growl lousy things are worse than useless he complained to lemp or possibly to god god didnt answer lemp did i know franz im not using mine either not right now we dont have to worry about planes anyway not in this crap we dont franz said youd have to be nuts to take off to begin with if you didnt kill yourself doing that youd never spot a uboat and if you did spot one youd lose it again before you could do anything about it we hope lemp said and franz had to nod to that because you never could tell life was a bitch sometimes you just never could tell the russians were nuts enough or stubborn enough to put planes in the air regardless of the weather and they were used to operating in awful conditions more used to it than the germans were if one of their seaplanes came out of nowhere it might be able to deliver an attack before the u vanished in the swirling snow and mist uboat skippers who didnt stay nervous all the time didnt come home again uboat skippers who did stay alert all the time and who insisted their crews do the same were ironarsed sons of bitches all you had to do to know that was talk to any sailor whod served under julius lemp hed recite chapter and verseand book too if you gave him time and fed him a couple of seidels of beer normal watches up on the conning tower lasted only two hours you could sweep your field glass across the sky just so long before you stopped noticing things as franz had seen sweeping field glasses across the sky on a day like this was a losing proposition lemp sent the ratings below at the appointed hour new men also dressed in foulweather gear took their places lemp stayed topside himself awhile longer he made and enforced the rules he could break them if he chose a gull scudded by he would have sworn its golden eyes bore a fishy look that had nothing to do with herring or cod whats this crazy human doing out here in weather like this why isnt he back on land where he belongs a big wave slapped the u when the boat was already rolling to port the crest tried to throw lemp and the ratings on the conning tower with him into the sea he grabbed the rail and hung on tight spitting frigid salt water more seawater cascaded down the hatch along with the uboats usual foul smells volleys of foul language poured out of the hatch a moment later the men in the pressure hull would have to get rid of the water as best they couldand fix whatever the unexpected bath had shorted out alles gut lemp called down rubbing at his stinging eyes more profanity from below made it clear that nichts was gut the diesels didnt miss a beat though whatever the sudden flood had done it hadnt soaked the engine room which turned out to be a good thing because a rating let out a horrified squeal ship dead ahead too many things were happening too fast lemp spun like a man suddenly hit from behind if it was a destroyer they were dead no matter how alert you were you couldnt hope to fight it out on the surface taken by surprise but it wasnt a warship it was a big rusty freighter maybe a straggler from a convoy on the way back to england hard left rudder emergency full power lemp screamed down the hatch at the same time as the freighters whistle blared a warning peter was down there he would obey instantly whether instantly was fast enough to do any good theyd know much too soon the steam whistle shrilled again if the freighter turned with the u the uboat was sunkliterally sailors at the ugly old ships bow pointed at the submarine they were close enough to let lemp see their open mouths and staring eyes as the u and freighter slid past each other then one of the sailors caught sight of the us windwhipped ensign his eyes got even wider lemp thought theyd bug right out of his head he must have figured we were russians the uboat skipper realized the freighters captain must have thought the same thing or he would have rammed the boat some english admiralmaybe even the first sea lordwould have pinned a medal on his chest that wasnt going to happen now one of the sailors up on the conning tower asked are we going to track that damned pigdog and do for him skipper no one would have claimed julius lemp was not aggressive certainly no one from the torpedoed athenia would have claimed any such thing all the same lemp wasnt sorry to see the freighter vanish into mist and spray and sleet as abruptly as it had appeared and the more he thought about pursuing it the less he liked the idea no well throw this one back he answered her skipper will be dodging and zigzagging for all hes worthand chucking every gram of coal hes got into the furnace too wed only find the rustbucket by luck and who knows how far away the convoy escorts are none of the ratings said anything more lemp would have been astounded if they had commanding the uboat was his job nobody elses did the sailors up there with him seem unusually subdued though did they think he should have gone after the freighter more to the point would they or one of them report him for not going after the ship would some kriegsmarine board decide hed shown defeatism or lack of fighting spirit or whatever the hell they called it these days would party bonzen courtmartial him on account of it or put him on the beach he hated to have to think that way which didnt mean he didnt do it bad things happened to politically naive people then again bad things also happened to politically pushy peopleat least to the ones who didnt shoot up the ladder at top speed you had to be aware without making the people who paid close attention to such things aware that you were aware it could be a tightrope act and so when he finally did go below he logged the incident in the most particular detail noting every detail of bad weather and dreadful visibility that mightlikely wouldsave his bacon if he had to try to explain himself to the kriegsmarine but if he had to explain himself to the ss he grimaced the blackshirts listened when they felt like it when they didnt they went ahead and did whatever they would have done anyhow in his tiny cabinseparated from the rest of the boat by a curtain which made him the only man aboard to enjoy if that was the word so much privacyhe listened to what was going on around him no cries warning of other ships came from the watchstanders on the conning tower that was his biggest most immediate worry everything else sounded pretty much normal too which came as a relief if the ratings who had a brief from one security service or another to spy on him were plotting with one another they were doing it where he couldnt hear and they werent doing it where they were disturbing the rest of the crew nice of them lemp thought he hadnt fretted about security men when the war started in those innocent days hed only cared about fighting the enemy he wished things were still so simple now hideki fujita had been through the fringes of a couple of typhoons in japan till he got to burma hed thought that meant he knew something about rain now he had to admit hed been nothing but an amateur in the monsoon water poured down by the warm bucketload you could stand outside naked and wash off men did whenever they felt the need what you couldnt do was dry off again afterwards water dripped through thatched roofs and pounded off galvanized iron even when the soldiers of unit werent being deluged the stifling humidity made sweat stick to them so they felt as if they were quite a few soldiers wore nothing but loincloth and zoris in the rain before long fujita was one of them leaving on a uniform even a tropicalweight uniform only ensured it would rot faster it would rot anyway but you could make things take longer despite the ghastly weather the war went on now that japan was fighting england in asia the english suddenly were doing everything they could to help china keep the emperors forces busy supplies came from india to yunnan province in southern china by road and by air they were no more than a trickle but a trickle that annoyed the japanese occupying the chinese end of the supply line was impossible the empire was stretched too thin she didnt have enough soldiers and too many of chiang kaisheks troops stood in the way making it hard for the chinese to collect the supplies or do much with them that was a different story and that was the kind of thing unit could help with fujita helped load porcelain bomb casings full of cholera bacilli and rodents infected with plague whenever bombers could take off they carried the germ bombs over the mountains into china the town of baoshan in western yunnan was a special target because of the rail lines to kunming the provincial capital that ran through it before long reports came back that baoshan was suffering from disease outbreaks that was the signal for more bombers to attack the place these carried ordinary high explosives and incendiaries hideki fujita didnt think baoshan would burn very well if it was as wet up there as it was down here butsurprise none of his superiors asked for his opinion some of what they did worked even if fujita couldnt find out exactly which part they wanted the people who lived in baoshan to flee from the town and spread sickness through the chinese countryside japanese soldiers monitoring radio signals from yunnan reported that unit s officers were getting what they wanted they were so pleased by their results they gathered the units enlisted men together so they could brag about what theyd accomplished a major named hataba stood on a table to let everyone see him it is now established that chinese forces have had to evacuate yunnan province he declared they take sickness with them wherever they go and they cannot gather the goods england tries to give them a sergeant standing by fujita clapped his hands good he said thats good thats very good hai very good fujita agreed he really did think it was but he would have agreed even if hed thought it was a disaster now that hed been demoted to corporal hed quickly relearned the necessary art of sucking up to sergeants theyd make you sorry if you didnt and you couldnt do anything about it all you could do was grease them up and try to keep them happy the sergeants noise and his own servile reply made fujita miss a little of what major hataba was saying when he could pay attention again without the risk of getting thumped what he heard was not just in china our illustrious unit and others working on related projects can punish the english in india the same way everyone knows india has been full of disease since the beginning of time its even filthier and more backward than china who there would realize why an epidemic started where the english were loading up their goods to send them on to the chinese bandits he paused waiting expectantly for an answer the assembled soldiers gave him the one he wanted nobody major san nobody thats right up on his rickety table hataba nodded i am obtaining the authorization we will need to give the english and the indians everything they deserve and we will hai the soldiers shouted and banzai one hot wet sticky day followed another no planes from unit dropped disease bombs on india though the attacks against china continued fujita was less surprised than some of the men he worked with when major hatabas soughtfor authorization proved slow in coming up in manchukuo unit had always worked in the darkest secrecy why wouldnt it be the same for the germwarfare units down here and even if the chinese figured out what japan was doing to them well who cared about the fuss chinamen kicked up they sounded like a bunch of hysterical geese when they got excited it would be different if england realized the japanese were waging germ warfare against her when england said something the whole world listened england might not just talk either she might hit back china hadnt a prayer of matching japans science but england was one of the places from which japan had learned science to begin with what kind of bacteriologicalwarfare program did england have fujita had no idea did his superiors know all he could do was hope so whether they knew or not his superiorsor rather his superiors superiorsrefused to issue the order major hataba craved perhaps they feared to break secrecy or perhaps they just werent inclined to take any chances they didnt have to gradually the men in unit quit talking about india they pretended no one had ever said anything about it had they done otherwise major hataba would have lost face if that happened to an officer what could he do but make everybody who served under him sorry fujita settled in myitkyina had a military brothel staffed by burmese comfort women the japanese had recruitedor just grabbed the one fujita mounted started crying as soon as he finished and got off her he didnt care why should he he was happy and a comfort woman was only a convenience like a rubber rain cape the day after he got back from his leave in myitkyina major hataba summoned him ignoring his hangover he stood at stiff attention and saluted like a machine reporting as ordered sir he said wondering how much trouble he was in and whether he could wiggle out of it but the major wasnt in a mood to pull the wings off flies he said at ease corporal fujita relaxed fractionally hataba went on youre a good man im glad to have you here the people at unit were stupid to let you go if you want to know what i think youre wasted as a corporal im making you a sergeantlets see how you do he handed fujita two silver metal starsone for each collar tab put these on youll help us more with two stars on each tab than with one domo arigato major san fujita bowed low grateful inferior to superior the joy he felt at getting his rank back made coming inside the unhappy burmese comfort woman seem as nothing beside it youre welcome sergeant and youre dismissed major hataba might promote him but he wasnt about to waste a whole lot of time on him so what fujita bowed again almost as deeply he didnt think his feet touched the ground as he left the majors presence as soon as he could he affixed the new stars to the red tabs with the yellow stripe across the middle the tabs looked so much better now that they had their second stars back he thought so anyhow people noticed when he walked around the little base congratulations sergeant san a private said and gave him a cigarette and a light even as a corporal he could have knocked a private around but a sergeant could do it with more flair a sergeant could do anything with more flair and all the corporals whod been senior to him would need to watch themselves from here on out chapter when you came out of the line here you couldnt toddle off to an estaminet to soak up some wine and chat up the barmaid this was war without distractions and alistair walsh missed them even the italians werent much of a distraction that was the only good part of the fighting here as sergeant billings had said some of their units werent too bad most though didnt really have their hearts in the fight when english forces outmaneuvered them they would surrender with smiles on their faces it happened again and again because the english had more tanks and far more lorries than mussolinis boys you have to understand sir it doesnt work this way all the time walsh told lieutenant preston when another band of italians waved white flags after the briefest exchange of fire for those dagos its nothing but a game you come up against fritz though and youll find out he means it the subaltern nodded with luck in wisdom quite he said it is a bit like playing football when the other sides down to nine men isnt it hardly seems sporting bugger sporting sir walsh said earnestly you lose men here they dont get up again after the referee blows his bleeding whistle itll take the judgment trump to set em on their pins again wilf preston stared at him the youngsters eyes were blue as sapphires they were also redtracked with weariness just like walshs sun and wind and sand had burned and chapped prestons fine fair skin i do grasp the difference sergeant he said his voice starchy with indignation devil you do but walsh couldnt say that yes sir would have to do besides preston went on wouldnt you sooner have it easy than rough maybe he wasnt a complete twit walsh sketched a salute now that you mention it sir he answered yes only later did he wonder how true that was had he asked ronald cartland to stay in england and help turn young hooligans into proper soldiers the mp would have arranged that as effortlessly as hed seen to this and walsh would have done something useful to king and country something where he could have lived comfortably and where he would have been most unlikely to catch a packet instead hed requested service here and here he was a fat black fly landed on the back of his hand he squashed it before it could bite him it had a nasty smell like shit mixed with blood and you couldnt kill them all there were just too many beelzebublord of the flies hed had the bible pounded into him when he was a boy same as most welshmen till this campaign though hed never realized what a dark and terrible god old beelzebub must have been lieutenant preston wasnt immune to the flies either could you bring the bugs up on charges officers disrespect to something like that preston didnt try to smash his flies he just waved his hands over them so they buzzed away that might have been a better idea he didnt need to fret about the mess and the stink of course the bloody things would come back he still had his pecker up if we keep going the way we are well take tobruk away from mussos lads before long what will they do then theyll be in even more trouble than they are already thats what walsh answered liking the notion tobruk was the big italian base in eastern libya if it fell the enemy might have to fall back to benghazi or maybe all the way to tripoli without it the dagos sure as dammit wouldnt be able to mount another attack on egypt they seemed to know that too some of them even seemed to care their resistance stiffened as they pulled back into the works surrounding the mediterranean port no doubt about it they were better at fighting a static campaign than one that called for movement and now they had ships bringing supplies straight in to them that beat the stuffing out of the english truck convoys that started way the hell back in alexandria italian tanks might be laughable but one armys mm howitzer was about the same as anothers if the other buggers could bring in more ammo than you could in that case you dug trenches and laid barbed wire in a ring around his trenches and barbed wire and you settled in as best you could because grabbing tobruk was liable to take a while after all but for the weather and the scenery it might have been over again in biplanes had dueled above the trenches and so they did again here in raf gloster gladiators fought fiat crs high overhead planes and pilots seemed evenly matched when one side or the other won a dogfight a cheer went up from its troops on the ground these days pilots wore parachutes they mostly hadnt in god what a long hard way down every time walsh saw a silk canopy blossom in the sky he remembered rudolf hess bailing out of his bf over scotland what a mess that had made not for the first time walsh thought i should have bashed his brains in with a rock both raf flyers and their italian foes were sporting when a pilot hit the silk they didnt machinegun him while he floated helplessly the same courtesy had been observed most of the time in western europe from things walsh had heard the russians and the japanese didnt play by those rules neither did the fritzes in russia fair play verboten italian bombers sometimes came over the english lines by night they werent very accuratethey cost the tommies more in lost sleep than in damage or casualties little by little the besiegers assembled a striking column to try to break through the italian lines the italians had to defend everywhere so they spread themselves thin without tanks an attack on their position would have been suicidal remembering walsh knew that might not have stopped the donkeys with the red collar tabs from ordering one anyway with tanks a breakthrough had a chance that was one of the things tanks were for punching holes in positions too tough for infantry to crack by itself the italians didnt do much to hinder the english concentration walsh got the idea that like a tortoise bothered by a dog they werent going to stick their heads out of their fortified shell unless and until they had to the english generals must have got the same idea because they took their own sweet time readying their attack as things turned out they waited too long walshs regiment wasnt in the main striking column it went to a smaller one that would deliver a feint to make the italians commit their reserves to the wrong part of the semicircle around tobruk just after dawn two days before the feint was supposed to go in he heard unfamiliar engine noises in the air then all of a sudden they werent the least bit unfamiliaronly unexpected and out of place which unfortunately wasnt the same thing he grabbed lieutenant prestons arm sirthats the bloody luftwaffe s and stukas heading this way what youre daft the subaltern exclaimed perhaps five seconds before the messerschmitts started strafing the feinting column a few seconds after that stukas dove down out of the sky like ugly falcons their jericho trumpets screaming fit to jolt a mans soul right out of his body and in case the jericho trumpets fell down on the job kg bombs werent half bad for spreading terror around either walsh dove under a lorrythe best cover he could find he would roll out to fire a shot or two at the planes overhead then duck back again those werent italian pilots flying german planes black crosses and swastikas declared who was at the controls for reasons of his own hitler had decided to jump into the war in africa with both feet toomanmade thunder off to the east said the real striking column was catching hell too tobruk might fall but it sure as the devil wouldnt fall day after tomorrow rain in russia meant panzers went nowhere fast theo hossbach knew that as well as any german soldier in the ussr with the wider ostketten his panzer iii was less likely to bog down but swift thrusts and dashes were a thing of the past the ivans slowed down in the mud too their ponderous kvs had as much trouble with it as any german panzer ts though chugged through goop theo wouldnt have wanted to try even with ostketten adi was rightthe t wasnt a perfect panzer but it was kilometers out in front of whichever machine ran second and so for the time being the wehrmacht would try to hang on to what it had already gained instead of pushing deeper into russia maybe once a hard freeze came the panzertruppen could have another go at smolensk in the meantime units settled down in villages and on collective farms to wait out the mud time a couple of platoons from theos company based themselves on a kolkhoz southwest of smolensk a few of the buildings remained more or less in one piece the ivans whod fled the farm had slaughtered some of their livestock and driven the rest with them when they headed east hitler planned on turning european russia into germanys breadbasket no one in the reich had seemed to realize stalin would have plans of his own the germans might gain ground but theyd draw as little benefit from it as the russians could manage like any sergeant worth the paper he was printed on hermann witt believed idle hands were the devils playground if our panzer isnt going anywhere for a while then by god well make sure it goes like anything when we do start moving again he declared theo wasnt the only one who had no trouble containing his enthusiasm what stand in the rain and sink into the mud while we screw around with the engine adi stoss said in a word yes witt answered do you think i wont be there with you passing you spanners and pliers and fan belts and whatever else you happen to need ill be messing with the ironmongery too you know adi noddedreluctantly but he did so did theo sergeant witt was not a man to stay dry where his crew got wet nor a man to stay clean where they got dirty he made a good panzer commander in other words that didnt mean he couldnt be a pain in the fundament the new guys were no more enamored of busting their humps in the rain and the ooze than the crews oldtimers if i had a pretty girl there with me now not some hairy smelly old sergeant kurt poske said youd come down venereal in about a minute flat witt broke in affronted poske shook his head i can last a lot longer than that once they got the bitching out of their systems they fell to work they tore down the engine rain or no rain mud or no mud they boresighted both machine guns lothar eckhardt calibrated and adjusted the sights for the main armament they checked every link of their tracks and got the track tension left and right to just where sergeant witt and adi wanted it and theo serviced his radio set it still worked all right but a couple of the tubes plainly wouldnt last much longer he swapped in a spare for one but couldnt match the second to his annoyance none of the other halfdozen radiomen at the kolkhoz hador would admit to havingthat tube either hed gone and talked to all those relative strangers and they hadnt been able to help him it hardly seemed fair unhappily he reported his difficulty to sergeant witt witt rubbed his chin considering how long will the old one last he asked theo shrugged a day six months he shrugged again as usual he talked as if he had to pay for each word expended all right next time a kettenrad comes along hop a ride back to regimental hq and snag a new one witt said snag more than one if you can maybe we can swap some of the spares for other stuff we need muttering didnt count as words neither did theos resigned sigh most of the men at regimental headquarters were real strangers not the relative kind he would rather have tackled a t with a panzer ii than have anything to do with them no matter how much sense witts order made two days later a kettenrad a motorcycle with a track instead of a rear wheelbrought mail up to the kolkhoz when it started back theo sat in the sidecar he carried his schmeisser you never could be sure the wehrmacht had cleared out all the indians the common german name for enemy soldiers he didnt have to use the machine pistol on the way to the village the regimental bigwigs had taken as their own babushkas cooked for the headquarters staff old men with tolstoyan beards cut their firewood younger women probably served them other ways theo didnt have to ask questions to find the machine shop following his ears toward a smithys clangor got him there he stood and waited to be noticed eventually one of the mechanics asked well what do you need he held out the failing tube the mechanic turned and yelled hey helmut heres a guy for you the bespectacled helmut plainly cared more about radio sets and their parts than about his fellow human beings theo got on fine with him in other words and he had and could spare four tubes of the model theo needed theo stowed them in his greatcoat pockets he wondered how hed get back to the kolkhoz witt hadnt said anything about that he was walking up the villages muddy main street all the other streets were muddy too when someone called hey yeah youthe goalkeeper that made theo stop he turned at first he didnt recognize the landser coming toward him then to his dismay he did it was the fellow who claimed hed seen adi play football before the war theo would rather have met up with a russian ambush how are you doing the guy asked as if they were old friends theo doled out a shrug he didnt want to talk to this fellow who was nothing but troubleand worse trouble because he had no idea how much trouble he was sure as hell he went on and hows your buddy the footballer several possibilities ran through theos mind the truth was among them but he didnt let it bother him for long saying adid been killed seemed better but mr snoopy here might suspect that and try to check it out how about some playacting instead with a guttural growl theo raised the schmeisser and pointed it at the landser s belly button the safety was still on but he didnt figure the other guy would notice fine details you fucking son of a bitch he ground out so youre the asshole who tipped him to the blackshirts and now youre here to gloat i ought to blow your balls offif youve got any the guy in feldgrau went whiter than skim milk nnn he couldnt manage a nein till the fourth try desperately he went on i didnt do that i wouldnt do that im no rat on my mothers name i swear it what theo said about his mother would have got him murdered if he werent the one holding the machine pistol and thats bullshit too he added it isnt honest to god will you listen to me the landser said that time after the game i just wanted to say how good he was how was i supposed to know hed get his long johns in a twist that was what theo thought he said anyhow to a man from breslau the other guys broad bavarian dialect came within shouting distance of being a foreign language somebody reported him you sure looked like a good bet theo let his synthetic anger cool he lowered the schmeissera little why dont you just fuck off i still dont trust you and if i ever see you again youll wish i hadnt gabbling thanks and apologies and who knows what the other fellow beat it theo spotted another kettenrad hed been talking a little more wouldnt hurt much damned if he didnt get himself a lift back to the kolkhoz every once in a while words had their uses and sergeant witt beamed when he displayed the four tubes there you go he clapped theo on the back and youll save the one thats going bad too right if it isnt all the way dead you can get a little more out of it theo nodded hed already thought of that witt went on anything else going on at hq nah with a slow smile theo squeezed out the one word honolulu again pete mcgill hadnt wanted to see it hed hoped to see manila once more instead no such luck though the us navy would have had to win the big pacific slugfest to make that happen far from winning the great fleet the usa sent west from hawaii had barely got to play the planes that rose in swarms from japaneseheld islands and from japanese carriers didnt give the american ships the chance to close with the imperial navys battlewagons wildcats buzzed above pearl harbor now like the japoccupied islands farther west hawaii made an enormous unsinkable aircraft carrier if anything was going to hold the japanese navy away from pearl it would be air power meanwhile pete and the other marines aboard the boise joined her sailors in repairing battle damage and getting her ready to go out again and do well something anyhow the damage wasnt anything bigmetal dented and torn by near misses from japanese bombs the light cruiser hadnt been a major enemy target no light cruiser would storm into tokyo bay or anything like that sensibly the japs had gone after the american ships that could do them the most harm more planesfighters bombers reconnaissancecame into hawaii almost every day by ship so did more tanks more soldiers and more everything else if the united states had to fight japan starting from san diego and san francisco and seattle the war would be far longer and harderif it could be won at all but no new japanese attack on pearl harbor came word got back that planes from japanese carriers were helping to bombard singapore besieged and isolated the british bastion at the southern tip of malaya seemed likely to fall everything else from guam to the border between burma and india already had i bet the aussies are sweating bullets joe orsatti remarked as he and pete lugged fiveinch ammo aboard the boise the light cruiser had replenished at sea from the lassen ammunition ships fittingly enough were named for volcanoesbut shed shot off almost all of what shed taken aboard then her main armament by contrast hadnt fired a shot i bet youre right i sure would be anyway pete said his leg and his shoulder still pained him when he worked hard he wondered if they always would every time something in either place twinged he thought of vera if the aches lasted the rest of his life so would his memories of their time together in shanghai gettin more stuff through to them its like running the gantlet orsatti said he set a wooden case that held two shells down on the deck with a grunt of relief pete laid his burden down too something in his back clicked when he straightened that had nothing to do with his injuries or he didnt think it did it simply came from hard work as other leathernecks knocked the casings apart and stowed the shells he said youre right twice running you ought to quit while youre ahead funny funny like a dose of the clap orsatti said i aint seen your mother lately pete retorted orsatti flipped him the bird while they walked down the gangplank to pick up more shells neither man hurried the job would get done but it didnt have to get done right away the boise wasnt heading into action again any time soon pete went on weve got to try it though theyre screwed if we dont yeah i guess orsatti picked up another twoshell case a hundred pounds of brass and explosives plus the weight of the wood he lugged it back toward the cruiser pete did the same his shoulder and his leg really complained he didnt listen to them he could do the work hed proved that aboard the boise if he hurt he hurt that was all he had a bottle of aspirins hed bummed off a pharmacists mate in sick bay when he got especially sore he took a couple sometimes he thought they helped sometimes they didnt seem to do anything after he set down his next crate he said we could use some liberty you know what youd rather drink and fuck than haul shit around like a draft horse what kind of marine are you anyhow orsatti demanded in mock anger one with my head on straight thats what pete answered they dont pay you to drink and fuck the other sergeant pointed out they dont pay me enough to do this shit all the goddamn time when im in pearl mcgill said when im on board ship okay fine im stuck there i aint stuck hereexcept i need a pass people in hell need mint juleps to drink orsatti told him you had all that soft china duty where you could eat like a pig and screw like a lord you arent in a good place to piss and moan you know pete shut up china duty was soft especially to somebody whod spent most of his time in the corps on one ship or another servants good food all the time cheap whorehouseswhat more could a marine want but when it went bad it went as bad as it could he wondered how many of the leathernecks hed served with in peking and shanghai were still alive he hoped theyd made the japs pay a high price for bagging them a few days later he did snag a pass into honolulu he got drunk he went to hotel street and he got laid then he drank some more and got laid again in the course of drinking more still he knocked an army sergeant cold with a left to the belly and a right to the jaw he walked out of that joint before the shore patrol showed up leaving the army threestriper on the floor the jerk would be sadder when he woke up but probably no wiser he made it back to the boise on time next morning it was black coffee and some of those aspirins he hardly remembered coldcocking the army guy nor was he the only man just back from liberty who seemed a little the worse for wear for his sins the boise steamed out into the pacific later that day for livefire exercises with towed targets aspirins or no aspirins when the guns started going off he thought his head would explode with them before long he hoped it would the other guys at the gun razzed him every time he flinched since he flinched a lot he got several weeks worth of razzing all in the space of a few hours hangovers and big booms dont mix joe orsatti observed thank you albert einstein pete replied after a moment he added fuck you albert einstein his jimjams didnt keep him from passing shells to the loader when planes brought targets overhead if slowmoving strips of orange cloth had divebombed the boise the marines at her secondary armament would have blown them out of the sky a navy lieutenant warned keep an eyeball peeled for submarines we arent within safe waters he outranked the leathernecksa twostriper was the equivalent of a marine corps captain so they couldnt say much while he was in earshot once hed gone that was a different story what he thinks were too dumb to look if he dont tell us to orsatti groused he must figure were like ordinary swabbies pete put in that got some laughs marines were convinced sailors were idiots in training to be morons of course it worked both ways which was one of the reasons sailors and marines from the same ship sometimes brawled when they got liberty at the same time one of the other guys in the gun crew just said whistleass peckerhead that summed things up as well as any other two words pete could have thought of no one saw a periscope or even imagined he saw a periscope the hydrophones didnt report any contacts there was talk that the boise would get a fancy new version as part of her refit sonar was the name pete had heard he didnt know much about it but he was in favor of anything that would help keep them from stopping a torpedo they made it back to pearl undamaged that young lieutenant seemed convinced they got back for no other reason than his own enormous heroism the leathernecks laughed behind their hands otherwise they kept their opinions to themselves ivan kuchkov hated squelching through the mud he hadnt had to do that when he was in the red air force or not nearly so much of it anyhow but his only other choices were falling behind and letting the nazis capture him a bad bet or getting wounded or killed a worse one so squelch he did ukrainian mud seemed particularly oozy and bottomless too everybody said ukrainian soilthe famous black earthwas fertile beyond compare he supposed that was so this country was all kolkhozes but when the rasputitsa came the black earth also turned goopy beyond compare avram ivan called then he raised his voice to yell avram again louder this time the point man was well out ahead of the section the way he was supposed to be he stopped when he finally heard kuchkov what do you need comrade sergeant he shouted back he could afford to make some noise as ivan could no germans were in the neighborhood or if the germans were things were even more fouled up than the brass wanted to admit kuchkov guessedno on second thought he was surethat was possible maybe even likely he slogged forward through the muck to catch up to sasha davidov if there were fascists around he didnt want to call the point man back then the whole section might run into them without warning that he might run into them without warning occurred to him only when hed almost reached the jew he hung on to his ppd a little tighter once it did and the first question out of his mouth was any fucking sign of the pricks avram shook his head not around here sergeant he pointed ahead once we get over that swell of ground well be able to see farther of course if there are any germans on the far side of it theyre liable to spot us too ivan grunted normally he would have had no more use for a skinny swarthy little kike than any other russian of peasant stock did but times werent normalnot even a little bit the game had changed as soon as the ussr and the nazis actually came to grips some russians and more ukrainians and people from the caucasus liked hitler better than stalin theyd desert if they got the chance not even the politruks could stop them all the time you didnt need to worry about the jews though they were in the fight to the last bullet they had to be if the nazis caught them theyd get a bullet all right a russian might be able to surrender no guarantees but he might zhids didnt have a prayer the germans casually murdered them the same way they got rid of the political officers who fell into their hands pointing to that same swell of ground kuchkov asked can you haul your sorry ass to the top and over without letting the fascist pussies spot you avram was no braver than he had to be but then people who were braver than they had to be had a way of not living long he tossed a papiros into the mudhe didnt want some alert fritz noticing the coal or the smoke he nodded not with any great enthusiasm but he did i can do it all right you go ahead then but some of the clumsy cuntfaced bitches in our outfit you know theyd trip over their dicks if they tried right ivan said he waited for the jew to nod again before he went on so im gonna lead our assholes around to the left if its clear you fucking meet up with us there got it yob tvoyu mat sergeant davidov assured him ivan burst into raucous laughter and slapped him on the back literally what the jew said meant fuck your mother in a different tone of voice or at a different time it might have made kuchkov try to murder him but the filthy phrase lay at the bottom of mat it could have a multitude of meanings foul or fair what avram was getting across here was you bet your ass fair enough he was betting his own ass that he could do what he said he could do go on then ivan told him you get into trouble ill send some of the shitheads after you davidov nodded and went on if he got into trouble ivans promise probably wouldnt do him any good he had to know that but he moved up anyhow he might be a kike but he was all right the rest of the section took its own sweet time catching up to kuchkov the men werent fools they could tell they were pretty safe where they were the farther ahead they moved the betteror rather the worsetheir chance of bumping into nazis with guns kuchkov profanely explained how they were going to skirt the swell of ground ahead he also told half a dozen soldiers to rush to avrams rescue if the point mans luck ran out you fuck that up you better be more scared of me than you are of those german walking foreskins he added the soldiers nodded anyone who wasnt afraid of ivan didnt know him very well it had been drizzling the rain started coming down harder as he took his section where it needed to go in a way that was good the germans would have more trouble noticing them in another not so good the red army men would have more trouble spotting the fascists avram carried a ppd too you wanted to be able to throw a lot of lead at the bad guys in a hurry if you came across them when you didnt expect to ivan kept his head cocked toward the top of the low hillock hed hear that snarl through the rains plashing it didnt come he got the rest of the section where they needed to go then he waited avram davidov materialized as if out of thin air i think there are some germans in the trees along the stream up ahead he said you sure ivan asked him pretty sure comrade sergeant davidov answered i dont have any field glasses but they looked like germans sure as the devil bugger the cocksucking devil kuchkov said he turned to another red army man yuri da comrade sergeant go back and tell the company co that weve bumped into the fucking fascists ask him if he wants to reinforce us for a proper attack or if we should just sit tight and keep an eye on the pussies you got me da yuri said again and accurately gave back what ivan had said like his sergeant he could no more read and write than he could fly he relied on his memory in ways people who could write never did he was also pretty good at traveling crosscountrynot so good as avram but good enough off he went at the fastest clip the mud allowed ivan didnt need to order his men to start digging foxholes and camouflaging them the soldiers automatically did that when they saw they wouldnt be moving up for a while the foxholes here would be nasty places and would start filling up with water soon the men dug anyhow if german machine guns or artillery were going to probe for them they wanted somewhere to hide yuri probably wouldnt make it back for a couple of hours it might be dark by the time he did which would put things off till tomorrow ivan didnt mind he was in no hurry to get shot at he just hoped the nazis werent readying their own onslaught they might not need to wait hours to set up something goodsized the bastards had radio sets falling out of their assholes night came before either yuri or a german attack yuri did manage to find his way back in the dark and the jumpy sentries managed not to shoot him when he did reinforcements will come up in the morning he reported the captain wants us to sit tight till then khorosho ivan said the order let him to what he already wanted to which suited him fine but as avram discovered the germans reinforced under cover of darkness the soviet attack never went in instead the red army pulled back another kilometer or two and tried to draw a firm line in the mud chapter hansulrich rudel shivered snowflakes swirled through the air his breath smoked the ordinary luftwaffe greatcoat wasnt defense enough against the russian winter hed have to go back to wearing his flying togs all the time the way he had the year before the wehrmacht had been caught short last winter even the germans polish allies laughed at them or worse pitied them because of their inadequate coldweather gear nothing could embarrass german national pride worse than pity from a pack of slovenly harddrinking wifebeating poles things were better this year proper winter clothing was reaching the landsers who needed it most in something like adequate quantities they wouldnt have to steal lousy fleainfested sheepskin jackets from russian peasants the way they had before they wouldnt have to tailor bedsheets into camouflage smocks for the snow either there were proper snowsuits reversible between white and feldgrau progress of a sort but only of a sort as a lot of invaders had discovered before germany tried it russia was easy to get into getting out was a lot harder you could win victory after victory and then what the red army kept throwing in fresh divisions as if it manufactured them in magnitogorsk and there were always more kilometers of broad flat russian terrain ahead of the men from the reich nobody talked much about having a bear by the ears get labeled a defeatist and youd soon envy men whod only been captured by the ivans hansulrich was sure though that if hed started having doubts about what germany could hope to accomplish here other people had worse ones and had had them longer he was automatically loyal to the reich to the party and to the fuhrer others tried to separate the idea of germany from the people actually running the country and there were other worries not long after the ground got hard enough to let them start flying again albert dieselhorst sidled up to rudel on the airstrip and spoke in a low voice what have you heard about the french huh hansulrich blinked what do you mean what have i heard about them they eat frogs legs and snails they make good wine too though youd care more about that than i do what else am i supposed to know his radioman and rear gunner breathed out twin gusts of exasperation through his nostrils in a military sense sir the military honorific plainly took the place of something more like you donkey well hansulrich chose his words with care even with dieselhorst if he talked about the way the french had held the reich out of paris two wars in a row he could still end up in trouble so he stuck with the obvious theyre holding a stretch of the line not too far south of here yes they are the sergeant exhaled again not quite so extravagantly this time how hard are they holding it huh hansulrich repeated this time though he didnt stay a blockhead long even an innocent like him began looking for plots when the war wasnt going so well what do you think theyre going to try and pull an england on us its possible dieselhorst seemed happier that his superior did have some kind of clue after all are you ready to fly against them if we have to im always ready to fly against the enemies of the reich rudel answered now without the least hesitation sergeant dieselhorst grinned crookedly he reached out and set a hand on hansulrichs arm it wasnt the kind of thing a noncom was supposed to do with an officer it was though the kind of thing an older man might naturally do with a younger one he liked there you go sir i shouldve known youd come out with something like that well what else do you expect me to say if hansulrich sounded irritable it was only because he was he was a falcon fly him at something and hed kill it for you what it was didnt matter as long as you wanted it dead he didnt think of himself in those terms of course but then chances were a true winged taloned falcon didnt think of itself in those terms either not a thing sir not a goddamn thing dieselhorst paused perhaps wondering whether to go on after a few seconds he did if the froggies screw us over weve got a twofront war for real god forbid rudel burst out that had been the nightmare in the last fight one that germany hadnt had to face this time around if she did well the war got harder god wont forbid it god doesnt work that way dieselhorst spoke about god with as much assurance and conviction as hansulrichs father ever had he went on people are going to have to take care of it one way or another itll be people it always is he sketched a salute and ambled off no one not even a national socialist loyalty officer could have made anything of the conversation if he didnt overhear it theyd been flying together since the start of the war more than three years now of course theyd have things to talk about if france went bad the luftwaffe would have to fight back out of germany itself well out of the low countries too but all that seemed small consolation for so much fighting so much treasure so much blood and if france let england back onto the continent while the war against the russians ground on that could be very bad hansulrich didnt need to be a general staff officer to see as much two days later he got up the nerve to ask colonel steinbrenner sir just how loyal are the french the squadron commander blinked et tu brute he said sir he might as well have been speaking latin after a moment hansulrich realized he was sighing steinbrenner dropped back into plain old deutsch so youve heard the rumors too have you rudel also realized that if he had odds were everybody else in the squadron had been buzzing about them this past fortnight or maybe longer there was an encouraging thought not even winning the knights cross had made him less of a white crow yes sir ive heard them he mumbled well now that you have you know as much as i do steinbrenner said if they turn out to be true weve got some new troubles if they dont weve got our old lot any other questions what came out of hansulrichs mouth then surprised him can i get a little bit of leave sir long enough to go back to bialystok if things turn bad id like to have the chance to say goodbye to sofia you know you ask so few favors it makes me nervous sometimes steinbrenner said yes ill give you leave what you do with it is your business not mine enjoy yourself though thank you very much sir hansulrich stiffened to attention and saluted colonel steinbrenners answer was more a wave than a salute but that was a superiors privilege three days later hansulrich was back in poland it was snowing in bialystok too he didnt feel so cold there though the tavern where sofia worked wasnt far from the train station german and polish soldiers crowded the place drinking as if they didnt want to think about tomorrowand they probably didnt the bartender stuck his head into the back room and shouted something in polish that had sofias name in it she came out a moment later trim and neat as always the bartender pointed toward hansulrich who sat at a small table against the wall she walked over to him you again so they havent shot you down yet as a matter of fact they did but i managed to bail out he answered which sobered her he went on bring me a coffee will you youll make us rich she exclaimed snippy as ever her pleated skirt swished around her legs as she went off to get it when she set italmost slammed itdown on the tabletop hansulrich said i dont know how much longer ill be able to keep coming back here were liable to get transferred he didnt say anything about the possibility of flying from germany again let her think he was going to the ukraine or something he assumed she was no spy but he took no chances he waited for one of her patented zingers to come back at him she surprised him by gnawing at her lower lip and not saying anything for a little while finally she murmured well it was fun while it lasted wasnt it its not over yet he said quickly you want to lay me some more you mean that sounded like her all right he quirked an eyebrow youd be amazed its been more fun than i ever figured it could be so maybe youll get another chance she said maybeif you wait like a good boy till i come off my shift he clasped his hands on the table in front of him as if he were eight years old and sitting at a school desk laughing sofia swirled away again carlos federico weinberg yowled lustily in chaims arms the baby had la martellitas blueblack haira startling amount of it when so many little tiny guys were bald telling who newborn babies looked like was a mugs gamethey mostly looked squashed chaim hoped this one would end up taking after its mother carlos screwed up his face and started to cry hey im not that ugly chaim said first in english and then in spanish la martellita rolled her eyes she hardly ever thought his jokes were funny give him to me hes hungry she said when he cries like that thats what he means chaim handed her his son she handled the baby with practiced efficiency where he was as careful as if he were taking a detonator out of a land mine as soon as he settled carlos in the crook of her left arm she unbuttoned her blouse and gave the baby her breast she saw chaim eyeing her he could no more help it than he could help breathing theyre for this too they were for this before they were for men to stare at she said pointedly i guess so chaim didnt want to argue with her he just wanted to keep looking were womens tits really for milking before they were for ogling if men didnt admire them and grab them and lick them and suck at them how many babies would get born to nurse from them not many by god it was like the chicken and the egg only a hell of a lot more fun to think about if he brought it back to the abe lincolns theyd argue about it for days if not for weeks it was more interesting than what the lousy nationalists were liable to try next no two ways about it deftly la martellita switched carlos from one side to the other he ate like a pig if he didnt know when he had a good thing going he was no son of chaims when she put him up on her shoulder and patted his back he belched as if hed been drinking cocacola instead of milk she reached a finger inside his diaper wet again she said resignedly and set about fixing that chaim would have been afraid hed stick the kid with a pin la martellita wasnt and she didnt carlos wasnt circumcised chaim had never seen a spaniard who was he felt a pang of tradition flouted jews had had that covenant with god for thousands of years never mind that the top of chaims mind made a point of not believing in god he felt the pang even so he didnt say anything about it if he were going to take carlos and la martellita back to the states he might have but theyd stay in spain carlos would have to fit in as best he could a funnylooking cock wouldnt help he tried something less likely to cause trouble thanks for letting me visit you thanks for letting me see my son technically they remained man and wife she hadnt divorced him yet having a baby probably kept you too busy to worry about something you could take care of any old time he knew too well the writing was on the wall she nodded as she started rocking carlos in her arms the babys yawn showed off pink toothless gums his little crib only cramped her tiny flat even more its all right she said you arent the best communist ever but its not like youd go over to the other side she really did think that way not whether he was a good guy not whether hed make a good father but how good a communist he was chaim admired such dedication without sharing it he would have wanted to jump on her adorably padded bones if she were marshal sanjurjos mistress hell he would have wanted to jump on her bones if she headed up sanjurjos general staff she hummed a lullaby to ease carlos down into sleep chaim thought the tune sounded oddly familiar was it one american mothers used too then he recognized it and started to laugh now what la martellita asked after making sure his silly noises hadnt bothered the baby nothingi suppose but how many kids go nightynight to the internationale and why shouldnt he la martellita would have bristled more but she was easing carlos down into the crib he made a little noise as she slid her arm free but only a little one then he kind of sighed and went on sleeping no reason at all chaim said it did surprise me though a soft answer turned away wrath sometimes when la martellita didnt feel the overwhelming urge to rip somebody a new asshole chaim braced himself for tsuris it didnt come instead la martellita sat down on the edge of the narrow bed where carlos had got started a sigh whistled out of her you have no idea how tired i am she said actually chaim thought he did la martellita had done a lot for the republic and the revolution but he didnt believe shed ever fought in the line when you spent most of a week on a couple of hours worth of snatched catnaps some battles petered out just because both sides got too goddamn exhausted to keep going any more but if for once she didnt feel like squabbling chaim wouldnt go out of his way to provoke her all he said was i know raising kids isnt easy la martellita nodded it would be harder still if id had to invent a last name for carlos or if he had to do without one im glad to give him mine chaim said fearing he knew what was coming next ill bet you are la martellita smiled cynically you got the fun that goes along with being married got past tense chaims spanish wasnt perfectnowhere closebut he understood that all right he felt as if he were defending the ebro again back in the days before england and france went to war with germany not much hope but he was damned if hed retreat bits of it he said when i could come back into madrid and if you didnt have some fun with me you ought to be in the movies on account of you sure acted like it she flushed hed managed to hit a nerve even if that was all hed managed there were moments she admitted there could be more chaim wanted like anything to sound debonair and suave he had the bad feeling he seemed horny and desperate instead well he wasboth no its over la martellita by contrast sounded altogether sure of herself when didnt she dammit i have gone to the palace of justice to register the dissolution of our marriage in the republic that was all you needed to do very simple very clean very civilized aw shit chaim said in english hed known all along it was coming that should have made it easier when it got here somehow it didnt la martellita didnt speak english he translated for her mierda i dont mind if you want to keep seeing the baby she saidshe really was trying to be civilized but she didnt go on or need to if he tried to touch her again hed leave without his cojones shit he said again no it didnt hurt any less more if anything he got to his feet take care of yourself querida you could do worse than me he couldnt help a little vinegar and i bet you do my worry not yours la martellita looked toward the door out chaim went he headed for the bar a few blocks away the one from which hed taken her on the night they started carlos he brawled with a guy half again his size and left him moaning and bloody on the floor el narigon loco the crazy kikewas on the loose again vaclav jezek listened to the impassioned yiddish pouring out of the american international the czech guessed he was getting maybe two words out of three that was plenty to understand what was wrong with the other guy women he said in his own slow clumsy german when the american finally paused for breath nothing better than a woman to drive a man nuts he hadnt cared about any one woman since he had to leave czechoslovakia when he got the urge he went to a whorehouse and laid his money down it was easy and quick if it didnt give him everything he might have wanted well what did especially in wartime man you got that right chaim said i never thought id get this one to begin with to get her and then to lose her like thatits a bastard and a half you had her for a while thats better than not having her at all vaclav said is it i fucking wonder the american replied was it wasnt it vaclav was trying for sympathy not philosophy he didnt know he didnt think anybody could know and right now it wasnt his worry any which way he unbuttoned his breast pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes here have one of these thanks youre a mensh you know chaim had an american lighter he fueled with brandy these days its blue flame was almost invisible but lit his cigarette and one for vaclav they smoked together and both stashed their tiny butts in tobacco poucheswaste not want not chaim went on that was good not as good as pussy but good you do what you can vaclav answered with a shrug yeah and when you cant you dont the international reached out to touch the long barrel of vaclavs antitank rifle i hope you do pal i hope you blow that cocksucker sanjurjos head from here to bilbao you know you do what you can jezek repeated people kept telling him to finish off the nationalist leader nobody told him how though wait till he shows up then shoot him that was what it boiled down to if it were so easy by now sanjurjo would have as many holes in him as a colander but only another sniper would understand that or maybe not you can do it chaim said honest to god you can that big bertha you carry it can reach farther than those nationalist tukhuslekhers really imagine if he shows up ill try vaclav didnt know how many times hed said that since reaching the madrid front kill him if you cant fuck killings the next best thing chaim thumped him on the back and mooched away vaclav scratched his head he didnt get any kind of charge from shooting fascist officers the most he took from it was an artisans satisfaction at a difficult job done well some people had other ideas though trenches got muddy in fall rain made them even less livable than they were when it was dry rain also made sniping with the elephant gun harder yes you could still kill somebody two kilometers away rain didnt bother bullets a bit but if you couldnt see anybody two kilometers away how were you supposed to kill him vaclav still went out to one hideyhole or another between the republican lines and those of the nationalists if he had more trouble finding targets the enemy would have more trouble finding him sometimes he would come back after dark without firing a shot better not to fire if you couldnt do anything worthwhile he told himself as much over and over again it was frustrating all the same dont worry about it benjamin halevy said after he blew off steam in the jews ear easy for you to say jezek snarled probably by refusing to take offense halevy only annoyed him more but you arent obliged to get yourself killed by being stupid youve lived through another day maybe the chances tomorrow will look better as long as youre still here you can find out well vaclav looked at that from every angle trying to get angry at it try as he would he couldnt do you have to be so sensible all the goddamn time im sorry ill do my best not to let it happen again halevy said vaclav wondered if jews were usually that way then he thought about chaim the american whatever else you could say about him sensible he was not jews probably differed as much from one another as anybody else from where vaclav had started before the war that made a pretty fair leap of tolerance and understanding it started raining harder halevy had a shelter half he draped it over his shoulder for a poncho i hate winter in the field you know he said tell me about it vaclavs shelter half dated back to the czechoslovakian army he shrugged it on too but wondered why he bothered even as he did it a lot of the rubberized fabric once coating it was long gone that meant it let in water just like any other piece of cloth next time we fight a war lets do it in panama or the belgian congo or somewhere like that he named the places he could think of that were least likely to be afflicted with winter there you go benjamin halevy nodded good to see youve got it all figured out my ass if i had it all figured out id be lying on the beach on the riviera or somewhere like that next to a girl with hardly any clothes and even less in the way of morals sounds good to me halevy said as a jew in the french army he could have left the service when france threw in with the nazis had he headed down to the riviera he could have found a girl like that from everything vaclav had seen france was full of them but halevy chose to come to spain and leave his life on the line when you looked at him like that who said he was so goddamn sensible like animals they both curled up and got what sleep they could vaclav woke before dawnagain like an animal he gnawed on garlicky sausage and hard bread then went out into nomansland there were ways through the wire if you knew them vaclav didhed made some of them what was left of a smashed house out there didnt offer a whole lot of cover but vaclav didnt need much most important were concealing the outline of his helmet and making sure the nationalists couldnt spot the antitank rifles long barrel the ruins let him do both well enough he draped the shelter half over the big guns telescopic sight keeping it dry mattered more than keeping his carcass that way war was at least as much about tools as about the men who wielded them as dawn poured thin gray light over the landscape jezek suddenly jerked as if a scorpion had stung him that was a summertime worry here but not in weather like this the nationalist soldier crawling toward this wreckage however was hed fixed bushes to his nazistyle helmet with a strip of inner tube a trick vaclav also used and his rifle had a telescopic sight so he was probably a sniper on his way out to see what harm he could do the republicans but hed had a mild case of manana the common spanish ailment hed had it and hed never get over it jezek shifted the elephant guns barrel so the massive piece bore on the oncoming spaniards track at less than a hundred meters he hardly needed the sight he used it though he didnt want to miss when he fired the gun almost took his shoulder off as it always did the spaniard sank down like a punctured tire he twitched a few times even after a hit from a round that could pierce three centimeters of hardened armor plate human beings were damned hard to kill vaclav chambered another round just in case he quickly decided he wouldnt need it he thought about crawling over and getting the enemy snipers rifle it would be a good weapon to bring back not while its light out he thought somebody might be watching after darkness would be time enough you had to be patient if you were going to play this game another trip out of town to raise funds for the war effortand on the side for the democratic party peggy druce was more relieved than not to get out of philadelphia she never would have felt that way before she went to europe it wasnt her fault she understood that it wasnt herbs fault either it wasnt anybodys fault it was just one of the things that happened when two people even two people who loved each other a lot got separated from each other for years at a time maybe things would get better pretty soon peggy kept hoping so she had no doubt herb did too till they did sometimes she was just more comfortable when she didnt feel that mild awkwardness that slight constraint while she was in the same room as her husband carbondale was north and east of scranton not very far from the border with new york it was exactly what its name declared it to be a coal town one of perhaps people most of them were welsh and irishthe primarily slavic mining towns lay farther west as their ancestors had since the early nineteenth century the breadwinners went down under the ground to grub out anthracite us highway the main drag twisted like a snake with a bellyache what peggy could see of where people actually lived looked to be on the grim side even so the man who met her at the train stationa plump druggist named vernon vaughanhad his own smallscale civic pride carbondales come through the depression better than a lot of places he declared watery sunlight glinting off the silver rims of his bifocals the mines always stayed open they had to cut back some but they didnt shut down most people had some money most of the time that meant the merchants didnt go under either good for you peggy said and she meant it plenty of towns carbondales size all across the country might as well have closed up shop for good after the market crashed in since she was here on business she felt she had to add i hope that means youll reach for your wallets when it comes time to buy your war bonds well i figure we will vaughans double chin wobbled when he nodded people here are proud to be americans they work hard sure but they know theyre better off than they would be if greatgrandpa stayed in the old country the irish now they got out cause greatgrandpa was starving my folks didnt have it quite so bad not from the stories ive heard anyway but i went over there in and i was proud to do it good for you peggy said again my husband was the same way she didnt tell him that she and herb had lived more than comfortably enough even when the country hurt worst she didnt tell him shed had enough money to stay in europe for a couple of years either the way things worked out she wished shed never boarded the liner to begin with there you go vaughan said let me grab your overnight bag there and ill take you to your hotel its only two three blocks away and the rotarians hall where youll talk is right next door that all sounds great peggy said again most sincerely some places were better organized some not so well vernon vaughan seemed to have things under control the hotel would never make anyone forget the ritz carlton but it would do shed stayed in plenty of worse places on the other side of the atlantic she didnt have to trot down the hall to the bathroom for instance and she wouldnt have to scramble for the shelter when airraid sirens started shrieking she talked about that when she went next door to speak theyre still having airraid alerts on the west coast though she said we have to make sure no enemy can ever strike at us at home not ever when i was in europe i saw for myself how horrible that was people applauded her then but they sat on their hands when she talked about helping england now that she was back in the fight against germany carbondale wasnt the ideal place for that line even if she realized as much half a minute later than she should have what had vernon vaughan said the town was full of irish and welsh and why had their ancestors crossed the ocean to get out from under their english landlords and overlords time to adlib then you may not love england she said but if you think hitlers a better bargain im here to tell you youre out of your everloving minds if you get on englands bad side shell break you if she can if you get on hitlers bad side hell kill youand as many of your friends and neighbors as he can catch to make sure they dont get any nasty ideas like freedom on their own that drew a little handclapping but not much peggy went back to laying into japan sooner or later she expected there would be a reckoning with the nazis but it would probably have to be later people like the ones in the rotarian hall here showed why fdr couldnt go and declare war on germany if old adolf had declared war on america now well it hadnt happened the best thing the usa could do now against the evil day was strengthen herself as much as she could if that meant whipping up hatred against the japs okay shed whip it up we were fighting them after all and we werent doing any too well against them right this minute either show your hearts with the red white and blue she finished everybody talks about being a patriot but patriotism takes more than talk put your money where your mouth is folks you cant fight a war with nothing but talk i wish you could but you cant it takes cash too she hadnt expected much this wasnt a big city or even a mediumsized one and welshmen at least had almost the same kind of name for stinginess as jews but she did great the bonds the men of carbondale bought wouldnt mature for years washington could spend the greenbacks they forked over right now both sides seemed to think it was a good bargain afterward mr vaughan took her to dinner at an italian place down the street the tablecloths were red and white checks there was a poster of a venetian gondolier on one wall and of the leaning tower of pisa on another despite the cliches the spaghetti and meatballs were fine peggy could see the cook he looked more like a mick than a wop but he knew what he was doing and he had the advantage of american abundance with plenty of food and plenty of fuel if you screwed up the food it was your own damn fault not that of your ingredients the way it might be in screwedup europe as they ate and drank red wine vaughan did his best to put a move on her peggy pretended not to notice he wasnt her typenot even close still and all getting noticed that way felt good it reminded her she was alive it wasnt that herb never acted interested even so well the druggist put a fin on the table which made him an extravagant tipper he climbed to his feet let me walk you back to the hotel thanks two glasses of ordinary chianti didnt make peggy susceptible she was more amused that he kept pitching than anything else she had no trouble shedding him in the hotel lobby that behind the front desk stood a large strongjawed maiden lady who plainly disapproved of everything enjoyable under the sun only made it easier up in her room all by herself she pulled out a mystery story and read till she got sleepy what with the wine and all that filling food it didnt take long vernon vaughan wouldnt have had much fun with her even if he had got past the dragon downstairsnot unless he enjoyed necrophilia he wouldnt he was there to take her back to the station the next morning sorry if i got out of line last night he said dont worry about it peggy told him im heading home thats all so she was and before long shed look forward to getting out into the boondocks again how smart had she been to ignore him then that she could wonder said not everything in philadelphia was the way she wished it would be chapter narvik again julius lemp was not a happy man namsos would have been better wilhelmshaven would have been wonderful but it was narvik so the u could get back up to the barents sea as soon as possible more fuel for the diesels more eels for the tubes more food for the crew and away theyd go again hed already complained to the powers that be here about narviks shortcomings as a liberty port his crew had already tried to take the place apartand they werent the only gang of uboat sailors to join the rising against authority predictably authority didnt forget when the u tied up she was greeted at the pier by a squad of shore patrolmen all of them wearing stahlhelms and all of them carrying schmeissers well this is a fine crock of herrings lemp growled at the chief petty officer in charge of the squad youd think wed put in at aberdeen by mistake he shook his head no by god the royal navyd give us a better hello than this to hell with me if it wouldnt the steel helmets beetling brim only made the cpos features seem even more wooden than they would have otherwise he saluted stiffly sir i have my orders he said no one is going to tear narvik up againthats what the people here have in mind daylight was already leaking out of the sky though it was only midafternoon before long arctic night would fall narvik lay north of the arctic circle disgraceful lemp snarled sir if you didnt lead such a pack of hooligans there wouldnt be a problem the shore patrolman answered in a gruff monotone if this place werent a morgue but lemp could see this was an argument hed lose the shore patrol didnt just have the firepower the bastards had the backing of the bigger bastards here the ones with all the gold stripes on their sleeves his crewmen had been glaring at their natural foes they reminded him of cats snarling at sheep dogs then one of them tipped him a wink did that mean theyd stay out of trouble or that theyd dive into it headfirst lemp didnt know not for sure but he was afraid he could guess he let the shore patrolmen lead the uboat sailors off to whatever passed for fun in narvik then the mechanics fell on his submarine he was glad to see them unlike either the high command or the shore patrol they seemed to be on the same side as the men who actually did the fighting he thought about staying away from the officers club in sympathy for the way his men were being treated he didnt think about it long though the alternative was staying cooped up in his tiny curtainedoff cabin in the stinking claustrophobic pressure hull he did make a point of repairing to the club in his grimy working togs instead of putting on a proper uniform no one there said a word about it though the shorebound officers were evidently used to uboat skippers eccentric ways those shorebound men did let him know that plans actually were in the works for an officers brothel and one ratings could patronize as well that plans were in the works didnt mean the brothels were working yet lemp thought that was a damn shame he was a few years older than the men he commanded he didnt burn quite so hot as most of them but that didnt mean he didnt burn at all oh nonowhere close he would have welcomed a grapple with a nice warm girl even if it was purely a business transaction since he couldnt screw he drank hed got to the bottom of his third stiff schnapps hoping they would improve his attitude all they succeeded in doing was making him dizzy they were strong and he was tired they hit him hard only later did he stop and wonder what would happen when the us ratings started drinking that was when he remembered the one sailors wink as such things have a way of being that was also just exactly too late a burst of submachinegun fire brought silence smashing down in the officers club a moment later another burst rang out good god somebody said have the royal marines landed or what there was a cheerful thought if english raiders were swooping down on narvik they could do a hell of a lot of damage most of the german forces here belonged to the kriegsmarine the only reason they were here at all was to go after convoys bound for russia shore patrolmen wouldnt stand much of a chance against coldblooded professionals one of those shore patrolmen rushed into the officers club he looked around wildly before his gaze fixed on lemp come quick he shouted before those maniacs of yours tear this whole base to shreds just what it deserves lemp thought the words almost came outsuch were the dangers of three strong drinks but he managed to stifle them instead he said if they had more ways to blow off steam without getting in trouble theyd do that they wouldnt brawl theyre a pack of criminals nothing else but the shore patrolman retorted if you dont calm them down theyll get courtsmartial for making a mutiny thats a capital crime by the way he spoke he thought the us men deserved no better than a blindfold and a cigarette take me to them lemp said he had to pay close attention to where he put his feet when he followed the shore patrolman out of the officers club it was cold outside cold and dark the northern lights wavering curtains danced in the sky now red now gold lemp spared the aurora a glance no more it wasnt as if he didnt see it on a lot of frigid winter nights he could have found the fighting without his guide men were yelling and screaming whistles blew frantically things brokeoften by the sound of it over somebodys head two shore patrolmen dragged a wounded buddy from the fray making a mutiny the man with lemp repeated grimly theyre just drunk and disorderly and they hate this miserable place the uboat skipper answered hoping he was right if the lads had got the bit too far between their teeth theyd be in big trouble in spite of anything he could do to try to convince himself things were as he wanted them to be he added i do too who wouldnt you werent smashing up the officers club when i found you though sir the shore patrolman said lemp judged a discreet silence the best response to that from out of the gloom ahead came a shout halt who comes friend or foe it wasnt the kind of challenge the shore patrol would issue not only that lemp recognized the voice of the rating doing the shouting its me willithe skipper he called back playtimes over you boys have had your funand youve made your point too he waited if willi and the other sailors rejected his authority they really were on their way to military courts and the brig if not worse several men up there argued back and forth when the chain of command broke you had to figure out who had authority at last willi said well come ahead sir you can help us pick up the pieces enough is enough lemp said as he advanced trying to pour oil on troubled waters enough is too much the shore patrolman beside him put in trying to make a bad situation worse lemp contrived to step on the mans foot as had been true the last time things went arseyvarsey not all the brawling sailors came from the u but the rioters had done a more thorough job of tearing narvik to pieces this time around they werent brawling for the fun of it they were brawling because they were furious about what passed for a base up here in the frozen north lemp did sympathize but he had to hope very hard that they hadnt got themselves in too deep if you give it up now you probably wont land in too much trouble youre good fighting men and the reich needs you for the war effort he told them but if you push it even a centimeter further theyll land on you hard you havent just pissed them off this time youve scared them and thats worse they treat us like shit when we come in from a patrol theyd better be scared growled a sailor from another uboat but the fight had gone out of the men theyd made their point there wasnt much else they could do not here at the frigid end of nowhere they gave it up lemp headed back toward the officers club hoping the argument hed used with the sailors would also work on their superiorsand his hideki fujita loved being a sergeant again he was meant to have two stars on each collar tabhe thought so anyhow and unit was a much smaller outfit than unit had been that made him seem a much bigger frog unit was also a much less experimental place than unit had been here they went out and did things that suited fujita fine too he was no big brain and knew he never would be but when somebody pointed him at a job he would take care of it not only that he had a knack for getting the most out of the men under him hed knock them around when they deserved it but he didnt give them bruises for no better reason than to show his cock was bigger than theirs as long as they hopped to it they didnt need to worry about him they went on spreading disease through yunnan province if the chinese died from the plague and from cholera they wouldnt be able to do so much with the military equipment england sent them even more to the point if the chinese feared they would die from those dreadful diseases their panic helped japan at least as much as real illness would major hataba assembled the men in the unit to say we have received an official commendation from the imperial war ministry in tokyo for our contributions to victory in china banzai for the emperor banzai the soldiers shouted fujita loud among them banzai hataba did not remind the men of unit that hed also wanted to use bacteria against the english in india no doubt he was doing his very best to forget all about that fujita remembered it but not very often it hadnt happened so it didnt matter everyone was better off not remembering a plan that hadnt come to fruition it wasnt as if the japanese didnt have other things to think about fujita came from hiroshima in the south winters in mongolia siberia and manchukuo had left him horrified and amazed what was alleged to be the approach of winter in burma left him horrified and amazed too but not the same way eee he said to another sergeant they were drinking warm beer together there was no other kind of beer to drink i thought i knew everything there was to know about hot sticky weather but this makes the worst august in hiroshima feel like february hai the other man nodded his name was ichiro hirabayashi he was a career noncom hed spent his whole adult life in the imperial army nothing seemed to faze him much your clothes rot your boots rot you start to rot too ive learned more about ringworm and jock itch and athletes foot and all that crap than i ever wanted to know since i got here you arent the only one fujita said dolefully i had jock itch so bad i thought id got a dose from one of the comfort women in myitkina hirabayashi laughed at that fujita didnt think it was so funny a medical assistant had given him some nastysmelling ointment to smear on his privates it helped some it wasnt a cure though he still itched in all kinds of places where he couldnt scratch without being crude the other sergeant drank more beer in reflective tones he said i hate this miserable place you know i hate the weather i hate the rot i hate the bugs i hate the sicknesses i hate the burmese too whats wrong with the burmese fujita asked he could see why sergeant hirabayashi hated everything else about burma theyre lazy theyre shiftless theyre thieving they dont talk any language a civilized man can understand hirabayashi spoke with great conviction a british colonial administrator pouring down gin and tonics in mandalay a year earlier might have said the same thing even if he would have said it in english rather than japanese well besides that fujita said he set hirabayashi laughing again youre a funny fellow arent you the older man said thats good you get up into burmas asshole the way we are and theres not a hell of a lot to laugh about its war shigata ga nai neh fujita said sergeant hirabayashi nodded no you cant do a damn thing about itexcept drink when you get the chance he suited action to word so did fujita who said one good thing anyhow at least the raf doesnt bomb us here when i fought the russians in siberia they were always trying to drop stuff on our heads that wasnt a whole lot of fun cant say i miss it all right theres something hirabayashi admitted but ill tell you its not much i wont argue fujita poured himself another mug of beer and downed it and then another one after that he woke the next morning with a headache that pounded behind his eyes like a piledriver strong tea did next to nothing to fix it one more mug of beer helped some the headache dulled even if it didnt disappear shouting at conscript privates let him work off more of his discomfort he wasnt especially proud to remember that the next day but consoled himself with the thought that he hadnt slugged anybody odds were sergeant hirabayashi wouldnt have been so fussy noncoms like hirabayashi would have led japanese troops into action in the sinojapanese and russojapanese wars back in samurai days men like him would have been loyal retainers to their overlords even if they wouldnt have worn collar tabs back then if i stay in the army as long as he has will i end up like that fujita wondered he didnt want to be a career noncom he wanted to go back to the family farm and spend the rest of his days there if he never saw another rifle or another porcelain bomb casing full of germs that suited him fine no matter what he wanted though the army wouldnt turn him loose till the war ended if it ever ended and even after he escaped its clutches he sometimes wondered uneasily how he would fit down on the farm he wasnt the person he had been before conscription got him he was harder tougher less patient hed seen more of the world than hed even imagined while he was still a civilian he didnt like a lot of what hed seen but that wasnt the point the point was his horizons had broadened a farm off in the middle of nowhere was likely to seem a farm off in the middle of nowhere not an unquestioned home for the rest of his life he didnt know what he could do about that no actually he did know he couldnt do anything about it now that hed seen the wider world he couldnt very well forget about it even if he wished he could his father had carried a rifle in the russojapanese war had he felt some of the same thing after he came home again if he had hed managed to stifle it or maybe hed just never talked about it with his family he must have realized they wouldnt understand i do now fujita thought young men all over japan would understand after the war the country would be different then because theyd changed how it would be different fujita wasnt sure but it would be of course not all of japans young men in uniform would go home again fujita wasnt thinking about the ones who would die in battle their spirits would return to the home islands to live forever at the yasukuni shrine but after the war was done how many soldiers would japan need to protect her conquests in china and russia and the pacific islands and southeast asia and the east indies did japan have that many soldiers could she maintain them without ruining herself fujita was tempted to laugh at himself how could he know when he was just an ignorant peasant bumped up to sergeant he was surprised even the question had occurred to him then he wondered if it had occurred to the people who were supposed to worry about such things that though was another kind of question altogether sarah bruck soon settled into the routine of marriage and of bakery work if not much time seemed available for romance well she was usually too busy to miss it and romance during wartime at least for a jew in the reich was a pallid harried thing to begin with she did eat better than she had when she was living with her parents but when she wasnt too tired she missed the talk at their house all the brucks ever talked about was baking sarah treasured the weekend visits she and isidor made she was glad they intrigued her husband too he sensed a wider deeper world there than the one he was used to at home she didnt treasure the air raids as nights got longer the raf came over germany more and more often munster in the far northwest near the dutch border took more than its share of pounding it lay within easy range of england and bombers didnt need to fly through french airspace to reach it sarah could have done without the honor fear iced through her every time the sirens screams jerked her headlong out of sleep the brucks had no proper shelter to go to no more than her parents or any other german jews did theyand sarahhuddled downstairs between their shop counter and the ovens that gave them some protection if a bomb hit above them if one blew up in the street outside though she resolutely refused to worry about that if it happened odds were shed be too dead to do any more worrying anyhow her father gave forth with a gravediggers good cheer when she and isidor visited after a raid here for a while i thought they were going to throw me off the labor gang for lack of work samuel goldman said his eyes twinkling even though he had dark bags under them but weve had plenty to do lately ill bet you have sarah exclaimed its been terrible an awful lot of houses knocked to smithereens isidor agreed well so there are sarahs father didnt sound so cheery when he said that he paused to light a cigarette for a moment sarah took that for grantedbut only for a moment he didnt roll the smoke himself with newspaper for a wrapper and tobacco scrounged from other peoples dogends no this one was machinemade whole and new seeing her stare he nodded we clear the wreckage you know whatever we find that we can carry away we keep im not what youd call proud of it but i do it just like everybody else good for you isidor answered before sarah could if thats the only choice youve got you have to take it thats what i tell myself samuel goldman nodded again i scavenged the same way in the trenches when we went forward the french and the tommies always had so much more than we did we ate better after every advance mother and i are eating a little better now too but it feels different when youre scavenging from the neighbors not the enemy what else can you do sarah asked sympathetically i could do nothing then wed starve this is betteri suppose fathers cheeks hollowed as he sucked in smoke he looked up toward the ceiling or maybe toward whatever lay a mile beyond the moon as he continued a lot of the time were the ones who pull the bodies out of the rubble too i didnt mind bodies much you know when they wore horizonblue or khaki i even got used to bodies in feldgrau lord knows we saw enough of them but bodies in pajamas or nightgowns thats a lot harder sarah and isidor looked at each other neither of them seemed to know what to say to that at last sarah asked have you found anyone you know uh i guess i mean knew im afraid so he said you remember friedrich lauterbach sure he studied under you hes in the wehrmacht now isnt he sarah left it there had the world gone down a different path she might have been more likely to marry him than the husband she had now hed stayed decent even after the nazis took over getting father money for writing articles that would see print under his byline rather than a jews sarah hoped he hadnt stopped anything her father nodded thats the fellow his older brother was a doctor here was he repeated the past tense something in the way his jaw set made sarah fight shy of asking just what had happened to the luckless dr lauterbach isidor yawned im sorry but i dont think well stay very late he said you have air raids two or three days in a row you get so sleepy you cant see straight thats the truth sarahs mother exclaimed she hadnt had much to say till then and the horrible ersatz coffee and tea you can get nowadays dont have any kick in them at all everybody nodded at that people grumbled about it all the time they make pills for pilots and other people whove got to stay awake father said not the stuff that goes into coffee but the real strong stuff benzedrine and the like plenty of times ive wished i could get my hands on some of those i could use them believe me who couldnt isidor said dr whatshisnamelauterbachdidnt have any at his house if he did somebody else beat me to them what can you do samuel goldman spread his hands sarah remembered when they were soft and smooth and impeccably manicured with only a writers callus on one middle finger now they were scarred and battered with filthy nails and with hard yellowed ridges across the palms well her own hands were a lot harder than they had been too she and isidor got back to the flat over the bakery well before curfew in lieu of benzedrine pills they went to bed early sarah thought she could sleep the clock around if she got the chance tired by bad food and nighttime air raids she wanted to hibernate like a dormouse she didnt get the chance that night the raf came over again a little before midnight the sirens wailed like damned souls sarah and isidor and the older brucks did some heartfelt damning of their own as they stumbled down the stairs in darkness absolute then the bombs whistled down as soon as sarah heard them her terror redoubled they sounded louder and closer than they ever had before she tried to burrow into the floor when they started going off it sounded as if one hit right across the street the window in the front of the bakery had survived the whole war it didnt survive this it fell in on itself with a tinkling crash scheisse isidors father said loudly and then i beg your pardon dont worry about it sarah said as the building shook from other hits only a little farther away now she understood why her own father still sometimes called bomber pilots air pirates even though the name came straight out of dr goebbels propaganda ministry if they were trying to kill you they werent your friends after fortyfive eternal minutes the bombers droned away that was awful isidor said sarah couldnt have put it better herself she shivered not just from fear but also because the shattered front window was letting in cold air it was letting in light too the grocery across the street was on fire isidors father started to go out to see if he could help stepping on broken glass made him change his mind in a hurry there wasnt much water pressure when a fire engine finally clanged up what had the bombs done to the pipes under munster nothing goodthat was plain firemen in what looked like stahlhelms with crests did the best they could with what they had hes going to lose everything david bruck said gloomily i just hope hes alive hes a goy but hes a mensh the two shops have been across the street from each other as long as i can remember its terrible sarah said its worse than that her fatherinlaw answered for him and for us i know i wont be able to get glass to fix that window heaven only knows if theyll even give me wood scraps ive got to have something or people will just come in and steal how am i supposed to stay in business when sarah decided to marry isidor shed figured that getting into a bakers family would at least mean she had enough to eat now even that wasnt obvious any more she suddenly hated the raf almost as if she were a genuine german after all anastas mouradian lay in his tent trying to sleep he had his flying suit of fur and leather and long underwear below it he had two thick scratchy woolen blankets he had a cot that kept him off the ground the tent itself held off the worst of the wind he was miserably cold even so russian infantrymen learned to sleep in the snow shrouded by no more than their uniform and greatcoat stas was no foot soldier he was a flyer he was no russian either he knew what good weather was all about when it got this frigid his teeth chattered like castanets then the tent flap flew open a blast of air straight from the north pole rushed inside so did a human shapeno more than a lumpy outline in the darkness what the devil stas said groping for his service pistol youve got to hide me the voice was familiar stas stopped feeling for the automatic what do you mean hide you ivan hide you from whom he asked having learned russian as a second language he was often more precise in his grammar than men whod spoken it from birth but ivan kulkaanen wasnt a native russianspeaker either hide me from the chekists theyre after me the karelians voice wasnt just familiar it was desperate he panted like a hunted animal worn down after a long chase now the ice that ran up mouradians back had nothing to do with the arctic air rapidly filling the tent bozhemoi he burst out what did you do what do they think you did the questions were related but not necessarily identical and the second was the one that really mattered if the nkvd decided youd done something you might as well have because theyd hang it on you anyway i wrote in a letter to my cousin that the war wasnt going as well as it ought to be kulkaanen answered miserably bozhemoi stas repeated this time his tone was hopeless you wrote that he didnt ask how could you be such an idiot it had already occurred to him that his copilot and bombaimer might be playing a part the nkvd might be building a case against him and using kulkaanen as a provocateur it struck him as unlikelyif the chekists wanted you more often than not they just grabbed youbut it was possible i wrote it ivan agreed i wrote it in finnish i didnt think theyd ever be able to read it but they did and im fucked karelia lay in the far north next to the finnish border a lot of finns thought it belonged to them by rights not least because the only differences between finns and karelians were the names and where they happened to live of course the nkvd would have men who read finnish just as the chekists had men who read armenian and georgian hell stalin could do that and azerbaijani and kazakh and lithuanian and every other language under the soviet sun the nkvd probably had men who read sanskrit for christs sake hey you never could tell when a professor of the ancient languages of india might turn wrecker on you hide me kulkaanen said again even more urgently than before if i can count on anybody its you there was a compliment stas appreciatedand one he could have done without hide you where he asked doing his best to sound like the voice of sweet reason what do you want me to do with you ivan stick you in my back pocket kulkaanen was both taller and thicker through the shoulders than he was himself theres got to be somewhere the karelian said under my cot maybe that should fool the nkvd for a good second and a halftwo if youre lucky stas said kulkaanen groaned im fucked he said once more an observation all too likely to be accurate with yet another groanor maybe this one was better called a moanhe fled out into the night stas felt like groaning and moaning too now he didnt have to worry about whether the cold would keep him awake adrenaline would handle the job just fine he lay there trying without much luck to relax heart thuttering in his throat he didnt get to lie there long not fifteen minutes after ivan kulkaanen disappeared someone shone an electric torch full in his face and shouted answer in the name of the soviet union stas answered all right turn that goddamn thing off you stupid motherfucking jackass do you want to bring nazi bombers down on us if you were going to deal with the nkvd any moral advantage you could grab was precious the torch winked off except for a wavering purplegreen afterimage stas could see nothing at all for a little while the chekist demanded did the antisoviet criminal ivan kulkaanen come here ivan came here yes stas answered no matter what kulkaanen was dumb enough to put in a letter mouradian was sure hed harmed the hitlerites far more than this blustering russian ever would it wouldnt help him of course but it was true what did he want what did you tell him the nkvd man barked he wanted me to hide him i said i couldnt stas gave back the exact truth it couldnt land poor ivan in any more trouble what did he do then he ran away you dont see him here do you never mind what i see the intruder snapped why didnt you instantly report his treasonous behavior because he only just now came and went that was a lie but only a tiny one and because its bloody cold out there truth again and because i expected you people would be on his trail one more truth where did he go the nkvd man asked so even a chekist could see the sense in his response comrade investigator i have no idea mouradian said which was also true but wherever he is he cant have got far ha youre right about that and when we catch him hell be sorry he didnt run off to venus or mars the nkvd man ducked out of stas tent and let the flap fall he shouted obscenityfilled orders to whatever friends he had out there theyd comb the grounds around the airstrip were they moronic enough to turn on their torches while they did it they probably were who was going to tell chekists they couldnt do something you could wind up in a camp yourself if you tried i did it i got away with it too stas thought not without pride he was still coldcolder now in fact with all the icy air his visitors had let into the tent he huddled under the blankets sleep was hopeless hed be pouring down tea tomorrow to keep his eyes open or coffee if they had any or maybe not hed need a replacement copilot if he was going to fly could they deliver somebody soon enough to do him any good hed have to see out at the edge of the encampment somebody yelled a moment later someone fired a long burst from a machine pistol a moment after that somebody let out a horrible scream was that kulkaanen or were the nkvd brutes mowing one another down stas knew where his hopes lay as a karelian kulkaanen probably knew even more about snow than the russians coming after him did maybe he could get away it still didnt seem likely but it was possible it was possible but it didnt happen they brought him in near daybreak theyd beaten the snot out of him for making them work so hard odds were he had worse coming if they didnt execute him theyd give him twentyfive years in the gulag they wouldnt bother hanging a mere tenner on him not after hed gone and pissed them off and the war would grind on whether run well or badly why couldnt he have seen that any which way no matter what he told his cousin the goddamn war would grind on chapter lieutenant demange sidled up to luc harcourt and murmured into his dirty and none too shelllike ear be ready be ready for what luc asked irritably id sure be ready for a holiday on the beach at nice or somewhere like that ill tell you the flat russian landscape he saw at the moment wouldnt have reminded him of the riviera even if it werent draped in snow funny funny like the crabs demange growled the usual gitane in the corner of his mouth jerking as he spoke i dont know if ive got crabs or not i dont give a good goddamn either luc said ive got regular lice though and fleas and bedbugs so who cares about the papillons damour its war what dyou expect demanges narrow bloodshot eyes flicked now this way now that luc tried to look every which way at once too the ivans off to the east were supposed to be pretty quiet right this minute but youd never live to get old by counting on what the bastards on the other side were supposed to be doing demange went on yeah its war but the political wheels are spinning again thats what youve got to be ready for oh god are we going through another round of that merde luc looked around again this time off toward the left his regiment was stationed at the french expeditionary forces left flank next to them in the line were the boches if he suddenly didnt have to worry about the russians any more he would have to worry about the fritzes instead could be lieutenant demange answered what i hear is daladiers been talking with the english if he decides they look like a better bet than hitler things here get sticky in a hurry no kidding luc exclaimed after a moment he added you know some of the guys in my section really do hate the russians you stay here for a while and they keep trying to kill you thatll happen sure it will so what demange said we came here on account of some french jackass with a white mustache and fancy embroidery on his kepi told us to if that same jerk or another con just like him says stalins the hottest lay since josephine baker and we should make nice with him from now on we fucking well will thats how the game is rigged and you know it as well as i do lucs sigh brought out fog almost as thick as the lieutenants cigarette smoke yeah i guess so he said unhappily you want i should warn the men something may be cooking then hold off a while longer like you say some of the dumb shitheads like the nazis better than the reds wouldnt do if one of em spilled the beans and brought the germans down on our heads before we were ready to go over to the russians youre right luc sounded more unhappy yetand he was so you dont think id do that huh if you even thought about it id blow your fucking head off before you got the chance to try demange replied love you too lieutenant luc teased a few syllables worth of sour laughter out of demange if the red army knew the french were thinking about changing sides it didnt let on the russians always hadsometimes quite literallymore artillery than they knew what to do with they also had their horrible new barrage rockets that could lay a square kilometer waste in nothing flat winter weather troubled such toys much less than it interfered with infantry actions the russians pounded the french positions again and again luc wondered if they were trying to tell the french generals that they could hurt the troops those generals commanded worse than the nazis could if they were trying to do that he didnt think it would work yes the russians could punish the expeditionary force but the germans could invade francecould invade and had invaded and might invade once more if france did switch back to englands side none of which made him cower any less in the shallow scrapes he hacked out of the frozen ground when the red army pounded his countrymens positions shell fragments whined maliciously not far enough over his head blast from the rockets picked him up and slammed him down till he felt as if hed lost a fifteenrounder to joe louis the shelling did send one of the most pronazi soldiers in his section away with a nasty thigh wound seeing the mess luc guessed the poor groaning bastard would lose the leg he didnt wish that kind of anguish on anybodyand marcel had been a brave fellow even if he was a fascist two days after marcel got hit lieutenant demange quietly told luc now you can let your guys in on it they need to know oh they do do they luc said tonelessly he wasnt at all sure he needed news like that himself he glanced off to the left again the closest german detachments were only a few hundred meters away no barbed wire separated them from the french as it did from the russians they were allies after all for the time being anyhow demanges eyes slid in the same direction he nodded glumly as if at a question luc hadnt asked yeah its liable to get a little hairy he said we may end up playing flank guards doesnt that sound like fun fun right luc said still with no expression in his voice demange chuckled thumped him on the back and went off to brief some more noncoms luc spread the word through his section he quietly told off a few reliable poilus to keep an eye on the handful of others who might give them away to the wehrmacht its politics my dears he said over and over again nothing we can do about it but roll with the punches he wished he had a better line that one reminded him too much of the way the russian rockets knocked him around were crossing into the reds lines right one of his men asked how do we know when were supposed to do that if we go too soon the salauds re liable to machinegun us instead of letting us through theyll give us the signal to move on luc hoped like nobodys business he wasnt lying and as a matter of fact he turned out not to be when its time for us to go the russiansll fill the sky with green flares lieutenant demange said just like fucking traffic lights harcourt even the dumbshits in your section ought to be able to remember that heres hoping some of those dimbulbs wouldnt remember their heads if they didnt have em stapled on luc said demange grunted something that might have been laughter how many times had he talked about ordinary soldiers the same scornful way sure as hell luc had got most of what he thought he knew about being a sergeant straight from the horses mouth the russians shelled the stretch of german line that abutted the french positions perhaps for the sake of verisimilitude perhaps just to remind the french that they werent buddies yet they also shelled lucs regiment a couple of luckless men got killed a few more picked up wounds french s and s indignantly joined the german guns that gave back counterbattery fire luc hoped like anything that they murdered some ivans he didnt want anybodys artillery coming down on his head the red army signaled early one frigid morning there was no other kind in russia at this season of the year just as night was giving way to daybreak one second the predawn stillness held the next it might have been a bastille day fireworks show except that all the stars and rockets and flares flying up in the east were green lets go luc called therell be ways through the wire the flank guards will hold off the boches while we move while france and germany played at friendship you werent supposed to call the feldgrau boys boches it was an order widely ignoredhe ignored it himselfbut an order even so the flank guards still werent supposed to fire until fired upon which would probably get some of the poor bastards killed luc carried his rifle at high port as he hurried across the snowcovered fields toward the gaps in the barbed wire that had better be there no firing came from in front of him that was encouraging but all at once he heard mgs and mausers open up off to the left swearing under his smoking breath he hunched over and tried to hurry faster green flares oberleutnant wolfgang gruber told willi dernen and the other men commanding squads in his company thats what youve got to look for from the russian lines thats the signal for the froggies to try and fuck us over what do we do then sir willi asked to his surprise he found he liked leading a squad because awful arno had done it for so long hed assumed he would hate the job but noand he didnt think he was doing it badly he added i mean i wont be sorry to get the frenchies off our flanki was always scared the ivans would push through them to flank us out still when they turn their coats weve got to make them pay gruber answered till then we have to make nice i guess theres still some chance the guys in the striped pants and the cutaways can straighten things out again i mean i dont want them on our flank any more than you do dernen but i dont want a hole in the line four divisions wide either willi grunted and nodded the wehrmacht had managed to patch things up and keep going when the english turned traitor maybe the general staff could figure out how to do it again especially since they seemed to have some warning but that wasnt a game you wanted to play once much less twice gruber looked from one corporal and obergefreiter to the next any other questions he asked nobody said anything willi had asked the only one that mattered the company co nodded all right then let your men know whats going on adam pfaff nodded cynically when willi passed along the news no big surprise is there he said anybody who ever counted on a lousy frenchman was just asking to get his pocket picked thats how it looks to me too willi said we got as much as we could out of the nogood pigdogs best thing we can do when they fly the coop is remind em why screwing around with the reich is a bad idea pfaff nodded again most of the other guys in the squad bobbed their heads up and down too at the time willi thought hed been plain enough later though he was faintly appalled at what had come out of his mouth sharing a cigarette with the obergefreiter with the gray mauser he explained why i sounded just like that cocksucking baatz just like him you hear me take an even strain man pfaff said if youre a noncom or making like a noncom youve got to come out with that bullshit every now and then you couldnt do your job if you didnt i dont want to sound like awful arno willi said why couldnt i sound like a good corporal instead because youve had the dumb turd blabbing in your ear since the war started thats why his buddy answered some of its bound to stick the way shit sticks to the hair around your asshole there you go willi liked the comparison thanks now you made me feel better what are friends for pfaff said modestly one thing friends were for as far as willi was concerned was staying with you through thick and thin the french flunked that test the germans started unobtrusively patrolling their right flank where their positions adjoined those of their alleged allies willi noticed the froggies doing some unobtrusive patrolling of their own keeping an eye on what the landsers were up to when germans and frenchmen couldnt avoid noticing one another they still waved and swapped smokes and rations but it wasnt the same as it had been willi wondered what would happen if he asked some french noncom about green flares he figured it was even money whether the guy had kittens or tried to murder him on the spot probably just as well he didnt know enough french even to frame the question of course he might run into a frenchman who could verstehen some deutsch he never did so much as find the chance to ask patrolling got more dangerous russian artillery fire picked up he noticed that the ivans were also hitting the french positions off to the right of where the german part of the line ended he hoped they were killing bunches of the men who were plotting to go over to them it would serve the french right by god all he really wanted to do was get out of russiaeventually get out of the warin one piece himself if doing that involved massacring every ivan from here to omsk he would if it involved sitting on his ass instead hed do that he wasnt fussy he didnt know anyone whod been at the front for a while and didnt feel the same way so he didnt complain when the russian artillery fire eased off again if the reds were hauling their guns twenty kilometers north to hit the germans there that was all right with him his boys had been taking it in the neck for a while now it was some other poor bastards turn and then one clear cold morning a new fish named erich somethingorother shook him awake sorry to bother you herr obergefreiter the kid said to an ordinary rifleman even willis picayune rank mattered erich went on theyre shooting off green flares bunches of them in fact ah fuck willi said wriggling out of his blanket like a badtempered butterfly emerging from its pupa he looked eastward sure as hell green fire was everywhere he sighed and swore and lit the days first smoke all right were on with the french again then are the rest of the guys awake most of them erich answered we didnt want to bother everybody in case this wasnt what you warned us about give the sleepyheads a good swift kick in the ass in that case this sure wont be anything else willi grabbed for his scopesighted rifle the longer the range at which he could pick off treacherous froggies the better oberleutnant gruber spoke to most of the company the french figure they can get away with yanking the fuhrer s mustache were going to make them sorry you hear me the more poilus we kill here the more we kill right now the fewer well have to worry about on the western front later on so lets go get em the landsers raised a cheer willi joined it but he had the feeling hed heard something most of them had missed if france was back in the war there would be a western front again wouldnt there the wehrmacht had come so close so goddamn teasingly close to paris well close only counted if you were chucking hand grenades he had a couple of potatomashers on his belt hed use them if he couldnt get rid of the enemy from farther away he trudged south and east through the snow toward the boundary between the german and french sectors shooting had already broken out as he remembered from the fighting in france it was easy to tell whose machine guns were going off mgs fired a lot faster than the crap the froggies used french rifles didnt sound the same as mausers either he hadnt had to worry about them for a while but all that stuff came back in a hurry there was a frenchman scurrying east to the vodka and borscht the reds would give him for turning his coat willi dropped to one knee to steady his aim and to make himself a smaller target exhale dont squeeze the trigger touch it gently like a tit the mauser pushed back against his shoulder in his scope the frenchman staggered stumbled and fell he worked the sniping rifles downbent bolt and slogged forward again he knocked over a couple of more poilus both of them from a range where an ordinary mauser without a scope probably would have missed he felt sorry for them how could he not when it was a risk he took himself but he knew they would have shot him without a qualm do unto others before they could do unto you if that wasnt wars golden rule it should have been a french noncom up ahead was trying to rally his section it was another long shot but willi didnt hesitate down went the noncom his men scattered like partridges willi slapped a new clip into the rifle as he did a bullet cracked past his head not all the froggies were running dammit he flattened out in the snow where was that french son of a bitch willi couldnt spot him that was scary you always hated it when the guy who was trying to kill you was good at what he did aristide demange peered balefully across the snowy fields that damned boche had disappeared with a white snowsuit and a whitewashed helmet he was almost impossible to spot as long as he kept his head and his hands out of sight in front of demange luc harcourts blood steamed in the snow the germans were still well over half a kilometer away it had taken one hell of a shot to punch harcourts ticket for him well punched it was that one had torn his throat out hed lie here till the wolves found him which didnt mean demange wanted to lie here with him the veteran glanced back over his shoulder working out what he needed to do next the stupidest thing you could do was move before you decided where you were going and how you intended to get there he crawled backward trying his best to keep harcourts body between him and the german sniper acting as cover was the last favor the kid could do him or anybody else when demange had gone about as far as he could go that way he scrambled to his feet and sprinted for the cover of some snowcovered bushes a mauser bullet snapped past him viciously close he dove behind the bushes his breath harsh in his throat im getting too old for this crap he thought all those chainsmoked gitanes he spat out the butt he had in his mouth now the last thing he wanted was for that fucking nazi to spot cigarette smoke yelling here i am can i take him out he wondered he had a lot of practice with a rifle but he was only a good marksman not a great one and his piece wasnt all that accurate out past three or four hundred meters if the guy whod potted poor damned harcourt wasnt carrying one of their manhunting fancy mausers demange would have been astonished all of which meant that in any kind of longrange duel the odds were on the other fuckers side then a hotchkiss machine gun opened up puffs of rising snow traced its stream of bullets across the ground demange loved machine guns when they were shooting at the other clowns he wasnt nearly so fond of them when they tried to put his lights out now the sniper would have to keep his head down though unless he craved a round in one ear and out the other and if he couldnt fire or would be rushed when he did now looked like a terrific time to put some more distance between him and the lieutenants precious irreplaceable self he used the bushes to screen his movements from the boche the asshole might be willing to pop up for a shot if he got a good target best not to give him one then all the same the spot between demanges shoulder blades that stretch of skin right above his spine itched madly as he hustled toward the red army lines mm round ripped through that spot or any other demange thanked the god in whom hed long since quit believing he hadnt stopped anything big in this war not yet he sure as hell did in the more you know about getting shot the less you wanted to do it again a horrible clanking monster rumbled straight at him a whitewashed t it looked as if it could make canapes out of every french tank ever manufactured the reason it looked that way was simple it could the commander rode with his head and shoulders out of the hatch recognizing demange as a frenchman the ivan waved a mittened hand as the t clattered past watch out for a sniper up ahead demange yelled he doubted the russian heard or understood if he did hear hed tried though what else could you do he soon discovered he should have warned the driver to watch out for one of the germans fearsome mm multipurpose guns but hed had no idea the damn thing was in the neighborhood the boches hadnt wasted it on anything so trivial as foot soldiers a t now that they took seriously a big armorpiercing round slamming into steel plate sounded like an accident in a steel mill the t slewed sideways and started burning a diesel engine didnt go to blazes the way a gasolinepowered one did but there were limits to everything demange wasted maybe a second and a half feeling sorry for the unlucky cons inside the t then he trotted on toward the russians lines whatever the tank wouldnt do now that it had been intended to it had got the germans off his back for a while from his point of view what more could he want as promised there were lanes through the barbed wire the ivans had even gone to the trouble of marking them with strips of red cloth never a trusting soul demange yelled friends were friends as he came forward he didnt want his new comrades potting him by mistake a russian appeared out of nowhere one second he wasnt there the next he loomed up in front of demange a snowman with a submachine gun instead of mowing the lieutenant down he pointed with the stubby barrel you go that way he said in bad palatal french i will go that way demange agreed speaking slowly and clearly afterward he thought the red army man understood his obedience better than his reply he spotted a few more russians as he tramped along a couple of them gave him and the poilus whod come in more brusque directions he wondered how many more of the snowsuited cochons he wasnt seeing the russians knew things about camouflage other people didnt even suspect their strength was like an iceberg ninetenths of it hid below the surface finally he came to an officera captain by his collar tabswho wore khaki he relaxed a bit himself then deciding he was out of any possible sniper range the captain carried a clipboard and a pencil his french was pretty fair give me your name your rank and your pay number he told demange whatever you want demange rattled them off he assumed half a dozen russians he couldnt see crouched somewhere nearby ready to gun down anybody stupid enough to argue or complain the captain wrote things down in a language and a script demange couldnt begin to follow he also took the information from the enlisted men who trailed demange then he gestured with the pencil the same way the guy in the snowsuit had with his machine pistol go that way past the trees another kilometer get into one of the trucks you find demange sketched a salute you got it he turned to his men come on you lugs one more lousy kilometer then were done marching for a while at least they arent taking away our rifles one of the french soldiers said he was right demange found that mildly encouraging toobut only mildly if the russians wanted to slaughter them from ambush how much would their rifles help the trucks gave demange pause much the same way as the sight of his first t had some weeks earlier they were big sturdy broadshouldered machines that made every design engineer in france germany and england look like an amateur and a halfassed amateur at that if the russians made trucks like these and tanks like those how come they were still such fuckups then he saw letters of his own alphabet on the trucks grillwork studebaker they proclaimed the russians hadnt made these trucks theyd got them from the americans that was something of a relief the americans had a real talent for manufacturing things he remembered that from the last war that and their puppyish enthusiasm they were new to the fight and still eager for it all the french soldiers left alive then had long since shed such stupidity another moonfaced ivan with a submachine gun waved him and some of his men into the back of one of the studebakers three or four frenchmen were already inside before long the compartment was packed as tight as a tin of anchovy filets anybody know where theyre going to take us asked one of the fellows whod got there ahead of demange as long as its away from the front who gives a damn the lieutenant returned he was as grimy and unshaven as any enlisted man his greatcoat hid his rank badges the men who didnt know him treated him the same way they would have treated one of their own that suited him fine hed never wanted to be an officer to begin with the trucks engine rumbled to life the driver put the big beast in gear wherever they were going they were on their way in the summertime the stinking fritzes pressed forward and soviet forces fell back ivan kuchkov had seen that in all three summers of the war during the winter though all bets were off the nazis werent such hotshots once snow started coming down they were soft pussies the germans all the good weather in western europe spoiled them rotten as far as ivan was concerned the ukraine had pretty easy winters it got a hell of a lot colder and snowed a hell of a lot more farther north but even the weather here was plenty to screw up the fascist bastards their tanks didnt want to run sometimes even their gun oil froze up when you killed a guy who couldnt shoot back because the bolt on his mauser was stuck tight you had to feel a little sorry for him but you blew his head off anyway and you were a jackass if you felt more than a little sorry while you did it what was he doing hundreds of kilometers inside your country except trying to murder you and fuck your sister and steal everything you ever had or would have ivan was a jackass all kinds of wayshe even recognized some of thembut he wasnt a pitying jackass west of kiev the german and soviet positions looked more like interlaced fingers than anything resembling a line a stavka officer who planned and proposed dispositions like those would have got sent to the gulag or a punishment battalion in nothing flat none of this had been planned like a lot of war it just happened the russians had gone ahead where they could the germans hung on to villages and to the roads that let them keep the villages supplied to complicate things even more ukrainian bandits in the woods bushwhacked russians and germans almost impartially a lot of them would have been pronazi if only the nazis gave them the chance but the germans liked ukrainians no better than they liked russians more often than not they couldnt even tell them apart or didnt bother trying so the bandits took potshots at them too one of the reasons so many of the bandits would have gone over to the german side if only the germans wanted them was that they hated jews even more than most russians did kuchkov had no great love for zhids himself guys like avram davidov though got more useful in this kind of country avram knew what to be nervous about the short answer was everything and when the short answer was everything the long answer didnt matter the ukrainian nationalists big disadvantage was that they didnt have an actual country on their side no factories made rifles and mortars and hand grenades just for them no trains and trucks made sure weapons reached them inliterallycarload lots they had to make do with hunting rifles and whatever they could steal from the germans and russians on the other hand they were desperately in earnest the only reason most of the red army men and their foes in feldgrau wore their countrys uniform was that they would have got it in the neck if theyd tried to say no to the fat sons of bitches whod conscripted them the bandits went out to fight because they felt like fighting they didnt have a country on their side but they sure wanted to it made a difference right now ivan and his men crouched in amongst some trees that wanted to be a proper forest but didnt quite know how avrams eyes flicked across a field to some more trees that might have been an orchard before stalin started tearing the ukraine a new asshole but had plainly stood forgotten ever since the little jew didnt point the red army mens cover wasnt all that great somebodys in there comrade sergeant davidov sounded as spooked as a guy wandering the corridors of a haunted castle in some bad horror film german cunts kuchkov asked that was his first guess because his officers said there were supposed to be nazis around here somewhere he let them do his thinking for him he knew he wasnt real good at it himself unhappily avram shook his head i think theyre banderists he was hardly ever cheerful now he looked and sounded even gloomier than usual stepan bandera was the bandit chief in charge of mostnot all but mostof the jerks who wanted to fly the goldandblue flag stamp their stupid trident on everything that didnt move and go around grunting in their almostrussian language fuck kuchkov said you sure two or three of them showed themselves there for a few seconds davidov still didnt point he did add what he plainly thought was a clincher one of em was wearing a cloth cap fuck kuchkov repeated real soldiers would wear helmets or maybe service caps or berets only a yokel off a farm would dress like a yokel off a farm ivan went on we dont need this extra fucking shit you know sorry comrade sergeant sasha sounded as if he meant it he was like anybody else getting shot or ripped to pieces by artillery fire didnt appeal to him one hell of a lot after a moment he asked what shall we do ivan only grunted he had no idea how many ukrainians were lurking over there he didnt want to have to attack them across open ground if they had a machine gun or maybe even if they didnt they could murder every one of the men whod come at them he grunted again then he picked up a branch not quite as long as he was and tied his snow smock to it by the arms not much of a flag of truce but he had to hope it would do ill parley with the bitches he said if they dont turn me loose or if anything else gets fucked up send somebody back to regimental artillery and have em blast the living shit out of those trees got it the jew nodded if anybody in this section could be counted on to take care of something like that he was the guy waving the improvised white flag ivan started across the field toward the forgotten orchard it was a long slow lonely walk they could kill him if they wanted to nothey wanted to kill him and they could it wasnt the same thing after a while a shout came from the leafless fruit trees hold it right there you cocksucking red ah fuck your mother you havent got a cock big enough to suck ivan answered without much rancor but he did stop youve got some nerve talking like that out in the open the ukrainian in the orchard made enough of an effort to speak russian that kuchkov could follow him well enough what do you want my guys have a radio ivan lied without compunction all we have to do is call and the big gunsll fuck your position over if you cunts clear out peaceablelike we wont call ill give you half an hour why should i believe a guy who licks stalins balls the ukrainian was almost as foulmouthed as kuchkov himself cause im standing here thats why kuchkov answered you think id let you shoot my dick off for nothing bettern bullshit with a russian who the hell knows what youd be dumb enough to do the bandits spokesman said darkly ivan stood out there in the cold wind hed figured he would have to wait the bandit couldnt just give orders the way a proper sergeant could he had to talk his buddies into doing shit ivan made as if to look at a watch he wasnt wearing twentyeight minutes now he called dont sit there jerking off get your nuts in gear he waited some more occasionally checking that nonexistent wristwatch after a while the ukrainian said all right keep your old galoshes on were leaving ivan chuckled old galoshes was russian slangnot quite mat but closefor a used rubber hearing it made him think the bandit meant what he said when ivan did wave his section forward only half his men came out of their positions if that wasnt avrams doing he would have been amazed you always wanted somebody in reserve they occupied the orchard with no troublethe bandits really had gone away kuchkov swigged vodka and lit a papiros to celebrate a bloodless victory was the best kind chapter like the goldmans the brucks had a radio set if anything they listened to it more than sarahs mother and father did books meant less to them than they did to the goldmans isidor and his folks used the radio to fill in the spaces where the goldmans would have been reading which would have been all right if dr goebbels werent the fellow giving the orders about what went out over the airwaves oh not even hitlers clubfooted propaganda boss could screw up everything sarah had no problems with handel and bach and beethoven they didnt belong to the nazis alone they were part of every halfway cultured persons baggage wagner wagner was more complicated sarah had been a girl in the days back before the fuhrer came to power she remembered her father playing records of wagners operas then and after the direction in which the nazis were taking germany grew unmistakably clear she remembered him smashing those records one by one and throwing the pieces in the trash that didnt mean he or anyone else in the third reich could escape wagner altogether naturally hitlers favorite composer was on the radio all the time samuel goldman had usually turned it off or found another station when that happened sometimes though sarah had caught him listening hardly seeming to realize he was doing it the germans made it plain that liking wagner was a big part of being one of them and her fatherd always wanted nothing more than to be and to be seen to be a good german himself besides some of what wagner wrotenot all not to sarahs ear but yes somewas ravishingly beautiful these days more french treason and french betrayal were on the radio than wagner german commentators screamed that france had broken her commitments as an ally and a friend david bruck was nowhere near so sophisticated a man as samuel goldman but did you need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind was blowing itll be two fronts going full blast same as it was in the great war he predicted it didnt work then what are the odds it will this time do you want it to sarah asked him if this regime goes down the drain maybe whatever comes along next wont blame everything on the jews the baker looked startled i hadnt even though of it like that he confessed turning to his son he went on see what a smart girl you married isidor oh yeah isidor said sarah was about to throw something at him when he added if shes so smart how come she married me that selfmockery was very much his style this time he dragged her into it too must be your good looks david bruck said they all laughed isidor looked a lot like his father the older bruck gave his attention back to sarah i hadnt even thought about no more nazis i just remember how hard things were during the last war and what a horrible mess everything was afterwards the nazis had sprung from that horrible mess what might spring from the next one if there was a next one whatever it was it couldnt possibly be worse than hitlers party sarah was sure of that she wondered if her father would be so sure the nazis had surprised him with their virulence had they gone as low as people could go sarah thought so if she was wrong she didnt want to find out about it well isidor said lets get these into the ovens and into the ovens the dark loaves went he and his father complained all the time about the horrible brown coal with the lumps and chunks of worthless shale they had to use for baking these days sarah understood why they complained they were used to better jews all over germany were used to better all kinds of ways here though sarah wasnt inclined to kvetch along with them before long the baking bread would smell wonderful and the ovens even if they burned the cheapest most adulterated coal aroundand what else would a jewish bakery get kept the place warm in earlier war winters shed shivered till spring finally came no more the war bread came out of the ovens right at the top of the hour david bruck turned on the radio to catch the news itll all be lies sarah said nah he shook his head not all just most of it she nodded he was right if you listened carefully and knew how to read between the lines you could sometimes glimpse the real moving figures that cast the enormous blurry shadows the newsreaders talked about the latest broadcast started out with a bang the jews are our misfortune the announcer shouted slamming his fist down on a tabletop so our beloved fuhrer adolf hitler said twenty years ago and as usual history has proved him right at that point sarahs father would have given forth with a derisive snort since he wasnt there she did it for him her husband and fatherinlaw made identical shushing noises now the bolshevik jews of moscow conspire with the plutocratic jews of paris to try to smash the german reich between them the newsreader went on for a little while it seemed the degenerate french would have will enough to resist the poisoned honey the jews poured down their throats sadly though this was not to be as a result of base french treachery and deceit we are punishing the enemy soldiers who seek to desert to the bolsheviks theyd said the same thing after england decided shed had enough of the fight in russia maybe it was true maybe it was sweet syrup designed to make the radio audience feel better about what was going on here sarah couldnt know for sure without going to russia herself there werent many places she wanted to be less than in munster but the russian front was one of them fighting has resumed in france the announcer said in portentous tones displaying their usual cowardice the french were pushed back several kilometers in the skirmishes no sign of english troops on the western front has yet been detected as always england talks a better game than she plays sarah would have looked across the street at the bombedout grocery there only she couldnt the bakerys front window was repairedafter a fashionwith scraps of plywood and cardboard the raf played all too good a game in other news relating to the changed war situation unlimited uboat warfare in the north atlantic has resumed the announcer said if americas jew capitalists think they can get rich shipping arms to increase europes woe we will hurt them in their pocketbooks wait and see how loud they scream he laughed a most unpleasant laugh after that homefront reports took over then the radio started playing tristan und isolde david bruck smiled he liked wagner he hadnt quit liking the composer because the nazis liked him too the way sarahs father had she wondered what that said most likely no more than that he liked wagner even better than samuel goldman did isidor said i bet the wehrmacht is jumping up and down with joy because they get to fight a twofront war again bet youre right his father agreed theyve already tried to toss out our beloved fuhrer he laced that with sarcasm not the newsreaders schmaltz a couple of times how long before they take another shot at it sarah looked from one of them to the other no they werent sophisticates like her father but as she was coming to realize that didnt make them dummies either they could see what was going on in the world hitler would be able to see it too how far could he trust the wehrmacht if he didnt trust it what would keep the french and english out of germany for that matter what would keep the russians out of the reich there was a thought to make any good national socialists blood run cold sooner or laterprobably sooner the way isidor grabbed her every chance he could stealshe was going to have a baby what kind of world would it grow up in in a world that didnt look a whole lot like this one in a world without nazis a few weeks earlier that would have looked impossible now now she could hope anyhow you can go home again vaclav jezek said contradicting the title of a new novel hed never heard of benjamin halevy shrugged yeah i guess so but unless we all go back to france to fight the germans im staying right here with you guys youre a french citizen youre a french soldier vaclav said what if your government orders you back halevy told him what the french government could do about it vaclav didnt think governments were equipped to do such things especially not sideways he laughed all the same one thing he said when he got done laughing now that france and germany are on the outs again theyll open up the supply spigot here there you go that is something halevy sounded enthusiastic all at once let the fucking fascists get thirsty for goodies for a change with france and england back in the war id like to see hitler and mussolini ship sanjurjo any toys its funny the nationalists are fascists and i cant stand them on account of theyre dumb enough to be fascists but i dont hate them the way i hate germans vaclav said i wonder why all the spaniards have done is try to kill you halevy said they havent raped your country and stolen it from you besides i bet you didnt have much use for germans even before the war what czech does you are a smart hebe vaclav said less ironically than hed intended every word of that rang true hey i love you too halevy made as if to kiss him laughing some more jezek pushed him away leave me alone you fairy he said and laughed again not guilty halevy shook his head im a french jew fighting for the czechoslovakian governmentinexile in spain ive got to be normal some kind of way i like girls they dont always like me but i like girls girls dont always like anybody vaclav said he and halevy went on from there when everything else failed you could always talk about women vaclav slipped out through the wire before dawn the next morning if you were in place by the time the sun rose the bastards on the other side wouldnt notice you moving the nationalists wouldbe sniper had discovered the error of his ways about that but hed never get the chance to do it over and do it right not now he wouldnt the czech crawled into a shell hole whose forward lip helped shield him from the prying eyes of sanjurjos men they wouldnt find him easy to spot any which way twigs and branches torn off bushes broke up his helmets outline more camouflaged the antitank rifles long barrel his greatcoat was duncolored to begin with and muddy on top of that hed smeared streaks of mud on his face too they had chameleons in the far south of spain he did his best to impersonate one of the goggleeyed lizards since he lacked goggle eyes of his own he peered through the scope on his rifle instead the nationalists behind the lines seemed busier than usual hustling here and bustling there he wondered if they were getting ready to attack in this sector that wouldnt be so good neither for the republic nor more relevantly for his life expectancy after a while though he decided it wasnt that kind of hustle and bustle it seemed more as if they were getting ready to receive a vip in spite of himself excitement coursed through him people had been telling him to blow marshal sanjurjos head off ever since he crossed the pyrenees what if he really got the chance dont blow it thats what he thought one shot probably out close to meters he could hit at that range hed done it before hed missed too but he refused to dwell on that footballers missed all the time but they kept playing even so and strikers shrugged off misses and put the ball in the net the next time without false modesty vaclav knew he was one of the best strikers in this game he was still here wasnt he hed smoked a cigarette just before he emerged from the republican trenches the next one would have to wait as usual when he was out between the lines he didnt want to do anything that might give him away time dragged on if you didnt know how to wait you had no business sniping he ate some sausage he took a leak hed improved the bottom of the shell hole by digging a little trench so he could deal with such things without needing to lie in a puddle of piss afterward a nationalist officer in one of those almostgerman helmets surveyed nomansland through field glasses the nerve of the son of a bitch vaclav almost killed him to discourage the fascists from doing that kind of thing again they knew that he was out here or that he was liable to be anyhow he would have disposed of the officer had those binoculars paused while they were pointed his way he might have done it on general principles if he werent after bigger game hed never known the nationalists to do that kind of thing before maybe they were trying to make sure their precious big shot would be safe vaclav ducked down before he shook his head sorry boys he thought im here whether you see me or not he waited some more clouds rolled in and turned the day gloomy he hoped it wouldnt rain that would screw up everything he needed a clear shot if he ever got a target a few drops fell come on god quit screwing around vaclav grumbled whose side are you on dammit the rain stopped either god was on his side or the rain just stopped he remembered a day when he would have figured it was god now he would have bet it just happened any which way after a while he spotted a nationalist general haranguing a bunch of assembled officers it wasnt marshal sanjurjo vaclav knew what he looked like the fascists slapped posters of his jowly mug on anything that didnt move this guy was younger and skinnier a good thing too if you were fatter than marshal sanjurjo you were too fat to be a general and probably too fat to live well this shithead was too fascist to live he had an oval rather disapproving face and a neatly trimmed dark mustache by the way he gestured he wasnt the most exciting speechifier god ever made no matter on whose side god turned out to be he wasnt quite so far away as vaclav had thought he might be no more than meters the czech aimed with his usual meticulous care he took a couple of deep breaths as he let out the second one he fired muzzle brake or not padded stock or not the antitank rifle always tried to break his shoulder hed have a fresh purple bruise tonight to go with the ones that were fading to yellow but the nationalist general stopped in the middle of one of his jerky gestures and fell over as far as vaclav was concerned that counted for more than the bruises the fascists started running around like chickens suddenly minus their heads the guy with the field glasses popped up again except for vaclavs rule against shooting twice from the same place he would have nailed him for his presumption sitting tight wasnt easy but he did it his pals back in the republican trenches were on the ball they started shooting rifles and machine guns at the nationalist lines that made sanjurjos men decide against going out to hunt for him he appreciated the gesture any heirs he might eventually have would too more waiting then once darkness fell vaclav crept back to the little stretch of trench the czechs held they pounded him on the back and plied him with harsh spanish brandy and even harsher spanish cigarettes do you know who you got they yelled do you since vaclav didnt he answered tell me for christs sake all i know is it wasnt the big cheese next best thing by jesus one of them said it was that franco asshole whos given us so much grief hey that was worth doing jezek said francisco franco wasno had beenone of the nationalists better generals he had balls even if he was a fascist and he had a tenacity few on either side showed what he grabbed he held on to well all hed grab from here on out was a plot of earth two meters long a meter wide and two meters deep in the end that was all anybody ever grabbed but when you got it mattered the republicans hadnt put an enormous price on his head the way they had with sanjurjo all the same vaclav bet theyd give him some leave and some cash to have a good time in madrid for potting franco and if you couldnt have a good time in madrid you werent half trying battle damage repaired the boise steamed out of pearl harbor and headed west looking for trouble pete mcgill was happy about that any chance to give the japs one in the slatsor better one in the nutslooked good to him he wished he were on the sixinch guns instead of the secondary armament then he could have fired at enemy ships not planes if you sank a destroyer or another light cruiser you could give yourself credit for hundreds of japs instead of the lousy one or two you got for hitting a fighter or a bomber vera still needed more revenge no matter how much he tried to take it could never be enough that didnt mean he didnt want to up his score though along with the boise came three destroyers a heavy cruiser and the ranger all the other ships were along to protect the carrier the ranger wasnt the ideal carrier to go after the japs she was just arrived from the atlantic and shed been more a training ship than a combat vessel but the fleet carriers that had been in the pacific now lay on the bottom if the usa was going to hit back at all it needed to grab whatever it could get its hands on two years from now none of this shitll matter joe orsatti said as the gun crew stood by their piece looking out over the wide empty ocean two years from now well have so fuckin many carriers theyll fly out our nose when we sneeze tojoll see em in his bathtub for chrissake little tiny wildcatsll strafe his fuckin mustache everybody laughed youre outa your goddamn tree you know that pete said not without admiration yeah well i have fun orsatti looked around some more except when i gotta put up with youse guys i mean boy you talk even more new york than i do pete said again more admiringly than not i didnt figure anybody could comes of bein a dago orsatti said with pride of his own if the wrong guy had tried to slap that label on him he would have decked the bastard but he could stick it on himself he pointed at mcgill now you youre just a regular paddy if you came from minnesota youd sound like a fuckin squarehead but a guinea like me dont matter where hes from he still sounds like hells kitchenor jersey at the most inevitably that came out joisey talking about jerseypete pronounced it much the same waywhos that kid whos been singing with goodman and now with dorsey sinatra orsatti spoke with assurance yeah hes from hoboken my folks know his folks some kinda way i think one of my cousins went out with a gal whos kin to himlike second cousin or somethingbut it didnt stick too bad for your cousin pete said the way the dames scream for that guy hes gonna end up with more money than henry fuckin ford probably enough so some even sticks to a second cousin wouldnt surprise me a bit orsatti agreed but its water under the bridge now and vitos in the army poor sap so hes got more to worry about than trying to make it with sinatras cousin my ass he does the armys safe as houses like any halfway decent marine mcgill looked down his nose at the larger service he had his reasons too whats he gonna do besides train and look cute army cant fight the japs not till it gets delivered and that wont happen any time soon if we were fighting the germans too he might have to work for a living way things are though forget about it its coming you gotta think so anyway orsatti said now that france and england are over their fling with the nazis were shipping em stuff again thatll piss hitler offhell itd piss me off so hell start torpedoing freighters and well jump in same as we did against the kaiser could be pete allowed hes turned his subs loose again over in the atlantic idly he wondered what it would be like to be a kid from hoboken with girls screaming for you wherever you went there sure had to be worse ways to make a living back when he had vera he wouldnt have cared if all the other girls in the world were screaming for him and if that didnt prove hed been head over heels what would have since he couldnt have the one hed wanted most being able to pick and choose from all the rest didnt seem half bad the ranger and her shepherds steamed south and west nobodyd said where they were going not to the likes of pete mcgill anyhow he didnt care as long as it was toward the enemy that suited him fine wildcats from the carrier flew a combat air patrol over the task force floatplanes from the heavy cruiser buzzed ahead of the american ships to make sure they werent running into trouble facefirst little by little the usa was learning to fight a midtwentiethcentury war no matter what kind of superjutland the admirals had imagined it probably wasnt going to happen admirals imaginations hadnt encompassed airplanes and submarines battleships turned out to be dinosaurs huge and ferocious and armored with mouths full of big sharp teeth but doomed to extinction all the same klaxons hooted almost every day swabbies and leathernecks dashed to battle stations it always turned out to be a drill men swore when the allclear sounded but they didnt swear too loud or too hard most of them had been aboard the boise when the big american fleet tried to run the japanese gantlet only now was pete coming to realize how dumb the admirals had really been joe orsatti laughed at him when he said so i bet you still believe in the tooth fairy and the fuckin easter bunny and santa claus too orsatti said but dont sweat it sure our big guys are dumb but you bet your ass the japs are too pete was betting his ass everybody in this flotilla was if hed had any doubts they were erased when one alert was followed by an ironthroated shout of this is no drill from the intercom speakers the officer at the mike went on japanese planes incoming from bearing i say again this is no drill grunting pete grabbed a shell and handed it to the loader who slammed it into the fiveinch guns breech joe orsatti trained the gun to bear on the enemy planes expected track toward the ranger pete stood ready to pass as many fiftypound shells as might be needed his shoulder complained every time he did it but hed long since quit listening overhead the wildcats tangled with a swarm of japanese zeroes wildcats had a chance against zeroes but not usually a great chance one of the american planes splashed into the ocean as pete watched shit he said and the zeroes kept the wildcats too busy to do what they should have been doing going after the divebombers that followed the fighters in japanese naval dive bombersvals was the us code name for themwere ugly and oldfashioned like german stukas they had fixed landing gear also like stukas they could put a bomb down on a silver dollar if you gave them the chance four of them pulled away from the main bunch and buzzed toward the boise a wildcat that broke off from the big melee shot one of them down a moment later a zero shot down the wildcat the rest of the vals droned on all the light cruisers antiaircraft guns large and small started going off at once pete jerked shells like a man possessed bursts blackened the air all around the enemy planes one took a direct hit and turned into a fireball the other two dove joe orsatti frantically swiveled the fiveinch gun aw fuck he said again and again aw fuck bombs fell free one of them hit fifty feet to starboard of the boise the other caught the cruiser just abaft the bridge pete flew through the air with the greatest of ease next thing he knew he was in the bloodwarm pacific he was amazed how far from the ship hed been thrown a good thing too because the boise was already starting to settle in the water pete looked around for a life ring he could dogpaddle for a while but off to his left a dark gray dorsal fin sliced the sea it was the oldest shipwreck cliche in the worldexcept when it happened to you and it was happening to pete theo hossbach huddled with the rest of the panzer crew around a little fire in a peasants hut in a tiny village whose name if it had a name was written in an alphabet he couldnt read he wished for hot coffee thick with sweet cream yes he was from breslau but viennesestyle would have suited him fine theyd found some tea in the hut water was boiling in a dented pot over the fire no sugar no milk an englishman probably would have killed himself before he drank such scheisse theo looked forward to getting outside of anything warm he would have drunk plain old hot water just then and been glad to have it hermann witt took the pot and filled everybodys tin cup the loose tea in the bottom of theos cup smelled great when the water hit it he had to make himself wait before he drank so it would brew some in there the tommies would laugh at us not for the first time adi stoss way of thinking paralleled his everybody swore at the tommieseverybody except theo who as usual kept his ideas to himself lousy bastards ran out on us same as the french fuckers lothar eckhardt growled the gunner scratched without seeming to notice he was doing it odds were he was lousy himself theo was pretty sure he was too you came into one of these places youd pick up company whether you liked it or not next time we see englishmen itll be through our sights kurt poske agreed adi said well the good news there would be wed be seeing tommies instead of ivans thatd mean wed got out of russia in one piece theo sipped his tea by now it was plenty strong the caffeine made his heart beat faster it sure held more than the ersatz coffee that came with german rations he wondered if that crap had any at all you could get benzedrine tablets hed used them once in a whilewho didnt when you needed to keep going but he didnt like them they were too much like squashing a cockroach by dropping a building on it caffeine now caffeine was just right twofront war witt said and not another word with just theo and adi there he probably would have talked some more neither kurt nor lothar had ever given the slightest hint they would bring anything to the national socialist loyalty officer but the panzer commander didnt take needless chances in combat with the enemy or with his own side thats what screwed us the last time i just hope it doesnt screw us again adi said maybe he trusted the two new guys further than witt did maybe he had his reasons too if eckhardt or poske ever reported him to the powers that be odds were they wouldnt do it for anything so trivial as a few illchosen words he had bigger things than that to worry about i wouldnt mind getting the hell out of russia i mean who in his right mind would eckhardt said a sentiment that certainly had its points he went on i dont want to get my sorry ass run out of russia though know what i mean we get run out of russia things arent going so good adi nodded so did theo that was plainly true but adi said you know what this miserable country is its a swamp with no bottom thats what we throw in panzers and planes and people and then we throw in some more and some more and some more after that and the swamp just kind of goes glup and its like we never did anything to begin with glup theo echoed he liked that theres got to be a bottom somewhere hermann witt said slowly the ivans have to run out of land and soldiers and machines sooner or later he grimaced only thing i wonder is whether the reich s pole is long enough to reach that bottom sooner or later people had been saying the russians were bound to run out of people and stuff ever since the germans started fighting them in northeastern poland now the germans and the poles and romanians and magyars and slovaks butdammit not the english or french any more were halfway to moscow all the same sooner or later was looking more and more like later the fire dwindled down toward extinction like the other guys in the crew theo glanced around for more wood to throw on it he didnt see any there wasnt any to see theyd burnt the last of it sergeant witt said lothar go on out to the woodpile in the square and bring back some more fuel eckhardt picked up his schmeisser everybody kept a weapon handy all the time you never could tell when some reds would sneak past the german pickets and raise hell but the gunner couldnt go out without pissing and moaning first i just fetched firewood like two days ago why dont you send the hebe instead it hadnt been noisy inside the hut before now silence seemed sudden and absolute the wind still howled and whined but that might have been a million kilometers away what did you call me adi asked softly his machine pistol lay beside him he wasnt holding it the way lothar held his all the same theo would have bet on adi if shooting started and shooting didnt seem very far off at all theo glanced down at his own schmeisser just in case he told himself in case of what he didnt want to think about for a wonder lothar actually got how far hed stuck his foot into it hey take an even strain he said making no quick or herkyjerky moves i didnt mean anything nasty by it honest to god adi i didnt but so you know everybody in the company calls you that when you arent around to hear it theo hadnt heard anyone call adi that which proved what not much probably if selfsufficient adi had a best buddy it couldnt be anybody but theo people wouldnt say anything adi didnt fancy where theo was around to overhear it if it got back to adi theo wouldnt have wanted him for an enemy nobody with a pfennigs worth of sense would lothar first things first youll get the wood cause i told you to witt said if i wanted adi to fetch it i would have sent him hear me yes sergeant eckhardt said his voice uncommonly solemn witt nodded recognizing that wunderbar now about the other thing if people do call adi that tell em for christs sake to cut it out we need the ss sniffing around us like we need an asshole where our mouth ought to be you hear me there yes sergeant the gunner repeated more formally yet all right now get the hell out of here and bring back that wood before we freeze to death go onscram eckhardt went you didnt need to make a big deal out of it sergeant adi said after a moment i shouldntve got pissed off people talk too goddamn much witt said a sentiment theo heartily agreed with the panzer commander went on thats a dangerous nickname to have itd be dangerous for a fat blond bavarian he left it there he didnt say its really dangerous for somebody who kind of looks like a jew and who just happens to be missing his foreskin adi was no dummy he could work that out for himself after another pause he said a while ago theo told me the guys knew id kind of got used to that knowing is one thing blabbings something else witt said if things were different youd probably be a major by now and ordering all of us around i dont want to tell anybody what to do adi said i just want people to leave me the fuck alone words burst from theo no wonder i like you the other crewmen laughed like loons no wonder at all adi agreed enough you lovebirds witt said and the panzer men laughed some more getting through the war in one piecelike you said before adi thats the only thing that counts the rest is just bullshit so lets get through and if the other stuff needs sorting out we can always do it later lothar came back with an armload of wood to build up the fire theo fed in a few little skinny chunks when they were burning well he added some bigger ones after a while they caught too like wall lizards basking in the sun all five panzer men leaned toward the flames soaking up the wonderful warmth
