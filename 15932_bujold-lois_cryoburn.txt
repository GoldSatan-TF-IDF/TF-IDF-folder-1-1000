lois mcmaster bujold cryoburn chapter one angels were falling all over the place miles blinked trying to resolve the golden streaks sleeting through his vision into mere retinal flashes but they stubbornly persisted as tiny distinct figures faces dismayed mouths round he heard their wavering cries like the whistle of fireworks from far off the echoes buffeted by hillsides ah terrific auditory hallucinations too granted the visions seemed more dangerous in his current addled state if he could see things that were not there it was also quite possible for him to not see things that were there like stairwells or broken gaps in this corridor floor or balcony railings but wouldnt he feel those pressing against his chest not that he could see anything in this pitch darknessnot even his hands reaching uncertainly before him his heart was beating too fast rushing in his ears like muffled surf his dry mouth gasping he had to slow down he scowled at the tumbling angels peeved if they were going to glow like that they might at least illuminate his surroundings for him like little celestial gravlights but no nothing so helpful he stumbled and his hand banged against something hollowsoundinghad that bit of wall shifted he snatched his arms in wrapping them around himself trembling im just cold yeah thats it which had to be from the power of suggestion since he was sweating hesitantly he stretched out again and felt along the corridor wall he began to move forward more slowly fingers lightly passing over the faint lines and ripples of drawer edges and handlelocks rank after rank of them stacked high beyond his reach behind each drawerface a frozen corpse stiff silent waiting in mad hope a hundred corpses to every thirty steps or so thousands more around each corner hundreds of thousands in this lost labyrinth nomillions that part unfortunately was not a hallucination the cryocombs they called this place rumored to wind for kilometers beneath the city the tidy blocks of new mausoleums on the citys western fringe zoned as the cryopolis did not account for all the older facilities scattered around and underneath the town going back as much as a hundred and fifty or two hundred years some still operational some cleared and abandoned some abandoned without being cleared miless ears strained trying to detect a reassuring hum of refrigeration machinery beyond the bloodsurf and the angels cries now there was a nightmare for himall those banks of drawers bumping under his fingertips concealing not frozen hope but warm rotting death it would be stupid to run the angels kept sleeting miles refused to let what was left of his mind be diverted in an attempt to count them even by a statistically valid samplingandmultiplication method miles had done such a backofthenapkin rough calculation when hed first arrived here on kiboudaini what just five days ago seems longer if the cryocorpses were stacked up along the corridors at a density on average of a hundred per ten meters that made for ten thousand along each kilometer of corridor one hundred kilometers of corridors for every million frozen dead therefore something between a hundred and fifty and two hundred kilometers of cryocorridors tucked around this town somewhere i am so lost his hands were scraped and throbbing his trouser knees torn and damp with blood there had been crawlspaces and ducts hadnt there yes what had seemed like kilometers of them too and more ordinary utility tunnels lit by ceiling tubes and not lined with centuries of mortality his weary legs stumbled and he frozeum stoppedonce more to be sure of his balance he wished fiercely for his cane gone astray in the scuffle earlierhow many hours ago nowhe could be using it like a blind man on old earth or barrayars own time of isolation tapping in front of his feet for those sovividlyimagined gaps in the floor his wouldbe kidnappers hadnt roughed him up too badly in the botched snatch relying instead on a hypospray of sedative to keep their captive under control too bad it had been in the same class of sedatives to which miles was violently allergicor even judging by his present symptoms the identical drug expecting a drowsy deadweight theyd instead found themselves struggling with a maniacal little screaming man this suggested his snatchers hadnt known everything about him a somewhat reassuring thought or even anything about him you bastards are on the top of imperial lord auditor miles vorkosigans very own shit list now you bet but under what name only five days on this benighted world and already total strangers are trying to kill me sadly it wasnt even a record he wished he knew who theyd been he wished he were back home in the barrayaran empire where the dread title of imperial auditor actually meant something to people i wish those wretched angels would stop shrieking at me flights of angels he muttered in experimental incantation sing me to my rest the angels declined to form up into a ball like a willothewisp and lead him onward out of this place so much for his dim hope that his subconscious had been keeping track of his direction while the rest of his mind was out and would now produce some neat inspiration in dramatic form onward one foot in front of the other wasnt that the grownup way of solving problems surely he ought to be a grownup at his age he wondered if he was going in circles his trailing hand wavered through black air across a narrow crosscorridor made for access to the banks supporting machinery which he ignored later another hed been suckered into exploring down too many of those already which was part of how hed got so hideously turned around go straight or if his corridor deadended right as much as possible that was his new rule but then his bumping fingers crossed something that was not a bank of cryodrawers and he stopped abruptly he felt around without turning because turning hed discovered destroyed what little orientation he still possessed yes a door if only it wasnt another utility closet if only it was unlocked for a change unlocked yes miles hissed through his teeth and pulled hinges creaked with corrosion it seemed to weigh a ton but the bloody thing moved he stuck an experimental foot through the gap and felt around a floor not a dropif his senses werent lying again he had nothing with which to prop open the door he hoped he might find it again if this proved another dead end carefully he knelt on all fours and eased through feeling in front of him not another closet stairs emergency stairs he seemed to be on a landing in front of the door to his right steps went up cool and gritty under his sore hand to his left down which way he had to run out of up sooner surely it was probably a delusion if a powerful one that he might go down forever this maze could not descend to the planets magma after all the heat would thaw the dead there was a railing not too wobbly but he started up on all fours anyway patting each riser to be sure the step was all there before trusting his weight to it a reversal of direction more painful climbing another turning at another landinghe tried its door which was also unlocked but did not enter it not unless or until he ran out of stairs would he let himself be forced back in there with those endless ranks of corpses he tried to keep count of the flights but lost track after a few turnings he heard himself whimpering under his breath in time with the angel ululations and forced himself to silence oh god was that a faint gray glow overhead real light or just another mirage he knew it for real light when he saw the pale glimmer of his hands the white ghosts of his shirtsleeves he hadnt become disembodied in the dark after all huh on the next landing he found a door with a real window a dirty square pane as wide as his two stretched hands he craned his neck and peered out blinking against the grayness that seemed bright as fire making his darkstaring eyes water oh gods and little fishes let it not be locked he shoved then gasped relief as the door moved it didnt creak as loudly as the one below could be a roof be careful he crawled again out into free air at last not a roof a broad alley at ground level one hand upon the rough stucco wall behind him miles clambered to his feet and squinted up at slate gray clouds a spitting mist and lowering dusk all luminous beyond joy the structure from which hed just emerged rose only one more storey but opposite it another building rose higher it seemed to have no doors on this side nor lower windows but above dark panes gleamed silver in the diffuse light none were broken yet the windows had an empty haunted look like the eyes of an abandoned woman it seemed a vaguely industrial block no shops or houses in sight no lights security or otherwise warehouses or a deserted factory a chill wind blew a plastic flimsy skittering along the cracked pavement a bit of bright trash more solid than all the wailing angels in the world or in his head whichever he was still he judged in the territorial prefecture capital of northbridge or kitahashi as every place on this planet seemed to boast two interchangeable names to ensure the confusion of tourists no doubt because to have arrived at any other urban area this size he would have had to walk over a hundred kilometers underground in a straight line and while he would buy the hundred kilometers considering how his feet felt right now the straight line part was right out he might even be ironically close to his downtown starting point but on the whole he thought not with one hand trailing over the scabrous stucco partly to hold himself upright and partly from what was by now grim superstitious habit miles turnedrightand stumbled up the alley to its first crosscorricorner the pavement was cold his captors had taken away his shoes early on his socks were in tatters and possibly also his skin but his feet were too numb to register pain his hand crossed a faded graffiti sprayed in some red paint and then imperfectly rubbed out burn the dead it wasnt the first time hed seen that slogan since hed come downside once on an underpass wall on the way from the shuttleport where a cleaning crew was already at work effacing it more frequently down in the utility tunnels where no tourists were expected to venture on barrayar people burned offerings for the dead but miles suspected that wasnt the meaning here the mysterious phrase had been high on his list of items to investigate further before it had all gone sidewaysyesterday this morning turning the corner into another unlit street or access road which was bounded on the opposite side by a dilapidated chainlink fence miles hesitated looming out of the gathering gloom and angelrain were two figures walking sidebyside miles blinked rapidly trying to resolve them then wished he hadnt the one on the right was a tau cetan beaded lizard as tall or short as himself its skin rippled with variegated colored scales maroon yellow black ivorywhite in the collar around its throat and down its belly but rather than progressing in toadlike hops it walked upright which was a clue a real tau cetan beaded lizard squatting might come up nearly to miless waist so it wasnt exceptionally large for its species but it also carried sacks swinging from its hands definitely not real beaded lizard behavior its taller companionwell a sixfoottall butterbug was definitely a creature out of his own nightmares and not anyone elses looking rather like a giant cockroach with a pale pulsing abdomen folded brown wing carapaces and bobbing head it nonetheless strode along on two sticklike hind legs and also swung cloth sacks from its front claws its middle legs wavered in and out of existence uncertainly as if miless brain could not decide exactly how to scale up the repulsive thing as the pair approached him and slowed staring miles took a firmer grip on the nearest supporting wall and essayed cautiously hello the butterbug turned its insectile head and studied him in turn stay back jin it advised its shorter companion he looks like some sort of druggie stumbled in here lookkit his eyes its mandibles and questing palps wiggled as it spoke its male voice sounding aged and querulous miles wanted to explain that while he was certainly drugged he was no addict but getting the distinction across seemed too much of a challenge he tried a big reassuring smile instead his hallucinations recoiled hey said miles annoyed i cant look nearly as bad to you as you look to me deal with it perhaps he had wandered into some talking animal story like the ones hed read over and over in the nursery to sasha and little hellion except the creatures encountered in such tales were normally furrier he thought why couldnt his chemicallyenchanted neurons have spat out giant kittens he put on his most austere diplomats tones and said i beg your pardon but i seem to have lost my way also my wallet my wristcom half my clothes my bodyguard and my mind andhis hand felt around his neckhis auditors sealring on its chain not that any of its overrides or other tricks would work on this worlds comnet but armsman roic might at least have tracked him by its ping if roic was still alive hed been upright when miles had last seen him when theyd been separated by the panicking mob a fragment of broken stone pressed into his foot and he shifted if his eye could pick out the difference between pebbles and glass and plastic on the pavement why couldnt it tell the difference between people and huge insects it was giant cicadas the last time i had a reaction this bad he told the butterbug a giant butterbug is actually sort of reassuring no one elses brain on this planet would generate butterbugs except maybe roics so i know exactly where youre coming from judging from the decor around here the localsd probably go for some jackalheaded fellow or maybe a hawkman in a white lab coat miles realized hed spoken aloud when the pair backed up another step what were his eyes flashing celestial light or glowing feral red just leave jin the butterbug told its lizard companion tugging on its arm dont talk to him walk away slowly shouldnt we try to help him a much younger voice miles couldnt judge if it was a boys or a girls yes you should said miles with all these angels in my eyes i cant even tell where im stepping and i lost my shoes the bad guys took them away from me come on jin said the butterbug we got to get these bags of findings back to the secretaries before dark or theyll be mad at us miles tried to decide if that last remark would have made any more sense to his normal brain perhaps not where are you trying to get to asked the lizard with the young voice resisting its companions pull i dont know miles realized back was not an option till the drug had cleared his system and hed garnered some notion of who his enemies wereif he returned to the cryonics conference assuming it was still going on after all the disruptions he might just be rushing back into their arms home was definitely on the list and up till yesterday at the top but then things had growninteresting still if his enemies had just wanted him dead theyd had plenty of chances some hope there i dont know yet he confessed the elderly butterbug said in disgust then we cant very well send you there can we come on jin miles licked dry lips or tried to no dont leave me in a smaller voice he said im very thirsty can you at least tell me where i might find the nearest drinking water how long had he been lost underground the waterclock of his bladder was not reliablehe might well have pissed in a corner to relieve himself somewhere along his random route his thirst suggested hed been wandering something between ten hours and twenty though he almost hoped for the latter as it meant the drug should start clearing soon the lizard jin said slowly i could bring you some no jin the lizard jerked its arm back you cant tell me what to do yani youre not my parents its voice went jagged on that last come along the custodian is waiting to close up reluctantly with a backward glance over its brightlypatterned shoulder the lizard allowed itself to be dragged away up the darkening street miles sank down spine against the building wall and sighed in exhaustion and despair he opened his mouth to the thickening mist but it did not relieve his thirst the chill of the pavement and the wall bit through his thin clothingjust his shirt and gray trousers pockets emptied his belt also taken it was going to get colder as night fell this access road was unlighted but at least the urban sky would hold a steady apricot glow better than the endless dark below ground miles wondered how cold he would have to grow before he crawled back inside the shelter of that last door a hell of a lot colder than this and he hated cold he sat there a long time shivering listening to the distant city sounds and the faint cries in his head was his plague of angels starting to melt back into formless streaks he could hope i shouldnt have sat down his leg muscles were tightening and cramping and he wasnt at all sure he could stand up again hed thought himself too uncomfortable to doze but he woke with a start some unknown time later to a shy touch on his shoulder jin was kneeling at his side looking a bit less reptilian than before if you want mister jin whispered you can come along to my hideout i got some water bottles there yani wont see you hes gone to bed thats miles gasped that sounds great he struggled to his feet a firm young grip caught his stumble in a whining nimbus of whirling lights miles followed the friendly lizard jin checked back over his shoulder to make sure the funnylooking little man no taller than himself was still following all right even in the dusk it was clear that the druggie was a grownup and not another kid as jin had hoped at first glance he had a grownup voice his words precise and complicated despite their tired slur and his strange accent low and rumbly he moved almost as stiff and slow as old yani but when his fleeting smiles lifted the strain from his face it looked oddly kind in an accustomed way as if smiles were at home there grouchy yani never smiled jin wondered if the little man had been beaten up and why blood stained his torn trouser knees and his white shirt bore browning smears for a plain shirt it looked pretty fancy as ifbefore being rolled around init had been crisp and fine but jin couldnt figure out quite how that effect was done never mind he had this novel creature all to himself for now when they came to the metal ladder running up the outside of the exchanger building jin looked at the bloodstains and stiffness and thought to ask can you climb the little man stared upward its not my favorite activity how far up does this castle keep really go just to the top that would be um two stories he added in a low mutter or twenty jin said just three my hideouts on the roof the hideout part sounds good the man licked at his cracked lips with a drylooking tongue he really did need water jin guessed maybe youd better go first in case i slip i have to go last to raise the ladder oh all right a small square hand reached out to grip a rung up up is good right he paused drew a breath then lurched skyward jin followed as lightly as a lizard three meters up he stopped to crank the ratchet that raised the ladder out of reach of the unauthorized and latch it up another three meters he came to the place where the rungs were replaced by broad steel staples bolted to the buildings side the little man had managed them but now seemed stuck on the ledge where am i now he called back to jin in tense tones i can feel a drop but i cant be sure how far down it really goes what it wasnt that dark just roll over and fall if you cant lift yourself the edgewalls only about half a meter high ah the sock feet swung out and disappeared jin heard a thump and a grunt he popped over the parapet to find the little man sitting up on the flat rooftop fingers scraping at the grit as if seeking a handhold on the surface oh are you afraid of heights jin asked feeling dumb for not asking sooner not normally dizzy sorry jin helped him up the man did not shrug off his hand so jin led him on around the twin exchanger towers set atop the roof like big blocks hearing jins familiar step galli twig and mrs speck and mrs specks six surviving children ran around the blocks to greet him clucking and chuckling oh god now i see chickens said the man in a constricted voice stopping short i suppose they could be related to the angels wings after all quit that twig said jin sternly to the brown hen who seemed inclined to peck at his guests trouser leg jin shoved her aside with his foot i didnt bring you any food yet later you see chickens too the man inquired cautiously yah theyre mine the white one is galli the brown one is twig and the blackandwhite speckled one is mrs speck those are all her babies though i guess theyre not really babies any more halfgrown and molting the brood didnt look too appetizing a fact jin almost apologized for as the man continued to peer down into the shadows at their greeting party i named her galli because the scientific name of the chicken is gallus gallus you know a cheerful name sounding like gallopgallop which always made jin smile makessense the man said and let jin tug him onward as they rounded the corner jin automatically checked to be sure the roof of discarded tarps and drop cloths that hed rigged on poles between the two exchanger towers was still holding firm sheltering his animal family the tent made a cozy space bigger than his bedroom back beforehe shied from that memory he let go of the stranger long enough to jump up on the chair and switch on the hand light hanging by a scrap of wire from the ridgepole which cast a bright circle of illumination over his secret kingdom as good as any ceiling fixtures the man flung his arm up over his reddened eyes and jin dimmed the light to something softer as jin stepped back down lucky rose from the bedroll atop the mattress of shredded flimsies stretched and hopped toward him meowing then rose on her hind legs to place her one front paw imploringly on jins knee kneading her claws jin bent and scratched her fuzzy gray ears no dinner yet lucky that cat does have three legs right asked the man he sounded nervous jin hoped he wasnt allergic to cats yah she caught one in a door when she was a kitten i didnt name her she was my moms cat jin clenched his teeth he didnt need to have added that last shes just a felis domesticus gyre the falcon gave one earsplitting shriek from his perch and the blackandwhite rats rustled in their cages jin called greetings to them all when food was not immediately forthcoming they all settled back in a disgruntled way do you like rats jin eagerly asked his guest ill let you hold jinni if you want shes the friendliest maybe later said the man faintly seemed to take in jins disappointed look and after a squinting glance at the shelf of cages added i like rats fine im just afraid id drop her im still a bit shaky i was lost in the cryocombs for rather a long time today after another moment he offered i used to know a spacer who kept hamsters this was encouraging jin brightened oh your water yes please said the man this is a chair right he was gripping the back of jins late stepstool leaning on it the scratched round table beside it discarded from some cafe and the prize of an alley scavenge had been a bit wobbly but custodian tenbury had showed jin how to fix it with a few shims and tacks yah sit im sorry theres only one but usually im the only person who comes up here you get it cause youre the guest as the man dropped into the old plastic cafeteria chair jin rummaged on his shelves for his liter water bottle uncapped it and handed it over im sorry i dont have a cup you dont mind drinking where my mouth was not at all said the man raised the bottle and gulped thirstily he stopped suddenly when it was about threefourths empty to ask wait is this all your water no no theres a tap on the outsides of each of these old heat exchanger towers ones broken but the custodian hooked up the other for me when i moved all my pets up here he helped me rig my tent too the secretaries wouldnt let me keep my animals inside anymore because the smell and noise bothered some folks i like it better up here anyway drink all you want i can just fill it up again the little man drained the bottle and taking jin at his word handed it back more please jin dashed out to the tap and refilled the bottle taking a moment to rinse and top up the chickens water pan at the same time his guest drank another halfliter without stopping then rested his eyes sagging shut jin tried to figure out how old the man was his face was pale and furrowed with sprays of fine lines at the corners of his eyes and his chin was shadowed with a days beard stubble but that could be from being lost below which would unsettle anybody his dark hair was neatly cut a few gleams of gray showing in the light his body seemed more scaleddown than distorted sturdy enough though his head set on a short neck was a bit big for it jin decided to work around to his curiosity more sideways to be polite whats your name mister the mans eyes flew open they were clear gray in color and would probably be bright if they werent so bloodshot if the fellow had been bigger his seedy looks might have alarmed jin more miles miles vowell the rest is a mouthful no one here seems able to pronounce you can just call me miles and whats your name youngperson jin sato said jin do you live on this roof jin shrugged pretty much nobody climbs up to bother me the lift tubes inside dont work he led on im almost twelve and then deciding hed been polite enough added how old are you im almost thirtyeight from the other direction oh jin digested this a disappointingly old person therefore likely to be stodgy if not so old as yani but then it was hard to know how to count yanis age you have a funny accent are you from around here by no means im from barrayar jins brow wrinkled wheres that is it a city it wasnt a territorial prefecture jin could name all twelve of those i never heard of it not a city a planet a triplanetary empire technically an offworlder jins eyes widened with delight i never met an offworlder before tonights scavenge suddenly seemed more fruitful though if the man was a tourist he would likely leave as soon as he could call his hotel or his friends which was a disheartening thought did you get beaten up by robbers or something robbers picked on druggies drunks and tourists jin had heard he supposed they made easy targets something like that miles squinted at jin you hear much news in the past day jin shook his head only suze the secretary has a working comconsole in here in here this place it was a cryofacility but it was cleared out and abandoned oh way before i was born a bunch of folks moved in who didnt have anywhere else to go i suppose were all sort of hiding out well people living around here know theres people in here but suzesan says if were all real careful not to bother anyone theyll leave us be that um person you were with earlier yani who is he a relative of yours jin shook his head emphatically he just came here one day the way most folks do hes a revive jin gave the word its meaningful pronunciation revive he was cryorevived you mean yah he doesnt much like it though his contract with his corp was just for one hundred yearsi guess he paid a lot for it a long time ago but he forgot to say he wasnt to be thawed out till folks had found a cure for being old since thats what his contract said they brought him up though i suppose his corp was sorry to lose his vote this future wasnt what he was expecting i guessbut hes too old and confused to work at anything and make enough money to get frozen again he complains about it a lot isee i think the little man squeezed his eyes shut and open again and rubbed his brow as if it ached god i wish my head would clear you could lie down in my bedroll if you wanted jin suggested diffidently if you dont feel so good indeed young jin i dont feel so good well put miles tilted up the water bottle and drained it the more i can drink the betterwash this damned poison out of my system what do you do for a loo at jins blank look he added latrine bathroom lavatory pissoir is there one inside the building oh not close sorry usually when im up here for very long i sneak over and use the gutter in the corner and slosh it down the drainpipe with a bucket of water i dont tell the women though theyd complain even though the chickens go all over the roof and nobody thinks anything of it but it makes the grass down there really green ah ha said miles congratulationsyou have reinvented the garderobe my lizardsquire appropriate for a castle jin didnt know what kind of clothes a guardingrobe might be but half the things this druggie said made no sense anyway so he decided not to worry about it and after your liedown i can come back with some food jin offered after a liedown my stomach might well be settled enough to take you up on that yes jin smiled and jumped up want any more water please when jin returned from the tap he found the little man easing himself down in the bedroll laid along the side wall of an exchanger tower lucky was helping him he reached out and absently scritched her ears then let his fingers massage expertly down either side of her spine which arched under his hand the cat deigned to emit a short purr an unusual sign of approval miles grunted and lay back accepting the water bottle and setting it beside his head ah god thats so good lucky jumped up on his chest and sniffed his stubbly chin he eyed her tolerantly a new concern crossed jins mind if heights make you dizzy the gutter could be a problem an awful picture arose of his guest falling headfirst over the parapet while trying to pee in the dark his offworlder guest see chickens dont fly as well as youd think and baby chicks cant fly at all i lost two of mrs specks children over the parapet when they got big enough to clamber up to the ledge but not big enough to flutter down safely if they fell over so for the inbetween time i tied a long string to each ones leg to keep them from going too far maybe i could liketie a line around your ankle or something miles stared up at him in a tilted fascination and jin was horribly afraid for a moment that hed mortally offended the little man but in a rusty voice miles finally said you knowunder the circumstancesthat might not be a bad idea kid jin grinned relief and hurried to find a bit of rope in his cache of supplies he hitched one end firmly to the metal rail beside the tower door made sure it paid out all the way to the corner gutter and returned to affix the other end to his guests ankle the little man was already asleep the water bottle tucked under one arm and the gray cat under the other jin looped the rope around twice and made a good knot after he climbed back onto the chair and dimmed the hand light to a soft nightlight glow trying not to think about his mother sleep tight dont let the bedbugs bite if i ever find bedbugs ill catch them and put them in my jars what do bedbugs look like anyway i have no idea its just a silly rhyme for bedtimes go to sleep jin the words had used to make him feel warm but now they made him feel cold he hated cold satisfied that hed made all safe and that the intriguing offworlder could not now abandon him jin returned to the parapet swung over and started down the rungs if he hurried he would still get to the back door of ayakos cafe before all the good scraps were thrown out at closing time chapter two when armsman roic woke for the second timeor maybe it was the thirdthe opaque drugmush in his head had cleared to a thin throbbing haze he felt for his wristcom and found it unsurprisingly gone groaning he turned on his musty mattress thrown on the floor of thisplace and opened his eyes to plain daylight and his first clear view of his prison it was bare of furnishings some kind of old hotel room he decided after a minute from the shape stains outlets corrodedlooking sprinkler overhead and cheap light above the only door his mattress lay in what might once have been a clothes niche opposite a small working bathroom with the door removed a chain bolted around his ankle led in turn to a bolt on the wall the links were long enough to let him use the facilities he remembered that from the blurry night but not to reach the outer door he visited them again and hoping to wash out more of the mush drank thirstily from a flimsy plastic cup apparently left for his use a long narrow window stretched above a stained bathtub he stared out onto a featureless rise crowded with tall arrowshaped conifers dark and tangled he rapped on the glass it gave back that dull tone that said unbreakable at least by anyone not armed with a power drill or perhaps a plasma arc he tested the length of his chain it didnt go even halfway to the door but by standing upright he found he could see out the front picture window unobscured by curtains or a polarizing filter they must not expect visitors this room seemed to open onto a secondstorey gallery the view beyond the railing ran downhill to a broad patch of flat scrub that curved out of sight framed by more tangled taiga not another building to be seen he wasnt in the city any more that was certain had there been any urban glow on the horizon last night he could only remember the nightlight in the loo he could be ten kilometers from northbridge or ten thousand for all he knew which could make a difference later he folded his considerable length back onto the mattress and began working at the bolt in the wall the only item even remotely resembling a weak point it didnt budge and his big fingers could scarcely get a purchase on the annoying little thing if only he could get it started wriggling how t devil did i end up in this mess he imagined armsmancommander pym critiquing his actions of yesterday and cringed this was a thousand times worse than the infamous bug butter debacle yet it had all started so benignly four weeks ago if abruptly but there was nothing new to thatlord auditor vorkosigans galactic assignments from emperor gregor usually arrived abruptly after a dozen offworld trips in mlords wake roic was getting practiced at the scramble to arrange mlords luggage in his role of sometimebatman mlords and his own travel documents in his role as personal assistantthe job title roic traveled under as explaining the ancient and honorable rank of armsman to galactics was always a losing gameand mlords security andthough mlord almost never discussed this aloudprivate medtech for mlords lingering health issues the competent vorkosigan house staff under the even more competent supervision of lady ekaterin vorkosigan had actually relieved him of the first of these tasks canceling his own affairs had cost more of a pang as hed just worked up the courage to invite miss pym down to hassadar to meet his parents for the first time but as an armsmans child aurie had understood perfectly courting his commanders daughter had been an oblique process this past year rather like those earth insects lady vorkosigan had described where the male approached with painful caution lest he be mistaken for a meal by his intended but it was armsmancommander pym who would tear off roics head and eat it if he made a misstep still in less than a day theyd boarded the shuttle for orbital transfer to the jumpship and began three boring if comfortable weeks of travel to new hope ii or kiboudaini as it was called by the locals to distinguish it from two other planets and a transfer station of the same name in the wormhole nexus kibou for short thankfully mlord accustomed from his old days in imperial security not to waste travel time had handed roic quantities of homework about their destination and himself plunged into even larger and more classified reports roic himself couldnt figure this gig out granted lord vorkosigan was the only person roic knew who had actually died and been cryorevived making him the handson expert in the subject among gregors auditors the emperors personal stable of troubleshooters and he knew his galactics no question there and he had just successfully concluded in his other hat as thecounthisfathers voting proxy to the council of counts several years on committees devoted to upgrading barrayaran law on reproductive technologies to galactic standards cryonics roic supposed was the other end of these lifetech issues and so a logical extension but the northbridge invitational conference on cryonics hosted by a consortium of kiboudaini cryorevival corporations had proved as harmless a hotelfull of mistyeyed science boffins and wellfed lawyers as roic had ever seen dont underestimate the viciousness of academics when funding is at stake mlord had said when roic had pointed this out nor attorneys command of ambush tactics yeah but they dont generally use stunners or needlers roic had returned its all words my skills seem wasted when they start firing off those paragraph grenades id rather hunker down behind you hed spoken too soon it seemed hed sat in on every program mlord had attended in the back of the room where he could watch all the exits and been hardput to stay awake though mlord recorded everything indiscriminately he followed mlord to meals with other attendees and to lavish evening parties provided by the conferences sponsors at varying distances from looming over mlords short shoulder to leaning against the far wall as mlord signaled he learned far more about cryonics and the people who dealt with it than he had ever wanted to know and he had just about come to the conclusion that the entire jaunt was a putup job between lady vorkosigan and empress laisa to give ekaterin a muchneeded holiday from a spouse who diagnosed all complaints as a sign of boredom to be alleviated with an exciting new task since lady vorkosigan already ran an enormous household rode herd on four children under the age of six and a teenage son from a prior marriage played political hostess for her husband in his roles both as an imperial auditor and as the counts heir had undertaken supervisory responsibilities for agriculture and terraforming in the vorkosigans district and tried desperately in her spare seconds to maintain a garden design business bets were on belowstairs as to when she would break and respond to mlords idea of husbandly help by defenestrating the little man from the fourth floor of vorkosigan house this trip seemed a reasonable substitute to roic but even the most loyal armsman had to go to the loo sometimes which was why economy be hanged roic argued constantly for a backup man or better two on these excursions hed returnednight before lastor had he lost more than one day in this dazed captivityto the main room of the reception to discover mlord gone though a quick ping found him up a floor past some winding stairs in an even more private section of the party their wristcoms ran a scrambled security channel no comehereiwantyou code called so roic jittered impatiently and controlled his nerves when mlord at last trod back down the winding stairs spotted roic and joined him tugging down his cuffs in a selfsatisfied way his appearance was anything but reassuring to anyone who knew him well that is it was the manic glitter in his eyes and the fleeting smile and the general air of elation the damndest things could elate him what roic had murmured in alarm and later mlord had replied the walls have ears roic had to grind his teeth till midnight found them back in their shared room where mlord unpacked the antibug silencer for the first time and his message encoder as well he sat at the rooms sole desk and began typing and so asked roic why do you look so happy all of a sudden ive had my very first break in this case after days of dead time someone just tried to bribe me roic stiffened an attempt to bribe an imperial auditor could warrant the death penalty on barrayar but were not on barrayar mores the pity erand this is a good thing where theres smoke theres fire they say mlord continued cheerfully keying in whatever he was composing for imperial eyes only or maybe mirrors mind you it was a subtle and elegant bribe im almost glad im not dealing with idiots here oh laisa you were right you were right however did your cute komarran nose know what did you say asked roic anxiously thats right you were never in a galactic mercenary outfit or covert ops they both have tested policies for bribes back in my old fleet the rule was accept everything register it with command and go do exactly what you were going to do anyway covert ops was similaraccept and follow up as far as the string leads because strings run two ways you know play it out pull it insee whats on the other endhah he finished his entries with a flourish what kind of bribe roic pressed orshould i not know please dont make me work in t damned dark some very interesting stock options in the shiragikushathe white chrysanthemum cryonics corporation in full whitechrys is the company in process of establishing a franchise on komarr you know i could get in on the ground floor at a very favorable rate it seems in fact they would lend me the money at no interest to be paid back after my value doubles because what could be better for them than to boast a local stockholder with my insanely high connections though i am not curiously enough offered voting stock the votes are reserved for their subzero patrons of all the brainbending twists of democracy roic had encountered even worse than the secondary market in komarran planetary voting shares it was kiboudainis custom of votes by the dead that most made his head hurt proxies naturallyleft in the hands of the cryocorps that shepherded their frozen charges into an unknown and curiously receding future because if you were going to trust a company with your death and next life your vote was a small thing in comparison it had doubtless mlord had remarked crisply upon first learning this fact seemed a good idea at the time two three hundred years ago when new hopes strange burial customs as roic could not help thinking of them were just beginning to gain popularity heh muttered mlord and sent his message on its coded and circuitous way roic knew that heh it gave him cold chills and so to bed to rise and face the last day of the conference which had gone as near as roic could tell as no one had expected not even mtwisty lord and now oh god hed gone and lost the little maniac or had he belatedly he wondered if mlord had been captured in the melee in the lobby as well he could be here roic abandoned the bolt and shuffled over to rap three times three on his rooms side wall again nothing he tried the other side of the room though he had to stretch to reach silence the adjoining rooms could be empty or his fellow captives still too drugged to hear or answer or maybe it was his captors over there and hed just alerted them of his return to consciousness damn try again later he went back to working on his bolt which was producing blisters on his fingers but no discernable loosening and brooded hed only taken his eyes off mlord for a moment and then his old street guard reflexes had cut in as hed hustled at least halfadozen potential kidnap victims into a lift tube and escape because they were unarmed civilians but that wasnt his job even though no one else was doing it hed sure won a whole lot of angry attention from their attackers by that at least till the stunner beam had caught him maybe mlord escaped and will rescue me an embarrassment roic decided that he could happily live with at the sudden clack of the door being unbolted he started and dropped his hands hastily to his lap the door opened and a skinny young man with lank dark hair and a slitted eye set in a swollen magentaandpurple contusion eased through and stared for a suspicious moment at roic seated on his mattress he limped forward to just beyond the arc of roics chain set some sort of commercial reddimeal tray on the floor and pushed it toward roic with what appeared to be a broom handle the tray was still sealed so roic was not to be starvedor poisoned dont make premature assumptions he could almost hear mlords voice intone roic realized he was terrifically hungry but he made no move toward the tray ive seen you before roic said suddenly in the hotel lobby up close things had been happening too fast at the time for roic to tell if the snatch had been an amateur or a pro job but thinking back he guessed a mix the marksman whod clocked him with the stunner had been cool enough yet the mob of men assigned to control and cart away captives well they sure hadnt been up to roics idea of a standardmilitary paramilitary or youth scout troop it had been a mass snatch however therefore not targeted especially upon barrayaransmlords ego would be wounded at thatbut roic wasnt sure if it made things more or less of a puzzle the skinny man touched his swollen eye and stepped back a pace scowling it seemed he remembered roic too who are you people anyway asked roic why tdevil did you kidnap meus skinnys head jerked up his good eye lit were the new hope legacy liberators because this generationhe thumped his fist on his chestis finally doing what it takes to stand up to the powergrubbing corps theyve grown so fat and corrupt theres no choice left but to burn the whole rotten structure to the ground and start over were standing up to bite the dead hand of the past that grinds us into the dust roic squinted in dismay as skinny impassioned if garbled elaborated on this theme the nhll appeared to be some sort of local political action group who grown frustrated at their inability to win verbal argumentsif this was a sample roic could see whywere trying to up the ante with physical demonstrations bits and pieces from more considered critiques of local affairs that roic had overheard at the conference bobbed by in the torrent of complaint but the gist of harangue seemed to be that skinny and his fellows were busted and down on their luck and they figured that if only dead people didnt persist in owning everything in sight there would be more left for the living the corps and the corpses seemed muddled together in skinnys head roic refrained from pointing out that actually the wealth of kiboudaini was being managed by live people in the name of the dead ones and even if those were replaced by different live people it seemed improbable that anyone would choose the nhll for the task burn the dead skinny finished in much the tone that one might say amen at the end of a rote prayer burn bury freeze roic didnt see much to choose except for the loss of some recycled organics but whats that got tdo with us said roic plaintively we dont vote here were leaving next week are you after ransom skinny made a gesture of proud denial no but were determined that the nexus will know of the injustice and suffering and theft on kibou no onenot you galactics not the complacent old salaryfolk fat sheep dreaming only of their own meat lockers not our own oppressed generation planetwidewill remain in ignorance after this no matter how they shut their eyes and ears ah said roic publicity stunt huh roic would have preferred ransom actually mlord could have arranged it in a heartbeat as soon as he was allowed to contact the barrayaran consul here and doubtless some sneaky way of recovering the money afterward too and yet roic had never heard of a political fringe group that wasnt strapped for cash it could be ransom he essayed cautiously or even reward depending skinny looked scornful but maybe give the idea time to work roic had more pressing concerns lord vorkosigant fellow i work for you cant mistake him top of his head would be about level with your shoulder carries a cane talks a blue streakis he here was that blank look feigned roic wasnt sure he went on more urgently because if he is youve got to put us in a room together im his private medtech and he needs me he gets these terrible seizures hes a very important vor lord back on barrayar theyd pay a lot to get him back unharmed but if he dies on you well youve no idea how ugly it could get roic wasnt sure how far to push this theme mlord had presumably been keeping a low profile here for a reason and roic didnt want to run the ransom price up inadvertently lord vorkosigans postcryorevival seizures actually consisted of him sinking down shivering with his eyes rolled back for a couple of minutes in an unattractive manner and then waking up very very cranky the fits were unlikely to be fatal at least since lady vorkosigan had extracted his promise never ever to attempt to drive himself in any powered vehicleground car aircar lightflyer shuttle or mode unnamed horses and bicycles had been a compromise and though mlord hated the helmets he did comply skinny didnt need to know this however so roic embroidered the medical facts to the limit of his invention till skinny doubt growing in his eyes weakened and said all right ill ask he addedas no professional would havei didnt see anyone who looked like that guy here though skinny withdrew leaving roic thinking uhhuh minion not master skinny seemed a type roic had met often in his early days as a street guard in the vorkosigan district capital of hassadar while not reliable enough to be put in charge of anything more complicated than a dishwasher they were very easy to convince that all their troubles were someone elses fault roic knew this because they used to tell him so at great and often incoherent length while he was hauling them somewhere safe to sleep off their current binge of drink or drugs or arguments that didnt mean they couldnt be truly dangerous especially when they found themselves in over their heads and it didnt take a very deep pool of troubles to manage that either his own pool seemed an abyss right now did the legacy liberators plans for their captives include killing them one by one till their demands were met our fringe loonies on barrayar sure would roic thought semiproudly yet the affair had been oddly bloodless so farstunners and sleepydrugs not needlers and nerve gas but maybe maybedare he hopemlord wasnt in their queue because if mlord died on roics watch there would be nothing for it but to file the testimony by secured comlink and slit his own throat right here death would be better than making that report to certain persons in person he pictured the faces of count and countess vorkosigan of lady ekaterin hearing the news of commander pym of aurie he imagined sasha and little helen five years oldhed have to kneel to look them in the eyewheres papa roic he lacked a suitable blade hed heard of prisoners choking themselves by swallowing their own tongueshe curled his experimentallybut he doubted it would work for him there was the wall strong enough to hold that damned bolt certainly could he run against that wall hard enough to break his own sturdy neck it seemed premature but it was something to keep in mind mlord now he was very big on getting a good meal on board before making lifeordeath decisions and so was mlady come to think roic sighed crawled over and collected his reddimeal miles woke in a blink to broad daylight a canvas roof and a curious feline face staring into his from a cats breath away glad to discover the weight on his chest was not some alarming new medical condition he lifted the threelegged beast off and gingerly sat up postdrug headache check fatigue check no screaming angels doublecheck and an exclamation point or two his vision seemed clear of all unrealities and his surroundings though odd were not out of any nightmare he owned he pushed his blanket aside and looked around the rooftop refuge all of the castlelike details had faded to be replaced by a utilitarian flat quadrangle with a couple of exchanger towers supporting the canvas room or barn or zoo in addition to the birdofprey on its perch elegant and haughty and clearly the vor lord of all it surveyed some battered metal shelving displayed the cages harboring the blackandwhite rat collection along with several glasswalled terrariums though most of their occupants were out of sight behind artfullyarranged vegetation he was fairly sure he saw a turtle along the wall opposite his bedroll three boxes lined with shredded flimsies made nests for the chicken population twig the brown hen still dozed in hers miles eyed the clothesline still tied around his ankle have i been collected hed known worse fates and here was his zookeeper jin sitting at the little round table turned around and smiled at him oh good youre awake freed of an upwhacked brain chemistrys reimaging jin proved a skinny kid just shy of puberty with a shock of straight black hair in need of a cut and bright brown eyes his features typical of the multiracial blends of the local founder populations he was dressed in a shirt too large for him the sleeves rolled up and the shirttail trailing down over a pair of baggy shorts worn sport shoes without socks slopped on his feet would you like breakfast jin asked i have fresh eggs this morningthree of em a proud young farmer miles could see that eggs loomed in his near future in a bit id like to wash up first wash said jin as if this were a novel notion do you have any soap miles went on i dont expect you have any depilatory jin shook his head at this last but jumped up to rummage on his crowded shelves and came up with a bar of rather dry soap a plastic basin and a grayish towel miles had to ask for jins help unknotting the safety line then accepted the soap and supplies with thanks and shuffled around the exchanger tower to the working water tap where he stripped off his clothes what was left of them knelt and managed a wash and rinse not only of his face but head and whole body including a good soaping of his sore feet and knees the latter were contused and scabbed this morning but showed no sign of infection good jin tagged along to watch frowning curiously at the pale scars lacing his torso miles slid back into his ragged and somewhat smelly garb combed his hair with his fingers and shuffled back to sink gratefully into the lone chair toward which his young host gestured him jin set a metal pot of water to boil on an ordinary if battered rechargeable camp heater the boys rooftop realm was clearly furnished out of backalley scavenges but some fruitful ones the water heated quickly and jin slipped his three eggs precious treasures gently in twig laid the brown one jin informed miles and galli the other two theyre fresh last night and i have salt jin bustled about and produced a couple of plastic plates the bottle of water refilled and ready for sharing between them and half a loaf of what proved to be surprisingly excellent bread if a trifle dry with an air of confession jin lowered his voice eggs come out of chickens butts you know yes i knew that miles returned gravely we have earth chickens and other birds where i come from too jin relaxed oh good some people get upset when they first find that out some people think barrayar is a primitive world miles offered jin brightened does it have many animals yes the usual earth imports atop its own native ecosystem the native animals are mostly small like bugs though there are larger creatures in the seas do people fish not in the seas in stocked lakes yes the barrayaran plants and animals are mostly toxic to humans jin nodded wisely around here the native stuff they first found on the equator was mostly microorganisms they figure thats where the oxygen came from before the last big freeze they set up a lot of earth plants to follow the melting glaciers north and south but not many animals kiboudaini is a lot like komarrthats the second planet of my empire miles said a cold world being slowly terraformed sergyarthats the third worldyoud probably like it it has a fullydeveloped native ecosystem and lots of amazing animals or so my mother tells me its only been colonized in the last generation so scientists are still finding out new things about the biota jin looked at miles more warmly it seemed he had just risen in the boys estimationwere adults who could make sensible conversation rare in jins world perhaps for a certain value of sensible equating to zoological apparently i dont suppose you have any coffee or tea miles said without much hope jin shook his head i have a couple of cola bulbs though he darted back to his shelves to return with a pair of bright plastic drink bulbs except theyre warm miles took one up and squinted at the ingredients label a vile concoction of cheap sugars and chemicals and decided he couldnt manage this before breakfast even if one of the chemicals might be caffeine so when did you grow so nice my lord auditor or was it grow so old the eggs bread and water would be challenge enough for his queasy stomach he shook his head nothanks and set the bulb down the eggs were still simmering miles looked around and said interesting place this not at all like anything ive been shown on kibou so far not with the cryocorps stagemanaging the tours certainly how many other people live here jin shrugged a hundredtwo hundred im not sure suzesan would know miless eyebrows rose that many they stayed out of sight well he supposed a community of illegal squatters would have to be discreet in order to last how did you come here another shrug i just found it or it found me a couple of folks out collecting tripped over me sleeping in a park and sort of collected me too a tradition it seemed do you have other family here no an atypically short response from the chattylonelychild family anywhere my dads dead a hesitation my moms frozen a distinction with a difference on this planet siblings i have a little sister somewhere with relatives that last word had almost been spit out miles controlled his brows maintaining an empty inviting silence she was too little to take with me jin went on a bit defensively and she didnt understand anything that was going on anyway and what was er going on the shrug again jin jumped up oh the eggs are done so was jin an orphan a runaway both miles dimly thought kiboudaini maintained the sort of childrens social services usual to technologically advanced planets if perhaps not up to the relentless standards of say beta colony jin was a mystery but not alas the most pressing one on his hands this morning jin rolled hot eggs onto their plates making sure miles got the special brown one and miles kept the wits not to argue about his guestly doubleportion jin handed over a restaurant packet of salt from someplace called ayakos cafe and they divided the bread and shared the water excellent said miles around a mouthful couldnt be fresher jin smiled miles swallowed a bite of bread and said so you said someone around here had a comconsole would they let me use it suzesan jin nodded she might if you get to her early in the day when shes not so grouchy he added more reluctantly i could take you was he regretting untying that anklerope id like that very much thanks its rather important to me the impretendingidontcare shrug again as if the only way jin could imagine keeping any living thing was by tying it up and feeding it lest it run away and never be seen again jin bustled about after breakfast to feed meat shreds to the falcon bread bits to the chickens and other carefully sorted scraps to the rats and the residents of the glass boxes he cleaned cages and swished out and refilled water pans with fresh drinks all round miles was quietly impressed with his thoroughness though the boy might have also been dragging his feet reluctant to end this visit in due course and feeling much stronger and less dizzy miles followed his guide cautiously down the ladder once more chapter three miles trailed jin through another unlocked metal door down some stairs into a disturbingly darkened corridor through a utility tunnel and into yet another building subliminal sounds and smells as well as better lighting suggested this one was occupied and indeed around another turn they came to what had obviously once been an employee kitchen and cafeteria about a dozen people lingered there some cooking some eating all watched in wary silence as the pair passed except for a young woman working at an industrialsized mixer who spotted jin waved a large spoon in the air and called him to breakfast jin faltered sniffing at the aroma of baked goods wafting from her vicinity but then smiled and shook his head later ako i got a guest miles stared back over his shoulder as jin drew him onward along a corridor two flights up they passed a row of doors to what formerly miles thought might have been offices but now seemed to be living quarters through the open ones he saw filtered daylight and piles of personal junk variously tidy or messy the sort of shabby battered goods that only folks who feared they couldnt get more would ever use or save the people he glimpsed seemed to be mostly dozing in bedrolls on the floor or puttering quietly a few residents squinted back at miles as they passed while they seemed a mix of ages a disproportionate number were elderly maybe the ablebodied young ones like akothecook were out doing things this place was drawing power and water enough to maintain decency if not such luxuries as lift tubes no signs of buckets used as chamber pots stairwells doubling as urinals or cookfires set in wastebaskets or bathtubs so where was the power coming from and the sewage going to was someone here paying for utilities or were they being secretly siphoned from the municipal systems the answers miles thought might be revealing if only he had time to pursue them up another floor lay a corridor with fewer doors jin stopped at one on the end and knocked briskly he waited a minute leaning his shoulders on the wall and swinging one foot then rapped again louder yah yah a gruff voice sounded from within i hear you dont get your undies in a knot the door opened a handspan miles dropped his gaze to not much higher than his own eyelevel and found a seamed face scowling back at him whats this the grumbling voice demanded sharply oh its you jin what are you doing bringing a stranger up here yani and i found him last night said jin he was lost the redrimmed eyes narrowed what is that yanis druggie miles cleared his throat conscious of his piratical beard stubble drugged maam but not a druggie i had an unfortunate allergic reaction to some medication in the course of which i was robbed and stumbled into the cryocombs it took me quite a while to find my way out again youre not from around here no maam jin jumped in he wants to use your comconsole suzesan the scowl deepened you cant call out on it it only inloads this seemed unlikely to miles but for starters he would take whatever he could get it was plain this suze really didnt like him here an untrusted outsider who saw too much could come to a bad end in a secretive community granted he hadnt spotted any bully boys but murder didnt take muscle slyness would do as well i just want to check the news maam till i get my wallet and ids back i have to beg kindness from strangers suze snorted you find many kindly strangers where you come from ive always found enough a dozen times over miless life had been handed back to him by people he barely knew i figure it gives me an obligation to take my turn being one huh said suze jinni and lucky both like him jin testified in anxious aid thin lips quirked oh well if the rat and the cat both agree who am i to argue after another moment the door swung open and jin shooed him in suze might have been any age from a hardworn eighty to a wellpreserved century she had certainly miles thought been a head taller a couple of decades back now she would need sturdy shoes to top five feet but instead wore flat plastic sandals that snapped her dryskinned heels as she stepped that head was covered with frizzed and unruly gray curls she might have seemed younger if shed smiled but the frowngrooves were deeply set around her pursed mouth her loose trousers shirt and overshirt were not a set but being black black and black they could not mismatch her quarters consisted of two rooms an antechamber filled with much the same sort of junk storage miles had glimpsed belowstairs might once have been the domain of some receptionist the room beyond a generous corner office with windows on two sides had surely been executive territory a rumpled bedroll lay along one inner wall he spied the comconsole with desk and chair along the other a battered table held a ewer and washbasin damp towels and a faint scent of soap competing with the close oldwoman air of the place the tall storage cupboard doors shut might have held anything a couple of spare swivel chairs a couch leaking stuffing and two armchairs all used office furniture suggested that suze might not be as reclusive as she looked suze gestured him to the comconsole its open thank you maam miles said sliding into the station chair suze and jin watched over his shoulder finding the local news feeds took only moments he selected nexus standard english from a menu of some dozen supported local language options half of which he could not identify although barrayaran russian was most certainly not among them which might come in handy should he need private speech with his bodyguardif roic was still alive as hed suspected yesterday mornings uproar at the cryoconference was well covered the vid commentary as usual was cursory and not too informative but the detailsupplements proved more useful they included a complete list of the kidnapped with pictures and pleas from the local authorities for anyone with information to step forward roic and miles were both on the list as was dr durona unfortunately two different extremist organizations neither of which miles had previously heard ofso much for his impsec reports on kiboudainiwere claiming credit or blame for the kidnappings thats you said jin in excitement pointing to miless face on the holovid miles didnt think it a flattering shot but apparently it was recognizable he wasnt sure if that was a good thing or not just now jin went on miles vorvorvorkaseegain vorkosuhgn miles corrected automatically so you were caught up in that stupid mess said suze galactic are you she was not as unaware of the news as jin interesting the kidnappers seemed to be targeting offworlders a group of us had been assembled in the lobby for a guided tour it was listed on the public schedule so the snatch wasnt necessarily an inside job you just said you were robbed so i was right down to my shoes but the sedative they jabbed me with as they were dragging me off was an unfortunate choice instead of knocking me out it made me manic i broke away why didnt you go back to the hotel well and then there were the hallucinations about ten hours of them i think suze regarded him in deep suspicion miles hoped it sounded too screwy a tale to have been made up nine delegates takenno eight subtracting miles although the kidnappers hadnt confessed to losing him the barrayaran consulate here tiny as it was would surely already have reported this though the message could not yet have arrived home damn admiral miles naismith free mercenary had never owned a home address nor hostages to fortune lord auditor miles vorkosigan did he couldnt not report in and yet what an interesting chance to become temporarily invisible had been handed to him his old covert ops instincts were kicking in and he wasnt at all sure he wanted them he could walk out of here and into any store or restaurant and sooner or later find someone who would let him call and get help and a pickup the call would of course be unsecured and wideopen to anyone else looking for him not limited to the authorities yet if the authorities or at any rate the powerful people who he suspected ran them hadnt drawn his negative attention night before last hed not hesitate to do just that but he was hesitating now suze pulled up a swivel chair and plumped down on it watching more closely as he read on jin shifted from foot to foot growing bored as miles frowning sped through holoscreens of mostly nonuseful data hey suzesan you want me to bring you some cinnamon rolls ako was just getting them out of the oven do they have coffee down there miles asked diverted can you bring me coffee black jin wrinkled his nose i dont know how anybody can stand to drink that stuff its a taste you acquire when youre older rather like an interest in girls suze made a noise in her throat that might have been either a laugh or phlegm jins nose wrinkled further but he bobbed a sort of nod with his whole body and trotted off two coffees suze called after him he waved an acknowledging hand as he thumped out the door miles turned in his chair and looked after himthe boy was out of earshot already nice kid that yah good of you to take him in what do you know about him prime the pump my lord auditor he told me his father was dead and his mother was frozen making him an orphan of sorts i suppose id think his mother would have been too young for longterm cryosequestration usually at that age its only used as a lastditch emergency procedure to hold people till they can be treated as miles had once been he couldnt even add to my cost because despite the imperfections of his revival his life and everything in it for the past decade had been its grant and a gift of the kindness of strangers dont forget them the durona group being about as strange as they came suzes snort this time had a decidedly editorial tone she looked him over and evidently came to some decision in his favor for she went on jins father was killed in a construction accident he didnt have a cryocontract or cryoinsurance so he was denied treatment till it was too late though i expect things were happening brutally fast at the time miles nodded emergency cryotreatment was either fast or useless giving a new meaning to the phrase the quick or the dead there was little point in reviving a body when the mind was irretrievable you might as well just clone the victim and start over jins mother went a little crazy after that launched a campaign for freezing as a universal public right and went after the corps graverobbery as well she became quite the spokeswoman a few years back lawsuits protests then one of her rallies went violentthey never did figure out who was to blame though i have my own suspicionsand she was arrested they rammed though an allegation of mental illnessnot quite a charge of criminally insane because that would have had to meet stricter standardsand some kindly friend of the court offered to fund her freezing till her cure could be discovered miless teeth tightened that chill the opposition did it you could say didnt her relatives protest or anybody her campaign group was broken up by the expenses of it all her relatives were embarrassed by herput at risk of losing their own jobs dont you know i expect they were secretly glad when she was shut up suze eyed him you dont seem especially shocked miles shrugged ive seen a fair number of worlds met a lot of people encountered a variety of systems ive seen worse granted jacksons whole which is run by what are in effect hightech warlords and their thugs has a certain refreshing straightforwardness about its corruption they dont have to pretend their evil is good in order to sell it to voters let me tell you young manthe dirty little secret of democracy is that just because you get a vote doesnt mean you get your choice she sighed though up till twenty thirty years ago it wasnt so bad here there were hundreds and hundreds of cryocorps all run by different people with different ideas so their votebags offset each other then some of them grew big enough to start gobbling up the others not because it was good for kibou or for their cryopatrons or for anyone but their top men in the grip of their greed but just because they could nowadays its down to half a dozen big corps that control most everything plus a few scattered holdouts too small to matter jin called you suze the secretary said miles slowly what are you secretary of her lined face briefly animated by her anger grew more closed this place once it was a closelyheld family corp and i was executive secretary to our chief then we were bought outswallowed up and stripped not because the buyer wanted us but because they wanted to eliminate us who bought it out whitechrys by chance suze shook her head no shinkawa perpetual whitechrys got them later though a twisted smile suggested she thought this justice was cosmic if a little too late but how did you end up living in this shell a lot of us lost our jobs then you know no golden tram rides to retirement for mere employees we had to go somewhere she hesitated other folks drifted in later executive secretary huh i guess you would know where all the bodies were buried she cast him a sharp lookwhat frightened this tough haggish creature but before miles could pursue this line further jin banged back in bearing a laden tray it heldbesides the promised rolls redolent of cinnamon a carton of milk and two mismatched cupsan entire insulated carafe of coffee miles proud of his restraint did not fall on it rabidly but waited for his hostess to serve him she dismayed him with delay by shuffling to her tall cupboard and returning with an unlabeled square glass bottle she poured ashot miles fancied into her own cup and after a pause raised her brows at miles want any freshener er no thanks just coffee it sluiced down his throat tonic enough all on its own jin sat back on the other swivel chair contentedly munching rolls and swiveling with a steady squeaksqueaksqueak that made suze wince and take a long swallow of her doctored drink her scowl returned contemplating miles he wasnt sure what hed said to wind her up just when hed thought he was winning her favor clearly she wasnt merely someone lucky enough to have salvaged a working comconsole but a leader of sorts in this odd secret community jin can take you to ayakos cafe she said suddenly you can call your friends to come get you from there jin sat up and protested but i havent shown him how gyre flies yet he cant stay here jin jin wilted it was plain suze liked miles even less as a kidnapped conference delegate than as a mere lost tourist with a weakness for recreational hallucinogens he decided to try another lure i came to that conference to learn about kiboudainis cryolaw and science but actually ended up being handfed some very slick pitches for various cryocorps franchises after four days of it a lot of the delegates were ready to sign contracts on the spot in a way the extremists attack was a fortunate misfortune i was sent here by my employer to make a complete report on your cryonics system but it seems i was missing some rather large pieces then youd best be on your way to hunt for them hadnt you and what kind of piece are you to be sure puzzle actually now the conference is over my time is my own but i could use another day of rest from yesterdays ordeal if jin is willing although i do need to report in to one fellow jin if i gave you directions do you think you could handcarry a letter across town for me and give it to a man jin perked up sure uhmaybe what part of town east side umyah i could do that miles decided to ignore the faint tinge of doubt in his voice where are we now by the way south side said jin go yourself said suze ill give you the tubetram fare just dont come back and when the police ask me where ive been what shall i tell them her face grew grimmer tell them you were lost i couldif it were worth my while the snort this time was savage if we had money for bribes would we be here you mistake my meaning maam my coin is information although you know youre the second person on kibou whos tried to bribe me is this some sort of local custom her mouth worked who was the first whitechrys impressive it impressed me although not in the way they intended small gifts are for selling things large gifts are for hiding things it made me very very curious so did you take your large gift vorkosigansan he did not bother correcting it to vorkosigansama or possibly dono at least she had the pronunciation right at that level a scornful no is not only shortsighted but potentially dangerous i think a day or two of rest here might be good for my health and how do i know that letter to your friend wont bring more trouble down on us it wont if i say not i outrank him her lips twisted yah you have that swagger dont you and suze had undoubtedly seen a lot of upper management swagger in her time miles wondered if her bosses had realized how closely they were observed jin had been following this exchange with anxious squeakings of his chair i could take his letter suze i dont mind a bit miles opened a hand to suze half persuasion half plea think it through you lose no secrecy you havent lost alreadyhe cut the unless you propose to have me murderedno point in planting suggestionsand you gain my gratitude and whats that worth on barrayar quite a lot but they were not as roic had several times pointed out on barrayar ill think of something her eyebrows signaled severe skepticism but she spoke instead to jin didnt yani tell you to leave him out there see what trouble comes of good deeds jin miles wasnt sure if this counted for a yea or a nay but she heaved a sigh and went on take vorkosigansan down to the storerooms and find him something to write with and on jin shot eagerly to his feet miles made his thanks and followed him out before suze could change her mind jin watched shifting from foot to foot as milessan as hed decided to think of him because that last name was a jawbreaker sorted through the few halfempty boxes of notepaper on the shelf in the storeroom it was mostly the kind that old ladies used for writing formal thankyou notes decorated with flowers and such though jin eyed one that bore puppies with a certain covetousness with a quirk of his eyebrows the little man made his selection then turned to testing pens from the box of assorted discards he found two that worked stuck them in his pocket and looked around this place looks like a junk shop or the attic of vorkosigan house whenever anybody has findings that they dont want they bring them down here for anybody to use jin explained or else whenum when they go downstairs to tenbury for the last time but he couldnt say that he wasnt sure he was even supposed to know that milessans gaze caught ah shoes he limped over to the pile jin tagged along and helpfully also began sorting the galactics feet were a little smaller than his own but then jin had had to find replacement shoes here just a month ago when his toes had pushed through his last pair like spring shoots through soil the ladies fancy shoes were all useless even to most of the ladies here and tended to accumulate but miles found a pair of sport shoes that fit at last they were a girly flowered print but he didnt seem to notice as he shoved them on and fastened the straps thats better now i can move he turned scanning the stores more closely huh canes he went to the collection leaning in a corner and picked though it passing up some sturdy medical ones with multiple rubber feet and others that were too long he made his final choice by sweeping them around like swords and thwacking them against the wall so that jin wasnt sure if he was looking for a prop or a weapon but just in case it was the former jin led him back to his rooftop home by the inside route up the emergency stairs and out the exchanger tower door milessan took over the table and chair set out his paper and frowned face intent the he bent and began scratching with the pen with occasional long thoughtful pauses jin had cleaned out the chickens boxes counted the chicks just in case any had found the parapet again and brushed lucky before the man finished writing sealed the note and looked up squinting around do you have a clean sharp knife or pin or needle ill look jin eventually found a little scalpel in the halfamedicinekit hed once collected and handed it over milessan eyed it shrugged and to jins alarm poked his thumb with the sharp end after squeezing out a drop of blood he bent and pressed it over the flap leaving a clear thumbprint across the line which he then circled and initialed yah wow said jin whyd you do that dna thumbprints as good a mark as my grandfathers sealdagger better they didnt do dna scans in his day after all one couldnt expect the attache to bestir himself for just any anonymous note off the street he then proceeded to give jin a rather complicated set of directions for after hed reached the east side which he made jin recite back the result made him sigh and bend again to write the mans name and address on the outside of the envelope after all i expect youll get there one way or another dont give this into the hand of anyone but lieutenant johannes or consul vorlynkin mind its very private jin promised this and went to find his box of coins fishing out enough for the tubetram fare both ways it didnt leave much is that your whole bank milessan asked peering over his shoulder jin nodded well if you make my delivery youll get it back jin wasnt sure how much store to set by this but he nodded anyway in turn he gave milessan a set of instructions should any animal emergencies arise while he was gone which made the man blink a little but he recited them back flawlessly jin tucked the letter inside his shirt cast one last doubtful look over his shoulder and descended the ladder jin was nervous on the tubetram afraid people were looking at him but no one seized him by the arm and dragged him to security he almost lost himself in the big transfer station downtown the east side routes being unfamiliar to him but he kept his eyes rigidly on the wall maps and made an effort to not look panicked helpful people could be as dangerous to him as suspicious ones he found the right tube and the right stop at last a sixblock walk without too many turns brought him to his destination the neighborhood was full not of tidy apartment buildings of the sort hed grown up in but of forbiddingly fine houses in walled gardens several bore shiny brass plaques beside their gates labeling them as planetary embassiesescobars was an especially large and impressive mansion the barrayaran consulate thankfully also clearly labeled was not so intimidating by contrastquite a small house really set close to the street so jin didnt have time to get scared going up the walk no uniformed guards and the decorative iron gate was so low jin might have hopped over it if it hadnt been left invitingly open jin gulped and pressed the buzzer the door was opened by a blond man in shirtsleeves his slim green trousers held up by braces he looked rumpled and tired and in need of a depilatory he stared at jin with lowered brows no solicitors or beggars he said unencouragingly he had the same rumbly accent as milessan and jin realized to his dismay that not all barrayarans were short this man was very tall please sir im a messenger i have a letter for lieutenant johannes or consul vor um vorlynkin from milessans brief description of the lieutenant jin thought this might be him but did lieutenants answer doors further jin thought with some outrage milessan had called him a nice kid not a scary grownup though he supposed lieutenants had to be grownups im johannes jin reached inside his shirt the man tensed but eased again when jin drew out the letter from milessanfrom mr vorkosigan jin was careful with the pronunciation shit jin flinched lieutenant johannes then terrified him further by grabbing his arm dragging him into the front hall and slamming the door shut he snatched the letter held it up to the light then tore it open pausing only to shout up the stairway stefin he began running his eyes down the neat tightlywritten lines alive oh thank god were saved a second grownup somewhat older and even taller than the first clattered down the stairs he was dressed like any northbridge businessman right down to the hakamalike trousers except that his widesleeved haori coat hung open and he looked as squintyeyed and tired as the lieutenant what trev look at this a letter from lord vorkosiganhes free the second man looked over his shoulder and echoed thank god but why didnt he call in then after a moment more what what the lieutenant turned the letter over and they both read on is he insane the older man cast jin a very narrow look stirring up all jins worst fears policemen loomed in his imagination is this real the older man demanded jin bent picked up the fallen envelope and held it out mutely he swallowed and managed he said youd like the thumbprint he said it would be just like his grandfathers seal is that blood um yah the older man handed the envelope to the lieutenant take that downstairs and check it yes sir trevsan disappeared through the doorway at the back of the hall after a moment jin heard a door slam and feet thumping down some other stairs excuse me sir are you the consul jin had gained the vague notion that a consul was something like an ambassador but smaller rather like his house really because milessan said only give his letter to the lieutenant or consul vorlynkin he managed to get that last name out without stumbling over his tongue this time jin would have expected an ambassador proper to be stouter and older but this man was lean and not as old as milessan or at least he didnt have any gray in his brown hair im vorlynkin his stare at jin intensified his eyes were very blue like a hot summer sky where did you see lord auditor vorkosigan i um met him last night hed been lost in the cryocombs he said is he all right the answer seemed more complicated than the question but jin decided to skip all that and just reassure him hes much better this morning i gave him eggs vorlynkin blinked and looked at the letter some more if this wasnt a letter in his own handif this isnt a letter in his own handid have you under fastpenta soeh where did you see him um where i live and wheres that he was in trouble now between suze and this alarming stranger he was never supposed to talk to strangers or tell anyone about the facility hed been told that often enough he wondered if he could bolt back out the door and down the walk before the consul could grab him um my place what to his surprise vorlynkin did not pursue this but turned the letter over again what did he seem to be about umhe asked a lot of questions jin thought a moment and offered hes not kidnapped any more you know but why send a child as a courier vorlynkin muttered jin wasnt sure if the question was addressed to him so did not attempt to volunteer an answer it didnt seem the time to explain about almost twelve either he was beginning to think that the less he said the safer he would be the other fellowlieutenant johannes trevsan whateverstumped back into to the entry hall waving the envelope at his boss this parts real now what sir we still have to find his armsman just the samehe seems to think roic was taken no change there with respect to the locals i suppose we have to do exactly what this says but send a holo of the letter to impsec galactic affairs on komarr priority scrambled the lieutenant looked hopeful maybe theyll have an order some other order one that makes more sense not for some days and think who theyd have to go to for an override the two men looked at each other in mysterious perturbation were still on our own here jin diffidently cleared his throat milessan said i was to bring back a reply yes said the consul wait there he pointed to a spindly chair against the wall one of a pair flanking a little bureau with silk flowers atop it and a mirror above both men thumped downstairs again jin sat only the firmness and brevity of that yes gave him the courage not to run away while he had this chance however doubtful they were of jin they seemed to take milessans letter seriously which was a relief he was left alone for a long time he got up once to peer into the rooms flanking the entry hall one was a sort of living room very fancy the other was more severe and officelike no sign of pets not even a bird in a cage or a cat he was glad he hadnt gone poking around searching for any when another man emerged from the back hall looked at him in surprise and said may i help you this fellow spoke in a normal kibou accent at least jin shook his head vigorously lieutenant johannes is seeing to um it me the ease with which jin spun off the lieutenants name seemed to reassure the man oh he said and wandered into the office to sit at the comconsole and begin some sort of work there jin stayed in his seat after that after a great deal more time vorlynkin came back he held another sealed envelope in his hand plain and businesslike much bulkier than the one jin had delivered do you think you can give this back into the hand of lord vorkosiganonly jin stood up i got this far so you did with visible reluctance the consul handed the envelope over jin stuffed it into his shirt once more and lost no time in escaping i didnt understand any of that jin looked back apprehensively as he passed out the iron gate once more but he was glad milessan seemed to have some friends of a sort chapter four as soon as hed seen jin safely over the parapet miles retraced his steps to the basement cafeteria careful to make no wrong turns he was apparently early for lunch as only a few heads turned in suspicion to follow him it occurred to him that he was less conspicuous here in his tattered garb than if hed been wearing his fullon imperial auditor grays a suit so severe as to signal serious person here anywhere in the nexus regardless of the vagaries of local fashion street refugee here was a much better choice for his current needs the scattering of tables was divided from the cooking area by a long serving counter with metal cupboards above he made his way around it to find a sort of large electric samovar promising tea next to the dispenser was a mismatched collection of mugs with a handlettered sign over it wash your cup he couldnt quite tell if these were personally owned or up for grabs which gave him a perfect opening for conversation with the woman evidently akos replacement who was stirring a tenliter pot of soup he addressed her may i use one of these she shrugged go ahead wash it after though she tapped her spoon on the pot rim and laid it aside you new here very new rules are cook what you want clean up after yourself replace what you use contribute money to the pantry when you can sign up on the cleaning duty roster on the front of the fridge thanks just tea for now miles took a sip it was stewed cheap bitter and served his purposes as a prop in both senses you been here long yourself i came with my grandmother it wont be much longer as he was figuring out how to lead her on to parse that a familiar querulous voice sounded from beyond the counter that soup ready yet a tall bent old man stooped to peer through the serving hatch impressive white mustachios drooped down framing his frown and wriggled as he spoke like an insects palps ah another half hour the woman called back just go sit i believe ive met him miles murmured to her name of yani yah thats him yani shuffled in to collect a mug of tea from the dispenser he scowled at miles miles returned a cheery smile good morning yani so youve sobered up good go home yani clutched his mug in two hands to average out the shakes perhaps and shuffled back to one of the tables miles undaunted followed and slid in across from him why havent you gone away asked yani still waiting for my ride so to speak arent we all jin says youre a revive did you really have yourself frozen a century ago that would have been just about at the end of barrayars time of isolation on the verge of a torrent of new history all of which yani had moreorless slept through i would think the oral chroniclers around here would be all over you yani vented a bitter laugh not likely the people here are glutted with revive interviews i thought the journals might pay me but there are too many of us up walking around nobody wants us here everything costs too much the citys too big settlement was supposed to be more spread out hell i thought the terraforming would be halfway to the poles by now the politics have gone all wrong and nobody has any manners miles made encouraging noises if there was one skill miles had honed in his youth it was how to please an old man by listening to his complaints yani needed no more than a nod to launch into a comprehensive denunciation of modern kibou a world with no need nor place for him some of his phrases were so practiced they came out in paragraphs as if hed told them over to anyone who would stop to listen which by this point was no onethe few other residents who drifted in gave yanis table a wide berth his rheumy eye brightened at this new audience who didnt show visible signs of wanting to chew through his own leg to get away and miless suspect druggie status was temporarily forgotten as yani maundered on miles was thrown back in memory to his own grandfather general count piotr vorkosigan planetary liberator unmaker and remaker of emperors and cause of a lot of that history that yani had missed had sired his heir late in life as had miless father so that it was more nearly three generations between grandfather and grandson than two still they had loved each other after their own peculiar fashion how would miless life have altered if piotr had been frozen when miles was seventeen instead of buried for real in the ground his impending return always a promise or a threat like a great tree the old general had been but a tree did not only give shelter from the storm how would barrayar be different if that towering figure had not fallen permitting sunlight to penetrate to the forest floor and new growth to flourish what if the only way to effect change on barrayar had been to violently destroy what had gone before instead of waiting for the cycle of generations to gracefully remove it for the first time the notion occurred to miles that it might not be votegrubbing alone nor even the lack of medical progress in reversing geriatric decay that caused the cryocorps to freeze more patrons than they revived yani had now segued into a long screed about how his cryocorp had cheated him evidently by not delivering him into this new world physically youthful rich and famous which was roughly where miles had come in on this rant yani seemed a timetraveler who had found out the hard way that he did not like his destination any better than his point of departure failed to notice the one common factor was himself and now could not go back so just how many like him were haunting the streets of kibou miles made the emptiness of their mugs an excuse to grab both and take them for refills as he was washing his mug and topping up yanis miles murmured to the cook is it true yani was rejected for being a revive she snorted i daresay nobody wanted him around a hundred years ago either i dont know why he thought that would have changed miles muffled a smile i daresay the halfsmile caught her eye and she looked at him more closely youre not very old are you sick miles blinked do i look that hungover i thought that might be why you were here well i have a chronic medical condition but i dont much care to discuss it how had she guessed a seizure disorder hardly showed on the outside like say skin lesions miles suspected a conversation at crosspurposes again and that hed just been handed a clue so what was it but before he could follow this up she turned away and said oh tenburysan a lot of heads swiveled at the entry of a man in threadbare coveralls a shirt with the sleeves rolled up and an enormous quantity of hair but the looks were mostly followed up with brief nods or friendly waves the greetings were returned as silently the man trod into the kitchen area he shoved his hand into his thatch of browngray beard to scratch his chin greeted the cook with another nod and held out a familiar carafe which she took to rinse and refill with coffee your lunch is all ready tenburysan she called over her shoulder sacks in the fridge the man grunted thanks and went to poke inside the industrial refrigerator he was not miles realized actually of a bearlike build under all the mad hair but lanky and pale he pulled out a cloth sack turned and eyed miles youre new im a friend of jins miles answered not quite directly or at least he collected me really where is the boy i sent him to run an errand for me eh good time he did some work theres a faucet leaking in twoten the cook informed him right right ill bring my tools after dinner said the man he took the carafe and trod out who was that miles asked as the cook picked up her spoon again tenbury hes the custodian here miles dimly remembered that term going by a few times earlier and wondered if its meaning was as far outside the usual as suze the secretarys but if he really wanted to know where the power came from and the sewage went to now was his chance should he wait for jin to broker an introduction miles didnt have infinite time to explore herehis feet were already in motion deciding for him he waved his own thanks to the cook dropped the refilled mug by yani rapped a friendly farewell on the tabletop and made it to the door just in time to tail tenburys receding footsteps the worn rubber soles on miless scavenged shoes were as silent as hed hoped hinges squeaked miles nipped around the corner to discover a door closing again on another stairwell he drew a breath and followed the steps descended into stygian blackness his breath quickened to his intense relief a sudden glow reflected off the walls aheadtenbury had unshipped a hand light so the man didnt see in the dark like a werewolf good at the fourth landing the scrape of a heavy door being shoved open was followed by loss of the reflected light miles sped his steps put out his hands and found the handle he opened this door more cautiously turning sideways to slide through the gap and easing it closed with the minimum sound the bobbing light receded to his right he turned after it thinking of willothewisps luring unwary travelers to their doom as he followed he became aware of tiny twinkles dancing in the corners of his vision like floating fireflies adding to the nightswamp effect he blinked and they resolved into scattered indicator lights green for allswell tacking randomly up the corridor walls on either side reluctantly miles reached out and let his hand trace across the nowfamiliar bumps of closelyset banks of cryodrawers except these were not abandoned and cleared but working or a portion of them were well insulated the drawer faces were at room temperaturethere was no danger of his skin freezing to the surface and trapping him in a growing cocoon of icicleglass really he drew in his hands anyway making his way down the center of the corridor by witchlight he stopped short as at the end of the corridor another door opened ordinary officelablivingquarters glare temporarily blasted his eyes making a nimbus around a hairy head that fortunately did not turn around the door shut and miles was plunged into blackness once more as his night vision came slowly back the dense dark was relieved if that was the word by the scattered green specks he could just make out his corpselight sleeves so he hadnt found the pumping station or the electrical transformers hed found the deeper secret of this placeworking cryochambers a number of mysteries fell neatly into place suze and companions were running a secret cryocorp noa cryocooperative and unless he missed his guess unlicensed untaxed and uninspected clandestine off the books in every way kiboudainia whole planet so obsessed with cheating death that even the street people managed to scavenge hope which beat living and dying in a cardboard box all to flinders miles had to admit he opened his mouth in what might have been a silent laugh and i thought id pulled some audacious stunts in my time how the hell suze and whatever helpers shed suborned had managed to palm an entire facility back when this place was being decommissioned and stripped its patrons shifted to the elegant new cryopolis on the west end gaudy with its floodlit pyramids was a tale miles was suddenly dying to hear bad choice of phrase my lord auditor less than a third of the cryodrawers in this corridor sported those glowworm lights and how many other corridors might there be plenty of room for more customers and because his mind worked that way he considered how easy murder by cryodrawer would be the ultimate shell game one live body hidden among hundreds of dead ones asphyxiation would come quickly in the sealed black box even without the freezing and no one would know where to look till much too late its nothing i havent undergone before it was curious how much that reflection didnt help he stepped forward to the end door raised his hand to touch the cool metal surface and just stood there for a minute then curling his fingers into a fist he knocked the creak of a chair the door opened partway and a hairy face thrust through yah tenburysan just tenbury what did you want to ask a few questions if i may beneath shaggy brows dark brown eyes narrowed did you talk to suze jin took me to see her this morning yes tenburys lips pursed amid their thatch oh all right the door swung wide miles did not correct the misperception that suze had therefore gated him into this covert community but slipped inside at once the room was part office part control chamber for the banks of cryodrawers and part living space or so the unmade bedroll by one wall and the piles of personal junk suggested beyond another door stood open on what might be some sort of repairs facility miles glimpsed workbenches and racks of tools in its shadows there was only one station chair by which miles guessed this tenbury was less sociable than suze but the custodian politely gestured his guest into it and leaned against a control console miles would have preferred it the other way around so as not to risk a crick in his neck nor the embarrassment of swinging his short legs above the floor but he dared not impede the useful exchange hed started so he sat and halfsmiled upward tenbury cocked his head and echoed the cooks observation you look too young for us you sick or something miles repeated the reply that had seemed to work before i have an incurable seizure disorder tenbury winced in sympathy but said youd do better to go back to the docs offplanet maybe i have it was costly miles turned out his empty pockets as if to demonstrate that why you ended up here broke are you in a sense it wasnt as if miles was trying to beat a fastpenta interrogation through excessive literalism yet he found himself oddly reluctant to lie outright to this man its more complicated than that yah it always is can you show me what i might be getting into if i stayed here that is the hairy eyebrows jerked up youve nothing to worry about with my work come on and youll see tenbury led through his shop which seemed halfengineeeringhalfmedical dismantled freezer parts lay strewn across a workbench i keep a portion of the chambers usable by cannibalizing the others tenbury explained miles encouraged the tech to expand upon the arcana of his craft with much the same noises hed used on yani to better effect when miles had absorbed as much about how cryochambers were built as he could stand he asked but wont you run out of parts not for a while yet this facility was originally set up to serve twenty thousand patrons in twenty years weve only accumulated about a tenpercent occupancy i admit we started much smaller back when we can go for decades yet till im gone for sure and what then who are you relying on for your revivals we dont need anyone to do the revivals yet anyway theyre much trickier indeed who does the cryoprep then plant nurse youll meet her sooner or later shes real good and she has an apprentice ako too i need to get myself a couple of youngsters like that i guess miles didnt marvel at this emergency cryoprep was a common enough medical procedure that even he had learned it at least theoretically as part of military fieldaid under nonemergency conditions there were doubtless more refinements resulting in less cryoamnesia and other unwanted sideeffects after less trauma to start with left less trauma to recover from but to choose to go down to that darkness in cold blood so to speak while still breathing its still frightening to think about he said honestly for most folks its a last choice not a first one we all come to it in time though no one wants to go of a coronary in the night and notwakeup warm and rotting safer not to wait too long tenburys lips twisted although some of the corps are trying to increase market share these days by encouraging folks to freeze early im not sure if the math works out it does seem an inelastic demand yes agreed miles in fascination more customers now can only mean fewer later a shortterm strategy for such a longterm enterprise yah except maybe for those whod miss their chance it was miless turn to tilt his head in consideration i suppose theyre not up to onehundredpercent market saturation even now what about the religious types oh yah there are still a few refusers refusers youre not from around here are you figured from your accent but id have thought you must have been on kibou longer in order to end up here i mean it was something of an accident im glad i stumbled on you though refusers like revives were another item the careful corps tours had neglected to mention but they hardly needed even tenburys brief explanation which he obligingly supplied for miles to figure out tenburys judgment was that those who chose burial over freezing for superstitious reasons were a selflimiting phenomenon miles thought of those fringe utopian communities that had practiced strict celibacy and thus died out within the first couple of generations or nongenerations and nodded provisional agreement tenbury then kindly took miles through the far door out of the workshop and into another corridorthankfully lit though even with illumination the general effect was of an unsettling cross between a space station corridor and a morgue there he opened an empty cryodrawer recently reconditioned and pointed out its features rather like a very restrained usedvehicle salesman it seemssmall said miles not much head room tenbury agreed but youre past sitting up suddenly by the time you arrive in it ive often wondered if folks would retain any memory of their time in these but the revives ive met all say not he slid the drawer closed and gave it a fond thump to seat the latch you just go to sleep and then wake up in a future somebody else picked for you no dreams miles agreed blink out blink back in like anesthesia but longer an intimate preview of death and doubtless a lot less traumatic when the blink out part wasnt accomplished by a needlegrenade blowing out ones chest miles had to allow he spread his palm on the drawerfront what happens to all the poor frozen peopleor frozen poor peopleif this place is discovered by the authorities a brief humorless grin ruffled the beardthatch well they cant just let us thaw and rot then bury us thats illegal murder of a sort one of the grades of murder anyway so this place was not as futile an effort as miles had first guessed somebody was thinking ahead how far who might find the future legal responsibility for these frozen souls on their hands the municipality of northbridge some unwitting entrepreneur buying the rediscovered property for back taxes without inspecting it first cheating death indeed illegal at the moment then what happens if the law changes tenbury shrugged then several thousand people will have died calmly and without pain in hope and not despair and wont know the difference he added after a thoughtful pause that would be an ugly sort of world to wake up in anyway mm i dont suppose the authorities would go to the trouble and expense of reviving folks just to let them die again immediately blink out andstay blinked there were worse ways to arrive at an identical fate miles had seen many of them well i need to get back to work tenbury hinted away his uninvited visitor i hope this helped you yes yes it did thank you miles let tenbury shepherd him back through the shop to the first corridor i suppose id better go feed jins pets i did promise the boy i would odd kid that i had hopes for a bit he might apprentice to me but hes more interested in animals than machinery tenbury sighed whether in regret or bafflement miles was not quite sure um said miles staring up the darkened corridor first door on your left said tenbury and thoughtfully held his office door wide to light the way till miles had found it in the gloom the stair rail and a careful count of the turns guided miles after that he emerged again in the basement near the cafeteria and from there found his way back up to jins roof via the interior stairs emerging into the daylight and greeted by milling chickens he thought damn but i hope the boy makes it back here soon the big downtown tubetram transfer station was just as confusing going back as forward jin found when hed taken his second wrong turn the crowd made him nervous and it was only going to get worse as the time edged toward rush hour he needed to get out of here scowling he turned around a couple of times reoriented himself and made his way upstream through an entry corridor bumping a lot of folks going the other way what was in that big thick envelope counsel vorlynkin had handed to him it crackled against his skin entering the secondlevel rotunda he dodged out of the way of a woman with a pram then leaned his shoulders against a pillar and fished out the letter to his disappointment it wasnt sealed with a bloody thumbprint but it was certainly sealed no peeking he sighed and thrust it back inside his shirt he finally found the right escalator and rode it up two flights to the toplevel gallery he was worried about his animals would milessan take proper care of them you never could tell with adults they pretended to take you seriously but then laughed behind your back at the things that were important to you or said that because you were just a kid you would forget it all soon but milessan had seemed to genuinely like jins rats letting jinni sit on his shoulder and nibble at his hair without flinching jin could tell when grownups didnt really appreciate how sleek and funny and friendly rats could be and they didnt bite hard at all unless they were accidentally squeezed and who could blame them for that the squeeze on jins shoulder made him jump and yelp if hed been equipped for it he might have bitten the hand as well but all he could do was twist and stare upward straight into the face of his worst nightmare brown hair a pleasant smile the blue uniform of municipal security not just a tubetram safety officer their uniforms were green a real policewoman the sort whod come for his mother whats your name child the voice was friendly but the undertone steely jin opened his mouth jin oh no that wouldnt do lying to grownups made him scared inside but he managed jin um vorkson she blinked what kind of name is that my dad was a galactic but hes dead now jin added with hasty prudence and half truth for that matter he tried not to think about the funeral does your mother let you come downtown alone its school hours you know um yes she sent me on an errand for her lets call her then jin held out his skinny wrists his stomach felt cold and quivery i dont have a wristcom maam thats all right you can come along to the security booth and we can call her from there no in a panic now jin tried to wrench away somehow he found his arm cranked up behind his back hurting his shirt tail came loose and the envelope dropped to the pavement with a loud slap no wait he tried to dive for it without releasing his arm the woman scooped it up first staring at it with a deepening frown she murmured to her own wristcom code six dan level one in moments another policeman loomed what ho michiko catch us a little shoplifter im not sure truant maybe this young fellow needs to come to the booth and call his mother and get idd i think right jins other arm was taken in an even stronger fist helplessly he let himself be marched along he was wild for a chance to break away but neither grip slackened the security booth had big glass windows overlooking the rotunda it was cool inside and when the door shut a wonderful silence fell which usually would be a relief to jin but not now a lot of screens were running and jin realized that some of them were from vidcams that looked right into peoples faces as they went up or down on the escalators he hadnt noticed them among the noise and confusion and hurry of the place the woman plunked him down in a swivel chair his feet didnt quite reach the floor the wide man dan held up a light pen let me see your eyes child retina scan a red flash jin squeezed his eyes shut as tightly as he could and clapped his palms over his face for good measure but it was already too late he heard the man moving away to his comconsole hes scared dan said the woman jin peeked through his fingers to see her holding up the envelope squeezing and rattling it like a birthday present think the reason might be in here a ping from the console aha i believe we have a match that was quick officer dan looked up and asked is your name jin sato no it says here hes been missing for over a year without letting go of jins arm the woman edged around to look at the holoscreen good heavens ill bet his family will be relieved to get him back no they wont let me go where have you been hiding for a whole year son officer dan asked not unkindly and what is this michiko asked hefting the envelope and frowning you cant have that give it back so whats in it its just a letter a a very personal letter im supposed to deliver it for for some men both officers went rigid what sort of men asked michiko justmen friends relatives relatives were not a good thing in jins world no i just met them today where did you meet them jins mouth clamped shut not addressed not postalsealed no legal reason we cant peek is there said dan the woman nodded and handed the envelope over dan popped a folding knife and slit it open from the bottom holding it above the countertop a thick wad of currency thumped out followed by a fluttering note it was more money than jin had seen in one place in his life from their widening eyes it was more money than the two security officers were used to seeing in one lump too certainly in the hands of a kid dan riffled the wad and vented a long amazed whistle michiko said drug ring do you think feeliedream smugglers it could begods it could be anything congratulations michiko shouldnt wonder if theres a promotion in this staring at the envelope with more respect dan belatedly pulled a pair of thin plastic gloves from his pocket and donned them before he picked up the note it seemed to be printed on half a flimsy dan read aloud we must trust that you know what you are doing please contact us in person as soon as possible he turned the note in the light no address no date no names no signature nothing veery suspicious michiko bent to look jin sternly in the eyes where did you meet these bad men child they werent bad men they were justmen friends of a friend where were you taking all this money i didnt know it was money michikos eyebrows rose do you believe that she asked her partner yah said dan or he might have taken off with it good point i wouldnt have even if i had known no one can threaten you now jin michiko said more gently youre safe no one did threaten me jin had never felt less safe in his life and if he blabbed suze and ako and tenbury and everyone who had befriended him wouldnt be safe either and lucky and the ratties and the chickens and big beautiful gyre lips tight as he could press them jin stared back at the officers call youth services to pick up the boy said michiko the rest of the evidence had better go to vice at a guess yah said dan his gloved hands sliding jins precious envelope the wad of cash and the note into a transparent plastic bag my animals jin whispered such a simple task milessan had entrusted him with and hed screwed it all up hed screwed everything up between his scrunched eyelids tears began to leak with a grating noise and a puff of powder the bolt popped out of the concrete finally breathed roic chapter five roic waited for dusk to deepen and for the occasional echo of footsteps along the gallery to fall silent for a good long time before venturing a cautious reconnoiter the door lock yielded to force or rather the flimsy doorframe splintered and gave up the mechanism whole more loudly than he would have liked but no one called out or came to investigate crouching to slip beneath any view from the windows bare feet silent on the boards but for an occasional tiny clink from the chain swathing his ankle he discovered that the gallery wrapped the rectangular building on three sides with stairs down on either end about a dozen rooms like his lined this level there was no third storey another building with faint yellow gleams leaking from its windows lay down the slope to the right obscured in the trees behind it seemed to be a parking area but a marked lack of security lighting made the details invisibleboth to roic and to anyone passing overhead in a lightflyer he guessed right now he was grateful for the shadows he slipped around to the far end a third building vaguely shedlike sat low and black in the gloom down at the border of the level scrubland roic wondered if thered been a fire to so clear out the crowded conifers roics heart nearly failed him when a voice above his head hissed roic up here he jerked his head back to see a pale smudge of a face peering over the edge of the roof a long black braid swung forward over the figures shoulder triggering recognition and relief dr durona raven so they got you too sh not so loud we were in the same lift van you were out cold come up before someone comes back a pair of lean arms extended downward raven was apparently lying prone careful of my hands with no more noise than a grunt and a scrape roic scrambled up to the flat rooftop their careful footslides making no thumps that could be heard through a ceiling below they took shelter of sorts in the lee of a vent housing raven durona could have passed for a kiboudaini nativea slim intellectual eurasian in body and face with a highbridged nose and straight black hair to his waisttill he opened his mouth and that unlocal accent came out delegate from the durona medical group on escobar hed been the only other person at the cryoconference roic had known and moderately well at that but mlord inexplicably had signed them away from each other raven had accepted the signal with the merest nod and eyebrow twitch and steered around roic and mlord thereafter leaving mlord clear roic realized in retrospect to trawl for his own targets roic lowered himself to sit crosslegged the escobaran cryosurgeon wrapped his arms around his knees and they put their faces close together in a nearly voiceless murmur roic said seen any guards no but our captors are still awake dr durona returned in a matching tone theyre mostly still down in the dining hall but some wander back up here at random they sleep below us howd you get out of your room surgery on my bathroom windowlock an exit doubtless aided by the fact that the man was lithe as a snake roics shoulders would not have fit and the chains chains you had chains special roic never mind how far are we from northbridge did you see and where thell are we about a hundred hundred and fifty kilometers id guess the one glimpse i had was all forest as far as i could see there dont seem to be any roadseverything must come in by lightflyer or lift van this place used to be some kind of lake resort for northbridge weekenders before the dam blew out in a storm and the lake ran down the river the rebuild got tied up in lawsuits so the resort has been defunct for a couple of years one of our kidnappers owns it turns out which may have been how the legacy liberators came up with this crazed scheme in the first place what thell are they doingno wait first have you seen lord vorkosigan raven shook his dark head i thought i saw them tackle him back in the lobby when they grabbed me and you were throwing people into the lift tube and bellowing at them to keep climbingi swear some of those poor delegates were more scared of you than of our attackersbut i havent seen him since there are only six other hostages here plus me and you all locked in for the night it seems the nhll was setting up to host three times that many theyre not best pleased with you for that how many bad guys what a barrayaran turn of phrase about a dozen here at a guess ive not seen them all together they take it in shifts to harass us huh lecturing us mostly about the stern and glorious goals of the new hope legacy liberators oh i had a sample only a sample the rest of us have endured hours of it they marched us down to the dining hall and harangued us till they were hoarse how come i wasnt invited you have a reputation as a bold barrayaran barbariansay that six times really fasttoo dangerous to let loose chains huh you were fortunate to miss class i think they might be trying to inculcate some sort of identifywithonescaptors syndrome in us but are doing it wrong old baron ryoval could have eaten them all for breakfast roic had heard mlords clonebrother lord mark quote the late baron ryoval of jacksons whole only oncesome mutter about and then we shall explore the interesting focusing effects of threatening your remaining eyeand had not been moved to inquire further hed been moved to edge away actually despite overtopping lord mark by half a meter of height roic only knew that the entire durona group thirtyfive or so cloned siblings possessing extraordinary medical talents felt they owed their escape from jacksonian technoslavery to a new free life to lord mark and lord vorkosigan the reason for ravens peculiar melange of an accent and that of every other durona was that they were all refugees from jacksons whole whod been living for over a decade on escobar the reason that the infamous baron was the late was lord mark the reason roic and raven found themselves sitting on this roof togetherwas still unclear well raven had been invited to the conference to give an illustrated lecture on cryorevival techniques after death from extreme trauma which mlord and perforce roic had sat in on three days ago after raven had hinted during a chance encounter in a hotel lifttube that mlord would find special interest in the very complicated case of patient c a messy death by needlergrenade to the chest it was raven had informed his audience one of his earliest and most memorable cases as a young assistant surgeon mlord had indeed been riveted roic had closed his eyes but besides that yes but why are these idiots lecturing you pitching their cause i think rather like the past several days at the cryoconference really except in reverse and with much worse food are they suppressed by the government or censored by the local media not at all apparently they even have a site on the planetary net that tells everyone all they would want to know about their views no one wants to know much it appears so theyve turned to more forcible ways of getting attention now robbing at gunpoint actually works selling at gunpointnot so good we all started today scared to death but by the end it was just dreary raven rubbed his nose they seem to plan to keep it up for days hence my escape attempt but its not going too well we both got this far yes but here we are in the middle of a hundred kilometers of woodslots more if you take a wrong turnand even if this forest isnt stocked with peopleeating predators it would be insane to plunge off into the darkness with no shoes or gear and all the vehicles in the parking lot are neatly locked i just checked huh pity raven eyed roic in speculation now by myself i dont think i could jump someone coming out to his lightflyer and grab it after it was opened but if we worked an ambush together roic took this resignedly as if you jumped him and i cheered you on raven frowned except this crew doesnt seem to come or go very often all locked down tight making no noise till you came along i was starting to wonder if i should let myself back into my room and pretend this never happened wait for some better chance i dont think i could do that said roic remembering his ruined doorframe he craned his neck to stare over the roof edge at that third darkened structure if that was an old shoreline down there whats that other building dont know i havent seen anybody go in or out im thinking it could be a boathouse or a tool shedan isolated place like this would need onebut likely a boathouse raven glanced wryly at the dried lake bed and murmured ive never ridden in a boat this doesnt seem the night to start tools nowdo you think you could pry open a lightflyer but then youd still need the code keys to power it up crowbars no use there except maybe to hit the owner on the head mlord keeps boats he has a place on a lake down in the vorkosigans district back on barrayar couple hours from the capital by lightflyer a thought niggled in roics aching head i say lets go see raven gave him a dubious look but shrugged agreement with painful caution they lowered themselves from the roof and tiptoed down the far stairs they made a straight line for the cover of the trees then circled to come out on the shore side of the low building the effect of the sticks rocks and debris on roics bare feet made him reluctantly agree with ravens negative view of any longer walk in the woods the window glass was unbreakable the entry facing the exlake padlocked but it gave way to the same method roic had used on his room door raven winced at the rending crunch they both froze listening hard but no outcry came they edged inside the outer door opened onto an office the door beyond was thanks be unlocked roic swung it open upon a garagelike space also very dark butcould one smell boats the scent of wood and oil and old bilge and dried waterweed was quite unmistakable and strangely happy like preserved summer as his eyes adjusted roic could just make out half a dozen kayakorcanoe shapes slung from the ceiling and a couple of wider hulls up on sturdy cradles workbench on the far side of the room mostly cleared away raven started for it hands held out before him in wariness of headcracking pillars or other shadowy obstacles but roic whispered him back come over here this big power boathelp me get the cover off roic even if we could haul it out the doors the lake is dry thats not it just help all right the hull was maybe five meters long and half that wide and a stretched plastic cover protected a large open cockpit the fastenings parted reluctantly and roic dragged the cover aside and climbed in raven followed in curiosity roic felt his way to the controls just behind a windshield and opened what provedyesto be a small vid plate cover now if this comlink was independently powered as it bloody well should beroics fumbling fingers found the onswitch at last and green and amber lights threw back the pools of darkness hey said raven in a hearteningly impressed tonemost duronas daunted roic did you know that would be there i had a guess if this place rented out boats to its customers it wouldve had to keep something to go rescue them in comlink is a pretty standard builtin for pleasure boats this size along with the depthfinder and nav links and so on the emergency channel was easy to find within minutes roic had talked his way back through the system to the northbridge police his years as a street guard gave him a good idea of just what to say to smoothly reach the folks with clout and the boats navigation aid provided a precise location he reported briefly his experiences and ravens to the startled but pleased northbridge detective officer in charge of theby now highly publicized roic sensed in his tonekidnapping case to roics intense worry it seemed no one had found lord vorkosigan yet as the northbridge police scrambled roic closed the link and leaned back now what asked raven now we wait for rescue do you think we ought to do something for the others lying lows better no point in stirring up anything if our captors arent going to miss us for a while yet let the kibou fellows do their job and hope they get here first roic recalled some of mlords cautionary lectures on local liability a concern that mlord himself seemed to take to heart only intermittently speaking of locals roic leaned forward again and searched out the number of the barrayaran consulate in northbridge unfortunately the public net only supplied the public number not the secured emergency link coded on his wristcom presumably discarded back in the city by his captors for wellfounded fear of tracers a polite recorded voice told him to call back during office hours or leave a message the muted background music was a popular barrayaran military march that gave roic a twinge of homesickness he was halfway through recording a succinct report on his current situation when to his relief he was interrupted by a live human roic recognized lieutenant johannes the young driver whoalong with consul vorlynkin himself because mlord was after all mlordhad picked them up at the shuttleport nigh on a week ago and transported them to the conference hotel military attache impsec of sorts and for all roic knew cook gardener and the consuls batman he felt a dim sense of comradeship contemplating johannes armsman roic johanness voice was curt and anxious are you all right where are you roic began his summary once more halfway through the strained face of consul vorlynkin joined johanness image above the vid plate if you follow up with the northbridge police from your end youll likely know as soon and as much as we do roic finished vorlynkin said lord auditor vorkosigan is not with youright we havent spotted him here any sign back there a toolong pause we arent quite sure what thell did that mean when you get free report in to the consulate at once vorkynkin went on should i send johannes to coordinate with the police roic scratched his head if mlords not here theres no point t get in a panic about us ill get back with the others what about me said raven either indignant or amused it was hard to tell who is that said vorlynkin sharply dr durona an acquaintance from escobar one of the delegates roic replied raven obligingly leaned forward into range of the vid pickup and smiled benignly vorlynkin frowned back mlord would want to know he wassafe seemed a premature claimwith me roic explained vorlynkin said distantly you know if you people would be more forthcoming we could do our job of supporting you much better the faint bitterness in the consuls voice was more reassuring to roic than the man could possibly imagine it sounded quite like vorlynkin had undergone some recent dealing with mlord one that he was loath to transmit over an unsecured comlink yes sir said roic in a mollifying tone he cut the com now what said raven just sit here and wait for the sirens there had better not be sirens said roic best they drop down and secure the hostages first before making any noise that was what hed suggested at least after a longer pause raven said the liberators didnt really act like they wanted to kill us just convert us panic does odd things to people raven sighed you could stand to be more reassuring roic you know huddling around the indicator lights as if at a very tiny campfire they waited in the darkness miles rattled the consulates wroughtiron front gate found it locked and stared over it wearily beyond a dainty front garden sat a dinky house overshadowed by its grander neighbors although at least it looked wellkept maybe it had once been servants quarters kiboudaini had never been considered strategically important enough to spend much imperial money upon its system being in a wormhole culdesac on the far side of escobar well outside of barrayars web of influence this consulate existed mainly to ease the occasional barrayaran or more likely komarran trading venture through planetary regulations aid any members of the imperium who found themselves in local trouble and direct and quietly vet the even rarer kibou traveler planning to visit the imperium miless arrival was likely the most excitement the place had endured in years yeah well its about to get more so the predawn chill was damp and penetrating his legs were cramped and his back ached he sighed and clambered awkwardly over the gate retrieved his cane stumped up the short walk and leaned on the door chime the porch and hall lights flicked on a face peered through the glass and the door opened a crack a young man miles didnt recognize spoke in a kibou accent sir youll have to come back during business hours we open in about two more miles wedged his cane through the opening levered it wider put his head down and barged in sir the minion was only saved from a shattering blast of auditorial ire by consul vorklynkin strolling through an archway at the back of the hall saying what is it yuuichioh my god lord vorkosigan showing a swift sense of selfpreservation yuuichi fell back from between them vorlynkin tall and lean was halfdressed in trousers shirt and slippers blearyeyed and clutching a mug that steamed with the gentle perfume of hot green tea miles was so distracted by the smell that he was almost thrown off his wellrehearsed opening but hed had a lot of hours this past night to rehearse vorlynkin what the hell have you done with my courier vorlynkins spine snapped straight unconsciously revealing a military hitch sometime in his earlier life a look of partial but only partial relief lit his blue eyes we can answer that my lord so jin did make it here um yes sir the problem had occurred on jins way back then not good miles had waited in growing anxiety till midnight then pressed ako into substitute pet care and taken matters unto his own hands or feet the hours it had cost him to make it here unobserved had not improved his mood neither had the rain the consuls brows drew down as he took in miless appearance in turn a very far cry from miless cultivated grayeminencelook of their brief meeting last week although the ragged stained clothing twoday growth of face stubble general reek and peculiar shoes might not be the whole of why he flinched but showing a keen eye that was wellplaced in the diplomatic corps he caught miless gaze tracking his waving mug and added smoothly do you want to come to the kitchen and sit down my lord auditor we were just having breakfast tea yes said miles relieved from his impulse to wrench the mug out of the mans hand gods yes vorlynkin led through the back archway saying how did you get here walked thirtyodd kilometers since midnight back ways dodging twice because i didnt want to explain myself in my current condition to the local street guards needless to say this was not my original plan the kitchen was a modest tidy room with a round dining table squeezed into a sort of bay overlooking the walled back garden the windows mostly reflected the rooms bright interior but beyond the nights damp blackness was turning to bluer shadow the blond kid the attache johannes turned from the microwave and almost dropped whatever prepackaged bachelor fare hed just heated at his bosss headjerk he hastened to pull out a chair for the very important if very unkempt visitor miles fell into it trying not to let his gratitude overcome his exasperation because the latter was about all that was keeping him functional can i get you something my lord asked the lieutenant solicitously tea also a shower dry clothes food sleep and a secured comconsole though id settle for just the comconsole but lets start with the tea or else he risked pillowing his head on his arms and going for the sleep first right here did you get my dontpanic message off to barrayar and my wife coded i trust vorlynkin said a little stiffly we notified impsec galactic affairs on komarr that wed heard from you and that you were not in the hands of the kidnappers good enough ill send my own update in a bit miles trusted it would overtake any word anyone had been maladroit enough to hand on to ekaterin or hed have some groveling to do when he got home meanwhile ive had no news since yesterday have you heard more on the hostages taken from the cryoconference anything on armsman roic vorlynkin slid into his chair a quarterwedge around the table from miles good news there sir your armsman managed to escape his captors long enough to reach a comlink of some sort and call the northbridge authorities the police rescue team reached them not long agoweve been up all night following developments it seems everyone was freed alive i dont know how long it will take him to get backhe said he had to stay till hed given his testimony ah yes roic has a deal more sympathy for police procedure than i do miles took his first swallow of hot tea with profound relief and the boywait and who might you be miles eyed yuuichi who had taken refuge with johannes on the far side of the kitchen this is our consulate clerk yuuichi matson vorkynkin put in our most valuable employee hes been here about five years the clerk cast his boss a grateful look and slanted miles a civil bow the consulates only employee actually and since vorlynkin had been here two years and johannes had only arrived last year matson was also the oldest in time of service if not age who do you trust my lord auditor in a situation like this no one but roic miles supposed but misplaced paranoia could be as great a mistake as misplaced faith careful then but not bloody paralyzed so what happened to jin we dispatched him back to you exactly as you directed my lord we did take the precaution of placing a microscopic ping tracer in the envelope however not exactly the dont follow him that miles had written but it would be hypocritical to quibble over fine points now results after all by early evening the envelope had come to rest in what we think is the evidence room of the northbridge central police stationits in that building anyway the boy jin after apparently passing through the hands of the police ended up at the juvenile detention center where hes been all night with that much to go on lieutenant johannes was able to access the public arrest records for yesterday and identify him by process of elimination it seems the boys full name is jin sato and hes a runaway whos been missing for over a year yes said miles i knew that vorlynkins diplomatic tones grew notably strained how the devilsirdid you come to involve a child like that in your affairswhatever they are hes eleven said miles eleven worse and worse when my father was eleven said miles reasonably he became aidedecamp to the generalmygrandfather in a fullscale civil war by age thirteen hed helped to bring down an emperor i didnt figure an afternoons jaunt across his home town and backon a peaceful planet at thatto be beyond jins capacity yet apparently hed figured wrong miles winced inside he hadnt thought through the implications of jins runaway status in a heavily monitored place like this even while picking his own route to avoid notice as a matter of routine the boy would be frantic for his animals by now and that was the least of it my mistake to fix then i dont abandon my people if i can help it well just have to retrieve him vorlynkins jaw dropped hes a minor child how we have no rights to him he was carrying all our petty cash too put in johannes id have gone after that myself but i had no way to prove it was ours he frowned at miles the exactly as you directed complaint implied well theres always your ping tracer but before miles could voice the thought vorlynkin went on if your underage courier talks i expect the northbridge police will be calling us with some very hardtoanswer questions miles paused alert have they no not yet and if they didnt call it would imply jin had kept his mouth shut and under conditions that had to be quite frightening to him thatsinteresting where did you pick up that boy my lord said vorlynkin actually he found me on the street more or less miles did some rapid internal editing he had after all given suze his tacit word not to reveal her lair in exchange for information and he had certainly received information even if he wasnt sure what he wanted to do with it yet you read my note to you right vorlynkin nodded well as i said the drug the kidnappers tried to sedate me with triggered manic hallucinations instead and i ended up lost in the cryocombs no need to say for how long the situation was certainly elastic enough to cover the missing day hed spent with jin and company when i came to my senses and found my way out i was still a bit paranoid about my kidnappers finding me again and too exhausted to go on jin kindly helped me and i owe him vorlynkin stared at miles very hard are you saying you werent in your right mind that might actually be a good explanation should one be needed does this consulate keep a local lawyer on retainer yes standard practice can you trust him or her to keep our secrets was a question miles wasnt ready to ask out loud quite yet good as soon as possible contact the lawyer and find out what we can do to get jin back he held out his mug for more tea yuuichi the clerk politely filled it miless hand was shaking with fatigue but he managed not to spill tea on the way to his lips showers as good as three hours of sleep shower first and then the comconsole if you please shouldnt you rest my lord said vorlynkin miles choked back an impulse to scream dont argue with me which was a pretty good indicator that yes he damn well should rest but there were a few key things that he had to know first later he said then conceded soon after a moment he added reluctantly youd better let the northbridge police know i escaped was lost in the cryocombs and came back to the consulate on my owni dont want them to waste their resources hunting me you can tell them im uninjured but extremely fatigued and am resting here they can send someone to take a statement from me tomorrow if they need one dont mention jin unless they ask if anyone else inquires after mecheck with me this won another hard stare from vorlynkin but he only nodded johannes led miles upstairs to the sleeping quartersit appeared that the two barrayaran bachelors saved on rent by living on the premisesand the consulate personnel scored about a million points with miles by providing his very own clothes and gear retrieved along with roics from their hotel room after the kidnappings johannes eyed the auditors own secured communications equipmentimpsecs bestwith due respect when handing it over the personal belongings the kidnappers had stripped from miles were still in the hands of the police found discarded in a downtown alley and retained as evidence except for his auditors seal which vorlynkin had managed to pry back from them with miles gathered some vigorous diplomatic persuasion half an hour laterwashed shaved and dressed in clean clothesmiles had johannes lead him down to the consulates basement communications tightroom such as it was and settle him before a secured comconsole miles stretched his back and spread his fingers then entered his first search term lisa sato whos that asked johannes looming over his shoulder jin satos mother is she important someone thought so lieutenant someone definitely thought so as the vid plate flickered miles bent to the data stream chapter six a brief conversation with mlord over the comconsole at northbridge police headquarters once the rescued delegates arrived there relieved roic of his worst nightmare that of losing the little gimlord new curiosities thronged to take its place why was mlord insisting that roic bring dr durona along actually id planned to return to the conference hotel and collect my luggage raven interpolated leaning into the vid pickup see me first mlord replied ill miss my jumpship theres one every day in fact dont reschedule your berth yet ravens black brows flicked up my time is money ill keep that in mind raven shrugged amiably at mlords very dry tone and followed roic both scuffing along in the paper slippers their hosts had provided while waiting for their stolen shoes to surface it was midafternoon when the police at last dropped roic and his bemused companion off at the consulate the foursquare house seemed unduly modest in roics view though he supposed that upholding the dignity of the imperium at this distance was costly enough it did look as though it might provide a shower and a place to nap roics two biggest remaining wants since the police had provided the freed captives with a meal or at least as many ration bars as anyone would want to eat high in protein and vitamins tasting like chocolatecoated putty with kitty littersome horrors were universal it seemed roic stifled his wish for a washup and had lieutenant johannes guide them directly to mlord already ensconced like an invasive spider in the consulates communications tightroom in most planetary embassies that roic had visited in mlords wake the tightroom seemed the secret nerve center of the embassys affairs hushed and urgent here it felt more like someones leftover basement hobby roomfor some very odd hobbiesretrofitted in high tech mlord swiveled in his station chair and waved roic and raven to seats dismissing johannes with a thank you lieutenant johannes looking as though he longed to stay and eavesdrop nodded and dutifully withdrew closing the door with that muffled thump that betokened a good sound seal roic ignored the faint serialkiller ambiance of the windowless chamber and tried to appreciate that here at last one might enjoy a truly private conversation are you two all right a perfunctory inquiry mlord didnt even wait for ravens nod and roics grunt before continuing tell me everything that happened to you and yes i want all the details mlord listened brows tightening as the full tale of the kidnapping and rescue unwound rewarding the tellers at the end with a mere huh he added to raven im glad youre all right i shouldnt have liked to explain your loss to your clonesiblings or mine id actually thought the durona group would send your sister rowan no shes much too busy these days for offplanet jaunts said raven shes our department head for cryonicswe have over five hundred employees between our clinical services research and administrative overhead and she and that escobaran medtech she married plan to pop their second kid from the uterine replicator any day now not cloned eh no it was all done the oldfashioned way an egg and a sperm in a test tube they didnt even go for any genetic mods beyond the routine check for defects of course of course murmured mlord without comment so good old lily durona is a real grandmother nowor aunt depending on how you look at it she continues in good health for her age i trust very much so interesting raven tugged absently on his frazzled braid laid over his shoulder and continued as a department head rowan says she misses the handson surgical work she hardly gets to do two revivals a week these days i do two to six a day depending on complications nothing as complicated as you wereyou took rowan me and two shifts of medtechs eighteen hours straight back in the day you did good work thank you raven nodded in what seemed to roic rather smug satisfaction give rowan my best when you see her oh yeah she said to say hi to you too this won an oddly ironic look and a return nod i take it put in roic that dr durona here wasnt at the conference by chance indeed not id asked the durona group to supply me with an independent technical evaluation of the cryoconference and whatever turned up at it the group had actually received the conferences call for presentations well before you asked lord vorkosigan we were going to send one of our junior residentsthis place is not without interest to us actually and have you observed anything of special note so far technically mlord leaned back in his station chair and steepled his fingers giving raven a judicious stare nothing new to us on the technical side i did notice that they seemed more interested in freezing people than thawing them yes the cryocorps are plainly playing numbers games with their customerspatrons they call emproxy votes its a game theyve won from the sound of things mlord nodded it was barely discussed at the conference yet there seems to be plenty of debate on the subject outside in the streets and elsewhere raven put in the nhll were sure complaining vigorously yeah but not very effectively said roic loons like that are their own worst advertisement does it strike you both as a pretty free debate as such things go noisy well yes said raven not as noisy as escobaran politics noisier than barrayar though roic said much noisier than jacksons whole raven granted with a twisted grin thats not politics thats predators versus prey muttered mlord but he went on well thanks to the nhll i had a very useful two days now that youre both back alive i suppose i can afford to be grateful to them new answers asked roic with a sapient eyebrowlift better a whole raft of new questions and mlord promptly toppedof courseroics tale with a haircurling story of the appalling extent of the cryocombs beneath the city and of how mlord had stumbled on a bootleg freezing operation run by apparently kibou street geezers raven seemed less impressed by the bootleg cryonicshe was jacksonian after all as near as roic could tell everything on jacksons whole was done illegally or more precisely lawlessly fragile and doomed was ravens succinct opinion of madame suzes ongoing operation im astonished shes gotten away with so much for so long mm maybe not its clandestine but it doesnt really rock the cryocorps boat everyone here being in the same boat after all mlord rubbed his chin and squinted redrimmed eyes that glinted a trifle too brightly then we come to this woman lisa sato and her group your little zookeepers frozen mama said roic yep the nhll is allowed to run its length suzes operation is overlooked but satos seemingly much more reasonable and legal group is broken up at considerable trouble and expense all that ambient noise and yet only one voice is silenced mlord gestured to the secured comconsole now dark ive spent the past several hours doing some digging and as a former impsec galactic operative this sort of digging was meat and drink to mlord roic reflected and in just that time ive turned up anomalies galore lisa sato was not the only member of her group to come to a bad end two others were frozen after supposedlyunsuccessful treatments for medical conditions that should not have been fatal another died in an accident and yet another was ruled a suicide of the fellorjumped sort even at the time brows were raised and quite a few people were offended but the aftershocks were drowned out in the news by a flood of trivial sex scandals what does this suggest to you that lisa satos group was getting ready to rock somebodys boat pretty hard said roic slowly raven nodded concurrence how that interestingly does not turn up in the public record nor even in the lesspublic records somebody did a firstclass job on the cleanup there even if they werent able to make it completely invisible that now heads my list of shiny new questionsjust what got cleaned up a year and a half ago roic frowned very riveting mlord butwhat has this got t do with barrayars interests mlord cleared his throat it is far too early to say he said primly roic glumly read that as i havent made up a reason yet but give me time was mlord going all quixotic on account of that orphan boy emperor gregor himself had warned roic about mlords tendency to expensive knighterrantry in one of their rare private conversations from the imperial sigh that had accompanied this it had been unclear if gregor actually expected roic to restrain mlord or not the door hissed open and consul vorlynkin stuck his head through ive heard back from the lawyer lord vorkosigan ah good mlord waved him in he stood seeming a bit wary whats the word on jin as i thought there is nothing we can legally do if he were an orphan without kin you could apply for custody of him but it would take some months and almost certainly be rejected by the northbridge courts especially if there was any hint of taking him offplanet i didnt ask to adopt him vorlynkin just rescue him from the police in any case my lord auditor its become mootthe police have already turned the boy over to his bloodkin an aunt who is in fact his present legal guardian damn mlord slumped damn i hope ako proves a more faithful zookeeper than i did well its not as if we could kidnap him said vorlynkin with a faint smile mlord eyed him perhaps thinking better of this mild venture into humor vorlynkin cleared his throat and went back to looking bland roic wondered if he should take vorlynkin aside later and warn him not to say things like that around mlord and not because the lord auditor might take offense roic rubbed sandy eyelids perhaps youd best sleep on it mlord he suggested not without selfinterest mlord had plainly had the advantage of a shower and fresh clothes but still looked as if hed been up all night as had they all and the shiny glitter in his eyes was a tipoff have you checked your neurotransmitter levels since you got back the elevation of same being early warning of an impending seizure and signal it was time to use the medical seizurestimulator to shortcircuit the fitin some safe and controlled place mlord addressed an unrevealing mutter to his shoes right said roic in a very firm tone mlord sighed and rubbed the back of his neck yeah yeah can i go back to my hotel now asked raven hopefully yes but stay in touch in factvorlynkin please issue dr durona a secured wristcom before he goes eh vorlynkins brows rose but he said only yes my lord i need more data mlord growled to no one in particular he looked up appraisingly at the consul all right vorlynkin if whitechrys or any of our other late hosts call to inquire after me i want you to tell them that i am very upset by the disruption of the conference and the kidnapping of my armsman in fact im furious and as soon as i recover from my ordeal i plan to stalk home and give a very bad report of the affair to anyone who will listen starting with emperor gregor erand are you asked vorlynkin sounding nonplussed mlord returned only an unreassuring grin i want you to test how far theyll go to reopen their lines of communication indicate youll do your diplomatic best to calm me down but youre not sure it can be done if they offer you incentives for the task take them up youwant me to accept a bribe sir a little real offense tightened vorlynkins jaw as well as understandable alarm well at least pretend to consider it eh it will show us who wants what and how badly if they dont come through ill have to think of another move but if youre a tolerably good fisherman i think you can hook them for me ill umtry my best sir vorlynkin didnt exactly stare at the lord auditor as if the little man had sprouted two heads but roic could almost see the consul scrambling to keep pace yeah welcome to my world the debriefing broke up the consulate harbored two spare bedrooms upstairs fitted out for guests not much used for the purpose and slowly filling with assorted storage one had been hastily cleared for the lord auditor roic turned down the bed and rummaged in mlords luggage for the seizure stimulator mlord stripped to his underwear sat on the bed and eyed the medical device with loathing kludgy thing yes mlord tell me am i to trust the consulate fellows here or not im not sure yet ive been caught out before with embassy staff or even impsec couriers being suborned because if you mean to use them for backup which we very much need youre going to have to start including them in your loop i could see lieutenant johannes fr instance didnt know what to make of you leaving him out just now its this lord auditor thing i used to be able to get almost anyone to talk to me damn it in your spare minutes try your hand at evaluating them eh ive no doubt theyll be more willing to be frank with you simple honest face and all that yes mlord i already know that somebody out there is buying people question is has the consulate been bought already or did there seem no need to secure it before i showed up at least neither of the barrayarans have families here so i dont have to worry about negative incentives mlord scowled lay back and set the stimulator to the curve of his skull roic handed him the mouth guard which he fitted around his teeth he took a breath and squeezed his eyes shut like someone about to down a dose of some nastytasting medicine and triggered the stimulator roic timed the seizureit was a long one suggesting mlord had been pushing the limit roic was used to the rolledback eyes the weird grimace and the shivering but he doubted hed ever be quite reconciled to the strange absence of that driving personality animating the face in due course the neural storm passed and mlord lay slack his eyes opening again on the universe as though his gaze recreated it god i hate this he muttered his standard mantra at this point yes mlord roic soothed his standard response ill be useless for the rest of the night even if i do get slept out and tomorrow as well ill bring you coffee thanks roic mlord rolled over and drew up the covers surrendering at last to the demands of his depleted body muffled into the pillow almost inaudibly fr everythin roic shook his head and tiptoed off to find his own bunk jin blinked open sore eyes in the semidarkness of his sister minakos tiny bedroom then bit his lip on a groan hed meant to stay awake outwait and maybe outwit his captors but the exhaustion of the past day had betrayed him he sat up on his elbow a nightlight low on the wall shed a dim pink glow but the room lacked a clock it was still full dark outside and the muffled rumble of uncle hikarus snores sounded through the thin walls of the next room so everyone else was asleep but it could be any hour from midnight to neardawn he swung bare legs out from under the covers of the narrow futon aunt lorna had put him to bed in his underwear since his cousin tetsus pajamas had been too big and his cousin kens too small his own clothes she had hauled away to wash or maybe burn shed said since there was no telling where theyd been jin sure wasnt telling anyway hopelessly he went to the window and tried the lock it unlatched but the window only slid aside about three centimeters uncle hikaru had climbed up on a borrowed ladder after the argument at dinner and blocked the window groove with a rod jin could just curl his fingers around the frame but couldnt get his hand through he wasnt going to be able to repeat his escape of last year jin pressed his forehead to the cool glass and looked down at the patch of patio one floor below in a way aunt lorna had made it easy for him back then by exiling all his animals out there after hed climbed out the window and dropped down hed only had to load them all up on minakos outgrown stroller left in the lee of the fence earlier that day hed been terrified at the time that gyres squawk and luckys meowing would alert the household or that the glass box holding the rats and the turtle would tip and clatter but it had been a cold night the windows closed and nobody but him paid attention to his creatures anyway well tetsu had got in the habit of teasing gyre till gyre had naturally bit him then thered been the trip to emergency care and the surgical glue and antibiotics and aunt lorna screeching more than tetsu though mostly about the bill tetsu had shown off his battle scar at school the next day pretty smugly jin thought jin slipped over and tried the door turning the latch as silently as he could still locked there had been another big argument about whether people had to get up in the night to let jin go to the bathroom which uncle hikaru had settled in a very practical way by providing jin with a bucket which had scandalized aunt lorna and made tetsu and ken make fun of him till uncle had thumped them that had been after the squabble over where jin was to sleep since his sister was now judged too big to share a bed with him or maybe it was the other way around tetsu and ken already dividing a cramped room complained about having yet a third boy shoved in atop their clutter and had also objected to being made jins watchers jin had endured much in silence last night and today in anticipation of a timely escape he hadnt expected to be locked in just till the boy settles down uncle hikaru had saidas if jin would abandon his creatures as if he would ever stay here was milessan taking care of his charges properly what must he think when jin never came back with his money would he think jin had stolen it the police had stolen it really but would even that extraordinary offworlder believe jin over the grownups he swallowed a lump in his throat determined not to cry again because maybe letting go like that was why hed fallen asleep earlier although what was the point in forcing himself to stay awake when he couldnt get out he returned to the futon and sank down in despair maybe tomorrow night he could hide a screwdriver or some other tools in the room and try to take the window or the door lock apart from the inside tenbury would have known how jin was sure he didnt think he could pretend to be all settled down so quickly and thus lull his captors into relaxing their guard not when he was growing more and more frantic inside aunt lorna had threatened she was going to sign him right up tomorrow for tetsu and kens school because she couldnt afford to lose any more work days over him school he recalled had seemed even less easy to escape from thanjin refused to think of this narrow rented rowhouse as home the door lock clicked aunt lorna checking up on him he could still hear uncle hikarus snores he rolled over to face the wall hitched his covers up over his shoulder and scrunched his eyes shut jin a shy voice whispered are you asleep jin rolled back both relieved and annoyed it was only mina yes he growled a short silence no youre not what do you want some forgotten doll or stuffed toy he supposed although shed taken a basket of them with her to her temporary bed on the couch downstairs the door rumbled sliding into its slot and small feet padded to the side of his futon he rolled over onto his elbow again and stared up at her staring down at him she shared jins brown eyes and tousled mop of black hair but she was taller and less chubby than he remembered from fourteen months ago then she hadnt even started school yetnow she was in her second year she seemed lessbewilderedlooking somehow if i let you out she said will you take me with you huh startled jin sat up and hugged his knees what she wasnt just lost on the way to the bathroom no of course not are you crazy her face fell oh she retreated to the door and started to pull it shut behind her no wait jin hissed lumbering up next door the snores stopped they both froze after a moment there came a creaking and a sort of gurglingdrain noise and the snores started up again we cant talk here jin whispered lets go downstairs she seemed to think this over then nodded waiting in the hallway while he wrapped a blanket around his shoulders and trailed after her jin shoved the door closed again very slowly and quietly the stairs squeaked under their tiptoeing feet but no one came after them dont turn the light on jin said keeping his voice low there was enough light leaking from what uncle hikaru called the onebutt kitchen in a niche off the livingdining room to keep from tripping on things mina settled back in her twisted nest of covers on the couch jin sat on the edge of uncle hikarus chair and stared around mina asked do you remember daddy sort of some i dont just his picture in the family shrine mommy set up you were three jin had been seven when their father had died four years agoit seemed half a lifetime he remembered his mothers extravagant grief and anger rather better and how seldom hed seen her after thatas if one death had stolen both parents even before the policewomen had come for her doesnt aunt lorna keep the family shrine anymore she let me keep it in my room for a while but then we ran out of space when i needed a desk for school so she boxed it up and put it away i wasnt sure if to set your picture in it or not mina was putting on her shoes a determined look on her face you cant go with me jin repeated uneasily not where im going where are you going a long walk too far for you why do you want to come anyway shed been aunt and uncles pet he thought tetsu and ken are horrid to me teasing and bedeviling uncle hikaru yells at them but he never gets up and does anything jin didnt quite see the problem with this well he had a dim sense that maybe it was his job to heckle his own sister but if somebody else wanted to take up the slack he had no objection theyre probably just jealous because you get all the girl stuff plus if you werent here ken would have your room he added in a fairminded fashion uncle and aunt were talking about dopting me before you came back but i dont want tetsu and ken for my brothers i want my real brother how can they adopt you when moms still he trailed off alive the word choked in his throat a wad of uncertainty he swallowed it and went on you cant stay where im going ithey wouldnt want you youd just get in the way while suzesan and the people at her place might be willing to treat a stray boy as casually as a stray cat he had a queasy sense that a stray girl and younger at that might be another story and while the police not to mention uncle hikaru and aunt lorna might be less excited about him running away a second time would that boredom extend to mina you couldnt keep up yes i could sh keep your voice down her mouth went mulish if you dont take me along ill set up a screech and theyll catch you and put you back in my room and i wont let you out again so there he tried to decide if she was bluffing no probably not could he hit her on the head with something and knock her out while he made his getaway he had a feeling that worked better in holovids than in real life and if he hit her with one of aunt lornas pots or pans the only blunt instruments immediately available it would make a hellish bong and wake everybody up anyway defeating his purpose she interrupted his hostile mulling in a practical tone that reminded him of uncle hikaru besides i have money and you dont how much over five hundred nuyen she answered proudly i saved it up from my birthday and chores enough for a dozen tram fares except that jin had sworn off the tube system he craned his neck for a look at the kitchen clockmaybe two hours till dawn and everybody getting up and missing them that wasnt very much of a headstart compared to the last time it was now or never jin surrendered to the inevitable all right get ready quietly do you know where aunt lorna put my stuff they found jins clothes in the plastic basket along with his shoes in the closet off the kitchen that harbored the launderizer mina knew which kitchen drawer hid the lunch bars too and stuck a dozen in a sack within minutes they both edged out the sliding back door jin latched the patio gate as quietly as he could behind them and led off up the alley the occasional streetlights made cold halos in the clammy night mist ive never been outside this late before said mina still whispering though they were well away from the row house its weird are you afraid of the dark she made to walk closer to jin he strode faster the darks all right its people you have to be afraid of i guess so a longer silence while their feet thumped softly on the pavement then mina said that thing aunt lorna said to you about recidrecidiv i cant pronounce it kids who run away over and over they dont really freeze them do they jin pondered it uneasily i never heard of it before and it would cost a lot of money i think so she was just trying to scare you into being good yeah the scare part had sure worked jin had to allow that but anyway they dont freeze you the first time mina seemed to take undue satisfaction from this thought an unwelcome memory rose in jins mind it wasnt the clammy smell of the night that triggered it because the policewomen had come for his mother in the daytime but the clammy chill in his gut that day had felt much like this mom kneeling down gripping his shoulders saying jin help look after mina all right be a good big brother and do what aunt lorna tells you jin had given up on that last when aunt lorna had insisted that he get rid of all of his pets yes all a clean sweep there was no room and they smelled and pooped too much and that bird was homicidal and to top everything ken was supposedly allergic to lucky who was too lazy to scratch anyone jin just figured his cousin was doing all that sniffling and blowing on purpose to be annoying in which he certainly succeeded jin had forgotten the first part of that maternal partingblessing curse whatever it was because after all nobody yelled at mina they way theyd yelled at him and his pets he wished he hadnt remembered that they had a good long walk ahead of them just to get out of this area which they needed to do before they were missed maybe theyd better lie up and hide during school hours jin selected a direction he was almost sure was south and kept trudging chapter seven two days after his dawn return to the consulate miless party assembled on the front walk and watched the whitechrys groundcar pull up to collect them it was long sleek gleaming and settled to the pavement with a sigh like a satisfied lover roics eyebrows rose better tn that busthing they ferried us conference delegates around in ill give it that indeed said miles good job vorlynkin it looks like whitechrys means to grovel in style this won an uncertain headduck from the consul who had spent a good part of yesterday in repeated calls to and from their wouldbe host to set all this up while miles played hardtoget at least the delay had given him time to recover from the induced seizure but while it would do no harm to miless cause if barrayars own diplomat plainly found him alarming he was not altogether sure if the man was under control or sure whose control hes under he favored the consul with a brief smile by the by vorlynkin please refrain from commenting on anything you hear me say or see me do today for the duration youre the yesman an unreadable pause yes my lord auditor capable of irony was he good probably itll be just like watching a play roic reassured him vorlynkins brows quirked albeit not in an especially reassured way dr durona engaged in examining the variegated hostas lining the walk straightened and turned his braided head with interest as the groundcars rear compartment canopy rose and a woman exited she was as sleek as the groundcar if considerably more delicate her long black hair was drawn back and bundled with enameled combs in an elegant construction that miles was sure raven must envy kibou natives wore a variety of fashions both local and galacticinspired miles had been here just long enough to decode her garb as businesstraditional female version a skinskimming top a fitted undercoat and the loose cordfastened outer coat might be worn by either men or women but then instead of the wide trousers tied in at the ankles adopted by men she showed off trim calves with a short skirt and leggings all in subtle autumnal shades that set off her deep brown eyes the overall effect was simultaneously upperclass and sexy like a very expensive courtesanmiles had once had the geisha tradition explained to him on a visit to earth itself on its island of origin a sidebenefit of having a bride with a mania for gardens the sense that this woman was a weapon aimed directly at him came mainly from her diminutive height which nearly matched his own and the fact that she wore flat sandals good morning ohayo gozaimasu she favored them all with a formal bow but her smile zeroed in on miles lord vorkosigan consul vorlynkin duronasensei roicsan wonderful youre all here i am aida mr ron wings personal assistant for today i will escort you to whitechryss new facility and answer any questions you may have along the way ill bet not mine thought miles but returned appropriate greetings and allowed the pretty young lady to shepherd them all into the spacious groundcar miles wondered how much her boss had scrambled to find a hostess of that height on such short as it were notice ron wing was the man miles had been holding out for yesterday while vorlynkin fielded oblique messages and visibly refrained from tearing his hair wings official title was head of development he was one of whitechryss chief operating officers and the man in ultimate charge of the komarr expansion effort it was his underlings who had spent so much effort cultivating miles and vice versa during the cryonics conference now well see whats on the other end of their string roic aida and raven took the rearfacing seat miles and vorlynkin settled opposite no one even risked bumping heads with each other in the shuffle reminds me of my das old groundcar miles murmured to roic nah roic whispered back as the driver in the front compartment who had not been introduced set them smoothly in motion this isnt even half the mass no armor plating softvoiced aida offered a startling variety of drinks from the cars bar which everyone politely refused after miles did miles tilted his face to the polarized canopy to get a better look at the capital from an aboveground vantage for a change no actual mountains cradled northbridge but it had been long enough since the glaciers had retreated here for streams to have carved the moraines into something other than scrapedflat the native plant species rudimentary at best had pretty much been displaced by urban landscaping based on earth imports the city was city grown up around an infrastructure of galacticstandard transport and technology if miles hadnt walked through it himself hed have no guess of what strangeness lay below the view grew more interesting when they reached the west end and approached the cryopolis proper the cryopolis began to be developed some forty years ago aida informed them in good guide style when further extension of cryofacilities beneath the city grew too expensive now northbridge has grown out to meet it and it has become its own municipality named western hope and how many representatives does western hope field to the territorial prefectures legislature miles inquired fourteen she replied brightly as many as the parentcity itself though it occupied a fraction of the area interesting roics head swiveled around what t heck pyramids said dr durona happily craning too dozens of em is there a river around here called denial miles reminded himself to repress raven too at the earliest private opportunity aidas permanent smile grew briefly pained but recovered at once those are the facilities of our largest cryonics services competitor newegypt about a kilometer of sandstone wall was pierced by a high gate flanked by huge statues of somber seated figures sporting slim canine heads i saw those before said roic back at the conference there was a fellow wandering around in a skimpy costume with a big plastic dog head handing out flyers seemed more like an advertisement for a jacksons whole bioengineering firm miles could fill in that one the figures are of anubis the egyptian god of the dead he explained they had a number of other gods with animal headshawks cats cowsthat had various figurative meanings thats actually not a dog but a jackal which was a carrioneating scavenger in their ancient deserts a natural association with death for a preindustrial folk i suppose he glanced at aida and refrained from expanding the parallel though he did wonder if anyone had bothered to check the translations on those hieroglyphs decorating the walls or whether they really read something like ptahhotep is a louse or unas owes teti one hundred wheat sheaves and a firkin of figs aida glanced at the receding figures and sniffed as you can see theyve taken up that era from old earth as their corporate theme more of a theme park miles thought aida added with reluctant admiration the pyramids are their cryostorage facilities newegypt has found that patrons will pay a premium for the more limited luxury space on the upper levels luxury space said roic isnt it all t same once youre frozen i mean technologically he glanced at raven who murmured one certainly trusts so yes but the cryocontracts are selected and signed by the living people aida explained it has been a very appealing and successful program for newegypt theyve trademarked that entire historical period to block imitators she added in a tone of some disappointment they were giving away live sphinxes at the conference this year but our department head was too late to get us one with effort miles didnt blink and so he had a good view of the next facility along their route which featured glass towers and glittering spires wrapped with lines of colored light the groundcar was well soundinsulated but he could have sworn a faint bass beat penetrated the canopy music shinkawa consolidated their guide explained sure enough they passed another gate with the cryocorps name displayed over it in shifting rainbow hues i believe they are trying to appeal to a younger crowd miles tried to digest that it wasnt going down surely that would be the smallest market segment patrons are normally older when their contract is activated yes said aida but personal affordability is improved the sooner you sign on and begin your payments its actually been a very effective strategy for shinkawa if i didnt have a cryocontract through my own employer as part of my benefits package id consider them myself she hid a giggle behind one wellmanicured hand though i probably shouldnt tell you that another cryocorp campus appeared on the opposite side of the highway it seemed to have a lot of trees but neither walls nor gatesnor gate guardsthough a low stone divider bore the name northern spring what buildings miles could spot through the vegetation looked blocky and utilitarian miles pointed how about those folks ah northern spring said aida they have the distinction of being one of the oldest cryocorps in the region and one of the first to develop a facility out here but they are not what we would call top tier actually according to miless notalwaysinadequate preliminary reports on kiboudaini they were the sixth largest publiclyowned cryocorp presently doing business which would certainly make them what he would call top tier but the general look of their place was staid to the point of stodgy a lot of money was being spent to woonot the dead miles supposed but the living although for personal longterm cryosequestration one might well want an immortal entity like a corporation left in charge their impressive fronts promised a number of things but mostly continuity if only one didnt know that at the secret heart of all such organizations corporations and governments alike it still came down to a finite number of fallible people talking to each other the big groundcar slowed and turned passing under an enormous red torii gatewhitechrys lost no time in asserting its chosen corporate style the security beeped them through electronically without a pause they rounded a stand of pine trees and pulled up before the headquarters building an efficient tower block rose behind but the visitor first threaded an imitationtraditional garden all water and walkways moss clumps raked pebbles and delicate red maples the theme continued inside the big glass lobby with gnarled miniature trees and severe flower arrangements amid all this tasteful splendor their hosts awaited bowing and miles shook off the last of his lingering seizure fatigue and gathered his wits ron wing in person proved middleaged and trim in formal business attire undercoat widesleeved outer coat with just a hint of winged shoulders and baggy trousers in subtle muted blues complete right down to the splittoe socks and sandals style fabric and cut all signaled status money and mode as surely as a barrayaran vor males quasimilitary tunic trousers and halfboots the calculated dress was backed up by shrewd eyes and a sober attention at wings elbow hovered the fellow who had delicately conveyed whitechryss bribe to the lord auditor at the party the night before the terroristsactivistsidiotists had struck so rudely interrupting their promising exchange hideyuki storrs bore the title of executive vice president for development he wore a slimmer version of his bosss garb much like vorlynkins studiously local dress tradition modified by utility miles had pegged him as a highranking minion but not quite inner circle the development department plainly wanted to take up where theyd left off and miles was reminded not to let himself be unruffled too soon no point in wasting a free edge half of miless maneuvering yesterday had been to climb the chain of command up to one who knows as aida passed the party on to storrs who made the formal introductions to wing miles thought with satisfaction target acquired locked on by wings smile miles wondered if his opposite was thinking something similar i am more important to you than i ought to be why im so pleased said wing that you have allowed us to make up for some of the inconveniences you have lately suffered lord vorkosigan miles made an itsnotyourfault wave of his free hand undercut by a thin grimace and returned we can only be grateful that no one was seriously injured or killed in the whole escapade truly agreed wing in exchange this does allow us to give you a much more detailed look at our facility than the general tour would have some exchange does seem due yes would you care for some refreshments tea or shall we follow galactic custom and begin right away id prefer to jump straight in actually my time here is not unlimited right this way then the whole party shuffled off after wing at miless canepace not altogether feigned between his underground ordeal and the usual aftereffects of the damned seizures his aches and pains were catching up with him aida stuck to his side as if ready to catch him should he fall over the prettiest public parts of the hq building were quickly displayed then they were wafted by float cart over to another building where actual intake of patrons occurred both the front lobby and the back loading docks seemed busy our patrons come from two sources wing explained leading them down the medicallyscented corridors some whove suffered sudden and unexpected metabolic shutdowns are actually processed by the hospitals and then transferred to us for longterm storage others who choose a less chancy mode come in to our clinics and have us do the processing onsite wait they come in alive asked roic the healthier you are when frozen the better your chances of a healthy revival said storrs thats quite true murmured raven roics brows drew down and he shot a glance at miles who could only say alas yes would you care for a closer look at the technical processes said wing that section isnt normally on the public tours of course we have some twenty or so freezings scheduled for today the transfers are of course usually unscheduled miles who had once endured the whole process far too intimately if not consciously waved aside the macabre treat roic looked relieved vorlynkin bore it all with a wooden expression raven at miless thumbsup behind his back took the suggestion and went off with storrs miles was glad to exit the processing building the smell of the place while not unpleasant was doing odd jumpy things to his backbrain and how many cryorevivals do you do here in a day miles asked wing once they were safely back in the float cart and in motion he and wing shared the front seat with the best view aida sat facing rearward at their backs and vorlynkin and roic shared the last bench not quite out of earshot wing hesitated only slightly i would have to look that figure up he glanced back as the cart bowled along through the wellkept grounds how did you come to know dr durona included in this jaunt at milesswell not request raven had simply been announced in the seat count for the groundcar he and my assistant roic were rather thrown together during the kidnappings a bonding experience i gather ah that would explain it your roic looks a fellow id want to duck behind in a crisis too it was plain wing had no trouble translating assistant as bodyguard no one looking at roic and miles together ever thought anything else miles was fairly sure wing had not yet decoded the complexities of armsman wing went on i was intrigued to learn you have a relative who is a major shareholder in the durona group unless the name vorkosigan is common on barrayar mark so youve finally caught up with that another clue one of several that miless auditorial visit to kibou had come as a surprise to the cryocorp and they were still on the scramble to peg him miles had met deeplaid plots years in fruition wings maneuvers smelled of stopgap maybe only days old my younger brother actually really wing smiled do you think our komarr expansion project would be of interest to him as well yes but not in the way you think id prefer to keep mark out of this hes a very shrewd businessman while ive labored my whole life in public service for very little reward hes piled up profits to envy passing me by one of the things that most excites me about your project is the chance at last to beat him at his own game miles arranged his lips in a smile of vulpine sibling rivalry wing got it at once which said something about wing i quite see he added after a moment and does he have anything like your influence in public affairs lord vorkosigan no he pretty much keeps to the shop too bad not from my point of view and the rest of your famous family are you on warmer terms with them oh yes though a chance to show them all up doesnt come along every day miles let his voice turn faintly whiny ive always had more to prove on barrayar there let wing digest that a nice balance between jealous greed and the promise of an influence worth peddling and it would stand up to surface inquiry thank you brother wings brow furrowed in doubt wont dr durona report back to him lets just say im working on that miles softened his voice so the hum of the cart kept it from carrying you know the old saying keep your friends close and your enemies closer wing nodded thats a good one he hesitated weve prepared a presentation on the komarr project for you next should we invite the good doctor to view another part of the facility during that it wont be necessary unless you have some technical innovation you prefer not to disclose to potential rivals no the komarr installation will be based on tried and trusted technology our innovations are all to the business model no problem then i gather raven is one of those techie typesbusiness goes right over his head how provincial was this fellow wing raven was from bloody jacksons whole where the deal was art science war and survivaltilldawn have you ever been offworld mr wing yes i had a trip to your komarr last year when we were setting up all business im afraidi had very little time to tour i never got outside of the solstice dome ah thats a shame back in the headquarters building they were all trundled off to a topfloor conference room elegantly appointed with more gnarly potted treelets and fine art glass aida at last persuaded them to consume assorted beveragesmiles and vorlynkin stuck to green tea roic to coffeeafter which they were subjected to a glossy holovid presentation all about the large whitechrys cryonics facility presently under construction in the solstice dome komarrs planetary capital try as he might miles could spot nothing about it that was not perfectly aboveboard neither with access to far more detailed data had impsec komarr and theyd looked it over closely incidentally picking up with whitechryss full cooperation and applause two overcharging contractors an embezzling customs clerk and a ring of warehouse thieves although none of that was mentioned in wings snazzy vid raven and storrs joined them about halfway through the vid wound up in a burst of optimisticyettasteful music miles leaned back in his incredibly comfortable conference chair steepling his fingers so why komarr if you wanted to expand offworld wouldnt escobar have been closer wing sat up looking happy to answer we did look into it but escobars own cryonics services are far more mature and are further shielded from competition by what i can only call highly protectionist regulation our analysts concluded that komarr despite the extra distance offered far more scope for growth which is after all where most profits lie profits in which we hope barrayarans like yourself will share of course indeed solstice dome is sharing alreadyall the work after the design stage was contracted locally i expect said miles judiciously once everyone on a planet has been sold a cryocontract theres no place left to go but outward he didnt add though theres one born every minute but it was a struggle its the hazard of a mature market yes im afraid although some interesting work has been done in the past year with commodifying contracts beg pardon wings voice warmed with genuine enthusiasm cryonics contracts have not been historically uniform having been collected over many years by many institutions often under different local laws they yield on wildly varying bases any of which might have grown or shrunk since the contract was activated companies themselves have split combined gone bankrupt or been bought out formerly contracts and the responsibility for them have changed hands only along with the institutions holding them but it was recently realized that a secondary market in individual contracts could provide considerable opportunity either for profittaking or to raise operating capital miles felt his brow corrugating youre buying and selling the dead swapping all those frozen bodies around roics horrified expression was much less controlled no no said wing storrs seconded his boss with vigorous headshake no no no that would be absurdly wasteful wing went on the patrons mostly stay right where they are unless a facility is being upgraded or decommissioned of course the patrons are held on a reciprocal accounting basis company to company its only their contracts that are traded he added piously its hoped that over time this will result in a more uniform and fairer contract structure industrywide miles translated this as when weve squeezed the sponge dry well stop judging by ravens remarkably blank smile quite as if he hadnt understood a single word he was making the exact same construction and er will you be applying that model to komarr miles asked unfortunately no there is no one there to trade with although he sighed wing did not seem to be especially distressed by this miles read that as we plan to be a monopoly this is all quite stunning miles said honestly and what do you think of it all vorlynkin he cast the consul a jovial wink ready to sign up i suppose its all old hat to you though notreally said vorlynkin most of my work has dealt with the concerns of the living i had to expedite returning the remains of one poor barrayaran tourist who was killed glacierdiving last yearvery dangerous sportand sign off on the delivery of a couple of kibou business people whod died of natural causes in the empire and been shipped home one frozen one as ashes there were complaints about the latter from the kin which i forwarded to those responsible vorlynkin added diplomaticallyhow elsei do appreciate this behindthescenes view wingsan its proving an eyeopener for me the glance under his lashes was at miles though they were all gathered up again and conveyed to lunch which was served in a low building overlooking more gardens and a koi pond the space was all paper screens and tatami mats plus more art glass and those flower arrangements consisting of a handful of pebbles three sticks two buds and a blossom they sat on silk cushions at a couple of low lacquer tables miles had wing on one side and aida on the other all to himself storrs hosted vorkynkin roic and raven at the second table a pair of servers brought in a succession of delicate dishes all looking like miniature sculptures and miles finally allowed aida to serve him an oddtasting clear wine in a flat ceramic cup he wondered if the vessels design was meant to be selflimiting anyone too drunk must spill the contents down their front he managed not to barely aida facilitated the conversation onto a series of pleasant neutral topics all the while inching nearer her coat and undercoat loosened to strategically reveal the swell of her breasts beneath her lowcut top miles suspected pheromone perfumes but the message hardly needed the boost this young lady could be part of his bribe if he wished alas aida had shown no sign of knowing enough dirt to cultivate and anyway he didnt need to look every kind of corruptible there was such a thing as artistic restraint miles pulled out his holovid cube and showed off pictures of his magnificent wife and adorable children and she backed off although he also vented a few complaints about the high costs of raising a family and wing inched nearer encouraging him in this vein miles drank more weird wine and grinned foolishly whitechrys would have kept refilling miless cup till he slid under the table he was sure he only wound up the party by repeated hints about vorlynkin needing to get back to his duties aida slipped across to entertain the other group while wing took miles on a turn around the pond to clear our heads miless head at least cleared quite quickly when wing at last got down to some very specific details about how miless new shares were to be secretly transferred he supposed he shouldnt think of it as quick work my lord auditor from foreplay to coitus in one afternoon but who was being screwed and why why why was he being bribed i truly believe in the komarr project wing told him with apparent sincerity and a touch of euphoria though miles couldnt tell if it was induced by the wine or the closing of the negotiations to wing he suspected they were interchangeable the man harbored an almost jacksonian passion for winning in the deal in fact ive switched all my own stock and options from whitechrys to whitechrys solstice ive even placed my own cryocontract with the new facility thats how much im behind it so you see ive put my money and my life where my mouth is his dark eyes almost sparkled with this revelation and miles connections boiling up at last thought ye gods i think youve just handed me your head chapter eight the wolf spider was perky and sharp in a black coat with white stripes and neat dots like an aristocrat in a historical holovid dressed for a night on the town jin could clearly count all eight eyes in its fierce little face two bright black buttons looking back at him crowned by four more above and another on each side of its head beneath itsno beneath her abdomen clung a bundle of fine white fluff like a tiny cotton ballan egg case was she going to be a mama spider prone on the floor of the musty garden shed jin stiffened with excitement then drew slowly backwards careful not to startle her into scuttling into the cracks in the floor or walls before he could find something to capture her in she was a good size for her breed over three centimeters quite as long and wide as the end joint of jins thumb so she was certainly a grownup spider she seemed to wait patiently for him jin stared around the shed in some frustration it was taking a lot longer to walk from his aunt and uncles outlying northwest suburb to the near south side of the city than he had imagined it was partly from mina lagging and complaining as soon as shed grown tired just as jin had expected but mostly he was afraid hed got turned around and lost during their long trudge last night streets curved unexpectedly mixing him up and the towers of the city center glimpsed now and then from a hill or clear space looked much the same from any direction this shelter had been a splendid find early this morning theyd stopped to buy halfliters of milk in a corner store of a neighborhoody area then spent the next few blocks looking for a place to hide out during school hours one house had a for sale sign out front and a peek through the windows revealed it cleared of furniture and empty of people safe it had been locked up tight but the door to the shed around back proved unlatched the garden was highwalled and full of sheltering bushes and trees good to hide them from prying busybodies better yet theyd found an outdoor spigot with the water still turned on minas lunch bars were holding out if getting boring but finding water had been more of a problem though during the long march yesterday theyd twice lucked out with city parks that offered not only drinking fountains but bathrooms mina had proved very cranky about going behind a bush even in the concealing dark the shelves of this shed had been cleared of likely containers unfortunately as well as of garden tools except for one bent and rusty trowel jins eye fell on his sleeping sister curled up with her jacket folded under her head her zippered yellow backpack beside her decorated with smiling but anatomically misdrawn bees he squatted down and began rooting through it ah there hey mumbled mina sitting up and yawning her sleeppale face was marked with creases from her makeshift pillow and her hair hung every which way what was it about sleeping in the daytime that made people so hot and rumpled are you stealing my money jim popped open the clear plastic box she kept her coins in and dumped the contents back into the pack no i just need the box what for asked mina enduring this rummage but at least not theft of her possessions with no more than a frown spider house eew i dont like spiders their webs stick in your mouth shes a wolf spider they dont spin webs oh mina blinked considering this she didnt look altogether convinced but at least she didnt set up any stupid shrieking she did keep her distance till jin had snuck up on and captured his prey but once the lady spider was safe behind the transparent barrier mina was at least willing to take a closer look as jin pointed out the manifold if miniature splendors of fur and eyes and mandibles and the promising egg case she really does have eight eyes said mina crossing her own as if trying to imagine the spiders view of her emboldened by her brothers example she tapped on the plastic lid hey dont youll scare her will she be able to breathe in there asked mina jin regarded the box in new doubt it was certainly secure but it did seem rather airtight the wolf spider scratched futilely at the walls of her prison with fine claws for a while anyway whats her name i havent named her yet she needs a name jin nodded full agreement all right sometimes mina could be sensible it was said there were thousands of wolf spider species back on old earth but the kibou terraformers stingily had only imported half a dozen or so for their new ecosystem but with no comlink here he couldnt look up his new pets real scientific name he hoped it would turn out to be something as sophisticated as the spider herself you could call her spinner except you said she doesnt spin wolfie sounds like a boys name jin objected it ought to be a ladys name to fit her something from old earth mina scowled in thought a moment then brightened lady murasaki thats the oldest ladys name i know of jin about to poohpooh her idea in brotherly reflex paused he eyed his spider the name did fit all right mina grinned in triumph what does she eat littler bugs i should catch her some in the garden before we leave im not sure how much longer it will take us to get um home growing more interested after all this mina said can i help feed her sure mina stretched and perhaps reminded of food dug in her pillaged backpack for another lunch bar maybe we better split this to make them last good idea jin admitted he set the spider box aside and went out to rinse and fill their milk bottles with water from the garden spigot when he slipped back inside the shed closing the door with a creak mina asked what time is it out there im not sure afternoon anyway do you think schools out yet can we go on the streets again pretty soon they divided the lunch bar and the water maybe you should put lady murasaki in one of our water bottles instead said mina draining hers and holding it up to the light falling through the sheds one grimy window we could poke breathholes through it i was going to rinse those out and fill them up with water to take with us you know how you were yammering you were so hot and thirsty yesterday afternoon my feet were so sweaty inside my shoes mina said they felt nasty she looked up at him still a bit puffyeyed from their uncomfortable days sleep how much longer is it going to take to get to your place hard to say jin shrugged uneasily ive been gone way longer than id planned i sure hope milessan is taking care of all my creatures thats your galactic friend right during their winding journey the past day and a half jin had slowly unburdened himself of what he suspected were far too many of his secrets to mina partly to shut up her incessant questions mostly because well he hadnt had any other kids to talk to for so long yah jins own abysmal failure as a courier troubled his mind would milessan believe jin hadnt stolen his money how was he getting along with gyre you had to be gentle but firm with the bird the chickens were easier except for the part about climbing down and carrying them back up the ladder or the stairs when they fluttered over the parapet with that cane could milessan manage both an indignant chicken and the stairs does milessan have any children mina asked jin frowned he didnt say hes pretty oldthirtysomething he said but hes kind of funnylooking i dont know if he could get a girl once the drug effects had worn off milessan had been a nice enough fellow with that face where smiles seemed at home plus he had seemed to understand jins creatures which made him quite smart for a grownup jin wasnt sure whether to wish him a short understanding bride or not after a long thoughtful pause mina said do you think hed like some what children like if hes lonely at jins baffled stare mina forged on we read this book for school this year about two orphans adopted by a man from earth he took them there and they saw everything about where our ancestors came from she added enticingly they got new pets jin vaguely remembered that one from his own second school year otherwise made burdensome by the infliction of beginning kanji there had been a lot of sickly stuff about the girl getting a fancy kimono but there had also been a chapter about going to the seaside which had featured some earth sea creaturesmuch too short an episode but at least thered been picturesand a cat whod capped her excellence by having kittens at the end milessan isnt from earth hes from barrayar he said wheres that somewhere beyond escobar i guess escobar jin knew was kibous closest nexus trading partner by a shortish multijump route farther worlds didnt much come up till galactic history in high school except for earth jin had studied a lot about earth on his own because of the zoology now if only some benefactor would come along and offer to take jin to earth although come to think barrayar as milessan had described it might be almost as good with its double biota a sudden picture bloomed in jins mind of the odd little fellow living all alone in a cottage in the countryno better a big rambling old house with a vast overgrown garden like the book with that old professor who had taken in two children from the city during wartimejin didnt know what war except it was from a period before anybody got frozen thered been a horse that drew a cart and wonderful adventures involving a cave with blind white fish jin had seen a horse in the northbridge zoo once on a class field trip the braver children had all been allowed to pat its glossy neck while one of the keepers held its lead jin remembered the huge beast blowing air out its soft bellowslike nostrils in a warm whoosh across his cheek jin understood there were littler versions bred just for children called ponies mina wouldnt be scared of one that size the looming beast at the zoo had alarmed even jin but hed been younger then too a great rambling house and animals and it was all rubbish milessan wasnt a professor or their uncle of any kind great or regular and for all jin knew he lived in a cramped city apartment and wasnt lonely at all jin decided he didnt like that country daydream it hurt too much when it stopped he frowned at mina nobodys going to adopt us and take us away from here thats a stupid idea mina looked offended she turned one shoulder to him and began pulling on her socks they were blotched with pinkishbrown stains where her blisters had popped and bled and jin gulped faint guilt they both donned their shoes lady murasaki was safely lodged in minas backpack where jin argued she would endure less bouncing than in his pocket and they sneaked out onto the street once more a winding kilometer farther on during which jin kept looking for and not getting a glimpse of the downtown towers for orientation they came upon a busier street with a tubetram station entry minas footsteps had grown short and gimpy already she looked at the entrance in some longing if you want to go on the tramshe swallowed a bitill pay our fares no the police have vidcams in the stations thats how i got trapped day before yesterday we cant go in there but jins eye was caught by a big colorful display on the outside of the entry kiosk a map he peered up carefully for scanning vidcams on this side didnt spot any and ventured nearer mina trailing the lighted you are here arrow horrified jin they were nowhere near the south side of town as hed hoped from how far theyd trudged theyd somehow ended up on the residential east side instead and still had maybe thirty kilometers left to hike before they reached the light industrial zone of the south quite as far as theyd already come well that explained why the houses were so nice around here jin stepped closer squinting just two stops farther on this line was the very station hed exited to reach the barrayaran consulate it was about a threekilometer walk above ground jin stared thinking he had dimly planned to offer minas money to milessan when they arrived at their destination but his sister was proving pretty tightfisted in jins view she was sure to set up a screech even though jin was nearly certain milessan would replace it as soon as he could but if he stopped at the consulate first and explained his loss editing his situation a bit maybe would they give him more money for the barrayaran milessan seemed fairly important to them and they wouldnt turn jin in because they were protecting their own secrets right contemplating this confession made him feel a little sick but not as sick as going all the way back to milessan emptyhanded as well as three days late he stared harder at the map trying to memorize the streets and turns i know where were going now he said to mina trying to sound confident and bigbrotherly come on after the whitechrys groundcar dropped them all off again at the consulate roic followed mlord upstairs and watched him down two headache tabs and several glasses of water returning to the entry hall mlord stuck his head into the room roic thought of as the parlor where raven durona had been left to cool his heels and said debriefing downstairs again i think raven nodded and unfolded himself to tag along there had been little conversation on the way home aida had still been escorting mlord had settled into himself heavyeyed vorlynkin had stared out the canopy with a set jaw roic considered himself an observer and raven had been disinclined to buck the obvious trend they arrived downstairs at the door to the tightroom to discover it closed and locked mlord hit the intercom vorlynkin are you in there open up just a moment mlord vorlynkins voice came from the speaker the moment turned into several minutes while mlord tapped his foot and raven sat on the nearby step and yawned reminds me of a house with only one bathroom when the relatives have come to visit remarked roic as the wait stretched mlord cast him a dry look i wouldnt know ive never lived in a house with only one bathroom roic returned him an ironic headtilt at length the doorseal popped the vaultlike door swung open and the consul admitted them his eyes seemed electric blue and he was breathing fast as though he had been running youre too late he announced mlords brows rose not a first what for this time a muscle jumped by vorlynkins scowling mouth i just sent a full report of what i witnessed by tightbeam to general allegre at impsec hq barrayar i never thought id live to see a vorkosigan sell himself for money my career may be slagged but so will yours my lord auditor ah excellent thats done mlord kicked the door shut it sealed with a sigh that seemed insufficiently dramatic for vorlynkins mood what vorlynkins fists clenched not that every man doesnt have his price mlord went on amiably as im sure wingsan would agree i was more afraid that if he didnt come up to scratch today id have that whole parade at the conference to do over again if the consul didnt stop inhaling he was going to pop a lung roic thought he put in peaceably stop baiting the poor fellow mlord now that you have what you want anyway roic didnt want to have to wrestle the man to the floor if he went for mlords throat which he seemed on the verge of doing was that old phrase about being mad enough to spit nails supposed to apply to like roofing nails or fingernails around mlord roic had never been sure mlord added a trifle impatiently men like wing dont go around throwing their money at potential opponents at random vorlynkin first they have to figure out that the target is bribable i did my best to help him decide have a seat consul doctor its time we talked vorlynkins mouth which had opened to emit some hot remark sagged lord vorkosiganis this a sting it is now mlord pulled out a station chair and plunked into it we werent sure at first which is why they sent mei could be bait and trap at the same time saving the imperium on jumpship fares if nothing else vorlynkin sank more slowly into a chair opposite roic breathed easier the consul glanced in dismay at the secured comconsole mlordi sent the report dont apologize your next official visitor might really be on the take after all i dont intend to apologize to you either if it makes you feel any better ive seen our diplomatic personnel bought out before i had to make sure you weretesting me that disturbing heat in vorlynkins eyes which had started to fade flared once more why do you suppose i hauled you along today and let you see all this vorlynkins hands clenched on his knees but slowly eased again i see very efficient do try to keep up mlord added more kindly it wont be easy this case has baffled a few impsec analysts he turned to raven so what did you learn of interest during the time you had with storrs ravens mouth twisted in doubt im not sure i learned anything new their cryofreezing program seems perfectly legitimatenothing wrong with their procedures from a technical standpoint i asked to see a revival but storrs said there werent any scheduled today which by then didnt surprise me he did show me the revival facilities they looked quite adequate he angled to find out if i would be interested in employment with whitechrys and tried to find out my current pay rate i said my main interests lay with cryorevival as its more medically challenging he said hed pass that along although he didnt say who to we came back and joined your show in progress where youd finished the dogs and were on to the ponies eh raven shrugged vorlynkin blinked lord vorkosigan is dr durona your agent civilian contract consultant mlord clarified being paid out of my case budget are you still collecting your durona group salary simultaneously raven raven smirked thats personal information ill take that as a yes so dont hesitate to use dr durona on double shifts if needed raven grinned and rose to prod the automatic beverage maker strategically positioned near the secured comconsole and its satellite console it coughed up something coffeeish judging by the smell raven picked up the cup and gestured politely toward his chair roic waved him back to it and took up a position propping the wall with his arms crossed in a pose copied from a certain former impsec chief to bring you up to speed vorlynkin mlord went on whitechrys was vetted and cleared by impsec when its advance teams first scouted komarr eighteen months ago but impsec was looking for connections with military espionage and the like their business plan passed the local komarran commissions and they were in no one would have given them a second look for years if it hadnt been for some good oldfashioned nepotism within the last few months as the flagship facility we saw in wings vid was nearing completion whitechrys began collecting contracts on future customers not unnaturally they targeted solstice upperclass elderly womens clubs at the same time another sales team made some limited strategic stock offerings to certain wealthy and influential komarrans to give the local powersthatbe a stake in the future success of their operations i expect the two sales teams didnt compare hit lists nor realize that some wealthy old ladies are retired komarran traders who can read a balance sheet to a gnats eyebrow and one of those little old ladies looked at the two proposals before her and said this smells but i dont see how so she took it to her beloved greatniece who said youre right auntie this smells but i dont see how who took the problem in turn to her devoted husband better known as emperor gregor vorbarra who handed it to his loyal imperial auditor saying and i quote here miles youre better at diving into the privy and coming up with the gold ring than anyone i know have a go and i said thank you sire and took ship for kiboudaini vorlynkin blinked again deeply roic reflected that the imperiums shrewd komarran empress served gregor in more ways than just the joint production of their several scarily smart children mlord went on blithely the other thing wealthy old komarrans tend to have is an excess of planetary voting shareser raven do i need to explain these to you yes please said raven settling back and looking fascinated the system as usual is a relict of komarrs colonization history the planet is presently unlivablethough undergoing longterm terraformingall settlement is in sealed arcologies the domes i knew that much right so to encourage the development of the domes the early komarran colonists set up a reward system in addition to an inalienable onepersononevote that every komarran is born and dies with the colony awarded additional votes to those taking on the work and risk of creating more living space these were inheritable tradable salable and in general accumulateable the basis of the komarran oligarchy as it now stands is clan possession of blocks of these planetary voting shares the place is putatively a democracy but some are measurably more equal than others you follow raven nodded so said vorlynkin who had after all had two years to watch kiboudaini in operation you think whitechrys plans to accumulate those votes wholesale i do now mind you komarr has a long history of attempted chicanery with its voting system over time its accumulated a huge number of rules to thwart same among other things voting shares cant be held outright by corporationsthey have to be in the hands of individuals there are tested systems for proxies and so on whitechryss contracts passed muster with the komarran regulators and if anybody had still been looking by that point wed have accepted that my two working hypotheses are either that whitechrys has bribed some regulatorsa possibility i now find quite compellingor that they have figured out some way to game the rules system to hide their true intention till too late or both roic couldnt help thinking that mlord oughtnt to look quite so admiring detailing this in front of the stillgentlysteaming vorlynkin but well mlord the one thing that gave me pause was that there was no way this could be a getrichquick scheme even if the komarran system of voting shares gives it a turboboost compared to kibou the profit margin on what is arguably a service industry is razorthin yet whitechrys has been spending money like a drunken vor lord why go to all this trouble for a payoff youll never live to see until the last thing wing said to me this afternoon which was that he planned to have himself frozen on komarr mlord looked around proudly as if expecting the room to burst into applause and was plainly disappointed to receive three blank looks instead he inhaled visibly backing up unpack miles right what i now suspect is going on is a twotiered scam i think there is an inner cadre of white chrys executives who plan to ride out the years in cryostasis and all be revived in time to collect the goodies in fact if theyre as smart as i think they likely plan to take turns so theres always someone on the team awake to look after their interests while they quietly automatically bloodlessly buy komarr or maybe not so bloodlessly depending on whether you consider early freezing to be murder or suicide or not the slowest subtlest and i have to say creepiest planetary conquest scheme ever devised even vorlynkin jumped at that his lips parting in consternation conquest i hardly know what else to call it but i still have a hell of a lot of dots to connect before i can sign off on this investigation as soon as we get your consulate deep data crawlers up and running thats the first thing i want to look fora list of whitechrys personnel who have lately shifted all their investments to whitechrys solstice and are planning to follow them in person because given the numbers i also think it possible that this is could be a secret group inside whitechrys who are gutting their own company to feather their nests whew said raven with proper admiration mlord bestowed a pleased smile upon him vorlynkin ran his hands through his hair how do you plan to nail the bastards bribing an imperial auditor may be as illegal as all hell on barrayar but were on kiboudaini even if you could prove itand im afraid my testimony would be suspect herei doubt wing would get more than a slap on the wrist actually i would prefer not to give the slightest hint to anyone on kibou that weve tumbled to them the ideal revenge would be to let whitechrys get their hand so far into the cookie jar on komarr that they cant get it out then cut it off at the wrist by changing the contract rules just enough on em to make them drop the votes leaving them to be exactly what they feigned to be a marginally profitable service company that would hurt enough to be a warning to others brute nationalization is a last resortit would piss off the rest of the komarran business community regardless of the rights of the case itll take some studyim afraid were going to be up to our ears in lawyers before this is donebut with luck my part of the task will be over by then mlord glanced up at vorlynkin so what do you think of your lieutenant johannes hes young which makes him both poorer and potentially more gullible is he reliable enough for this i vorlynkin was given pause ive never had cause to doubt him and your local clerk yuuichi whatshisname matson ive never had cause to doubt him either but weve never had a situation like this before that you knew sighed mlord yet routine travel visas for whitechrys personnel have been handled through the consulate all this time yes but all we ask is business or tourism plus a quick background check for criminal records mlords eyes crinkled in speculation i wonder if we should add a box to tick offreason for travel creepy planetary conquestno i suppose not vorlynkin said slowly what if i hadnt tried to turn you in just now then you wouldnt be part of this debriefing and id be on the lookout for ways to nail you to the wall too in passing mlord stretched and rolled his shoulders vorlynkin looked roic felt properly thoughtful at last now the other thing mlord began but was interrupted when the sealed door chimed lieutenant johanness voice issued from the intercom consul lord vorkosigan yes responded mlord um your halfsized couriers just turned up at the back door and hes not alone mlords brows rose vorlynkins drew down raven cocked his head in curiosity dont let him get away johannes mlord called back well be right there motioning roic to unseal the door mlord grabbed his cane and levered to his feet chapter nine the kitchen of the consulate seemed homey if spacious by jins standards maybe it was the cool dusk falling in the back garden that made it so warm and bright maybe it was all the dishes piled in the sink that made it look so well kitcheny as if a fellow could wander in and out to snack at will without being yelled at even but the noise of all the footsteps clumping up from the basement made jin shift uneasily and when minas little hand stole into his and clutched hard he didnt shake her off jins timid knock had been answered by lieutenant johannes whod taken one look cried you and hustled them both inside though hed looked askance at mina added wait right there dont move and thumped downstairs before jin could get three words into his muchrehearsed explanation of how the police had taken milessans money so jin was expecting the fierceeyed consul vorlynkin but behind him loomed the biggest barrayaran jin had seen yet half a head taller than the tall consul he wore clothes that reminded jin of a military uniform had short wavy brown hair and a firm squarejawed face and looked older than johannes but younger than the consul mina stared up at him with her mouth hanging open the big barrayaran so filled up what had till a moment before seemed a wide doorway that it took a moment for jin to notice the slim fellow with his hair in a neat dark braid who followed him and another moment to spot milessan in their wake the little man shouldered past them all coming face to face with jin he looked so different all cleaned up more grownup moredaunting that it was a couple of heartbeats before jin recovering from his shock inhaled and cried my creatures you promised youd look after them milessan held up a hand theyre all right jin when you didnt come back by midnight i copied out your instructions and gave them to ako when i implied i was going to look for you she was very willing to help out but how did you get here walked took me all that night from behind jin mina asked interestedly did you get lost too we werent lost exactly jin denied harassed just turned around a little and who are you young lady milessan addressed mina i dont believe weve been introduced sister muttered jin it wasnt my idea to bring her i have a name mina pointed out its mina want to see my blisters milessan didnt even blink sure are they good ones have they popped yet oh yesthey made my socks all bloody too well miss mina why dont you sit down here milessan pulled out a kitchen chair with a flourish and halfbowed mina into it as if shed been a grownup lady and show me he added over his shoulder johannes find something for these children to eat cookies milk gingerbread whatever are you jins galactic mina asked kicking off her sport shoes and picking at her splotched socks he told me all about you did he milessan knelt and helped her peel off her socks she said ow ow as they parted stickily from her scabs my word those are good blisters arent they he glanced up and gave vorlynkinsan a headjerk that sent the consul to rummage in the other end of the kitchen aunt lorna buys all our shoes big to grow into mina explained to milessan thats why they slip around like that lieutenant johannes peering doubtfully into the depths of the refrigerator murmured beer do you like beer mina milessan asked she shook her head making her straight black hair swing around her chin thought not somehow youll have to do better johannes arent all you attache fellows supposed to be impsec trained improvise johannes muttered something through his teeth that jin couldnt quite make out he then conducted a brief survey which determined that vatoctopus pizza no onions was universally acceptable and trod out to order some vorlynkin came back with what turned out to be a firstaid kit which he handed off to the slim man with the braid who didnt look barrayaran at all but didnt talk like someone from kibou either mina leaned toward milessan and whispered anxiously that big guy isnt a policeman is he used to be milessan whispered back gravely but now he works for me alas armsman roic had to give up all his policemans principles when he entered my service the big man cast mina a pious nod mina settled back looking relieved and let the slim man who milessan introduced as raven and said was a doctor from escobar attend to her feet vorlynkin watched closely frowning till he seemed to be satisfied with the skills displayed then straightened up and narrowed his eyes at jin the big fellow armsman roic filled two glasses with water and set them on the table mina seized hers and drank thirstily and jin followed suit more warily when hed washed down the dry lump in his throat which actually had little to do with thirst jin embarked once more on his interrupted explanation of what had happened to the consulates money vorlynkin winced when jin came to the part about the drug dealers andor smugglers but at milessans restraining handgesture the consul let jin stumble all the way to the end before saying we know we traced the packet to the police evidence rooms and picked up your arrest report too so they did believe him that was something anyway yes said milessan and im sure the consul thanks you for keeping mum and preserving his reputation dont you vorlynkin vorlynkins lips compressed in an expression anything but grateful but he choked out a certainly then through what jin reluctantly recognized as a skillful series of questionssome put to jin though many to minamilessan drew out the story of jins escape from the custody of his aunt and uncle by the time johannes returned balancing a stack of pizza boxes two liters of milk and more beer jin was afraid there wasnt much milessan didnt understand about aunt lorna uncle hikaru and cousins tetsu and ken it made jin feel uncomfortably exposed milessan kicked a stepstool to the sink and made jin and mina wash their hands following up himself as if to enforce the good example lieutenant johannes watched him mount the stepstool glanced at the impassive roic and bit his lip milessan the consul jin and mina then sat four around the kitchen table that being all the chairs there were roic and the others leaned against the counter setting out the boxes and a roll of disposable wipes the lieutenant said i checked the comconsole both these kids were reported missing yesterday every police officer in town must be on the lookout for them consul vorlynkin pressed a hand to the bridge of his nose jin bolted upright in alarm you cant turn us in milessan waved him back down no one is doing anything till after we eat he looked over the aromatic offering what no vegetables dont you two need vegetables no we dont said mina jin shook his head vigorously in support milessan bit into his slice ah perhaps not this does seem very healthy and tasty mina at least dove readily into the first hot food theyd had for two days jin overwhelmed by the aroma followed suit the consulate bought good pizza not the cheapest frozen kind that aunt lorna served the consul barely sipped his beer milessan had water and big roic to jins surprise after first pouring out for jin and mina helped himself to a small glass of milk all this redirection might have worked to calm jin except vorlynkin after swallowing his first bite said the consulate cant harbor runaways lord vorkosigan their guardians must be frantic we dont want to stay here said jin i want to get back to my creatures milessan waved his nibbled pizza slice in the air asylum thats not amusing even as a joke said vorlynkin do you have any idea of the legal complications involved in giving political asylum to minors im not sure i was joking exactly milessan said mildly but wait for the children to eat please vorlynkins jaw tightened but he nodded after jin and mina could eat no more and johannes offered more wipes and put the leftovers away in the refrigerator for breakfast just like at home milessan leaned back in his chair and said i suggest we repair downstairs the seats will be more comfortable the other barrayarans all gave milessan funny looks but recalling uncle hikarus daily afterdinner saying when shifting into his big chair of out of the bleachers and into the box seats jin saw no objection to this yet when theyd all shuffled down the stairs after milessan the room into which he led them only boasted four chairs all officeylooking swivel types milessan gestured mina and jin into a seat each took one himself and left the other three men to sort themselves out johannes parked one haunch on the long table shoved up to the wall ravensensei copied him and vorlynkin mouth pinched dropped into the remaining chair this is a funny vid room mina remarked staring around and swinging her feet now encased in a pair of milessans socks donated to keep her bandages clean when roic closed the door and blandly sat crosslegged on the floor beside it the air grew awfully hushed and for the first time jin wondered if this was a safe place to have brought her and not just from the risk of being betrayed to the authorities he kind of trusted milessan or he would have been inclined to grab her and bolt though given roic and that thick door would that impulse have come too late milessan laced his hands together between his knees and said suze the secretary told me something of the story of your mother jin mina so when i got back here i looked up what i could about her on the planetary net it made me very curious i really dont understand how it was she came to be frozen when she wasnt sick or dying or even convicted of any crime jins tasty dinner suddenly felt like lead in his stomach what do youeither of youremember about your mother milessan went on not personal things but about her work her cause especially anything that might have happened about the time of the riot at her rally or just before she was arrested jin and mina looked at each other uneasily jin said mom didnt talk to us much about her work when she was doing anything she mostly left us at aunt lornas unless i was in school then she just left mina aunt lorna wasnt too happy about all the babysitting mina said yah she said she hadnt volunteered for this and didnt much like being drafted and she was sorry about daddy but maybe if mommy really cared that much shed do better to stay home and look after his kids herself mina looked away frowning jin put in hastily but she only said things like that when she was feeling specially cranky not that he was fond of aunt lorna but these galactics were outsiders after all and it felt funny to be talking about his family like this in front of them and mom had said you should always try to be fair didnt your mother ever take you along to her meetings mina shook her head she said they werent for kids and wed just get bored and kick up a fuss huh milessan rubbed his chin when i was a youngster jins age at home i was often permitted to sit in on my fathers meetings with his er professional colleagues my grandfather had done the same with him i learned more just by the osmosis than i realized at the time of course i had to stay quiet and make myself useful or leave naturally jin frowned you cant leave if youre out somewhere mom would have had to break off what she was doing to take us home couldnt she have just tappednever mind didnt she ever have meetings at your home in the evenings say there wasnt much room in our apartment did no one come to visit ever jin shook his head but mina to his surprise spoke up some people from her group did once late at night when was this mina sucked on her lower lip before she was arrested anyway close before yah i think so i dont remember this said jin mina tossed her head you were asleep what woke you asked milessan they were arguing in the kitchen kind of loud and scary plus i had to go to the bathroom can you remember what they were arguing about anything at all that was said mina scrunched her face in thought they were talking about the corps and money they were always talking about the corps and money only this time they seemed more excited georgesans voice was really boomy and mommy was talking all fast and sharp except she didnt sound mad exactly and the new guy yelled something about it wasnt any temprary setbackthis could bring the corps to their knees right before he came out in the hallway on the way to the bathroom and found me and mommy let me have an ice cream bar and put me back to bed and told me to stay there do you know who the people were had you ever seen them before mina nodded there was georgesan he was always nice to me when he came to pick up mommy and old mrs tennoji she always wore a lot of perfume they called the new one leibersensei do you remember the rest of their names jin headshakes milessan tried george suwabi by chance might have been said mina though sounding a bit doubtful the timing is interesting in the extreme and the cast i smell a lethal secret oh yes milessan rose and began to pace back and forth across the little room he forgot his cane left by his chair a snazzier one than hed scavenged from suzesans suwabi and tennoji came up in my researches dr leiber did not i admit curious absence not to be confused with an absence of curious i wonder who the hell he was sounding as if he was being drawn into all this despite himself consul vorlynkin said could you trace these people and find out more not suwabi or tennojitheyre dead and rotted buried for real the other one i dont know could be a long cold trail if hes run offworld or gone to ground well enough to escape the corps it might be faster just to wake up lisa sato and ask her mina drew a huge breath and shot to her feet staring wildly at milessan you could do that you could get my mommy back really milessan stopped short er jins heart jumped in his chest minas imploring look made him feel sick no of course he cant he said angrily it was just a stupid joke milessans hand went to his throat clutching something through his shirt some kind of pendant jin thought damn if i were on barrayar i could just order it done but were not on barrayar armsman roic muttered under his breath almost the first jin had heard the big man speak milessan waved a hand as if to say yah yah though whether in agreement or protest jin was not sure mina looked crushed her lower lip quivered it wasntwasnt a very nice thing to make a joke about it if you didnt really mean it no said milessan staring for some reason at ravensensei it wasnt could i ahreally mean it technically ravensensei scratched his chin technically yes you will forgive me if i point out that the medical aspects would seem to be the least of it milessan waved a hand in easy pardon assuming ravensensei went on the cryoprep was done correctly in the first place of course or at all milessans eyes narrowed and he resumed his pacing mmno reason why it shouldnt have been were not on jacksons whole either i note what all would you need to do the trick technically a decentlyequipped revival facility this isnt something id choose to do out of the consulate basements laundry tub if thats what youre thinking not if there were any complications we couldnt afford complications no emphatically not he glanced at jin and mina ravensensei nodded some standard medical supplies synthesized blood and so on if i secured you a facility could you scrounge the supplies ravensensei got a faraway look legally or otherwise a pause ive no intrinsic objection to legally but it cant leave a data trail back to us otherwise alternate suppliers would do if their merchandise was of proper quality of course that goes without saying how would you propose to gain custody of my patient milessans expression grew equally faraway now thats where it becomes quite interesting lord vorkosigan vorlynkin interrupted what the hell are you thinking jin wasnt sure if he really didnt know or knew and objected strenuously milessan waved that airy hand again any number of threads in my cats cradle of kiboudaini mysteries seem to run back to lisa satoand stop im thinking i might be able to cut the whole knot right through if i had her to interrogate er talk to grant you it seems a little imaginative at first glance but the more i think about it imaginative it seems outright mad milessan cast the consul a soulful look but vorlynkin it would solve all your problems with asylum for minors at a blow their mother being their closest possible adult nextofkin when did those become mynever mind milessan grinned in a glinty way that jin did not entirely understand very good vorlynkin what are you all talking about mina practically wailed milessan lost his glintiness at once and dropped to one knee in front of her swivel chair unpack right um you see mina i was sent here by my government to check out some sneaky nasty things that a kibou cryocorp is trying to do back on one of my home worlds i think your mommy might be able to answer some of my questions or at least give me some interesting new information now it just so happens that dr durona over thereravensensei waved his long fingers kindly at minais a top cryorevival specialist and he already works for me which is what gives me this idea see there are three things that have to be in place before i could undertake to wake up your mommy i have to be sure it would be medically safe for her and i think raven could see to that i have to be able to secure her cryi have to be able to get hold of her get her away from the place where shes now held without kicking up a dust and i think i can do that and afterward i have to be able to protect her from being arrested and taken away again or it will all be for nothing and that will be consul vorlynkins job vorlynkin looked startled at this news but when minas anxious gaze targeted him he returned her a flicker of a smile the first jin had seen lighten his face girls hah nobody handed jin smiles like that when he was scaredhe more usually got some sort of unsympathetic and bracing advice to buck up which reminds me vorlynkin milessan went on over his shoulder in a more clipped tone what are the limits of the political and legal protection this consulate can offer once it becomes known that madame sato has er escaped custody as it were youre not a fullscale embassy vorlynkin said reluctantly by our budget were a branch of the embassy on escobar but were legally more than a consulate because were the only fulltime diplomatic facility barrayar maintains here it would beit could be an ambiguous argument and ambiguous legal arguments burn lots of time ah that might just be good enough milessan rose to pace again mina sank back into her swivel chair her expression caught between hopeful and confused jin realized hed been gripping the arms of his own chair so hard his fingernails were white and slowly released his clutch minas words whirled around and around in his head you could get my mommy back really really really who did this halfsized galactic think he was when hed said he was a delegate to the cryoconference but didnt seem to be a doctor and the others had all called him an auditor jin had vaguely assumed his job had something to do with insurance or maybe less boringly insurance fraud he seemed to know a lot about fraud anyway first things first johannes what vehicles does the consulate maintain johannes jerked as if hed been a watcher of a play unexpectedly addressed by one of the characters uh the official groundcar of course and we have a lift van i have a float bike myself lift van perfect tomorrow then well take jin and raven and go pick up jins creatures and bring them back here to the consulate so thatll be off his mind and my conscience jin looked up caught between thrilled and bewildered didnt these barrayarans mean to let him go on the other hand as long as he had his animals back and didnt have to go back to aunt lorna and school did it matter where he stayed my consulate isnt exactly set up to host a menagerie said vorlynkin no theyll be fine here jin assured him panicked at the thought of being separated yet again from all his pets theres so much room and your back garden is all walled in they wont bother you a bit what kind ofno never mind go on lord vorkosigan at the same time i will take raven to meet suze and company and inspect the facilities we might avoid having to retool the consulate laundry room into a cryo revival facility though he did not sound as if this proposed renovation gave him much pause if like the installation we saw today her old place already has one and its still in good shape not stripped jin said doubtfully if you want any favors from suzesan you better catch her early in the day when shes still sober not a problem milessan said then if everything proves workable we can go on to the next step what is the next step asked consul vorlynkin in fascinated tones he looked like a man staring at a groundcar wreck in slow motion that he was in securing madame sato how im going to have to do a spot more research first to devise the optimum ploy according to the public records shes being kept at the newegypt facility out in the cryopolis here in northbridge which is actually pretty convenient milessans lips drew back on a peculiar grin it could be just like old times armsman roic sat up in alarm he put in with some urgency what about those commodified contracts ron wing was going on about maybe you could work out a way to just i dunno buy her all peaceable and aboveboard he added after a moment or under the table but peaceable anyway milessan paused again in his pacing as if arrested by this notion shrewd idea roic but shes not just any cryopatron i suspect that any interest in her is likely to send up a big red flag he fell into motion again still hold that thought it might be useful later for the retroactive tidying up roic sighed the ideal milessan went on would be to arrange things so that she wasnt missed at all these commercial cryochambers are all continuously monitored said ravensensei youd need some way to fudge the readouts he hesitated or go low tech and just swap in another cryocorpse that way all the readings would be naturally right they wouldnt know the difference unless they pulled it out and unwrapped it milessan tilted his head like gyre the falcon contemplating a choice morsel of meat the old shell game eh thatmight actually be highly feasible i wonder if i could borrow a spare from suze god knows cryocorpses are not an item in short supply around here vorlynkin choked do you have any idea how many different crimes youve just rattled off no but it might not hurt to make up a list should your lawyer need it could speed things up in a pinch i thought the task of an imperial auditor was to uphold the law milessans eyebrows flew up no whatever gave you that idea the task of an imperial auditor is to solve problems for gregor those greasy cryocorps bastards just tried to steal a third of his empire thats a problem despite his smiling lips milessans eyes glittered and jin realized with a start that underneath he was really angry about something im still considering the solution jin wondered who gregor was milessans insurance boss mina had scrunched her chair closer and closer to where jin rocked in his an audible sniffle escaped her which made both milessan and vorlynkin crank their heads around milessan lurched and lifted a hand toward her stopped short and gestured at jin instead who thus compelled gave his sister a clumsy pat on the shoulder that only made her eyes fill up and overflow for real lord vorkosigan for pitys sake enough for tonight said consul vorlynkin these children have to be exhausted both of them jin could wish he hadnt added that last his eyes stung in contagion with minas now he was offered it jin wasnt so sure he wanted sympathyit eroded his resolve as annoying bracing remarks never did to be sure said milessan immediately baths i think and we can give them both roics room he can bunk in with me i expect some clean tshirts would do for nightclothes toothbrushes milessan and vorlynkin arguing jin discovered were not nearly so daunting as the pair of them united in sudden agreement the ordinary business of bedtime blocked further tears jin expected mina found the consulate house stranger than he did hed slept in parks after all and in all sorts of odd crannies at suzesans vorlynkin even donated a fancy sonic toothbrush though jin and mina had then to share it with a trip through its sterilizing holder between customers at last they were tucked up in clean sheets in a warm quiet room jin waited for the door to softly shut and the grownups feet to clump away back downstairs before wriggling up and switching on the bedside lamp mina threw back her covers and helped him extract lady murasakis box from her backpack she watched closely as jin opened the lid to give their pet a breath of fresh air and helped by tossing in one of the little powdery beige moths theyd collected earlier while jins fingers blocked the prisoner from escaping he set the plastic box back on the table between their beds is she going to eat it mina asked peering through the lid im not sure she might only go for live prey mina frowned thoughtfully they have that big garden out back i bet we could catch more bugs tomorrow a reassuring notion jin lay back down and pulled up his sheets and mina reached to turn out the lamp again before any betraying line of light showed under the bedroom door after a while minas whisper came out of the dark do you really think your galactic can get mommy back no one else ever could had anyone else even tried jin didnt know milessan all dapper and alert and concentrated and never sitting still was proving an alarming acquaintance jin wasnt sure but what hed liked the grubby lost druggie better jin had a disconcerting feeling of having set a force in motion that he could not now stop which wasnt made better by not even knowing whether he wanted to i dont know mina he said at last be quiet and go to sleep he rolled over and hid from it all under his covers roic followed consul vorlynkin into the tightroom where mlord was already deeply involved with the comconsole johannes at his side raven leaning over and kibitzing they all seemed to be examining some engineering schematics for the newegypt facility pulled up from god knew where roic was relieved mlord had finally decided to involve johannes if only by necessity backup at last inexperienced but not untrained and judging from his wide eyes it looked as if he was getting a tutorial in covert ops that would have done his impsec instructors proud mlord wheeled in his station chair to take in the new arrivals ah vorlynkin good your clerk matsonhell be back to work in the morning right yes i dont think we can keep those kids quiet enough to hide them from him in a house this small hell have to be told they are protected witnesses in some danger that should be enough to settle him is it true said vorlynkin how did someone so reluctant to tell lies become a diplomat by the way i cant believe with all your training that you failed to admire miss satos blisters what is it about this universal female conviction that medical conditions make one interesting judging from my daughter helen it starts younger than i would have believed possible about the danger said vorlynkin winning roics admiration by refusing to be drawn into mlords flight of fancy judging from the brightness of his eyes mlord was as overstimulated right now as his own kids after one of his bedtime stories right enough is it real because its unconscionable to keep those children from their guardians otherwise mlord sobered perhaps this is an investigation which means that not all leads pan out or otherwise one wouldnt need to investigate but i shouldnt think lisa sato would have been removed in that brutal and effective way for any trivial reason which means waking her up could actually increase their hazard he tapped his lips considering this i suspect jin misjudges his aunt and uncle actually they may not merely lack the resources to fight the good fight for their kinswoman they may be seriously intimidated hm said vorlynkin roics own conviction was that as soon as that poor frozen woman had intersected mlords orbit this chain of events had become inevitable worse than dangling a string in front of a cat it was he likely shouldnt explain this to vorlynkin an armsman was supposed to be loyal in thought word and deed but not blind but if jin and mina were your children would you want some offworlder as good as kidnapping them to use for his own purposes vorlynkin persisted no matter how wellintentioned in my defense i must point out they turned up here on their own butif i were dead my widow frozen my children fallen into the hands of people either unwilling or incapable of helping them i doubt i would care where the man came from who could reunite them with ekaterin id shower all my posthumous blessings upon him mlord wheeled around and drummed his fingers on the comconsole counter poor jin he makes me think about my missing grandmother actually missing grandmother said raven leaning back against the counter i didnt know you had any most people have twonot you of course my betan grandmother is alive and well and opinionated to this day in fact if you ever meet her youll understand a whole lot more about my mother no its a barrayaran tale the fate of princessandcountess olivia vorbarra vorkosigan then delightfully bloody i daresay ravens sweeping hand gesture invited mlord to go on not that he needed any encouragement johannes too was listening in apparent fascination very if youd learned your barrayaran history not that you would be expected to youd know that once upon a timeall the best stories start that way you realizethat once upon a time the death squads of mad emperor yuri attempted to erase most of my family thereby triggering the civil war that ended eventually in yuris dismemberment so many people wanted a piece of him by then they were forced to share ysee the death squad shot my grandmother in front of my father messily he was eleven at the time which is part of why jin keeps reminding me of it but you seefor all the horrors of that day and of the war that followed it nobody im not sure how to put this nobody denied my father his experience jins mother was just as abruptly and unjustly taken from him but hes not been permitted his grief no funeral no mourning no protest even no revengecertainly not whatever satisfaction there might be of knowing she was escorted down into death by a procession of her enemies for jin and mina theres justsilence frozen silence a rather frozen silence followed this among the barrayarans in the room vorlynkin cleared his throat leaned on his hand stared into the comconsole so lord auditor and umjust how are we planning to give this woman her voice back chapter ten dont land on the chickens jin said leaning anxiously over the back of the seat between johannes who was flying the lift van and miles occupying the passenger side johannes grimaced and eased the lift van forward under the canopy of jins rooftop refuge then paused again while jin leaped out to pull the cafe table out of the way glance underneath the van look relieved and motion johannes forward as johannes gingerly set them down atop the roof a woman at the back of the tentroom stood handsonhips watching them in suspicion though she smiled briefly as jin danced up to her the whine of the vans engines went silent ah ako good shes been faithful said miles and slid open his door the rest of you wait here till i signal he added over his shoulder we dont want to stampede the poor woman or look like a clown car he did not add aloud johannes and raven nodded silently roics disapproving frown at miles seizing pointman position might as well have been audible ako was evidently attempting to feed gyre she wore heavy oven mitts and brandished a long fork with a fragment of raw meat fluttering from it as she gestured to jin the bird stretched forward and snatched the slithery morsel twisting its head and gulping it down ako jumped he bites you know she said to jin almost apologetically not very hard said jin i needed antibiotic salve and plastic bandages the first time thank you very much ill allow the bird didnt actually take off a finger she put her hands on her hips again and stared hard at miles so youre back you gave me quite a turn sneaking up in that van miles hoped their sneaking had been successful though not hidden from more sophisticated scanners at least the tent roof concealed their activities from casual observation in this level morning light discreet if not secret i was beginning to think you werent coming back and was wondering what to do with all these animals but you found jin after all she had nearly decided miles read in her eyes that hed dodged off without any intention of finding jin we were both unavoidably delayed miles said jin actually found me but in any case were reunited thank you so much for looking after his creatures they mean the world to him she sniffed not displeased with some recognition of her efforts i know jin returned from taking a rapid inventory of his menagerie including counting his chickens milessan is going to take me and all my creatures away to to his place for a while he told ako her brows tightened yah yes and i need to speak to madame suze about that miles said ako looked marginally appeased at this indication of aboveboardness tenbury told me you are something of an apprentice to the plant medtech miles would be meeting her again soon if things went as he hoped best to placate her ako went wary i help her clean and things in the infirmary just so miles motioned to the van the rest of his entourage piled out miles was relieved of the problem of introductions by jin taking them over possibly more reassuringly than miles could have this is ravensensei hes a friend from escobar this is roicsan he works for milessan this is lieutenant johannes hes all right ako bent and whispered jin theyre not policemen are they you should know better naw theyre barrayarans galactics ako bit her lip but seemed to accept this provisional guarantee she watched as they sorted themselves out johannes and roic to stay with the van till jin got back to supervise loading it raven and jin to accompany miles i should come with you roic muttered to miless ear these people are justifiably nervous of outsiders i wont get what i want if we hit them en masse and youre en masse all by yourself miles tapped his wristcom ill call you if i need you roic returned him the sigh familiar shorthand for the usual argument miles let jin lead him and raven off down the exchanger tower ako trailed as far as the kitchen where miles prudently detoured to grab a carafe of coffee and some cups she stared after them as they trod away toward the stairs to suzes suite as they waited for an answer to miless knock he turned his head and said to jin i had better pitch this to her in my own way ill let you know when you can chime in jin shifting from foot to foot gulped and nodded a slow shuffle from within heralded the door opening a crack suzes bleary eye peered out you again she said i thought we were well rid of you she squinted at jin of both of you the eye traveled on to raven who the hell are you raven durona from escobar raven answered readily pleased to meet you hes a friend miles said as in pass friend he brandished the carafe may we come in eh reluctantly but with her one open eye on the carafe suze gave way she wore the same loose black garments as before she probably slept in them her inner chamber had the same close geriatric smell she went to her window and set the polarization to admit a grudging shade more morning and waved miles and his carafe cups and followers to her battered seats you found your wallet i see she said settling across from them at miless gesture jin hastened to distribute coffee yes and my luggage and my friends im back in business and just what is your business thank you jin im an investigator of a sort suzes cup halted on its way to her lips her seamed face set in stiff panic not for any authority on kibou however miles added insurance fraud jin put in in hasty reassurance hes not a policeman or a doctor or a lawyer even though he went to that conference ravensenseis the doctor miless eyebrows went up at this description of himself clearly at some point he was going to have to take the boy aside and explain imperial auditor to him in greater detail but perhaps this would do for now not precisely but close enough as it happens the powersthatbe on kibou are the subject of my inquiries not its sponsors i have no interest whatsoever in shutting down your operation id actually like to make use of your facilities i may be able to make it worth your time suzes eyes narrowed over her coffee cup she finally drank we get by here because we dont draw anyones attention i dont wish to draw attention either suze sat back leathery lips pursing you want someone illegally frozen hoping you can bribe me into storing the body for you her tone was remarkably neutral neither leading nor guiding her suggestion came up far too readilyye gods had suze ever provided such services perhaps for the local underworld did kiboudaini have an underworld aside from the literal one hed been lost in that is could this be the source of some of her protection because crime lords would want to cheat death too though youd think they could afford their own private arrangementsstill they would need benefits to distribute to lesser followers and for the discreet disposal of enemies those ranks of anonymous drawers downstairs would certainly trump lead weights and a swim in the nearest river it would even render murder reversible if one had been too hasty in ones crimelordly commands or otherwise made a mistake man if i wanted to hide a body on kibou miles wrenched his mind from this fascinating sidepath have you done such favors before he asked cautiously suze shrugged her alarm giving way to dry amusement in the face of his consternation if i had would i tell you i have no need to know miles assured her want to know yes but then he wanted to know everything my need is quite the reverse we wish to do a private cryorevival which requires proper facilities and discretion you may be able to lend us both this took her aback her jaw worked and she covered her confusion with another swallow of coffee then grimaced jin fetch my medicine out of the cupboard she commanded jin leapt up rummaged for the square bottle and brought it to her at her gesture he also uncapped and pouredscantly both miles and he thought suze noted but she didnt complain as the boy settled once more cryorevival how dr durona here is a noted cryorevival specialist if your facilities meet his specs wed like to as it were rent them a long pause how much suze said at last i thought id offer you something your money cant buy in exchange for letting us revive our um patronand for the discretion of courseraven will throw in a topclass revival for any other candidate of your choice suzes jaw unhinged she sank back in her chair and after a moment breathed you devil money would have worked miles thought but some things worked better suze jerked her head toward raven just how good is he for answer miles unbuttoned his gray tunic and white shirt thishis hand traced the spider web of pale scarswas a needlegrenade very well aimed at close range ten years ago raven did my revival assisted at strictly speaking but raven had acquired a decades more experience and seniority since then i guarantee as a medical challenge nothing that you have downstairs can compare suze looked away as he buttoned up again old age she said is slower than a grenade but a lot more thorough this is unfortunately true said raven though i may have a few aids for that as well what i would suggest is that madame suze here draw up a list of half a dozen or so candidates and let me triage them for the maximum chance of medical success this should produce the most satisfactory result all round mm she said her hand crept up and rubbed her chest over her heart hm jin unable to contain himself any longer burst out please suzesan let them the caterpillar eyebrows climbed whats it to you boy jin pressed his lips together and looked imploringly at miles are you sure you want to know miles inquired suze was shrewd enough to hesitate a long moment before her curiosity overcame her better judgment yah miles opened his hand to jin who cried milessan promised to get my mother back suzes face pinched in horror oh and you think you arent going to draw attention mister galactic investigator lisa sato was all about attention we may draw some eventually but not to you miles said smoothly as soon as her recovery permits well remove her to the barrayaran consulate and reunite her with both her children no link to this place you think so those that froze her will sure enough want to find out who unfroze her which will drop them right back in my lap which isnt big enough to hold them i promise you yes but the first thing theyll run into is me i plan miles hesitated he didnt exactly have a plan yet more of a stab in the dark he still wasnt sure what his blade would connect with what demanded suze i plan to give them other worries he glanced at raven much depends on madame sato both on what she has to say and how soon she can say it i had rather severe cryoamnesia myself which lingered uncomfortably i remember that said raven uncomfortable it may have been but it didnt really last that long we were just pressed for time back then madame satowell i cant give any guarantees at this point miles nodded understanding both of what was said and what was unsaid and turned again to suze i need one more favor id like to borrow a cryocorpse what suze began in a towering tone which weakened to kind female about fifty kilos as young as you have available anything else raven raven shook his head that should do it we undertake not to damage her in any way that would compromise her future revival miles went on hoping he didnt sound too airy that a guarantee galactic it wont be wholly under my control but if things go my way she should be all right i hope in any covert operation peopletake their chances raven wincedah maybe not the best parallel to draw after the chest display when soon possibly tonight no later than tomorrow night suzes nostrils flared in a long indrawn breath of doubt miles held up a pair of fingers two cryorevivals of your choice suze turned her head and made a throwingaway gesture go see the plant medtech vristi tanaka jin will show you the way if you can talk her into going along with all this nonsense though i suppose you will talk talk talk makes me tired miles rose quickly so as not to outwear his welcome or her decision thank you madame suze i promise you you wont regret this was too big a diplomacy to push past even his teeth it will be interesting he finished suzes snort sent them on their way the infirmary turned out to be on the second floor of the facilitys old patron intake building jin led miles and raven through double doors to a corridor with some two or three rooms apparently furbished up for action judging from the fresh medical smell they found tenbury lingering outside of one of them leaning against the wall with his arms crossed a narrow float pallet grounded at his feet jin he said looking pleased they said youd got lost he looked somewhat less pleased at miles you again his brow wrinkled at raven we came to see tanakasan jin explained its important shes busy right nowtenbury jerked a thumb at the room beyondbut they should be done soon raven craned his neck to peer through a narrow glass window in the door ah cryoprep in progress id like to see that ravensenseis a doctor from escobar jin began tenbury looked perturbed and began to speak miles cut the debate short by simply knocking the knock was answered by a frowning woman brown skin like old leather spare of build and with straight white hair where suze was stout and frizzy but of a like age miles judged and without the alcohol fumes her face lightened when she saw jin ah youre found jin and who have your creatures savaged now and can it wait no one tanakasan but its kind of urgent suzesan sent us over miles let jin run through his introductions at which the boy was becoming nicely practiced he picked up weve made arrangements with madame suze to use your facilities for a private cryorevival if they meet dr duronas needs may we come in huh she said and gave way staring at raven miles wondered if hed rumpled ravens clothes mussed his neat hair and doused him with gin if he would have seemed less out of place here less alarming to these people too late on a table standing out from the far wall lay the naked body of a frail old man detained miles thought at the border crossing between life and death a sheet draped across his middle lent him a scrap of dignity as much as one could have when given over to plastic tubes and the will or whim of others a coldblanket wrapped around his skull sped the chilling of his brain a tube from a tank above divided partway down ran a clear liquid into both carotid arteries a wider tube from a vein in his thigh ran a dark pink color to a kneeheight tub with a drain with a trickle of water from a spout above to keep things flowing judging from the paleness of the skin and nails and the color of the murky exit fluid the old body was almost wholly perfused with cryosolution ako hovered closely supervising the process shed evidently overheard something through the doorway because she looked up and said excitedly a doctor were getting a real doctor miles waved down this hope before it could grow big and bite just visiting well explain it all when youre finished here jin was staring miles wondered how disturbing this process was to the boy or if hed seen it before it was disturbing to miles and hed done it before or had it done to him maybe the more unsettling for that for the first time he wondered how much the news of his own encounter with the needlegrenade had felt like history repeats to his father if it had triggered unwelcome old memories of the princessandcountess olivias messy death i must apologize to him for that when next we meet it almost seems too simple miles murmured to raven raven said the complexity lies in the cryopreservation fluid which has a whole pharmaceutical facility behind it or so one trusts where are you getting your cryofluid madame tanaka the medtechs old mouth set in a flat smile the concentrate falls off the back of a few loading docks of hospitals here in town they discard their outdated supplies a couple of times a year we distill our own water to reconstitute it miless brows rose is that umall right medically raven shrugged if the useby dating is fairly conservative yes it was not miles supposed a choice between discarded fluid and fresh but between discarded and none he was reminded again that this place was a parasite operation clinging to the underbelly of a more functional economy without which it could not continue to exist granted if its host economy functioned rather better it wouldnt need to exist medical sensors blinked timing lights ako withdrew the tubes and sealed the entry and exit incisions with plastic bandage and carefully lathered the skin with ointment she and medtech tanaka horsed the body into a sort of plastic bodyglove then joined forces with tenbury to shift it all onto the float pallet where tenbury covered it more corpselike with a sheet he guided the pallet out the door want to help me jin tenbury asked hopefully over his shoulder jin planting his feet doggedly shook his head tenbury sighed and trundled his burden away ako turned to the cleanup process raven leaned against a counter and miles found a stool to perch upon while the medtech folded her arms and listened dubiously miles embarked on much the same pitch as hed presented to madame suze heavy on the implication that suze had sent them over here with her full blessing since tanaka seemed susceptible to the boy miles also unleashed jin for a judicious blast of heartfelt imploring as a result her frown at the end seemed more technical than political we havent had most of that section open for years a lot of the equipment that wasnt stripped out when the place was decommissioned went later palmed and pawned or sold miles presumed but i do maintainhuh i think well have to go up and take a look around not a flat no impossible then good so far thats what raven is here for miles assured her suze saidis that her first name or her last by the way both said the medtech susan suzuki have you been working with her for long since the beginning there were three of us put the scheme togethersuze her sister who was assistant to the comptroller and me we roped in tenbury pretty quick though a younger man then was he you were critical for the cryoprep obviously did you have any plans for the other end of things the revivals she blew out her lips in a short laugh at the time i didnt think wed go more than a year before we all ended up in jail i figured it for more of a hopeless protest than anything then the street people started coming in even more desperate than we were and we found we couldnt quit couldnt betray them as everyone else had the world is made by the people who show up for the job miles agreed medtech tanaka eyed ako who had finished cleaning up and drifted over to listen in thats a true thing ako and her greataunt used to run a cookshop the usualthe old woman grew ill the medical bills bankrupted them the shop failed they were evictedcame in to us akod never finished school but she knew how to clean and wasnt afraid of work so i took her on earnest but timid ako miles guessed would never have gained entry to let alone graduated from any medtech academy this place gave a whole new dimension to the term unlicensed shouldnt we take ravensensei upstairs now jin urged they mounted one floor to the corridor directly above which had apparently once been a fullyequipped cryorevival facility with half a dozen operating theaters a recovery room and some intensive care booths most of it was dark and dusty and indeed sadly stripped but medtech tanaka apparently maintained one operating room for procedures more demanding than what antibiotic ointment surgical glue and bracing advice would cover she and raven fell into intense but by no means discouraged techspeak medical division which ended with sending jin downstairs to bring back tenbury for more consultation who is the ownerofrecord for this place miles asked the medtech while they were waiting if it was legally abandoned id have thought the city would have seized it for back taxes by now there have been a couple of supposed owners over the years the city wont seize it for the same reason the current owner poor slob cant unload it legal liability for two or three thousand destitute cryocorpses he was a contractor who bought it for what he thought was a song and only then discovered what came with it suze has him under control for now we think the biggest current danger is that hell try to solve his dilemma through a spot of arson but we keep a watch it doesnt sound like a very stable situation never has been we just try to go from day to day surprising where you can end up that way raven miles noticed was listening intently to all this not in the least appalled well jacksoniantrained after all the hippocratic oath if hed ever heard of it was likely only considered a guideline there tenbury came back and there followed a lot more techspeak then visits to other chambers with some alarming thumping and crashing miles sent the fretful jin back to his roof to supervise the loadingup of his menagerie when the noises of inventory at last died away raven returned well said miles go or nogo go said raven there will have to be some prep but i find these people are good at improvising and the physical impediments are made up for by a delightful lack of paperwork how soon will you be ready for me to make my snatch ill probably want you along on the insertion by the way in case we run into any snags that are medical rather than securityrelated how do you feel about risking arrest by the way raven shrugged im sure your brother will extract me if you cant in any case you can make your switch any time madame sato can just as well wait here till were ready my time is not infinitely elastic besides his wanting to go home of course there was no telling what can of worms would be emptied onto his plate with the revival of jins mother miles was getting itchy to know you can take that kid back to the consulate i expect ill be working late here raven went on i can get back to my hotel by public transport miles pointed to ravens consulateissued wristcom check in first secured channel ill want a report and it may be better to send johannes to pick you up actually raven hesitated i think i will want to stop back at the consulate anyway can i use your secured tightbeam links to report in to my boss on escobar lily or mark both though im not just sure where lord mark is right now do you know miles shook his head his enterprises have become rather farflung i dont track him daily are you arranging bail in advance well thats a thought but mainly because i may have found some elements of interest to the durona group here if they impinge on my investigation i want to be fully apprised or even if they dont understood miles waved him back to work and made his way back down through the basement maze and up to jins rooftop as they unloaded the van consul vorlynkin came out to see what all they were dumping in his back garden mina danced ahead of him and pounced on lucky with an excited cry rubbing her face in the soft fur lucky i thought you were dead the old gray cat endured the hug but wriggled free promptly do you still have your ratties jin yes said jin lifting the cage he was lugging to show them off jinnie and most of her children handsome said vorlynkin inspecting gyre chained to his perch from a prudent distance how do you keep it from eating your chickens galli and twig released from their transport box by lieutenant johannes ran past his knees flapping their wings and squawking then slowed to stare in apparent amazement at the grass patch before them warm and greensmelling in the noon sun well the big ones sort of defend themselves i had to keep gyre chained to his perch when the chicks were littler ill have to keep him chained here anyway till he figures out this is where he belongs jin watched as armsman roic with due care unloaded a stack of terrariums onto the shelf theyd brought from jins refuge tucked up against the back of the house and sheltered by its eaves concealed by the house the tall stone garden walls and all the trees and bushes the shelf and its contents would be almost as safe as in his tentshelter at suzesans cats and mice together as well vorkynkin went on what next lions and lambs rats jin corrected austerely though i wish i might have a lion anyway luckys too old and lazy to bother the big ones and i keep the little ones in cages with tops he looked around with satisfaction now that i have all my creatures back you can keep lady murasaki he told mina generously she made a face but luckys half mine because she wasnt yours to start with you know even if you did steal her away i saved her from aunt lorna jin reminded her lucky curled around vorlynkins ankles rubbing her chin to scentmark him as her new property and leaving a trail of hairs plastered to his formerlytidy hakama trousers he bent rather absently to scritch her spine and she arched shamelessly under his hand mina addressed him anxiously oh sir can we keep lucky inside till she knows this is home cats do get lost you know looking down into minas upturned face vorlynkin said reluctantly is she housebroken mina nodded vigorously i can fix her cat pan in my room the washroom off the kitchen would likely do as well he told her you and jinwell yes i expect it will be good for you and your brother to look after her milessan strolled past all shipshape here jin then i need johannes back he added to consul vorlynkin well be in your tightroom for a time a lot of detailwork still to do at his gesture roic rose and took up what seemed his accustomed place at his shoulder is your scheme going to fly then vorlynkin asked milessan nodded vorlynkin grimaced milessan returned a wry smile flexibility vorlynkin thats the key he trod indoors swinging his cane jin and vorlynkin stared after him vorlynkin voiced jins own halfformed thought was that supposed to be reassuring chapter eleven roic figured midnight would have been the right time for a bodysnatching expedition possibly in the middle of a thunderstorm among other things an electrical storm might help account for any powerflicker anomalies they left in their wake but there were no suitable cold fronts predicted any time soon and so roic found himself raven and mlord with johannes driving the lift van again turning in at the impressive entrance of the newegypt facility at high noon it was only in roics imagination that the dogheaded statues flanking the main gate seemed to follow them with their painted eyes johannes was armed with a couple of little floral arrangements in water tubes and a script but he wasnt called upon to deploy either the human gate guard waved them right through what t hell said roic its visiting hours said mlord mildly they arent going to harass their patrons kin nor their potential future customers coming in for their tour at this time of day this isnt a military installation all newegypt security has to worry about is theftwhich is more likely to come from an employeevandalism which isnt likely to occur in broad daylight and maybe something like the nhllwho would probably wait for that midnight thunderstorm you wanted seems like their style somehow roic settled back with a disgruntled huh he shifted uncomfortably in his somewhattootight hospital uniform xl scavenged by raven and medtech tanaka possibly from the same source as some of their medical supplies now laid in and waiting back at madame suzes mlord wore a similar set xs a bit too loose with the sleeve and trouser ends rolled up ravens set fit perfectly johannes was dressed in what roic had been assured were unexceptionable kibou street clothes tidy and middleclass the van slipped past both the pyramidtopped buildings lobby fronted by an inviting fauxegyptian garden with stone sphinxes and the sign pointing to the loading docks for prefrozen patron intake hidden on the more utilitarian backside then on around to a discreet side entrance meant for employees all right this is where we unload mlord said dont look hurried but dont waste time trying not to look hurried not to mention harried roic helped raven open the back of the lift van and slide out the float pallet a stack of boxes emptied of their medical supplies concealed the long shape in what roic thought of as the freezer bag beneath the body bag designed for shortterm transport would if left sealed keep its contents at cryotemperature for a couple of days raven had explained to him roic had to grant it was a hell of a lot less bulky and eyecatching than a portable cryochamber johannes drove off to find the visitor parking and wait and mlord led the pallet and its handlers inside through automatic doors that parted for them without protest mlord checked the holomap on his wristcom and led off through a succession of corridors they encountered a trio of gossiping employees and an elderly couple clearly visitors on their way to the cafeteria that roic smelled in passing but none spared the pallet a glance roic carefully did not look back two more turns and a short ride down a freight lift tube and they were pacing along an underground corridor that stopped at a double door the first locked barrier theyd encountered mlord opened one of the boxes whipped out his special tool kit impsec standard issue with upgrades and knelt to the electronic lock he muttered unreassuringly god its been a while hope i havent lost my touch he puttered for a minute or two while roic jittered and kept glancing over his shoulder and raven looked bland the doors parted so soundlessly roic was taken by surprise mlord looked smug ah good id hoped not to leave any evidence by damaging the lock he waved them through like some demented maitre dhotel escorting diners to the best table in the room and closed the doors gently again when the pallet had passed through the new corridor was much darker and roic was surprised to see unfinished which made him worry about encountering workmen but he supposed a construction crew would have lights that would warn them beneath the pyramidal building lay three sublevels around the core stack of utilities on each level four concentric corridors extended outward in squares with radial connecting halls at the midpoint of each side too regular to be called a maze it nonetheless seemed to roic that it would be easy to get turned around down here so just how disturbing it had been to mlord to be lost for hours in a true maze with no light they turned in at the next connecting spoke mlords lips moved as he counted off side branches then set in a smile as the core stack hove into view another pause while mlord weaseled his way into a locked electrical access panel did some careful counting and nodded they then went out another spoke and turned right into one of the corridors this one completed dimly lit with utility lighting and lined with loaded cryodrawers this doesnt look so fancy roic murmured these are the cheap seats said mlord if you want to be filed away behind faux mahogany and brass fittingsor gold im toldnewegypt can supply on the upper levels even down here a lot of the drawers had small holders set in the walls beside them for odd little personal offerings including tiny bottles of wine wrapped snacks or burneddown stubs of incense sticks most common were flowers mostly plastic or silk but sometimes real onessome fresh some brown and drooping sadly from their driedout water tubes here said mlord stopping abruptly he craned his neck at a drawer at the top of the stack read off the number raven raven recited a long alphanumeric string twice mlord checked carefully against the data on his wristcom this is it the disguising boxes then found another use as mlord filched one to boost him to a convenient height to examine the drawer lock and attach his impsecspecial door opener to it all right he murmured climbing back down when the lights go out make the switch he unshipped his own hand light and trotted off raven issued roic a pair of insulated medical gloves donned a pair himself and bent to unseal the long bag the figure revealed seemed a slender little old woman clad in a sort of plastic caul that clung to her shape what with the translucent protective ointment heavily slathered on her skin and the frost that instantly began to form on the exposed plastic surface her helpless nakedness had at least a decent veiling roic turned on his own hand light an instant before the corridor lights and all the little green lights on the drawers went black there having proved no way to open a single drawer without setting off some indicator in the central control room the next best thing had seemed to give the same flicker to five thousand or so drawers at once ready said raven roic tapped the button on the unlocking device to his relief the drawer lock opened easily he slid the long drawer out like opening some dreadful filing cabinet inside was another female figure also in its caul which also frosted swiftly roic frowned to see that the plastic wrappings werent quite identicalthese seemed to be browner and reinforced with some sort of netting but bracing himself he slid his hands under and lifted her out even with the gloves she seemed to suck the warmth from him in a swift tide he set her gently on the floor raven checked the name tag attached to the outside of the wrappings and he and raven between them lifted her replacement into the drawer the drawer slid shut with a smooth click mlords hand light flickered at the corridor corner and he peered around roic waved allswell and he nodded and ducked away again by the time roic and raven inserted their prize into the bag and sealed it up again the lights flashed back on roic reached up and carefully unsealed the unlocking device and hid it back in mlords kit he then began restacking concealing boxes wondering how soon a tech crew would arrive to check out their brief power failure mlord returned and murmured go go his eyes seemed as bright as any of the indicator lights and roic realized how much he was enjoying this caper im glad one of us is raven seemed as amiable as ever as if he indulged in this sort of chicanery every day which roic knew very well he did not roic swallowed and prepared to sprint as the hum of lift tube doors and the echo of voices drifted up the hall that radiated from the central stack but they turned onto the outer ring before any shouts of hey you there could find them a short stroll and they were back at the underground double doors mlord paused to lock them again and call johannes on his wristcom the lieutenant was opening the rear of the lift van as they arrived outside the palletload of supplies disappeared soundlessly within roic still didnt breathe easily till the van turned out the gates and joined the flow of afternoon traffic mlord checked his wristcom sixteen minutes he said in a satisfied tone raven had taken the front seat again with johannes which made all kinds of sense since the pair of them were by far the most normallooking by local standards johannes drove sedately but not too sedately just as instructed with the back seats folded down to make a cargo space roic crouched opposite madame satos body bag from mlord alert to reach out and prevent it shifting should johannes make any sudden turns roic had been assured that the cryosolution and protective ointments kept cryocorpses slightly pliable not brittle and that despite their temperature they wouldnt shatter like an ice cube thrown to the pavement at an accidental blow but still they rode in silence for a few minutes which roic broke at last lowvoiced all this makes me think about sergeant taura all these other folks got to die in some hope for their future why not her we were all right there at the durona clinic everything was in place for it it wouldnt have cost much taura was one of the mercs from mlords old impsec covert ops days before the needlegrenade and cryorevival damage had put him out of that business for good like raven and the rest of the durona cloned siblings she was a product of jacksonian genetic engineering unlike them she was a sole survivor in her case of a failed prototype batch of supposed supersoldiers she had escaped to mlords merc troop where the supersoldier part had actually worked mlord testified but her creators had built in a failsafe mechanism for their genetic prototypes taura would have been dead of old age at twentystandard without the medical intervention that the dendarii medics and later the duronas had supplied her roic had met her twice desperately memorably the first time when shed attended mlords wedding the second when mlord and roic had traveled to escobar to attend her last days in the durona hospice mlord sighed i you rowan and raven all tried to talk her into it if her dendarii insurance hadnt covered it id have popped for it out of pocket not that the duronas would have let me they still figure they owed her and all the dendarii mercs involved for their escape from jacksons whole but taura wasnt having it at any price what wake up still a freak in some strange place and time with all my friends gone taura had said to the protesting roic in that terriblywrongforher thready voice but you could make new friends was an argument that had failed to move her in the exhaustion of her failing metabolism roic made a helpless gesture you could have overridden her after she was too far gone to tell ordered her cryoprepped god knew mlord was capable of riding over any number of other peoples wills mlord shrugged face sobered in the shared memory that would have been for our benefit then not for hers but taura chose fire over ice that at least i had no trouble understanding high temperature cremation leaves no dna shed been indifferent to where her ashes would be scattered except not jacksons whole so mlord had provided a burial plot for her urn in his own family cemetery at vorkosigan surleau overlooking the long lake a task mlord and roic had seen to personally nobody muttered roic should die of old age at thirtystandard certainly not such a blazing spirit as tauras had been mlord looked meditative if the duronas or anybody elses antiaging research ever succeeds i wonder if death at three hundred or five hundred will come to seem as outrageous or two thousand said roic trying to imagine it some few betans and cetagandans actually made it to almost two centuries roic had heard but their healths had been genetically guaranteed before conception for random folks alive and afoot already not a help not two thousand probably said mlord some actuariallyminded wag once calculated that if all the medical causes of death were removed the average person would still only make it to about eight hundredstandard before encountering some fatal accident i suppose that means that some would slab themselves at eighteen and some at eighteen hundred but it would still be the same game in the end just set to a new equilibrium makes you wonder about the refusers indeed if the god they posit waited billions of years for them to be born a few hundred extra years till they die should hardly make a difference to him mlord stared off into some sort of twisty mlord mindspace all the worry people expend over not existing after they die yet nary a one ever seems to spare a moment to worry about not having existed before they were conceived or at all after all one sperm over and we would have been our sisters and wed never have been missed since there didnt seem an answer to this that didnt make roics head hurt trying to think about he kept silent they turned in past the sagging chain link gates of madame suzes facility at last it took many hours to bring lisa satos core temperature up from deepcryonic to just below freezing miles sent johannes back to the consulate and as the night wore on took turnabout with roic napping in a makeshift bunk in a room opposite ravens cobbledtogether revival lab set up on the third floor of the old patron intake building raven and medtech tanaka too took the night watch in shifts dawn of the new day brought the start of the critical procedures the flushing of the old cryofluid the swift replacement with what to miles seemed vats of new synthetic blood the skin of the supine figure on the procedure table went from clay gray to an encouraging warm ivory with the transfusion the cryofluid gurgled away down the drain if theyd had the time and equipment not to mention a startersample from the patient whole blood identical to the originals could have been grown the synthetic blood lacked the unique white cells the patients own body produced so the revived person would have to be in isolation for an indeterminate time following till her own marrow began to refill the immunity gaps miles had been kept asleep through that phase raven told him but then hed had a lot more trauma surgical and otherwise to heal from ako had spent all last evening cleaning and readying the isolation booth raven was maddeningly vague about how soon his patient might be questioned and made it clear that her children had priority as her first visitors miles didnt argue with that he couldnt think of anything better to motivate the woman to fight her way to her full faculties miles was anxious to offer help but as they approached the point of no return in the procedures raven sat him down at a distance on a stool with a face mask across his mouth the memorystick around the edges molded to his skin in a flexible but efficient seal and the electropores even filtered viruses still miles wasnt entirely sure if it was only to block germs so he bit his tongue rather than shrieking when raven muttered damn itthats not right whats not right miles asked as raven and the medtech busied themselves about the table and didnt answer theres no electrical latency in the brain raven said just before miles started to repeat his question louder it should be coming up by now tanaka lets try a good oldfashioned shot of shock here lisa satos head bore something resembling a swimming cap studded with electronics and sensors tight to the dark hair plastered flat with cryogel raven did something to his control screen and the cap made a snapping noise that made miles jump and almost topple off his stool raven scowled at his readouts his gloved hand went out almost unconsciously it seemed to miles to massage his patients limp hand close that drain raven said abruptly and inexplicably and the medtech hurried to comply he stepped back a pace this isnt working the bottom fell out of miless stomach in a sickening lurch raven you cant stop my god we cant afford to botch this one those poor kids are waiting for us to deliver their mother back to them i promised miles ive done over seven thousand revivals i dont need to spend the next half hour jumping on this poor womans corpse to know shes gone her brain is slush on a microlevel raven sighed and turned away from the table peeling down his mask and drawing off his gloves i know a bad prep when i see one and that was a bad prep this wasnt my fault there was nothing i could do there was nothing i could ever have done raven was far too controlled a man to throw his gloves across the room and swear but he hardly needed to miles could read his emotions in his set face the more fierce for the sharp contrast with his usual easygoing cheer murdereddo you think things can go wrong without someone intending them you know in fact thats the statistical norm though not around you i suppose but not i think in this case ravens lips flattened yeah i can do an autopsy in a bit here when he had recovered his tone of mind presumably find out exactly what kind of bad prep this was there are a number of choices i thought there was something odd about the viscosity of that return fluid he paused let me rephrase that i bloody insist on the autopsy i want to know exactly how i was set up for this failure because i dont like being set up like this amen growled miles he slipped off his chair jerked down his mask and approached the table with its mute burden the blood pump was still keeping the skin hopefully flushed deceptive promise absently raven reached out and switched it off the silence hurt how was he going to explain this to jin and mina because miles knew that would have to be his next task in his rush and his arrogance he had taken away their hopeno hed only taken away their false hope this ending was apparently inevitable however and whenever it was arrived at now or later by his hand or anothers the reflection didnt console him much i will get you justiceno he wasnt in a position to make any such pledges to them and i will try sounded too weak mere preamble to another adult putoff but guilt fueled his rage against histheirunknown enemy as nothing else could how odd how suspect how futile a sharp rap fell on the operating room door roic awake again he wasnt going to greet the news of their fools errand with any joy either miles stretched his back grabbed his cane walked to the door and glanced through the narrow glass and was immediately glad he hadnt just yelled come in roic because standing outside was consul vorlynkin looking harried with jin and mina in tow one tugging on each arm miles slipped through the door and stood with his back pressed to it what are you doing here you were supposed to wait at the consulate till i called as if he couldnt tell by the way vorlynkin was being pulled about he supposed it was a good thing the children seemed to have lost all fear of the man but it would be better if he hadnt turned to putty in their hands yeah like i should talk they insisted vorlynkin explained unnecessarily i told them she wouldnt be awake till tomorrowyou told them how unappetizing you looked when you came out of cryobut they still insisted even if they could only see her through the glass i dont think they slept all night woke me up three times i thought maybe if they could just see theyd settle down take naps later something vorlynkins voice slowed as he took in miless grim stance so he only mouthed and did not voice the words whats wrong miles wasnt ready for this now hell he wasnt ready for this ever hed had the unenviable task before of informing nextofkin or the friends who stood in that place but theyd always been adults never children never so wide open and unarmored mina and jins excitement was quelled as they looked at him because if things had gone well wouldnt he be puffing it off already taking the credit there was no way to make this better and only one way to make it over he wanted to kneel to grovel but it seemed only right to look jin in the eye he took a deep breath im sorry im so sorry something went wrong with the cryorevino with the cryoprep there was nothing ravensensei could do we triedwe think your mother died during her cryoprep eighteen months ago or sometime soon after jin and mina stood still in shock but not crying not yet they just stared at miles stared and stared but we wanted to see her said mina in a thin little voice you said we would see her jins voice was throaty husky entirely unlike himself you promised the trio had fallen apart from each other at the blow of this news quite spontaneously and uncharacteristically jins hand found minas minas other hand wavered and gripped vorlynkins again he looked down at her in dismay now he said are you sure his hard gaze rose as if to nail miles to the wall they have a right said miles in reluctance though i dont know if an ugly memory is better than no memory i justdont know neither do i admitted vorlynkin minas chin jutted out i want to see i want to see her jin gulped and nodded wait a moment then miles slippedfledback through the door and said raven we have visitors next of kin can we ah tidy her up a bit raven the supposed jacksonian hardass looked deeply shaken at this news oh gods its not those poor kids what are they doing here must they come in theyve a right miles repeated wondering why those words seemed to resonate in his mind he ought to know but these days he couldnt blame every memory lapse on his own tenyearold cryorevival raven tanaka and miles hurried to get the silent figure decently draped to remove the useless tangle of technology from about her tubes and electrodes and the strange cap miles smoothed the short black hair back over the ears its slickness rendered the middleaged female face sophisticated yet skulllike and miles wondered how the childrens mother had worn her hair weird little things like that could matter all out of proportion a swift and useless tidyingup this over let it be over miles went to the door and held it wide jin and mina and vorlynkin filed through the look vorlynkin flicked at miles in passing had very little love in it jin took the consuls free hand as they came up to the tableside because who else was there left to hang onto in this spinning hour the children stared some more minas lips parted in bewilderment jin raised his eyes to miles with a halfvoiced huh drawing back in something between outrage and scorn mina said but thats not our mommy chapter twelve miles just barely kept himself from blurting idiotically are you sure neither set young face held the least doubt then who he choked wheeling to stare at raven at the draped figure on the table was it that we just murdered was unfair as well as inaccurate and he suspected would also be deeply offensive to the upset cryorevival specialist that we just fortunately no one here seemed to expect him to fill in the blank her numbers were right said raven or anyway her numbers were the ones you gave me so either miles had grabbed the wrong drawer code from the cryostorage data which he knew very well he had not or the numbers had been fudged somewhere upstream by somebody for some reason concealment to protect lisa satos cryocorpse from kidnapping by her supporters or someone like the nhll or by milesno miles didnt think anyone on kiboudaini could have imagined a nosy barrayaran imperial auditor taking this interest or might it have been a genuine error in which casemiles pictured the millions of cryodrawers in under or around northbridge alone and his heart sank the thought that nobody might actually know where lisa sato had been stashed was too horrible to contemplate for more than an instant orand the notion was so arresting miles caught his breathsomeone else had been ahead of him with the exact same idea in which case no before his inner visions could proliferate madly hed better fasten them down with at least a few facts physical ones not all these trailing tenuous tentacled inductions miles took a deep breath to slow his hammering heart all right all right well start with what we can know first is to id that poor um patron make that a priority for your autopsy raven ill go back to the consulate tightroom and miles broke off as vorlynkin cleared his throat ominously vorlynkin nodded to jin and mina clinging together in whitefaced silence miles wasnt sure whether to read their postures as fear or anger though at least they werent weeping in either case vorlynkin was probably rightit wouldnt do to discuss the gruesome details of an autopsy in front of them just now even if the subject wasnt their mother after all children as miles had reason to know ranged naturally from deeply sensitive to remarkably bloodyminded sometimes confusingly the same child at different times was dealing with women practice for dealing with children it was likely just as well he didnt have time to follow up that thought with a sweep of his arms miles shepherded vorlynkin and his charges back out into the corridor im so sorry about all this miles repeated inanely i promise youdamn he really needed to cull that phrase from his vocabularyim still going to look for your mommy the problem has just suddenly become a lot more interesting er difficult its just become a bit more difficult i need more data d need more data dammit was an old mantra of his almost comforting in its familiarity some setbacks were simply setbacks others were opportunities breaking down the door in disguise he was reasoning ahead of his dataremember datato imagine this was the second sort well that was what experience could grant onea high degree of certainty while making ones mistakes mina said but whats going to happen to us now jin added anxiously youre not going to make us go back to aunt lorna and uncle hikaru are you no or at least not yet consul vorlynkin will take you back to the consulate for the moment until we get somewhere with all this or or vorlynkin repeated as miles trailed off well get somewhere i just dont know where ill stay here for the cleanup then join you all there later when you get back vorlynkin put lieutenant johannes on a preliminary data sweepsearch for me i want to try to find that dr leiber the one who was associated with lisa satos group here in northbridge eighteen months ago not much of a clue but he had to go with what little was in hand miles wondered just how common that surname was on kibou well hed find out shortly vorlynkin nodded and herded the kids off jin looked around as if regretting his lost refuge mina reached up and took the consuls hand which made him twitch a little possibly with guilt but he manfully endured this was clearly distressing for the children hell its distressing for me roic sleeprumpled stuck his head out the door of the improvised bunk room and squinted as the trio vanished around the corner i heard voices whats going on miles brought him up to date his expression when he learned that theyd just deftly snatched the wrong body was all that miles had pictured of course you had to have been around roic for a while to read all the nuances of bland his face and posture could convey was there some sort of secret school for armsmen to learn this or was it all apprenticeship armsmancommander pym was a master but roic was catching up yknow said roic as pym would not have because pym would have had an exact bland to cover it if youd quit while you were winning right after wing wed be on our way home right now well i cant quit now said miles tartly i can see that mlord with a sigh roic followed him back into the lab raven had tidied up and was getting ready for his next task medtech tanaka was laying out an array of rather disturbing instruments on a tray next to the cryorevival table she looked up at their entry and asked will we still get our free cryorevivals then yes of course said miles automatically rent after all he was surprised she still trusted them for the task but was vaguely heartened that she evidently agreed with ravens analysis he did not add and we might be back he was growing more cautious belatedly raven tapped his fingers on the table and looked over the instruments do you want me to send any samples out to a commercial lab for analysis or try to set up something here which is faster and which is better if i wanted to do a good job here inhouse id need to bring some of my team from escobar this would likely take more time than sending samples out either risks drawing attention results ought to be the same hm my instinct is to keep this close till we know what were dealing with id say go as far as you can on your own and then well take stock my working hypothesis is that this was a deliberate substitution sometime in the past eighteen months if we knew who this woman was where she came from it might tell us something about who could have put her in lisa satos place or not makes a difference if she was just swapped out or if she was actually frozen in place of sato from the getgo in which case raven frowned you think jin and minas mother might still be alive out there in that case why didnt she let her poor kids know depends entirely on how dangerous that knowledge might have been ravens frown deepened well i can tell you one thing straight off said medtech tanaka bending to retrieve a scrap of plastic caul from the waste bin and holding it up to the light this woman here wasnt frozen in place of the one youre looking for not in the past eighteen months at least this is an older style of wrapping three heads turned abruptly toward her how old said miles and how do you know her wrinkled eyelids narrowed oh heavens i havent seen this brand with the hexagonal netting inside since my student days at least thirty years old maybe fifty miles groaned so this woman could have come from any time in the last two hundred and fifty years no because there were other styles and brands before then and after this type was only on the market for about three decades thank you medtech tanaka said miles thats a start his mystery it seemed had just split into two mystery mitosis it seemed a retrograde sort of progress raven lifted his first instrument and bent to his patientturnedsubject it was very quiet in the lift van for the first part of the trip back to the consulate jins throat was choked with disappointment mina strapped in the middle of the next seat to the rear was pale and withdrawn vorlynkin negotiated traffic by hand till they were well away from suzesans then linked to the municipal control grid and leaned back with a sigh he hitched around sideways to regard jin and mina both im really sorry about all this mixup it wasnt your fault jin conceded vorlynkin opened his mouth to say something evidently thought better of it and substituted simply thank you after a moment he added although if you two had been my daughter id have been furious to have you dragged into something like this before jin could say but i thought we dragged you in mina piped up eagerly you have a daughter how old is she can she play with us vorlynkin grimaced annahs six so she probably would like to play with you but im afraid not shes on escobar with her mother are they coming back soon asked mina no vorlynkin hesitated were divorced both jin and mina flinched a little at the scary word why are you divorced asked mina if theyd been sitting together jin could have kicked her in the ankle to shut her up but unfortunately she was out of reach vorlynkin shrugged it wasnt anyones fault really she was an escobaran i met her when i was stationed at the embassy there as a junior secretary when we first married i thought it was understood that she would follow where my career took me but by the time i was offered the promotion and the transfer to the barrayaran embassy on pol annah had come along and my wife changed her mind with a baby to look out for she didnt want to leave the security of her family and her homeworld or she didnt trust me enough or something after a silence which jin endured in faint embarrassment and mina apparently in deep fascination vorlynkin added my exwife remarried recently another escobaran she wrote me that her new husband wants to adopt annah i dont know it might be better for her than a father she sees for maybe three days every three years its hard to decide to let go he had been talking to his lap but unexpectedly he raised his shrewd blue glance to jin and mina what do you think mina blinked and blurted id want my real daddy vorlynkin didnt look terribly cheered by this reply jin said more cautiously it depends i guess if hes a nice guy or not i assume so i havent met him yet i suppose i ought to take some time and go do that before signing off maybe visiting again would just confuse annah surely she cant remember much about me dont you send her messages and stuff asked mina frowning sometimes jin said slowly couldnt you have chosen to stay with your wife back then instead of going to pol wherever that was pretty far from escobar it sounded like being a diplomat isnt like being a soldier is it arent you allowed to quit vorlynkin gave jin an ironic salute just a fingertouch to his forehead and jin felt even more uncomfortable maybe he shouldnt have pointed that out yes i could have made that choice then i couldnt go back now of course that chance has gone beyond recall minas frown deepened to a scowl it sounds like you already picked my younger self did yes i have to wonder about him some days the autopilot beeped as they approached the consulate and somewhat to jins relief vorlynkin turned away to retake the controls back in the consulate kitchen vorlynkin fixed them all a snack then went off to the officelike front room to see about something his clerk wanted mina snitched lucky and went upstairs jin went outside to check on all his creatures by the time he arrived in the bedroom he shared with his sister she was curled up on her bed around the cat possessively lucky endured being clutched like a stuffed toy without protest beyond a lazy tailtwitch or two jin was much too old to take a nap in the daytime but his bed did look awfully inviting he supposed if he tried to take lucky away from mina shed just set up a screech maybe wait till she fell asleep her face was stiff and blotchy her eyes red as if shed been crying as he sat on his bed and plotted his recapture of the cat mina sniffed and said they lied grownups always lie jin brooded mom lied she always said everything was going to be all right and it wasnt huh mina curled tighter face scrunching and sniffed again in a little while both face and grip relaxed and jin bent over and fished lucky back careful not to wake mina he stroked the cat till she purred in concession to the trade then went to curl up with her on his own bed it was a nice bed nicer than anything hed had at suzesans but he still wished he was back there maybe grouchy old yani had been right after all to want to leave milessan in the street he was wakened by roic calling his name big hand gently shaking his shoulder mina was already sitting up and rubbing the creases from her pillow out of her face lucky had gone off somewhere the light on the carpet had shifted around jin glanced at the clock and realized that a couple of hours had slipped away sorry to wake you said roic mlord wants you to take a look at something on the comconsole in the tightroom roic waited patiently while both children visited the bathroom making sure theyd washed their hands before following him downstairs now that he was getting used to the big man jin kind of liked roic for milessan it must be like owning your own private grownup following you around and doing stuff for you except you got to tell him what to do instead of the other way around jin wished he owned a roic there was a crowd in the strange sealable basement room where jin had figured out by now the consulate kept all the nifty secret spy stuff milessan and vorlynkin sat at one comconsole ravensensei had returned and was bent over the long table along with johannes attending upon a small machine jin dodged over to them whats that dna scanner said johannes is that what you used to check milessalord vorkosigans thumbprint that first day yes handy said ravensensei there should have been one at madame suzes but evidently it was sold off or broken some time ago i was afraid i was going to have to take the tissue sample to a commercial lab for even this basic data jins interest rose could i make scans of my creatures dna on it its not a toy said johannes we use it for making positive ids of people wanting travel documents and so on he looked at jin and weakened youll have to ask counsel vorlynkin milessan called jin over to his comconsole where mina was already standing and shifting from foot to foot stillshots of four different men hovered in a row above the vid plate two had gray hair one wore a white laboratory coat miss mina im hoping you can help us out here said milessan all these men are different dr leibers who live around greater northbridge weve already eliminated the female dr leibers trusting none has made a trip to beta colony lately his mouth twisted up at some joke that jin didnt understand although roic did judging from his short smile do any of them look like the man you overheard talking to your mommy that night or do any of them definitely not look like him mina peered anxiously at the scans it was a long time ago i dont really remember do you remember anything at all was your dr leiber young or old oh old gray hair no black i do remember that much im not too good at telling grownups ages but he was real old thirty maybe milessan and vorlynkin exchanged a look the consuls lips twitched but he didnt say anything so old but not gray milessan tapped the vid controls and the two grayhaired men vanished the other two looked rather alike with similar haircuts except ones face was bonier and the others more round when i was a wee little kid remarked roic watching over their shoulders there was a time i thought that any skinny old man i saw was my grandfather it was pretty confusing nevertheless said milessan jin do you remember ever seeing either of these two men in your mothers company even if you werent introduced jin shook his head after a long hesitation mina pointed at bonyface that one maybe the other one seems too fat he might have gained weight jin offered helpfully getting into the spirit of this show her scans of a hundred fellows said roic or even ten and i doubt shed be able to tell mlord youre leading your witness if we had to look at the entire pool of elderly gents of thirty on kibou that would doubtless be true said milessan fortunately we have some other sorting constraints he pointed at roundface this dr leiber is an obstetrician at a replicator clinic in a northern suburb his finger swung to bonyface this dr leiber is a biochemist working for newegypt cryonics given that minas witness does not positively eliminate him that combination puts him at the top of my todo list what happened to your theory that the fellow must have fled asked roic this leiber doesnt look much like an activist i meangood salary stock options cryoinsurance a company man belike milessan sat back and rubbed his chin that is a problem true maybe i was wrong before roic gave him a headtilt which induced a fleeting grin on milessans face for no reason that jin could see johannes and ravensensei had finished their task at the table and taken over the satellite comconsole now ravensensei said ah is there a face scan of her i have fingerprints and footprints for backup butno were not going to need them are we milessan shoved his chair back with his feet and swung around what have you found over there roic bent and peered aye that does look like our woman doesnt it look at her cheek bones and her ears and that same mole above her left eyebrow this scan must have been taken pretty near the time she was frozen cant say as id noticed her ears milessan grabbed his cane and stood up to get a better view jin wriggled in to look too comparing the picture of the live smiling woman with that still alien figure theyd seen on the treatment table made him queasy all over again would his mother look all strange like that if she died for real good this file has it all said ravensensei biographical data medical history date of cryoprepwell her contract and her financial data would seem to be crossreferenced elsewhere alice chen poor unlucky woman i suppose im glad to know her name that was fast work said milessan good job these patron data bases are pretty open to the public said johannes though he straightened a little at the praise anyone from lawyers to academics doing demographic studies to medical researchers to just genealogists scouting their family trees can get in he sat back staring into the screen of data the vid plate had flung up looks like she was frozen about fortyfive years ago thats lucky you get back more than about a century and the data banks tend to have holes from one cause or another yeah when i was uh working in my prior career this planet used to be a favored source for untraceable false ids said milessan it was the only reason id ever heard of the place before this investigation he squinted and pointed to a line what the devils that unpronounceable polysyllable ravensensei looked debilitating blood disease might have been why she chose to freeze a bit early cause of death do you think ravensensei shook his head no it shouldnt have affected her revival she would have needed treatment later though could she have had it effective treatment that is oh yes that ones under control these days so what said milessan was a woman frozen nearly half a century ago doing in lisa satos cryodrawer with lisa satos id tag on her foot its plain she didnt get there by herself while someone could have just cooked the drawer file numbers in the data banks that damn tag pretty much guarantees it must have been a physical switch where are your madame chens remains now by the way said consul vorlynkin they really ought to be returned to her next of kin at some point there may be an inheritance tied up or who knows what and her death is recent enough that someone still alive may have an emotional interest in her fate he hesitated not that im looking forward to the lawsuits shes tucked away downstairs at madame suzes for now said ravensensei tenbury helped out will she keep asked milessan indefinitely milessan opened his hand to vorlynkin keep she must till ive untangled all this but hold that thought so now we have two ends our straying dead lady and dr leiber it remains to follow them up and see if they meet in the middle was she frozen by newegypt by the way johannes scrolled down by one of the cryocorps that newegypt later took over i think on that same site i dont think it was built out there yet fortyfive years back johannes bent to a flurry of searches ah here we go the place she was originally kept seems to have been decommissioned about ten years ago torn down they moved her out to the new facility at the cryopolis then that would certainly have made it easy for someone to swap her out said milessan especially if the swapper was already on the inside like an employee im thinking madame chen was chosen at random who they wanted was lisa sato are you saying somebody stole mommy asked mina a quaver in her voice its beginning to look that way milessan narrowed his eyes at the vid screen vorlynkins grip on his shoulder and exasperated headjerk toward mina returned milessans attention to her she looked like she was trying not to cry milessan made quick revision although you have to figure whoever took her had to care about her you dont steal something you dont value suggests they would be careful with her grownup lies on the whole jin liked that milessan didnt talk down to him and mina but this was all just too weird as mina failed to look encouraged milessan babbled on after all the portable cryochamber i was in was lost for a time but it all came out right in the end lost from your sides point of view said ravensensei from our point of view it was found milessan gave mina a big there see sort of smile which faltered at her blank stare vorlynkin and johannes were gazing at him in horrified fascination miles drew himself up im going to go talk to this dr leiber in person not at his work i think he added his voice slowing in thought roics mouth set in a grim line you will have a proper security perimeter certainly well even take johannes so you wont have to be the perimeter all by yourself its a start milessan studied mina who was still shifting fretfully the connection between dr leiber and your mother exists nowhere in the records ive seen so faronly in your witness miss mina if anything comes of it it will be entirely due to the valuable intelligence you supplied she cheered a little at this or at least her lip stopped quivering really really and valuable impsec informants get paid you know so do couriers i am reminded he added with a glance at jin but i didnt finish the job said jin capture by the enemy rates hazard pay actually how much asked mina brightening a lot more ah i like the way you think kid theres actually an official pay schedule in barrayaran marks of course it has codes for various services ill have roic check it and do the conversions to kiboudaini money you propose to pay them adult rates asked vorlynkin jin thought he sounded more startled than disapproving and hoped he wouldnt try to talk milessan out of this wonderful idea damn straight milessan added my case budget allows for a lot of discretion you know then i wish youd buy some snapped vorlynkin he shut his mouth abruptly as if startled at what had fallen out of it milessan merely grinned at him his stiff consulface back in place vorlynkin shepherded jin and mina back up to the kitchen to feed them again jin glanced back over his shoulder at the four men turning intently back to their comconsoles as that heavy door swung shut he hoped the consulate had good spy stuff chapter thirteen dr seiichiro leiber proved to live in a rented rowhouse in a residential district on the west side of northbridge not far from his work miles had johannes driving the lift van circle the block to give him a feel for the neighborhood on this pleasant weekend morning not a few folks were out tending their tiny plots of greenery a gang of children raced noisily across the lawns got yelled at by a gardener and vanished giggling around the corner jin and mina might well have grown up in a place much like this miless more focused researches last night had mainly turned up leibers school records with police records drawing a bland and virtuous blank he wasnt listed on any of lisa satos rosters of supporters or contributors nor did his name appear among the arrestees at the rally riot most of whom had been released without being charged charges had been made but later dropped against the two dead and the three including sato whod been suspiciously frozen all tidy and quiet now this dr leiber had acquired his phd at the unprecocious age of twentyeight and gone directly into employment with newegypt for the four years subsequently his thesis which miles had readwell skimmedhad focused on improvements in cryonics fluids which given that a consortium of cryocorps had funded his scholarship seemed perfectly reasonable several of the larger cryocorps maintained research departments that in addition to overseeing quality control worked on proprietary advances in their procedures designed to lure customers from their competition nothing odd about that either miles had johannes pull up at the corner i think our biggest problem here is going to be nosy neighbors not electronic surveillance you arent going to be able to sit or stand around without people coming out to see what youre up to so ill run an open comlink to you johannesmiles set his to record while he was at itand you find a place to pull in and buy coffee or something drop roic around back on the way miles eyed his bodyguard dressed fairly neutrally but not quite locally i wish we could disguise you as a lamp post or something ill manage said roic miles nodded waved raven to follow him and descended to the sidewalk the door buzzer was answered by a darkhaired blinking fellow with a tea mug in his hand wearing a tshirt and trousers barefoot despite the weekend jaw shadow and lack of a lab coat he was immediately recognizable as miless quarry miles smiled dr leiber not giving the man time to answer he continued my name is miles vorkosigan and this is my associate dr raven durona of the durona group a flash of recognition crossed leibers face at the latter name followed by puzzlement durona said leiber from the escobar clinic oh youve heard of us raven smiled sunnily i read the journals miles forged on we were both in town for the internexus cryoconference last week and hoped to see you may we come in leaving implied that the associate was bioresearch miles would save the insinuation of interstellar cops for after theyd made it through the front door and only if needed at this reasonablesounding explanation leiber gulped down his last swallow of tea and gave way miles hustled gratefully inside he let his host guide them into his little living room and took a seat promptly the harder to be dislodged the others naturally followed suit did you attend the conference i dont recall seeing you in fact miles had checkedleiber hadnt been there no but i was sorry to have missed it were you fellows caught up in that mess i saw on the news with the nhll i wasnt but raven here was miles gave raven a goahead and raven supplied a few icebreaking anecdotes about his brief adventures as a hostage with the barrayaran connections downplayed raven then went into a technical riff about the conference drawing leiber into questions in turn equally divided between biochemistry and scurrilous gossip he also touched on leibers thesis which raven had actually read all the way through last night without his eyes glazing over by this time leiber seemed fully at ease miles decided on a direct approach im actually here this morning on behalf of the nextofkin of lisa sato i believe you had some dealings with her eighteen months ago just before her arrest shock and dismay bloomed unconcealed on leibers face well he was the scientist type not a con artist nor probably a very good liar fine by me how do you knowwhat makes you think that leiber fumbled confirming miless judgment eyewitness testimony but no one sawthere wasntbut suwabi died there was one other leiber gulped and seemed to pull himself together im sorry it was an awkward time a frightening time miles prepared to utter something soothing but his witness leaped to his feet im sorry youve rattled me a bit some tea ill fix some more tea would you like some tea miles would rather not have given him time to invent lies which they would then have to spend more time pulling apart but he was already headed to his tiny kitchen miles waved an assent that leiber didnt even look back to see raven raised an eyebrow at miles congratulations indeed a hit a palpable hit dishes rattled water ran a faint squeak and quiet tick of a door opening and closing whoops miles grabbed his cane and lurched to his feet the kitchen was empty silent but for the simmering electric kettle only one door led out onto the patio its alley gate swinging miles lifted his wristcom to his lips roic our suspect just ran out the back im on him mlord roic said grimly the thump of big footsteps quick gasps a yelp not from roic more footsteps crap that last had been roic what happened miles demanded roic a little breathless returned he just dodged into a neighbors place gone to ground theres a woman and two kids staring at me out the glass now shes arguing with leiber well shes arguing hes wheezing and after a moment you dont want me to go in there trespassing assault roics very firm tone of voice discouraged miles from descanting on diplomatic immunity he continued now shes gone off to call the police im guessing what did you two do to the fellow nothing was plainly not the right answer im not sure miles said well withdraw for now and rendezvous with johannes understood miles turned to raven all right we have maybe five minutes to go over the place here you take downstairs ill take up what are we looking for whatever hes hiding upstairs held a bedroom a bedroomturnedoffice and a bathroom an endearingly tame by galactic standards porn collection in the bedroom was out in plain sight suggesting leiber did not have a girlfriend at present the closets held clothes and shoes and a residue of old sporting equipment miles was just eyeing the comconsole in the next room in frustrationhe likely didnt have time for a stealth download before the locals arrived and besides the impsec devices that made such tasks a snap were back at the consulatewhen ravens voice came from his wristcom miles weve got to fly raveni expect the police are on their way by now i dont think hell have called them actually an arresting remark for all that it was delivered in an amused drawl what have you found down there come look miles made his way down the stairs with rather more care than hed pelted up them collecting his cane on the way the lowest levelit was not quite a basementof leibers townhouse was much as one might expect a laundry area the mechanical and electrical guts of the dwelling a larger room left halffinished for dirty projects or whatever were the owners needs leibers need seemed to be for a great deal of junk stowage raven stood between a dusty exercise machine and a long shape covered with an old bedspread tahdah he cried and whisked off the bedspread revealing a portable cryochamber plugged into the house power running and apparently occupied do we know what were both thinking asked raven yeah said miles with proper admiration althoughcould it be it normal to keep frozen people in your basement around here i mean dont know said raven running his hands over the machine in a search for identifying marks youd have to ask johannes or vorlynkin or jin what i wonder is how he ever got it in here dark of night at a guess no i mean how he got it down the stairs it would never make the turn there has to beah garage door thats better raven climbed over some junk opened it and stuck his head through ooh nice float bike miles checked underneath the cryochamber it was a less expensive model without a builtin float pallet but it was propped up on stacks of miscellaneous bricks concrete blocks and a wedge of squashed flimsiesthe top one seemed to be a scientific paperrevealing where a float pallet had been slid out from underneath no sign of the pallet in the other piles he raised his wristcom johannes i just picked up roic sir johannes returned at once should we swing around to get you now one question first do you still have the float pallet on board that we used the other day yes sorry i havent had time to return it to the rental place yet excellent come around to the back of the row there will be a sunken garage entry well meet you there i have some heavy lifting for you on our way raven raised his eyebrows isnt that theft breaking and entering no the homeowner let us in breaking and exiting maybe if its theft im guessing its the second time around for this item and while its not true that you cant cheat an honest man crooked men are less likely to complain to the authorities afterward i dont think leiber will tell anyone he went on still peering underneath did you spot any ids on this thing makers mark its a common brand ah heres a serial number that may help later yeah first things first if i dont know how to recognize and seize a tactical moment by now he could be spectacularly wrong or spectacularly right in any case itll be spectacular by the time johannes and roic arrived with the van they had the garage door open leaving muscle to do what muscle did best miles repaired upstairs to the kitchen and searched for something to write with and on a halfcomposed grocery list and a stylus came to hand he thought turned the list over bent and scribbled roic came up to find him a bit awkward but we horsed it in had to lean on the rear hatch to close it what are you doing leaving leiber a note miles affixed it to the refrigerator door what t devil roic bent to read it what kind of burglar leaves a note miles was actually rather proud of the vague wording call on me at my consulate at your earliest convenience not even an initial in signature we never finished our conversation miles explained we now have something he wants hell come saves putting a trace on him at least damn johannes is the only one of us he hasnt seen yet but i need him for other tasks youll be glad to know i now regret not having brought that impsec team you always want cold comfort sighed roic why not just wait for leiber to come back he wont not while were here if ive guessed right he risked his job maybe his life to secure what we found in the basement hell be skittish till he has time to calm down and think it through and then hell be terrified after considerately closing the garage door behind them they all piled back into the lift van to madame suzes miles directed johannes circuitously and sedately raven leaned over the seat back you know if weve just stolen that poor mans grandmother were going to be very embarrassed miles grinned exhilarated then well simply return her leave her on the lawn after dark or maybe ship her back anonymously no it would take a lot more than that to embarrass me the thought was less amusing when miles remembered yesterday mornings debacle he wasnt sure if that noise from roic was a sigh or a snort but in either case he elected to ignore it back when hed been a young municipal street guard for the town of hassadar roic had undergone firstaid training later after taking the solemn oath of a counts armsman hed been sent off for a much more advanced course in military field aid it had included how to do an emergency cryoprep with practice on a disturbingly realistic and anatomically complete model person and fake cryofluid it hadnt given him nightmares helping shift madame satos body onto the procedure table he wasnt so sure that would remain the case cutting away the protective caul and prepping the still form raven and medtech tanaka were too professional to permit much embarrassment on the helpless womans behalf but she didnt look like the model she didntquitelook like a corpse and she didnt look alive either maybe no one had a slot in their old ape brain for this yet if he ever had to perform a cryoprep for real god forbid roic suspected this experience would help him do a better job knowing what all those rote steps were aimed at he was conscious of an odd sense of privilege at least mlord had made damned sure he had the right woman this time after that unholy mess day before yesterday fortunately hed stopped short of bringing in those poor kids to id his new prize last night after theyd got her to suzes and unwrapped her this time around jin and mina hadnt even been told she was found yet when hed asked mlord but which is better mlord had replied simply neither which just about summed it up roic tried not to flinch as raven punched the assorted tubings through thawed skin and carefully seated them in his vesselsofchoice roic did start at a brief rap on the door and turned on his heel alert consul vorlynkin stuck his head in lord vorkosigan a message cameoh you didnt bring the kids this time did you demanded mlord alarmed no no johannes is babysitting they still dont know whew though perhaps you could bring them over soon if all goes well and if it doesnt asked vorlynkin grimly mlord sighed then maybe i can bring them you can come in said raven over his shoulder but you have to put on a filtering mask you cant hang in the doorway like a cat ako hastened to hand vorlynkin a mask and helped him adjust it he grimaced as the memoryseal bonded to his skin he came cautiously up to the procedure table i did wonder what this was like any problems so far mlord asked he was perched on a tall stool partly to oversee the procedure but mostly roic suspected to block him from pacing not yet said raven he reached over and started the first flush of warmed hyperoxygenated iv fluid his patients skin began to turn from clay gray to an ethereal icepale someone had made an unexpected effort to preserve her long hair treated with gel and rolled in a wrapping it lay curled like a snail shell above her shoulder ms chens hair had been cropped in a medically utilitarian bob madame sato was taller than roic had expected fully fivefooteight that and her dark hair gave her a slight unsettling resemblance to mlords wife lady ekaterin actually which roic elected not to point out satos face was a rounder shape if also stretched over a fine symmetrical scaffolding of jaw and cheekbone and her body was thinner in a way that suggested stress rather than athleticism an elflady strung out on bad drugs and bad company shes not what vorlynkin stared mesmerized i thought you said shed look terrible skin flaking and bleeding hair falling out and so on there wasnt a thing wrong with her when they put her in cryostasis said raven and this appears to have been firstclass prep and recent at that when he arrived on our operating table lord vorkosigan was in much worse shape than average to put it mildly i suppose someone has to be better to keep the average balanced she looks like something out of a fairy tale what said mlord swinging one heel to tap upon a stool leg snow white with just one dwarf vorlynkin reddened an ididntsaythat look in his eyes mlord snickered at him now all we need is a prince so whos t frog asked roic secretly glad not to be alone in his fanciful impressions different fairy tale mlord told him kindly i hope raven switched tubing and the clear fluid was replaced with dark red the icewoman look slowly changed the skin tone shifting through faint pinkness like a chill spring to a warmer goldivory as though she was receiving a transfusion of summer at length raven closed the exit line draining from her leg sealing vein and skin with plastic bandage raven and tanaka fussed about with the leads and wires and the strange cap clear raven called looking up to be sure his amateur audience had stepped back the snap of the electrical stimulus was quieter than roic had expected but still made him recoil for the first time the silent womans chest rose and her skin seemed suddenly not just pliable but alive a few moments of uneven stuttering while tanaka watched their monitors and raven stared narroweyed at his patient his face was calm but his gloved hands roic noticed were clenched then her lips parted on a longer indrawn breath then another and ravens fists relaxed roic remembered to exhale before he disgraced himself by passing out but only just got it in one said raven and shut down the external pump mlords eyes squeezed closed in gratitude vorlynkin transfixed breathed thats astounding i just love this part raven confided to the air generally as far as roic could tell it makes me feel quite godlike or at least wizardly mlords lips twitched are you saying this is an egotrip for you the best ever agreed raven i live for these moments always glad to see a man happy in his work mlord murmured raven circled his patients body tapping here and there with a stylus in a pattern roic suspected was meaningful and very old we have reflexes peripheral nerves are firing up nicely he reported he returned to her head smoothing a stray strand of hair back from her forehead in a curiously tender gesture madame sato he called lisa the eyelids fluttered opened squeezed shut the lids bore the epicanthic folds of her earth ancestry the eyes the classic almond shape the irises were a rich dark brown further reducing her resemblance to lady vorkosigan whose eyes were a striking bluegray hearings working raven murmured grossly at least and lisa he repeated are you with us yet it could hardly be reassuring to the woman to open her eyes on a circle of masked faces like bandits especially if the last thing she remembered were the faces of her allbutmurderers had they been leering coolly professional indifferent but bandits indeed stealing her will her world her life from her roic leaned in in his best reassuring guardsmans tones he tried maam youre all right safe and alive rescued your children are both safe and secure as well youll get to see them soon another fluttering of lids a moan and larynx said raven happily that should please you my lord auditor indeed said mlord she sighed again the tension passing out of her shell sleep for some hours after this said raven the longer the better well clean her up and move her to the isolation booth said medtech tanaka ako you can help with the skin treatment tubes and needles were pulled away lines coiled up machines turned off roic helped shift the live woman off the procedure table onto the transfer cart mlord slid down from his stool stretched his back and leaned on his cane how soon till we can move her to the consulate depends on her white blood count and a few other things said raven but possibly as early as the day after tomorrow youll have to keep her quiet in one of those upstairs bedrooms for a few days we can do that said vorlynkin mlord turned his head toward the consul wait why are you here has leiber shown up no not yet you have a sealed message from barrayar thats arrived in the tightroom we cant access it so i dont know how urgent it may be he added with reluctant honesty also i was curious how this was going given the need to deal with mina and jin he didnt want to be blindsided again roic read this understandable ah all right said mlord raven if youre on top of things here i guess i can go back raven waved assent and turned to follow the medtech and ako trundling his patient away the room seemed very empty when theyd left disconsolate and messy like the morning after a winter solstice party vorlynkin blinked and rolled his shoulders as if trying to come back into himself from somewhere far away that was very strange ive never seen anyone die but thisit was like watching time run backwards or something i have and yes said mlord were we playing god vorlynkin asked uneasily no more so than the people who put her down in the first place and our cause is much more just mlord added in a mutter i hope frowning he fished out his auditors seal on its chain for a slightly crosseyed downward glance sealed message eh you know when i was jins age id have been thrilled to own a secret decoder ring now i have one it feels more like a sack of bricks theres something sadly out of phase about that when mlord limped off to exchange one last word with raven roic found himself briefly alone with the consul who gazed in bemusement up the corridor after the short retreating form lord vorkosigan is not exactly what i expected when i was told the consulate should prepare for a visit from an imperial auditor roic stoutly didnt snicker the nine imperial auditors are actually a pretty varied lot once you meet them lord auditor vorthys whos also mladys uncle looks like a rumpled old engineering professor because thats exactly what he is theres this crusty admiral a retired diplomat an industrialistmlords become moreorless gregors galactic affairs expert the emperors uncannily shrewd at matching his auditors to their cases although i suppose well have to hit a dud one of these days he hasnt sent us offworld on a fools errand yet roic actually hoped for a dud case someday it could be restful thats reassuring vorlynkin hesitated i think roic smiled crookedly at the codicil yeah back in the consulates tightroom miles saw the address code on his message and relaxed it looked to be the weekly report from ekaterin which explained why it didnt bear any of the usual urgent markers something nice amid all this muddle reflecting on the difference between urgent and important he leaned forward to let his auditors seal swing out on its chain and unsealed the message his wifes face appeared smiling above the vid plate and he paused the vid just to get a good look at her she sailed through her days under such a constant barrage of interruptions lately he hardly ever saw her holding still unless she was sleeping clear bluegray eyes raised in a candid gaze sleek dark hair untouched by frost although she was his age plus a couple of months considering that hed stuck her with four offspring in under six years her lack of gray hairs seemed increasingly remarkable theyd all been gestated in uterine replicators but still hed been an only child himself racked from birth by medical issues now not so much solved as exchanged for new ones perhapsno make that certainlyhed underestimated how much work normal healthy children would take even with all the help his money and position could buy for there were some tasks you didnt want to delegate because then youd be missing the best parts she was actually staring at a vid pickup not at him he reminded himself but under the weight of her faintly ironic look he set her back in motion irrationally guilty at delaying her greetings my love she said weve received your latest here with much relief and rejoicing though fortunately i didnt tell the children about that first alarming message before the second had overtaken it i shudder to think what your parents went through during your old career though i suppose your father kept his highvor upper lip suitably stiff and your mother well i can scarcely imagine said tart betan things i suppose actually hed dodged those issues during his covert ops days by almost never sending any messages or updates it wasnt as if his father couldnt have demanded a report on his missions from the head of impsec any time he wanted one or nerved himself to it he imagined his mothers voice remarking tartly ekaterin swung into a crisp recounting of a few vorkosigan district matters before the news from his household always first things firstif ever she put matters the other way around hed know to be really alarmed for his family he was reminded that he was neglecting duties down in the district as well although this week there did not seem to be anything that called for an urgent message to hishis fathers reallyvoting proxy in the council of counts but both his parents were off tending to the emperors business on sergyar viceroy and vicereine respectively and had been for some years a fine tradition of neglect of ones own in service to the imperium those vorkosigans at a cost miles recalled with a touch of wry pride what a district village speaker had once said to him of ekaterin we feel as though you belong to the imperium but lady vorkosigan belongs to us indeed on the home front ekaterin went on heres the latest achievement the vid cut to another less steady good job helen said ekaterins voice as a room spun dizzilythe library at vorkosigan house miles recognized despite its rabbiting speed but pan more slowly or youll give your papa vertigo whats vertigo came a young voice from offsidesasha no lizzie good heavensand ekaterin responded at once dizzy oh the new word was duly accepted the vid steadied on taurie ten months old gray eyes wide under a mop of wispy black curls clinging grimly to the edge of a low table sasha five going on six as he and his twin helen phrased it and their sister lizzie three sat on a couch in the background sasha watching with interest lizzie looking bored and kicking her feet as if to say ive already done this whats the fuss come on taurie ekaterins voice cooed come to mama effectivemiles undertook not to fall through the vid plate reaching for that seductive voice taurie turned rocking on her stout little legs releasing one hand which waved for balance then the other then began a bowlegged toddle toward her mamas outstretched arms how any child learned to walk while swaddled in a diaper miles didnt know but there she went thumpthumpthump to fall chortling into ekaterins arms and be swung high in triumph let me try her said sasha much as if his little sister were a robot car he slid to his knees on the rug across from ekaterin and called encouragingly come on taurie you can do it fresh from her first victory taurie screeched and toddled toward him even faster promptly falling on her chin and setting up a wail clearly more of outrage than painmiles could discern the different timbres while still lunging up from his sleep sasha gathered her up laughing hey youre supposed to learn to walk before you run he got her turned around and aimed back toward her mama and the trial was repeated more successfully lizzie who had slid down off the couch during all this gave up spinning herself in circles singing vertigo vertigo vertigo and made a grab for the vid recorder which judging from the way the view jerked wildly her elder sister promptly raised out of her reach no i wanna run the vid now came lizzies voice let me let me mama make her let me too soon the domestic drama came to an end miles backed it up and reran it wondering if these were indeed tauries first steps or a reenactment for his benefit the vid recorder suggested the latter ekaterins face returned against the cluttered background of her thirdfloor office the one on the north side overlooking her barrayaran garden through the earthimport treetops im so sorry sergeant taura never lived to see her namesake she said looking reflective but im glad you were at least able to tell her about taurie before the end maybe we should have given her name to lizzie sooner rather than your betan grandmothers oh speaking of names sasha has now announced that he is alex i suppose because he gave up trying to talk everyone into xander lexie and aa appear to be permanently rejected now too same rationaleif we dont call him aral because of grandda aral we shouldnt call him sasha because of grandpa sasha either he seems to be sticking to this one however and he has helen on his side at last so in your next message be sure to call him lord alex that much logic and determination should be rewarded i think indeed miles had been deeply alarmed earlier in his fatherhood by what seemed sashasalexsdelay in verbal development compared to his agemate helen till ekaterin had pointed out that the boys sister never let him ask a question for himself or get a word in edgewise after he wasnt delayed merely amiable and had caught up with complete sentences soon enough thereafter as long as helen wasnt in the same room translating for him come to think of it ekaterin went on didnt you once have some trouble deciding what you wanted to be called and at a much older age history does not so much repeat as echo i suppose but he loves you whatever hes named we all do take care out there miles and hurry home when you can the vid went dark if only i could crawl through that vid plate and have myself beamed back to barrayar at the speed of light miles sighed all his life his home had been something he couldnt wait to escape how had his polarity become so profoundly reversed roics remark stung if only youd quit while you were winning well this tangle on kiboudaini wasnt all of his own making he wished leiber would show the hell up now would be a good time miles was surprised he was taking so long he might have to send someone to collect the man after all or if lisa sato woke up with temporary cryoamnesia or simply didnt know the answers no she has to know whatever leiber knows because id bet betan dollars to sand hes the one who told her in the first place leibers evident alarm niggled at miles why should he have been so afraid of us he didnt even know us leiber was obviously responding to some local threat perhaps the very one that miles wanted to know all about but miles was still having some trouble guessing what it might be just as sato was bait for leiber the pair of them would be bait forwho why miles had staked people out like goats to draw the tiger du jour in the past but not knowingly when they had children in tow or had you just never noticed their webs of relationships before he couldnt remember but if he didnt have the personnel here to chase down leiber he surely didnt have the personnel to put a roundtheclock guard on the consulate and the people it sheltered roic and johannes between them werent enough even if they hadnt had other dutieshanding the task to them without support would be downright abusive raven wasnt the only one who didnt like being set up to fail despite the distance it put between him and his family miles felt a little shiver of gratitude to gregor for sending him so far afield on his sporadic auditorial labors because it put that same distance between his family and whoever his investigations managed to piss off pissing off bad guys for the greater glory of barrayar that would be my job description just about speaking of being happy in ones work he bent to the comconsole and began composing an auditorial requisition to the barrayaran embassy on escobar for a security team to be dispatched immediately with a headsup to put an impsec forensic accountant and perhaps legal team on standby he knew nothing of his invisible enemy but that they played for keeps five days for the squad to get here at their best speed had he known enough five days ago to ask for this i suppose not miles called up the background data on newegypt cryonics once more and began to slog through it lisa sato could not regain her voice soon enough chapter fourteen by midmorning of the day after madame satos successful revival when dr leiber still hadnt contacted the consulate mlord allowed as how he might have been mistaken and dispatched roic and johannes to find the man roic thought it might have made his job easier if mlord had come to that conclusion earlier he began with the two obvious first ploys calling the mans residenceno answerand his work where he learned that the researcher had called in sick the morning before some stomach bug hed told his assistant and hed likely be out for a couple of days right roic then had johannes pack up some of the consulates better surveillance equipment and drive him back out to leibers townhouse a complex under construction that had caught his eye the previous trip did so again as they passed roic cranked his head around to study the sign century estates it read and were you born between and years ago see us whats that all about he asked johannes a generational cohort enclave said johannes you see them here and there in the bigger cities revives at least those who wake up with enough money and health for it often find they dont like the new kibou so much after all and end up clustering together trying to recreate their youths huh said roic a sort of doityourself historical reenactment at least youd have someone to talk to who gets all your jokes i guess said johannes a little doubtfully roic had johannes pull in the van at the back of the house row while he tried dr leibers front door no answer after a few minutes johannes opened it from within he left the garage unlocked float bikes gone right lets take a look around then visit his comconsole no room closet shower cupboard or dustbin large enough to hold a body did so mlords thoughtful burglars note was gone from the refrigerator which was still stocked with an assortment of bachelor rations the kitchen was tidied the bed upstairs moreorless made or at least the quilt pulled up clothes and shoes might have been takenenough to fit in a duffle strapped to the back of a float bikebut there was still a good bit left toiletries were absent johannes had started on leibers comconsole sucking a copy of its contents through the umbilicus of the secured cable onto his impsec recorder watching the progress on his holoscreen hey he said after a moment this thing is monitored i wonder if leiber knew that roic leaned in hey indeed this process wont stir up his watchers will it it shouldnt said johannes not very reassuring can you trace the bug partly i might be able to finish the job from the tightroom give us a look at his communications over the past two days since our first visit there were only three yesterday morning leiber had called in sick purchased a jumpship passage to escobar and emptied most of his remaining savings account onto a couple of universal credit chits there were no personal messages to relatives or friends he might have left a door key or instructions with the folks next door roic supposed but on the whole he thought not and he was unwilling to go stir up trouble by asking around people might remember their visit from day before yesterday he wondered what tale leiber had told his neighbor lady about them not the truth he suspected this jumpship doesnt leave till tomorrow evening johannes pointed out yeah i see think he might have gone aboard already roic frowned at the schedule ah no that one doesnt even make inbound orbit till this afternoon he thought a moment the minute he passes inside shuttleport security hes back on the grid lit up for anyone who can look and if we can spot him then belike his enemies can tooi dont think theyre operating on a shoestring not if theyre backed by one of those cryocorps hell wait to the last to board so he has to have gone to ground somewhere with a friend maybe could be hard to find johannes squinted at the comconsole although this could help if hes in as much fear for his life as this flight suggests he might not want to endanger a friend said roic slowly he didnt strike mlord as the ruthless type he said its a big city observed johannes so lets start with the obvious roic climbed to his feet pack up here and drive us out to the shuttleport in the lift van roic opened itsimpsec securedcomconsole and ran a search on lodgings around the shuttleport two were inside the security perimeter half a dozen scattered in the surrounding lightindustrial area he balanced closest against cheapest and decided to start with cheapest as they threaded their way to it he had time to reflect on how nexuswide transportation tech had shaped the cities it served giving more sameness planet to planet than hed expected before hed ever left barrayar this provincial boys come a long way in a way he was glad no good fairy had ever endowed him with the future he would have picked for himself when younger it would have been so much smaller now what asked johannes as they swung into the budget hostels lot stake the place out ask at the front desk not sure anyone would remember leiber even if they saw him said roic and this is one of those selfserve places not as cramped as some roic had encountered on space stations where sleep cubicles rented by the hour seemed a cross between a closet and a coffin but the buildings utilitarian lines didnt invite lingering it was a shadowed place even in the midmorning huddled down below a long concrete road abutment and some sort of manufacturing plant circle the lot well look for his float bike around the buildings back an openfaced shed sheltered a float bike lockdown roic recognized leibers bike nestled among half a dozen others right the first time said johannes in a tone of admiration ive had some practice trailing mlord around said roic modestly leaving out the dumb luck part well smart luck perhaps roic would have been surprised not to have turned up something within his first three tries they sat in the van for a few minutes while roic tried to think it through the way mlord would no scratch that idea hed likely do better trying to think it through like leiber or better still like roic would the enemy send cops or goons to collect their quarry if it was a cryocorp they could likely get all the cops they wantedcharges of employee theft would do the jobthey had only to wait at the pinchpoint inside the shuttleport and pick the man off as he scurried through but that would leave a trail names security vid recordings a whole lot of witnesses not under anyones direct control a private goon squad pickup before leiber hit the port that would be the quieter way to go about it and if roic could figure out where to look for the fellow presumably all those smart men in the fancy trousers could too roic wasnt the part of his team born with the silver tongue in his mouthcould he persuade leiber to come to the safety of the consulate when mlord had not guess ill have to try he glanced up whats that a pulsing blue light was reflecting off the concrete wall coming from the front of the building blues the color they use around here for emergency vehicles said johannes uneasily pull around front they arrived to see a pair of emergency medtechs dressed in blue scrubs yank a float pallet from the back of an unmarked van and hurry inside the sliding glass doors to the lobby both big fellowsone was tall and the other looked as though hed had some of those traditional wrestlers in his family tree on both sides didnt emergency services usually try to pair a woman in such a team well not always belike with round the clock scheduling as roic knew from grappling with the guardsmens roster for vorkosigan house and mlords other two official residences you took whatever combinations you could get wait here roic slid out of their own van and went to take a peek in the back of the other the rear doors had no windows but had been left unlocked careless of the techs if it was carrying drugs and expensive equipment roic quietly opened a door looked inside and raised his wristcom to his lips interesting johannes the cupboard is bare this isnt an ambulance just a van uhoh think ill just take a stroll inside and intercept those fellows coming out you watch my back from there roic still wasnt sure what was happening here although he was formulating some rapid guesses an anxious young lady desk clerk was peering up the central hallway when roic entered the lobby whats going on he asked one of our guests reported in very sick apparently he should have called the front deskwe would have assisted him was he from offworld dyou think he might have brought in something bad asked roic contagious no no some sort of sudden seizure i gather he was lucky he could use his wristcom the clerk gathered her nerve i should go and lock up after them make sure the gentlemans property is secure she glanced back at roic were you checking in sir theres only me on duty right now take your time first things first roic waved her away she trotted off up the hall to where a loaded float pallet was already being shifted out a doorway and turned the tall man hitched an iv to a pole bent and checked his patient roic glimpsed a blanketed male form firmly strapped down an oxygen mask in place across his face muffling his moans roic stepped forward radiating curiosity and concern as the pallet floated out into the lobby flanked by its two escorts dr leiber blinked up with bleared eyes and groaned behind his plastic mask what happened roic asked following along out the front doors is it anything dangerous do you need any help thanks no the tall one told him everythings under control so was it a heart attack we dont know yet said the tall one he just collapsed drugs is this a bad area i just landed myself for once roics notfromaroundhere looks and accent worked in his favor i was about to check in at this place and sleep off the jumplag but now im not so sure the broad one scowled at him in irritation no its fine go check in the pair swung the van doors wide and slid the pallet aboard both climbing inside to secure it roic stuck his head in after you sure yes its safe said the tall one exasperated from the windowless cargo area good said roic pulled his stunner and shot them both that would save some heavy lifting and scuffling roic hated scuffles just because he was big didnt mean he liked getting hurt johanness breathless voice sounded from his side not his wristcom what the hell is going on when roic had said watch my back he hadnt meant from this close but he couldnt fault the lieutenant for curiosity johanness eyes widened peering into the shadows roic tucked his stunner away in its shoulder holster we just rescued dr leiber im not sure if hell see it that way though he climbed into the cargo area first checking both his victims for health stunner fire was by no means safe it could trigger all sort of problems in people with underlying medical issues happily these two seemed extremely fit having assured himself of their continued cooperation by the simple means of a light repeat stun to the base of each neck he arranged them more tidily he then turned to leiber roic was not called upon after all to trot out his encouraging weve saved you be grateful im taking you to a place of refuge speech in which he had no faith leiber had lost consciousness roic hoped to hell it had just been a hypospray of knockout drugs and not some deadly poison even if some bloody and secret murder was planned if he were leibers enemy hed sure want him alive to question under fastpenta first actually roic wanted to question leiber under fastpenta on his own behalf that decision would be up to mlord though leibers breathing continued evenly and his skin did not turn any alarming colors all right so far follow me to madame suzes place he instructed johannes dr durona would be there among other useful amenities he thought a moment no betterlead me to suzes he locked the back of the van doused its flashing lights and followed johannes in convoy out of the parking lot roic wondered if mlords approach to life or at least to his auditorial investigations was rubbing off on him hed never used to be this cavalier about due process it was hard to tell sometimes if mlords style was the result of singleminded dedication to duty habits of overweening vor privilege or simple insanity roic only knew that he had an inexplicable desire to whistle cheerfully right now instead he raised his wristcom to his lips called mlord and gave a concise precis of his mornings mission if mlords laconic order of roic go nail that twit could be so grandly styled and then being alone in the drivers cab he whistled all the way to suzes his imagination afire with possibilities jin sat at the consulates kitchen table and counted out again his share of the money roic had solemnly distributed to him and mina at breakfast that morning mina had already secreted hers in her backpack upstairs but she watched him with interest as he reshuffled his stack of currencyfive thousand nuyen more than hed ever had at one time in his life back in the good times before his father had died jin had never been given more than five hundred even for his best birthday what are you going to do with yours mina asked im not sure yet i could buy food for my creatures for months with this or get something new i always wanted to try keeping fish but aunt lorna would never let me and there was no way at suzes you cant cart fish around with you if you might have to go live on the street minas eyebrows knit do you guess were going to be here that long jin hesitated i dont know do you think i have enough for a pony where would you keep a pony you need like lots of terraformed ground i think the back garden heres not big enough aunt lornas patio sure wasnt big enough mina agreed at least consul vorlynkin has grass jin tried to picture this the consulates patch of back lawn was barely larger than its living room nice for a chicken run but he didnt think it would work for anything much bigger anyway he said bracingly you still have lady murasaki ponys got four legs spiders got eight so she has to be twice as good right mina cast him a look of cold scorn id like to see you try and put a saddle and bridle and stuff on her jin tried to imagine spidersized tackknotted thread perhapsand what kind of insect could you persuade to ride a wolf spider that the spider wouldnt eat riding would be a much more exciting sport he thought if ponies ate prey like spiders did did the consulate have any thread they could borrow but before he could pursue the vision further consul vorlynkin and milessan came through the kitchen pulling on their jackets vorlynkin is going to drive me down to madame suzes to see about something milessan told them he and roic had been spending a lot of time there lately jin thought and come back looking grim and thoughtful though no one had said why and ravensensei hadnt come back at all yuuichi matsons here so you wont be alone but if any strangers come in on consulate business youll need to stay out of the front rooms and hall upstairs should be all right or the back garden if you dont make too much noise ill be back directly vorlynkin promised mina looked up do you think youll ever find mommy we hope to have good news soon said milessan jin wasnt sure how to interpret that soothing tone of voice more grownup lies by her scrunched face he didnt think mina was buying it either but what she said was lord vorkosigan if you had children youd give them ponies wouldnt you not spiders he looked a little taken aback i do and i have ponies not spiders although i suppose they could have spiders if they wanted some god knows we have butterbugs monogrammed didnt i ever show you my pictures and then to jins surprise and growing dismay he pulled a holocube out of his pocket and proceeded to show off scans of a regularsized darkhaired womanjin could tell she was regularsized because there were some shots of the two of them together and the top of milessans head barely reached her shoulderand a bewildering succession of children at different ages jin didnt quite sort them out till they came to a group shota darkhaired boy and a redhaired girl a bit younger than mina an infant in the pretty womans arms and a leggy toddler in the middle of the pack four children he hoped mina would muster the wit to look interested and not distraught he still wasnt altogether sure what milessan was but he seemed to have a lot of clout even the consul did whatever he said and heres helen on her pony down at vorkosigan surleauits a place we have in the country on a lakeand heres sasha petting his xander alex i mean jin wondered what kind of inattentive father milessan was that he couldnt seem to remember his own sons name there was only the one boy after all it wasnt as if he needed to run down a list till he got to the one who was irritating him the way uncle hikaru had with him and tetsu and ken sometimes but jin had to admit they were very finelooking ponies one dappled silverygray the other a glossy dark brown with black socks and mane and tail and a white star on its forehead both with dark liquid friendly gazes seeming tolerant of their childadmirers mina goggled her mouth dropping open in naked longing yah and doubleyaha big place in the country with lots of animalsthere had been dogs and cats and birds in the backgrounds of some of those shots and who knew what creatures lurked in those wooded hills and fish in a real lake not just in some little glass tank and maybe creeping and crawling native marvels living in the streams running down into itbetter than jin had dared to dream and all belonging to these other children children who had a live mother and father too what was that line of uncle hikarus them what has gets and those that didnt have didnt get jin supposed was the unspoken half of that lesson he looked at those other children and at milessan so obviously pleased and proud and didnt doubt that mina probably felt like crying his own throat was tight with envy and ridiculous anger it wasnt as if milessan had kept his family a secret on purpose just to bait jin so belatedly i wouldnt have dared not teach them to ride milessan went on my grandfathers ghost would have haunted me if i hadnt not that the old buzzard doesnt anyway the vor were a military caste back in the time of isolation knights of a sortor bandits perhaps depending on your point of view horse soldiers in any case its a tradition he gave that last word a peculiar emphasis as if it tasted funny in his mouth a perfectly useless skill nowadays but we keep it up all the same perhaps wed better go said vorlynkin and yeah said milessan he pocketed his holocube carefully like it was something special to him they went off through the garden toward the big garage jin and mina stared at each other well said mina at last at least i was right about the ponies she blinked rapidly and rubbed her reddened eyes jin glowered down at his little stack of money which had seemed such a big pile of possibilities just minutes ago its no good after all said mina maybe it never was maybe we should just go back to aunt lorna and uncle hikarus stop struggling you could maybe jin said bitterly not me no wait you couldnt eitheryoud gab mina looked indignant at this accusation with a huh she rose to go back upstairs at the archway into the kitchen she flung back over her shoulder two ponies have eight legs so there jin couldnt think of a counterargument to that as jin was fingering his nuyen and wondering if he dared help himself to a snack the consulate clerk wandered into the kitchen to refill his mug of green tea he leaned against the counter and stared at jin who fidgeted under the cool regard youre lisa satos children arent you the cryorights activist uhyah jin wasnt sure if that was supposed to be a secret here but matsonsan obviously already knew matsonsan took a sip of tea and frowned nobodys really told me anything but ahif you want me to call the police for you and your sister before the barrayarans all get back i could jin shot to his feet almost knocking over his chair and cried in horror no matsonsan sloshed hot tea swore set the cup down and wiped his scalded hand on his trousers it was the police who took mom said jin call your relatives then no thats even worse er said matsonsan so you two kids are not um notprisoners here are you of course not milessan is helping us he considered events so far and amended that to trying to anyway and then because that sounded weak and ungrateful nobody else has ever tried like him which was certainly true matsonsan scratched his head and grimaced ah he took up his tea again well if you change you mind you can tell me all right jin glowered at him in a dismay that made him hold up a placating hand just trying to help too jin wanted to cry if thats your idea of help dont but it seemed too rude a thing to say to a grownup he settled on all right but i wont change my mind matsonsan shrugged uneasily and went back out to that front officeroom jin gathered his money and fled upstairs to hide it away with three of the four people he wanted to interrogate at suzes place still out cold bless roic miles perforce began with madame sato inside the glasswalled softlylit isolation booth she was sitting up in her narrow bed looking pale and exhausted but on the whole very good for a new revive she was clean in a crisp patient gown and warmly padded robe each extra layer of cloth providing protection from exposure both to germs and prying eyes miles suspectedno knew very wellfrom his own toofrequent hospitalizations that the latter could be more important to ones morale than the former ako had washed the gel from her hair it lay undamaged in a silky fall over her shoulder he eased into the booth wondering if he seemed menacing to her or merely weird hard to tell from her stern glare he adjusted his filtering mask and cleared his throat good afternoon madame sato my name is miles vorkosigan he smiled reassuringly then realized she couldnt see his mouth sorry about the mask but dr durona says your immune systems coming back fast we should be able to dispense with the sterile precautions and get you out of here fairly soon are you a doctor her voice was raspy but functional no your revival was done by raven durona a specialist from escobar who works for me miles realized hed better add explaining himself to her was going to be an uphill slog i saw him earlier she swallowedpartly nerves partly still getting used to being back in control of her body he expected where is here they said i was in northbridge her tone said she doubted this doubted everything right now miles glanced around the view from booth took in only the shadowed deserted recovery room which had no exterior windows not even looking out on the wall of another building northbridge thats right youre in an old decommissioned cryonics facility on the south side which has been taken over by some rather clever squatters someone said you have my children the tightening of her throat smeared that last word nearly soundless miles now wished hed brought them along even though he was still nervy from his prior failure yes jin and mina are safe at the barrayaran consulate he added after a moment when she still didnt seem to know whether to parse this as a comfort or a threat jin has all his creatures there even gyrethefalcon and your old cat so hes content for now mina is pretty much sticking with jin this familiar reference to the traveling zoo would convince her of his veracity he hoped the barrayaran consulate why she swallowed again who are you why are you here she didnt add why am i here but miles thought it was implied what do you remember her lips clamped shut miles tried again the last thing jin and mina remember of you is your arrest by the northbridge municipal police eighteen months back two days ago my people and i found you frozen in a portable cryochamber in dr seiichiro leibers townhouse basement im now trying to close that eighteenmonth memory gap for both of us i suppose that last plainly shocked her her stare at him shifted from fear and misplaced anger to sheer bewilderment what miles sighed hitching himself up on the stool at the end of her bed an auditor was supposed to listen not talkone of gregors wee jokes was thatbut this woman had earned her briefing besides it was quite likely that lisa sato didnt know enough about barrayar to point to it on a wormhole map i expect i had better begin at the beginning im a galactic my official job title is imperial auditor thats a highlevel government investigator for the barrayaran imperium you no doubt wonder what im doing on kiboudaini miles wondered himself some moments i was originally sent to check out a smelly situation with a large whitechrys company franchise on komarrthats the second planet of our empire as succinctly as he could he explained the whitechrys scam with the komarran planetary voting shares including his successful bribery sting for the first time she looked faintly cheered yes hit them where they keep their hearts in their wallets she murmured with satisfaction although whitechrys isnt even the worst of the corps hold that thought well come back to it now i need to explain how i met your son jin and found this place necessarily he backed up to his attendance at the cryoconference and the attack upon it by the nhll those murderous idiots said lisa sato her voice hearteningly enlivened with scorn for someone other than miles in their defense they dont seem to have succeeded in killing anyone this round if not for lack of trying i actually feel i owe themthey opened up my case for me in ways id have had trouble finding on my own although i suppose the komarr scam part would have run on rails regardless anyway after i broke away from them i ended up lost in the cryocombs that part held her nicely spellbound miles had the motherwit to save most of his embroidering for after jin had joined his tale which drew her in fully she had less trouble following the explanation of suzes schemes than miles had first encounter but why was jin here she asked at a loss id left the children with my sister lorna i only thought id be gone overnight maybe a day or two until i could get a lawyereighteen months do you remember being taken to be frozen who did it her brow furrowed in an effort of recall i was in what was supposed to have been a temporary cell more of a room really at the municipal police station a man came in i thought he might be from my lawyer there was a hypospray then she shook her head then winced postrevival headache no doubt his had been a doozy hypnotic or knockout drug it hardly mattered which she had received miles suspected that not even more time to overcome any lingering cryoamnesiaof which she showed very few signswould recover anything after that after you were illegally or in any case extralegally frozen your sister and brotherinlaw naturally looked after their nephew and niece i gather that jin ran away from your sister due to conflicts over his creatures in her crowded household mina stayed on she was doing well in her second year of primary schoolthat seemed a safe assumptionuntil i inadvertently caused jin to be returned to his aunt and they both ran away together to well me at her why you look he added jin can tell you all the details when you see him miles hoped jin was enough of a barrayaran partisan by now to convey the lord auditors good intentions good performance was still to be tested unfortunately but enough about me lets talk about you it had been a very long time thankfully since miles had attempted to pick up a woman in a barand even that had been in the line of dutybut his sense of desperate seduction wasnt altogether misplaced he needed to persuade lisa sato to trust him and quickly what was your connection with seiichiro leiber and how did it come about for a long moment he feared she was going to clam up again but after another cool look she began seiichiro came to usto our political action councilwith a secret hed discovered through his work how many times did he visit you two or three who all did he tell did he ever meet with all of you george and eiko and me at first there was one later meeting with all of us when we planned the rallygeorge suwabi and me seiichiro lee kang rumi khosla and eiko tennoji those last names were all too familiar to miles from his researches let me guess you decided to make a public announcement of the secret at the rally where things went so wrong her gaze flicked up from her lap to go knifenarrow at him it wasnt our people who made the trouble we were hit by a counterrallya collection of thugs from the nhll they were supposed to have stayed at the other end of the park that night we couldnt afford to rent a hall and neither could they was it really the nhll or could it have been a gang hired to impersonate them it was really themi recognized a couple of the fellows involved locals mm they might still have been employed for the task set upon you her head tilted in consideration and halfagreement the police broke up the fight there seemed to be an awful lot of police for the size of the scuffle and they arrived very quickly as if theyd already been warned i saw several people with bleeding heads or pushed to the ground the memory seemed distressing to her it was literally only yesterday miles was reminded thats not the kind of protest we ever were i think the nhll is like the other side of the coin literally from the cryocorps the nhll frets about the money they dont have the cryocorps fret about money they do have and neither one cares about anyones lives but their own a shrewd judgment miles thought may we come back to dr leiber and his secret he does seem to have been the key man in several senses she regarded him and seemed to come to a decision i suppose if you are some sort of bizarre cryocorp spy you already know and know that i know so what more is there to lose hung unspoken for what its worth i already have a big pointer in the fact that dr leiber researched preservation solution chemistry for newegypt cryonics she gave a gingerly halfnod what seiichiro had discovered was that a certain formulation of cryopreservative that was on the market a generation or so ago broke down chemically after a few decades there must be thousands maybe millions of people who were treated with it locked up in the corps freezers who are truly dead not revivable meaning their votes are void and their assets due to be returned to their heirs there must be billions of nuyen at stake from that alone and thats without even getting to the vast legal costs plus all the procedures that will have to be devised to figure out which patrons from that period are which miles blew out a soundless whistle pieces of his puzzle slotting into place at light speed commodified contracts indeed oh he wanted an impsec metaeconomics analyst to go with the forensic accountant from escobar and he wanted them now with all the datapenetrating equipment they could carry prekeyed to the peculiarities of kibous planetary net and hed order them the moment he was back at the consulate but for the next few days he was stuck with his old original organic brain a used model at that sadly battered by all the wear and tear what he said out loud was yeah that would sure account for it all including perhaps poor alice chen whod been left by leiber in satos placeas a decoy or as a clue or as a timebomb we thought this was a revelation that could truly jolt the cryocorps hold on kibou said lisa sato even break their grip she stared around her cubicle down at her latelythawed hands i suppose we were right her brow furrowed wait you mean to say theyve still kept this silent for the past year and a half it wasnt a secret the corps could keep foreveras more and more bad revives turn up from that generation disproportionately people are bound to notice the pattern thats part of why george wanted to strike quickly for the maximum public impact why didntoh she turned suddenly bleak eyes upon miles who flinched in anticipation of what was coming next what happened to the six of us why didnt anyone get the word out after i was taken away were we all taken away i am sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings madame sato but thats what it looks like kang khosla and you were all frozen under questionable diagnoses within a few days of the rally george suwabi supposedly crashed his lightflyer into a lake and madame tennoji fell from her apartment house balcony to her death after excessive drinking needless to say i should think it most interesting to see someone from your police homicide bureau reopen those two cases er did she drink to excess she frowned even paler about the mouth than her revival had left her well yes she was in a lot of pain from her joint deterioration but she didnt fall off of things oh no poor george the odd man out in all this is dr leiber he simply went back to work for the past eighteen months that makes no sense fortunately im going to be able to ask him about it when he wakes up was he frozen too ah no he had an encounter with a simple sedative this morning according to my man roic ravendr durona that isconfirms weve detained him here at suzes while he sleeps it off he was trying to leave the planet when roic picked him up somebody else was trying to prevent him i think its going to be an interesting interrogation miles hesitated this was after all jin and minas mother those two had to have inherited or perhaps learned some part of their admirable wits and determination from her and you couldnt demand trust without giving some in return would you like to sit in chapter fifteen miles was itching to get to leiber but was diverted by roic to consider his other captives thanks to one of ravens potions both now slept peacefully on the floor of an empty officeor possibly abandoned utility closetadjoining the underground garage of the former patient intake building roic had spent the time constructively going through wallets ids and the lift van this wasnt what you might call deep covert ops here roic said sorting out the wallets to demonstrate the van is registered to newegypt and the scrubs theyre wearing are company issue they were carrying all their own identifications hans witta and okiya cermak johannes did some backchecking t one is actually the senior officer for plant security and tother used to be a regular guard till eighteen months ago when he got a big raise in pay and a promotion to personal assistant to his chief interesting murmured miles ayup id say dr leibers kidnapping was something they put together in a hurry out of resources they had to hand if theyd nailed him at work or anywhere on the newegypt properties they wouldnt even have had to bother with that much thing is now what do we do with em we cant keep em sacked out on the floor forever i mean you got to let a man pee sometime and their bosses have to know by now that something went wrong catch and release i figured to set them back in their van not far from leibers hotel and let them wake up on their own hm have you and johannes rendered the van unlocatable of course mlord roic said his prim tone adding i do my job but they did see you unavoidable im afraid i dont think they saw johannes though is kidnapping kidnappers still kidnapping miles mused yes said roic unhelpfully not that newegypt is likely to bring charges naw theyd do something else i am reminded i could have suze freeze and store them for us i suppose technically roic gave him the look if push came to shove as a kiboudaini problemsolving technique there seems to be precedent roic said nothing firmly ah well sighed miles lock the door and let them nap for now onwards working around madame satos bioisolation proved only a brief challenge miles set up his interrogation chamber in the empty booth next to hers and lent her ravens wristcom to listen in with his booth brightly lit hers not and the curtain mostly drawn on her side of the glass wall it was as good as a oneway mirror as long as she didnt move around too much she understood if perhaps did not entirely approve his plan to split the interrogation into two parts the first with leiber unaware of her presence to see if the same story was extracted both ways miles wasnt sure when to spring her on leiber for maximum utility it would doubtless come to him leiber was still woozy when raven and roic guided him into the booth and sat him in a chair roic took a wallpropping pose against the door with no bed the booth wasnt exactly crowded even with the four of them but its slightly claustrophobic air was more of a feature than a failing in miless view you again leiber said staring at miles raven with a benevolent air bent to press a hypospray against leibers arm leiber jerked fastpenta he growled looking helpless and angry synergine raven soothed that headache should clear right up leiber rubbed his arm and scowled but after pressing a suspicious hand to his forehead blinked in surprise and in a moment more belief so and when did you ever have fastpenta that you can tell the difference miles added the question to his long list miles waved raven to a chair against the wall and took one himself at a nottoolooming distance from his subject although to loom properly he supposed hed have to stand on the chair which just wouldnt have the same effect best to delegate that task to roic so dr leiber we might have saved steps by having this conversation day before yesterday but i suppose your living room might have been monitored like your comconsole maybe its just as well here i can assure you we are totally private miles smiled toothily imperial auditor threat or menace you decide leibers lips moved my comconsole dammit i thought id taken care of that so thats how you traced me thats how the two gentlemen dressed in the medical kit traced you i imagine armsman roic heremiles waved his hand roic nodded amiablyim sorry i didnt get a chance to introduce you two properly earlierroic followed them more or less and took you away from them did you recognize them by the way hans and oki of course the gang of fours pet muscle highly paid these coworkers of yours oh yah leiber smiled sourly and great job security too as good as yours not as far as i know lucky for them leiber squinted took me away how stunner said roic thats illegal no actually i have a local permit bodyguard yknow official government bodyguard in point of fact which was as close as vorlynkin had been able to get to armsman on the prefectures application form roic had acquired even odder designations in past ventures true who the hell are you people anyway leiber sat up indignantly roic tensed a trifle did you steal lisa from me her cryochamber is safe said miles truthfully it was still tucked away down the hall not for long if newegypts onto me youre safe too for the moment were holed up in an old decommissioned cryofacility on the south side of town if you want to know out of sight out of mind not likely muttered leiber subsiding how about this said miles ill tell you what i know and you tell me what i dont know why should i well come to that to start with i really was a barrayaran delegate to the cryoconference youre no doctor or academic leiber frowned prospective patron not if i can help it no im an imperial auditor a highlevel investigator for my government among my several tasks here is to study the social and legal problems kiboudaini faces as a result of its deep engagement with cryonics i shall inevitably be tapped as an advisor to upgrading barrayars admittedlyarchaic legal codes to avoid repeating your mistakes if we can granted that wasnt his explicit task but gregor was bound to think of it sooner or later miles shuddered to foresee another few years of armwrestling subcommittees from the councils of counts and ministers just like his last gig about galactic reproductive and cloning technologies on the bright side he could go home every night on the less bright work would follow him therethe punishment for a job well done as it were but it didnt take long to figure out that the only troubles the conference seriously addressed were the technical ones raven waved agreement miles went on the rest was pretty much cryocorps sales pitches so i went looking on my own for troubles well youve found mine indeed and instructive they are leiber hunched looking offended so far ive discovered that kibous scheme of proxy votes for the frozen originally devised on the assumption that people would be revived sooner and in greater numbers has proved a fascinating demographic trap still thinking about that one also that a certain brand of cryopreservative from about a generation ago turned out not to be good for more than about thirty years and that newegypt and presumably all the other corps are sitting on a financial timebomb of unrevivable corpses for which sooner or later someone is going to have to pony up and newegypt has gone to great lengths to insure that the someone wont be them leiber went rigid how hed doubtless twig to how miles knew in a bit miles had no intention of hurrying his thought processes i know that you figured this out that you went to lisa satos political action group for help and that the result was a riot at their rally that ended with three of her people frozen and two murdered did you set them up at newegypts behest no cried leiber indignantly but then deflating not on purpose betray them for money no the bribe came later just to make it look that way miles hadnt even gone looking for evidence of bribes yet ah yes deliver yourself into my hands doctor you know you want to then what did happen in your own words leiber clasped his hands and stared at his feet for so long that miles began to fancy fastpenta with or without his subjects permission but at last began it all started about two years ago i was assigned the problem of figuring out the unusual number of bad revivals we were getting from that era when id narrowed it down to the decomposing cryofluid i went to my boss who went to his bosses to report i thought theyd do something about it i mean right away but weeks went by and nothing happened who were these bosses which men were told about this the gang of four there was my r amp d supervisor roger napak and ran choi the chief operating officer and anish akabane hes chief of finance and shirou kim the newegypt president they clamped down and kept the information tight right away they promised me something was going to be done about the problem i began to figure out they didnt mean the same problem i did when akabane unveiled his commodified contracts scheme they werent trying to do anything about the bad preps just about newegypts financial liabilities when i complained to rog he told me to pipe down or id be fired and i pointed out that if i were fired id have no reason to pipe down and he went real quiet and then he promised me hed do something by that time i didnt trust their ideas about problemsolving one bit id been following lisa sato on the news for a year or two by then she seemed to me one of the few people on kibou who wasnt just arguing about the money i mean moral arguments you know her detractors had certainly been arguing about the money though from the bits miles had seen the corps claimed her schemes would just set up a rival corp run by the government for the poor for which everyone would pay illogically they also claimed her scheme would damage their business but if they werent taking in those poor patrons anyway miles didnt see how they were losing anything the nhll just wanted to set fire to all the metabolically disadvantaged regardless of net worth though they certainly wanted to start with the rich which suggested a certain shrewd efficiency in liberating their hypothesized legacy so i went to see lisa sato in person i didnt even make an appointment over the comconsole just went and knocked on her door one night and she was everything id hoped she would be i went again and gave copies of all the data i had to her and george suwabi poor guy and thats when they came up with the rally speech idea to release it all at once in a way the corps couldnt quash i thought it was all fixed a few days later when i went into work rog called me in to his office and suddenly i was being given a shot of fastpenta they squeezed everything out of me he hesitated almost everything everything about the rally plan and then they ran off in a hurry to do something about it thats where hans and oki first got into it i thinkthey did the legwork setting up the riot i think oki had a relative in the nhll actually which gave them their in who all was present at this interrogation all of them the big four i mean was that legal or illegal here the use of fastpenta on an employee i mean kind of legal i guess i mean theyre allowed to use it in suspected cases of employee theft and crimes on the premises and so on you have to sign a release when youre first employed i see there are rules about how it has to be conducted to make it admissible in court later but i dont think they were paying much attention to those in my case because the last thing theyd want is for any of this to get to a court because then they locked me up in securitys holding area was that also kindoflegal theyre allowed to hold suspects till the real police arrive except of course the police never did by the time they let me out two days later it was all over for lisa and her people he bit his lip clenched his hands i was helpless although not as helpless as the gang of four had figured thanks to lisa how was that when i brought her and george the data she told me to place a copy somewhere secretlawyer bank vault whereverwith instructions to simultaneously release it to a bunch of placesthe courts all the prefecture departments of justice the news the netin the event of my death freezing or disappearance which i did and that bought you protection from your bosses no they had the location out of me in no time thing is lisa and george also hid copies and by the time newegypt figured this out they were bothwell lisa was frozen and george was dead the gang searched but they never found the other two copies how do you know leiber smiled grimly im still above room temperature and walking around ah reasonable inference miles rubbed his lips were suwabi and tennoji murdered on purpose then by hans and oki perhaps by hans and oki but i dont think they were told to kill anyone i think those were attempted snatches that went wrong they managed to get kang and khosla and lisa though leibers lips twisted speaking of job security both were given bonuses and raises after despite the big screwups i wasnt privy to the underthetable agreements they cant turn in their bosses without incriminating themselves and vice versa and i think the four kind of liked the idea of owning their own dirtywork squad in case they needed someone to handle people like me again anyway the impasse bought everyone time to calm down and think even me i felt so badly about it all especially lisa i mean id destroyed everything shed worked for even though i was just trying to help so when i was offered the bribe i took it even though i didnt believe it for a minute because i thought it would pacify them he brooded theyd bribed rog a lot earlier i think what form did this bribe take nothing immediately useful they knew better than that its all unvested stock options that cut in after a certain numbers of years i always figured theyd fire me just before they had to pay anything out but i dont know they did let me do some real worki developed a noninvasive scanner test for the bad preps which wasnt a task they could have assigned to anyone else after all the first payment option was due to cut in soon though and thats what i set my plan on what plan to rescue lisa leibers eyes brightened and he met miless gaze for almost the first time its whats kept me going for the past year and a half his voice lowered beseeching i had to keep my job with newegypt in order to have access to her cryochamber do you see i realized it practically right away originally i figured to save enough money to rescue them all kang and khosla and lisa ship all three cryochambers secretly to escobar for revival there but it cost a lot more than i thought it would time was drawing on i thought the four were finally dropping their guard on me a bit so i revised the plan to take just lisa alone take her to escobar make the charges against newegypt and the whole corrupt system from there where wed be safe youve thought about this a lot i see said miles neutrally and pressed his hand to his lips to prevent the escape of any premature editorials leibers expression grew almost exalted it would have worked we could have been safe together we wouldnt even have had to come back to kibou if we didnt want with my credentials i could have found a job supported us both a slight indignant disturbance of the curtain miles saw out of the corner of his eye he carefully didnt turn his head that way leiber cast a speculative look at raven maybe even a place like the durona group his gaze grew more urgent maybe if you people could help me it still could still work out leibers heroic visions were abruptly interrupted by the curtain being yanked back and madame sato pounding on the glass and yelling something alas made unintelligible by the barrier miles pointed helpfully to his wristcom leiber nearly fell off his chair lisa he cried whether gladly or in terror miles wasnt sure madame sato apparently didnt get the message about the wristcom because she clenched her fists and whirled to dodge out her booth door instead raven lurched up to intercept her although only to hastily make her don a filtering mask before their own booth door slammed openroic had prudently moved out of the way seiichiro leiber you moron cried madame sato which was approximately what miles had guessed shed been trying to say since hed been hardpressed not to say it himself what were you thinking you were going to kidnap me take me offplanet and abandon my children and trap me there with no money to get home no no said leiber rising hastily and turning his hands out in pleading it wasnt like that wasnt going to be like that it had been going to be exactly like that in leibers mind miles guessed a princely rescue with leiber in the starring role and the happilyeverafter if not planned at least much wished upon had snow white in her glass coffin ever had a vote or a voice lisa i know this was all my fault i was going to make it right i swear behind her mask miles thought madame sato was sputtering almost beyond words he could see her point she snarled make it right make it worse raven put in you know upsetting and stressing a new revive is not good for their immune system or any other system some milder exercise than towering rage was indicated certainly strokes were another real possibility in the more fragile revives miles dimly recalled interested as he was in what more might be squeezed out of leiber it was time to intervene well his plan is certainly thwarted now miles soothed her well have to see if we cant come up with something rather better he jumped up and dragged ravens chair around please madame sato do sit down i should be extremely glad of your input at this point out of breath madame sato sank into the seat her brown eyes still glaring at leiber over the top of her filtering mask leiber too sank down or maybe his knees gave way madame sato rubbed her furrowed forehead a gesture that made raven frown medically her voice drooped in exhaustion along with her body if the corps have grown so corrupt and above the law that they can get away not just with theft but with murder what hope is there left for kibou escape leiber offered her eyes shot sparks of scorn over her mask leaving my children to be chewed up in this maw she drew breath everyones children miles said mildly newegypt hasnt got away with murder yet in fact their very secrecy suggests theyre still vulnerable on that point a big enough stink bomb suitably aimed might still land on the target madame sato shook her head miles wasnt sure if her spasm of despair was the result of postrevival exhaustion perfectly understandable under the circumstances or of an acquaintance with kiboudainis troubles much deeper than his own ravens glower at him suggested the former though roic he said over his shoulder i want you to run a fastpenta interrogation on both those goons we have downstairs focus on the murders but get as much else as you can especially about their bosses shoot the recordings over to the consulate secured link will such confessions be admissible to the local courts mm i need to think about that the fact that were not the local authorities may put a wrinkle in it vorlynkin can ask the consulate lawyer miles wondered what that asyetunmet woman was making of the recent stream of bizarre legal questions from her client well it was doubtless time she earned her retainer in any case i want to secure the evidence for my own purposes birds in the hand and all that do we still want to release them after if theyre murderers it sounds as if they were amateurs not contract killers and bungling amateurs at that eh depends on what turns up in the interrogations raven can assist but dont let them see him no point in letting them know any more than they do already and if either or both of them are allergic an induced and fatal allergy to fastpenta was not uncommon among galactic covert operatives miles wasnt sure about these civilians have raven check first the test patches are in my kit along with the fastpenta if so call me roic nodded miles was confident in roics interrogation skills on criminal matters this was one task he might safely delegate the larger issues miless voice slowed i dont have a handle on yet its hard to see how this technology widely adopted and combined with human nature wouldnt run into the same traps everywhere in due course in a broader sense this is barrayars problem too or will be good he had an allpurpose defense for his expense reports for this case that had been a minor but growing concern roic scratched his head thing iseveryone heres headed for the same end if the higherups allow the whole system to get too corrupt how do they expect to assure their own future revivals never underestimate the human capacity for wishful thinking and willful blindness said miles such as a whole society of people who became so wrapped up in avoiding death they forgot to be alive roic tapped his fingers on his trouser seam yeah belike a motion caught miless eyethe outer door of the recovery room opening vorlynkin appeared being anxiously towed by jin and mina miles pointed madame sato i believe you have some visitors her head turned she gasped under her mask and her eyes widened she scrambled from her chair raven springing to the alert in case the sudden motion made her dangerously dizzy but she was already banging out of the booth jin mina mommy the pair raced forward but since they did not let go of vorlynkin the man was pulled into a few long unbalanced strides that brought him face to face with madame sato she fell to one knee to clutch her children to her first one then the other then both together as hard as she could hug miles thought she might be crying he made his way to the booth door and leaned on the jamb watching even jin with all the austerity of his almosttwelve didnt reject the huggykissy stuff now mina madame sato held her daughter a little away from herself and stared over her mask her voice shook youve grown for the first time miles thought those eighteen missing months and what theyd stolen from her was brought home proof she could touch not just words and more words she looked up at last in some bewilderment at vorlynkin and whos this mina answered eagerly its vorlynkinsan mommy he took care of us at his house it has a great garden all jins creatures like it too she grabbed vorlynkins hand and swung on it without the least dismay on his part vorlynkin smiled and offered madame sato his other hand up which after her first wobbling attempt to rise she realized she needed and took he was tall enough that she actually had to look upshed been eyetoeye with leiber stefin vorlynkin madame sato im the barrayaran consul to kiboudaini im very pleased to meet you at last she made an abortive motion for her daughter to stop using the consul as a swingset but mina had already abandoned the hand and was running around the pair in excited circles jin hopped up and down in a burst of explanations most of which seemed to turn on the continued health and wellbeing of his creatures with special reference to lucky youve been looking after my children she said uncertainly only for the past few days maam you have a couple of really good kids there very bright miles thought a flicker of a smile might have turned her mouth under the mask it was certainly the first time hed seen her dark eyes crinkle with pleasure raven intervened at this point to run his stillnew revive back to her bed but he indulgently allowed the family reunion to go along miles watched through the glass the children waving their arms and explaining their lives for the last eighteen months madame sato looking dismayed as she struggled to keep up vorlynkin came to watch over his shoulder so glad to see her awake and cognizant it solves several legal conundrums for me now i can actually protect those kids just so miles smiled roic collected raven and padded off about their next task leiber looking confused waved inarticulately through the glass at the sato family and said but now what do i do miles turned to him folding his arms and leaning against the wall well youre certainly not a prisoner the only people on this planet i have the legal authority to actually arrest are other barrayarans uh but what about hans and oki i didnt arrest them i kidnapped them according to roic i see i shall have to explain to you the difference between permission and forgiveness sometime and what is the difference inquired vorlynkin brows rising success usually in any case dr leiber you are free to leave at any time i just dont recommend it not unless you have a better plan for hiding out than your last one presuming hans and oki are not your bosses only resource for legwork no theyre not sighed leiber you are also free to stay camping here overnight would make a better hiding place than any commercial venue to be sure we could all use a little time to digest all this i suspect although id also suggest you rethink any attempt to make your orbital shuttle tomorrow afternoon youd certainly not make it past the shuttleport no leiber agreed unhappily not now and what are you going to do next my lord auditor asked vorlynkin miles rubbed his jaw and scowled in thought what any commander does when hes outnumbered i suppose look for allies chapter sixteen roics interrogations of their inadvertent prisoners ran as smoothly as miles expected though hans and okis anxious selfjustifications leaked through even their slaphappy fastpenta hazes as leiber had guessed the two deaths had been more the result of clumsiness than malice although the verbal picture of the pair of goons chasing the frightened old lady tennoji around her apartment and over her balcony was sickening enough their attempt to force down george suwabis lightflyer might actually have worked if hed crash landed on dry ground instead of deep water they could have pulled him out of the safety cage and whisked him off to the freezer openly feigning a quickthinking rescue of an otherwise fatally injured man as it was his drowned corpse had been fished from the waters far too late for even kiboudainis medics to help whether the strict legal definition of their acts was murder or just manslaughter miles was still left with the dilemma of how now to be rid of his unwanted guests catch and release was off the table they and their confessions needed to be turned over to a local police authority but not one that could be bought by their newegypt bosses not that it would play out that way miles guessed roped together by their shared guilt hans and oki would be instant sacrifices and their bosses would purchase their own freedom through a screen of expensive lawyers yet miles wanted to bring down the whole newegypt crew if he could the meticulous roic did get to escort his captives individually to the loo and give them water for the moment miles had raven put them back into a light medicated doze although that wasnt going to be a longterm answer either freezing was looking better all the time miles damn well wasnt packing that pair home with him barrayar isnt suffering a goon shortage and anyway ours are more competent on the bright side the gang of four must be thoroughly alarmed by now at the disappearance of their minions and leiber hours after they should have reported in yeah it might be time to start rattling a few chains the recordings dispatched to the consulate miles was at last clear to tackle whitechrys where all this had started what was beginning to seem a rather long time ago happily he had no trouble bulling through to an immediate appointment with ron wing miles spent the drive out to the west end mentally rehearsing his role so as not to crack his cover while still accomplishing his aim they were met in wings outer office by a smiling executive secretary who rose to greet them also rising from a comfortablelooking chair in the corner though with a yawn not a smile was a startling catlike creature with the tawny body of a miniature lion and wings not unlike gyres but a disturbingly humanlooking face a colorful little striped headcloth in the style of egyptian statuary was tied under its feminine chin it trotted to roic who froze appalled as it wound around his legs it butted his kneesit must have weighed ten kiloslooked up and opened its mouth not to say what goes on four legs in the morning two legs at noon and three legs at night but a mere breathy halfmeow stop that nefertiti scolded the secretary and hoisted the beast to deposit it on her desk the creature switched its tufted tail and looked offended miles held out a hand for it to sniff as the secretary went on its all right she doesnt bite or scratch she does shed though she added in cheerful explanation to the still stunnedlooking roic they were this years promotional giveaway by our competitor and neighbor newegypt i didnt see them at the conference said miles oh they all went the first day very popular they come fitted with a vocabulary of over a dozen words and are supposed to be great with children and good for home security that last was delivered in a less confident tone where um did they have them made miles inquired some bioengineering company on jacksons whole i understood she said of course they were shipped frozen and newegypt was able to save money by reviving them in their own labs but they prove rather tricky to maintain very finicky eaters cat genesmostly said miles she looked rather doubtfully at the minisphinx who stared back sphinxlike i would think so wouldnt you ill tell mr wing you are here lord vorkosigan wing bustled out promptly to greet his selfinvited guests leaving roic in the outer office to chat up the secretary and perhaps exchange riddles with the sphinx miles allowed himself to be ushered into wings inner sanctum by the man himself and settled in a comfy and elegant gelpadded visitors chair nice corner suite windows on two sides overlooking the buildings and serene gardens of the complex miles was weirdly reminded of suzes lair wing took a seat behind his big black glass comconsole desk folding his hands and looking up in wary inquiry you say you have an emergency lord vorkosigan miles picked a sphinx hair off the sleeve of his gray jacket and tried to remember what he was about no id say you do he sat back and scowled wishing his feet touched the floor wing seemed alert but not alarmed how so ive spent a few days poking around northbridge after the conference and after our conference figuring out just what im getting into with my new investment there turns out to be a hitch did you know miles let his scowl go suspicious in hopes of putting wing on the defensive wing merely said hm miles reminded himself to keep in character while he delivered the bad news smart enough to be believed not so smart as to be a threat the structure of my compensation for services to be rendered depends on the value of my whitechrys solstice shares rising not falling if they fall i will be left holding not a profit but a debt they wont fall said wing confidently i beg to differ your parent company here is about to suffer a major financial blow wing did not immediately go on soothing him but said how so you know all those commodified contracts youve bought from newegypt youve been sold a lot of dud dead it turns out that a particular brand of cryofluid on the market between fifty and thirty years ago breaks down after a couple of decades rendering patrons nonrevivable brains turned to slush as my technical consultant so vividly phrased it increasingly any revivals from that period which used that product are likely to fail your patrons kin are owed back millions in nuyen and all those votes wings lips parted in genuine surprise is this true you can check it yourselves as soon as you point your labs in the right direction wing sank back in his chair i certainly shall newegypt is your culprit the commodified contracts scam originated from there as i understand itgenerated by a fellow named anish akabane their chief financial officer wing nodded slowly i know him clever bastard he sounded more admiring than outraged it seems to me you have a clear case against newegypt you and every other cryocorp in northbridge whos been suckered you might even combine forces in a joint suit wing squinted in nodoubtrapid thought only if it could be proved they knew it could be proved they knew at least eighteen months ago you can certainly bring the bandits down wing held up a hand slow down lord vorkosigan i share your outrage but i dont think the course you suggest will work to protect your investment leaving aside the airy nature of miless investment sir this is confidential youve told no one else i started with you id planned to go on down the row of every corp in the cryopolis after im so glad you came to me first you did the right thing so i hope but what do you mean we have to think first of protecting the value of whitechrys and the interests of its shareholders including yourself firstafter checking the facts of coursewe have this clear if obviously limited opportunity to unload our own liabilities it would be the height of irresponsibility not to seize it it would be far better for whitechrys to let this problem come out slowly and naturally from other sources rather than springing it on the public all at once and creating an avoidable crisis im not sure i follow you im afraid i do damn this dog wont fight wing shook his head every other responsible cryocorp operating team would agree with me this isnt something to publicize it could be very damaging not only to whitechrys but to the whole industry even to the economy at large so youre talking not a joint suit but a but a a joint coverup dont sputter miles told himself coverup is too strong a term wing sighed as if in regret though it would certainly be preferable all around but if this problem has come so close to the surface that even an offworlders casual inspection can uncover it its clearly far too late for concealment to be effective the news must be about to break not so casual as all that but miles wasnt about to tell wing the details wing tapped his fingertips on the black glass of his desktop a small headstart for us i think and thenyesi think it would be best for me to go to our competitor colleagues myself considering the aspects of this that threaten us all perhaps in a few weeks ah yes lord vorkosigan your investment will be safe with us just leave it to me he sat back smiling again although gears plainly turned behind his eyes but where in all this do those newegypt bastards get nailed to the wall miles tried to keep his tone plaintive and not outraged have you ever heard the phrase living well is the best revenge where i come from someones head in a bag is generally considered the best revenge well ah hm different cultures and all that well you have delivered me a great deal to do this afternoon none of which was on my previous schedule a broad hint that for miles to decamp and let wing go grapple with his damage control miles could just picture it the corps drawing together not in collision but in collusion youve given me a lot to think about wingsan and the reverse im sure some tea before you go wing was clearly torn between social etiquette and getting on with this new crisis cruelly miles said why yes thus combining living well and revenge he supposed if a petty one they repaired to the outer office where the secretary was already engaged in filling roic with green tea and almond cookies and giving him admiring and grateful glances the sphinx made plaintive noises from behind the bars of a largesphinxcarrier im so glad youre taking her said the secretary with a nod at the cage while pouring for miles and her boss from a delicate porcelain pot shes a very loving creature and quite tame but she just doesnt fit our decor ah said wing brightening have you finally found her a home yuko good work ill be so glad to get that litter box out of the executive washroom miles stared reproachfully at roic were getting a sphinx why or possibly why me god roic looked uncomfortable i said i knew someone whod love t have her ah miles trusted roic had received some value in return information hopefully the secretary seemed a little too old for him but whether her interest in his barrayaran manliness was romantic or maternal hardly mattered as long as it was friendly and forthcoming miles limited his revenge to one cup then let himself be gently ushered out two underlings were produced to cart away the sphinxs food dishes toys extra hats and sanitary arrangements roic lugged the carrier and oversaw it all stuffed into the back of the consulates lift van the sphinxs voice rose in unholy protest as they drove out under the red torii gate once more aowt aowt which way now mlord any other stops notyet i think my brilliant plan for fixing this mess and getting us all on our way back home just tanked tell you all about it on the way back to town yes mlord jin let himself quietly out of the isolation booth where both his mother and mina were napping mina curled on the foot of the bed like a cat his mother looked washedout and pale a little scary but nothing like that other woman milessan and ravensensei had failed to revive jins joy at finding her alive had crashed through him like a great wave but now that the first flush of relief was receding he felt all tumbled and strange everything was uncertain again with the grownups back in charge where would they go to live now what would happen to his creatures would they make him go back to school how soon would he have to be stuck in with kids a year younger than him could it all be taken away again ako keeping watch in the recovery room gave him a friendly nod from her chair jin heard voices out in the corridor and went to see who it was he shut the door behind him to find vorlynkinsan looking startled confronting ravensensei and two new people jins mouth too fell open as he stared at the couple the man was almost another milessansame height same looksexcept twice as wide and with no gray in his hair he wore a sharplycut suit in black on black with more black that somehow made his girth look trim the woman was even taller than jins mother with bright blond hair swept back in a cool knot and eyes almost as blue as consul vorlynkins her suit was more flowing in soft gray with a silky white top and a glint of gold at her throat and ears her outfit reminded jin of milessans shirt simple yet somehow extra extralooking her smile down at him made him feel warm all over jin said consul vorlynkin i was just coming to find you i was about to run back to the consulate for a bit but he stared at the new notmiles mom and mina fell asleep said jin ah good said ravensensei ill just go check on them and have a word with ako and be right with you all he slipped into the recovery room the blond ladys eyes glinted merrily at jin like sunlight off a lake in summer and whos this consul vorlynkin seemed to pull himself together though why the arrival of this pair should have scattered his wits jin was not quite sure well except for the short mans surprising looks this is jin sato hes the son of the woman the lord auditor and dr durona have just revived here lord vorkosigan met him well ill let him tell it when he gets back jin this is lord mark vorkosigan and his partner miss kareen koudelka from barrayar miss koudelka held out a slim hand for jin to shake just as if he were a grownup and the man after a beat followed suit jin wondered if partner meant girlfriend or like coworker the pretty woman seemed like she ought to be a corp executive the expensivelooking bag slung over her shoulder sized for business gear not cosmetics are you milessans brother jin asked like tetsu and ken jin stood he realized eyetoeye with the man just as he did with milessan but somehow the extra bulk made lord mark seem taller and his smile didnt lurk in his eyes the way milessans did twins born six years apart the man said sounding bored and rehearsed its a long story clearly not one he was about to tell jin you dont look umexactly alike said jin lord mark also lacked milessans cane and he seemed to move more fluidly maybe he was the younger brother a distinction i go to some trouble to maintain said lord mark ravensensei let himself back out of the recovery room i think you should meet madame suzuki first lord mark must we deal with her this ted fuwa fellow is the sole ownerofrecord only of the physical plant for our purposes the physical plant iswell not nothing but interchangeable its the human liabilitiesand opportunitiesit contains that made it worth dragging you here for a closer look and madame suze is unquestionably the mistress of that particular court of chaos lord mark gave a short nodlistening not arguing did your brother know you were arriving lord mark asked vorlynkin he hadnt mentioned it to me nor had dr durona his glance under his lashes at ravensensei was not very friendly we caught an earlier ship than expected said miss koudelka i actually havent any interest in impinging on whatever hornets nest miles is presently poking said lord mark we dont normally comment on each others enterprises think of it as the parallelplay stage of siblinghood his partnerlady put in smoothly actually i understand one of the functions of the consulate is to assist barrayaran business people on kibou vorlynkin nodded warily although the auditorial investigation naturally takes precedence just now he added under his breath whatever the hell he thinks hes doing of course miss koudelkas smile grew blinding vorlynkin blinked perhaps mark raven the consul should come along then well only need to explain things once vorlynkin looked nonplussed jin do you mind oh jin is welcome too said ravensensei airily he added aside to miss koudelka native guide and all that she nodded agreeably and favored jin with another sunny look ravensensei led off jin tagging along in silent wonder down and under and through and up to suzesans door lord mark and miss koudelka looked all around as they walked very keenly the blond lady taking vid scans on the way with a tiny handheld at the corner suite ravensensei knocked briskly the door was opened surprisingly soon not by suzesan but by tenburysan whats all this he peered suspiciously through his hedge of hair youve gone and brought new people in without asking asking is just what we came for said ravensensei im glad youre here may we come in and talk to madame suze i suppose tenbury squinted down at lord mark god its another one how many of these sawedoff galactics do you have up your sleeve raven lord marks eyebrows twitched but ravensensei replied soothingly just the two and tenbury gave way suzesan was sitting by her window playing mahjong and drinking something that probably wasnt tea with medtech tanaka tenbury had apparently just risen from the third seat their eyes opened wide at lord marks party now what raven said suzesan i thought id settled with you when do i get my two revivals eh were considering changing the deal said ravensensei suzesans scowl deepened instead of two how would you like two thousand her brows went up though her frown still bent down but she waved a wrinkled hand and the whole mob filed in and pulled up seats around her ravensensei first introduced consul vorlynkin who indeed had been running in and out of her facility for the past several days as she likely knew perfectly well jin cast her a nod trying to say this ones all right tenbury halfsat on the wide windowsill frowning and pulling on his beard ravensensei repeated his introductions madame suzuki may i present my employer lord mark vorkosiganhes also lord auditor miles vorkosigans younger brotherand his partner miss kareen koudelka lord mark is a coowner of the durona group my clinic on escobar whos the other coowner suzesan asked staring hard at lord mark lord mark bowed slightly and said dr lily durona who is also founder and cloneprogenitor of the original durona group of jacksons whole i acquired my interest a decade ago when i helped expedite the groups removal from the ownership of baron fell there and emigration to escobar you a doctor too researcher lord mark shook his head entrepreneur my primary interest in the durona research is to support development of an alternative to the clonebrain transplant method of life extension that will knock it out of business that techniques illegal said medtech tanaka not on jacksons whole unfortunately jin tugged vorlynkins sleeve and whispered what are they talking about he whispered back some bad rich people try to get young again by having their brains transplanted into the bodies of clones purposegrown to match them very dangerous operation and the clones brain always dies eew i agree his brows drew down as he frowned anew at lord mark he made a handdown motion to jin be quiet and listen and set the example lord mark tapped his spread fingers together in a gesture very like one of his brothers and said the durona group is considering expanding its cryorevival services to kiboudaini suzesans lip curled that would be a waste ofoh wait cryorevival you say not cryostorage cryostorage seems to be a fully mature industry here with no room for startups i think there could be far more opportunity in an arena the current cryocorps are neglecting raven tells me you have over two thousand unlicensed illegal cryopatrons stored in your lower levels a liability that has rendered this facility unsalable by its present ownerofrecord one theodore fuwa yah when the idiot bought the place for development he didnt know we were here he tried to get rid of his dilemma by arson once said suzesan anyway its closer to three thousand by now even better and what would you do to get rid of em why revive them and let them walk out on their own suzesan snorted only if youve found a cure for old age a weird little smile turned lord marks lips showing his teeth just so medtech tanakas head came up in a voice of slow wonder she said what have you people got he nodded to her not alas a fountain of youth it may prove to be a fountain of middleage however we dont think itll do much for anyone under sixty but from there up it seems to knock off about twenty years so far not a singlepronged treatmentsort of a cocktail really as it presently standsbut our r amp d group has finished virtual and live mammal trials and were almost ready to move up to clinical trials on humans has it been tried on any humans asked tanakasan just one so far put in ravensensei one trial one human lily durona as it happens said ravensensei you can imagine how riveted the whole group is by the outcome can you guarantee the results of this treatment of course not said lord mark thats why its called a trial but by the time we work through two or three thousand varied test cases all the bugs should be ironed out youll never get permissions said suzesan on the contrary escobar has reciprocal medical licensing arrangements with kiboudaini any facility i might buy here would move under the durona groups regulatory umbrella from the instant the purchase was registered no need to stir things up by reapplying for ah anything lord mark rubbed his double chin if the trials worked out the enterprise might become selfsupporting in as little as two years and after twenty years said tenbury what happens to people can they go around again lord mark shrugged ask me in two decades damn said suzesan this sounds like a license to print money you know that young man lord mark made an impatient throwaway gesture a sideventure from my point of view it will be safer than the clonebrain transplant to be sure but the sort of octogenarian customer who would buy a body of an eighteenyearold is hardly going to prefer a body of sixty we have to do better somehow but this could be another small step in the right direction will it only work on revives frozen folk asked tenbury oh no i expect it will work even better on the neverfrozen suzesans wrinkled lips drew back in a fierce smile who wouldnt choose it over a risky illegal brain transplant hell who wouldnt choose it over freezing people are strange said lord mark i make no predictions medtech tanaka said but what about the poor lord mark gave her a blank look what about em their stares of mutual incomprehension lengthened miss koudelka put in if i may offer an interpretation mark i believe madame suzuki and her friends feel just as strongly about kibous poor being shut out of their chance at the future as you feel about the jacksonian clones being shut out of their chance at a future or they wouldnt have been running this place as a protest for more years than youve been running the durona group she turned to suzesan mark and dr durona for that matter were both raised on jacksons whole where one must hustle constantly to survive and there is seldom margin to think of others theyre both getting over it slowly i suggest we all take the chance to consider the wider aspects of this while we look around mark and i hoped to inspect the place before our first meeting with mr fuwa suzesan sat back looking strange and stern and if not lord mark shrugged then well just have to meet with fuwa without your input suzesans eyes narrowed think you hold all the cards do you miss koudelka said its hardly such a zerosum game a cooperative venture might yield major advantages to all according to their varied needs yes said suzesan slowly i need to think she sat forward and jammed the cork into the top of her square bottle with a hand that shook slightly tenbury take em around let them see whatever they like tenbury nodded and pushed off the wall follow me then folks they all shuffled out after tenbury except for suzesan and the old medtech who bent their heads together before the door even shut out in the corridor jin edged close to consul vorlynkin and whispered up to him what did they mean i didnt understand any of that why was suzesan mad they trailed the group not quite out of earshot vorlynkin rubbed his knuckles across his lips looked down at jin and lowered his voice if lord mark has the money and i gather he does he could buy this facility outright and there would be nothing madame suzuki could do about it he could dowell not anything because hed pick up liability for all those cryocorpses downstairs but in theory he could clear out all the live people here as trespassers and dump them back on the street thats not right said jin indignantly miss koudelka cast him a glance over her shoulder and a funny smile jin blushed furiously im not sure thats quite what he has in mind murmured vorlynkin but i guess well have to see jin frowned trying to sort it all out how come milessan is lord vorkosigan and his brother is lord mark if their last names are both vorkosigan both are the sons of count aral vorkosigan your er friend milessan is lord vorkosigan because he is his fathers heir lord mark as the younger brother has a courtesy title with no direct political duties oh the consul had a very thoughtful look on his face as he followed tenbury and the new barrayarans jacksonians whatever so if lord vorkosigan and lord mark were brothers how come theyd been raised on different planets did all that creepy clone history have anything to do with them and was that fiveyearold boy the one with all the confusing names his own parent couldnt remember lord anything jin thought of milessans story about being allowed to sit in on his fathers conferences if he was quiet and useful so shut his mouth and hurried to keep up two hours later jin was yawning he wondered if milessan had ever fallen asleep at any of those old meetings maybe his dads business whatever it was had been more interesting than this theyd trailed tenburysan all over up and down and through parts of the facility even jin had never seen the talk was all boring grownup stuff about finances and drains and regulations it never did get back to more strange stories about cloning and medical murders tenbury showed off his shop and tools and tricks lord mark taking it all in expressionlessly miss koudelka outright encouraging the custodian to drone on forever with way too many questions jin thought of abandoning them and going back to the recovery room to see if his mom and mina were awake yet he was getting hungry they were crossing the parking garage under the old patient intake building when everyones heads turned at the sound of pounding and muffled yells coming from a door marked no admittance hadnt someone better let that person in or out asked miss koudelka out and no said ravensensei theyre lord vorkosigans prisoners they must have woken up i hadnt wanted to give them too much sedative atop the fastpenta and the stunner hangovers lord mark held up his hands palm out no affair of mine then he didnt sound surprised that his brother went around drugging and detaining people but merely asked when is he thinking of removing them i expect my deal to be moving rather quickly dont know ravensensei shrugged theyre his puzzlepieces as the pounding continued he added all the same ill wait till roic comes back to go in and settle them theyre a nasty pair jin tilted his head and ventured nearer to the door hey thats old yanis voice who said ravensensei and are you sure said tenbury hey yani is that you in there the pounding stopped a quavery voice cried jin is that you unlock the door and let me out where are the two guys jin yelled back i heard someone thumping and carrying on and went to go look yani returned muffled what call they got to go locking people up around here ravensensei threw up his hands and clenched his teeth oh my lord auditor will not love this he bent to the lock lord mark stood back drawing a businesslike stunner from his black jacket miss koudelka didnt get behind him but rather circled to cover another angle hitching her shoulders and flexing her hands and suddenly looking very athletic a tense pause and the door fell open yani stumbled out swearing he looked rumpled and wild with a big bruise on his forehead and dried blood around his nose ravensensei peered within crap gone chapter seventeen as roic drove them into the underground garage miles flinched at the sight of the mob clustered around the open door of the office where theyd left their prisoners his eye skipped to the empty space across the concrete where the captured newegypt van had been parkedand widened when he spotted the sleek blond head bobbing above the dark ones he didnt even need to look down to know who hed see standing level with her shoulder what t hell said roic pulling to a halt whats miss kareen doing here trailing my brother no doubt what i want to know is what the hell mark is doing here they disembarked and miles shouldered swiftly through the gawkers to stare into the barren office but even his best auditorial glare couldnt make hans and oki magically reappear not that he wanted them exactly he turned to sort out tenbury and raven mark and kareen consul vorlynkin jin jittering at his elbow pouring out the escape tale in a rapid high voice and battered old yani looking something between irate and contrite but no worse thank god and by his complaints still oblivious to his close encounter with one of kiboudainis shadier death angels how long ago did this happen miles tried to cut to the essentials very soon after you left at a guess said raven ruefully im afraid i undermedicated sorry miles waved a hand in understanding if not absolution so theyve been gone at least two hours maybe almost three plenty of time to get home or somewhere a tactical tree began to sketch itself in his mind if the pair had bugged out intending only to save themselves they might be anywhere but were unlikely to come back and certainly not with reinforcements the police and their own bosses being equally dangerous to them in such a flight if theyd dutifully returned to newegyptthe possibilities grew more complex i wonder if we passed them on the road too late the two goons had gained a good look at roic might have glimpsed raven had not yet seen the memorable miles but roic was pretty remarkable all on his own and once hed been identified the trace back to miles could be swift if rather baffling from newegypts point of view and newegypt now knew the location of suzes facility and they had to be pretty sure leiber their original target had come here though they couldnt be sure if he was still here had newegypt figured out yet that their employeeformer employee by now no doubthad absconded with satos cryocorpse and if so would they imagine shed been revived already or would they still picture leiber carting her about in a cryochamber like some especially awkward souvenir could they track back to whatever security vids they maintained from the day miles and his strike force had liberated her unfortunate substitute chen and what would they make of it if they did and damn miles muttered i have to talk to that idiot leiber again if he was to secondguess their thinking he wanted more details on those key newegypt execs he sighed and raised his voice and hello mark why are you here and so unexpectedly too mark tilted his head in unapology smirking a bit miles eyed raven i thought wed had an understanding about such surprises looking faintly guilty raven shrugged and mumbled earlier ship miles abandoned the unfruitful point hi kareen she glinted back at him reassuring in a way sort of hi miles hows it going not as well as i thought evidently he peered one last time into the drab little officestill emptyand turned away tenbury bless him was soothing yani and ushering him off to visit medtech tanaka a penetrating yowl rose from the back of the consulate van aowt aowt vorlynkins brows rose have you kidnapped someone else his tone seemed more resigned than disapproving miles thought of those tales about water wearing away stone the consuls edges were growing more rounded at least not this time jin armsman roic has a present for you live cargo really jin was instantly diverted miles jerked his head at roic who led the boy out of earshot to meet his new pet good with kids wings secretary had promised and you trust those people why kareen curious followed roic miles lowered his voice to vorlynkin and raven raven how soon could madame sato be moved out of medical isolation to the consulate said vorlynkin miles nodded if secrecy which was our first defense has failed then the consulate would be a better location for fending off legal attacks granted it hasnt much advantage for illegal physical attacks i have some help on the way for that but theyre not here yet ravens lips pressed together in medical reluctance tomorrow not that her bioisolation isnt compromised already with those kids in and out little vectors that they are well load her up with every immune system booster in your arsenal i already have miles made a thumbsup gesture then plan to decamp as early as possible tomorrow in fact vorlynkin if you could stay here tonight and be ready to move her and her kids out at a moments notice that might be um prudent he added reluctantly leiber too do you think newegypt will react that quickly asked vorlynkin i truly do not know my impression of all these cryocorp chiefs so far is that theyd rather hunker down behind a wall of lawyers than say hire mercs but this crew has already shown it can move fast at need and despite the lethal screwups their actions eighteen months ago must have seemed successful at the time i wish them a distraught and sleepless night figuring it all out anyway vorlynkin frowned taking this in miles turned to his clonebrother and you kareen and i jumped over from escobar to look into a real estate deal raven spotted said mark unperturbed by the foregoing the short version is madame suzes setup could be the perfect venue for largescale human trials of the durona groups latest lifeextension treatment if so i mean to buy the place from the unhappy current ownerofrecord this fellow fuwalock stock and liabilities mark jerked a thumb downward to indicate the frozen sleepers stacked in the hidden corridors below id take it as a personal favor lord auditor brother if you dont mess up my deal miless lips twitched happily vor views on nepotism remain culturally generous even in what our late grandfather would have called this degenerate age but dont mess up my case havent the least interest in your case thanks which is what by the way raven didnt apprise you no hes been virtuously closedmouthed well no one could say that a durona didnt earn his or her pay it all started with an attempt by a kibou cryonics company called whitechrys to expand onto komarr that smells oh youve heard of it not before now but at a glance theres a physical financial and cultural distance that doesnt explain itself marks lips curved slightly and then theres you popping up in the middle of it always a tipoff mm said miles well the whitechrys part is a train that has left its station and can run on rails to its appointed end so far this newegypt involvement is a sideissue that grew complicated his jaw set im trying not to leave undue collateral damage upon a local kid who befriended me at some cost to himself good intentions mark my path is paved with them so glad i dont have any of those marks glance grew uncomfortably shrewd its not your planet you know you cant fix it no butwell no but well try not to leave too much rubble in your wake i can use this place so you said miles hesitated life extension you say does this one look better that the last two durona developments you were so excited about that excuse the expression died on the lab benches maybe the one human trial looks hopeful so far lily durona if you were wondering it was miless turn to raise his brows all right im officially impressed if lily was willing to try it on herself marks smile went a little flat lily he said ran out of time to wait miles drummed his fingers on his trouser seam has it been tried on an older male yet speaking of running out of time miles and his clonebrother exchanged very similar looks mark said do you think he could even be persuaded to try it mm not by me perhaps our mother might give it a go betan you know anything for science thats one more reason im anxious to move these human trials along you might actually be more successful at persuading him if it were still billed as dodgy hit those old vor servicetotheimperium reflexes and all thats so strange miles shrugged thats the countourfather he added so if your deal goes through would you and kareen be spending much time on kibou mark shook his head once its set up and running i figure to turn it over to raven to develop past time he was promoted so far this is not the knockout competition to the clonebrain transplant business i was hoping for but its early days yet mark smiled slowly on the other hand if it proved sufficiently profitable maybe i could hire my own space mercs and attack the jacksonian cloning lords directly miles grimaced do you remember the last time you tried that vividly dont you patchily said miles dryly mark winced in the event though ive no doubt admiral quinn could do the job i would beg you to hire a different outfit just in case this wasnt quite a joke with mark on this subject it could be hard to tell what are you two doing next do you have a hotel no we came straight from the shuttleport next weve made arrangements to meet fuwa here isnt that after local business hours mark shrugged im on system shiptime can i sit in sit in yes mix in no mm said miles but jin roic and kareen returned before he could take exception to this jin was bouncing with pleasure but he paused to stare in the usual amazement at miles and his clonebrother standing toetotoe miles still wished mark hadnt picked weight gain as a way to differentiate himself but marks grim glee at his progenitorbrothers discomfort with the choice was probably just a bonus from his own point of view complicated man mark i want to show my sphinx to mom and mina said jin you mustnt take it into her booth said raven coming alert i know that said jin but i can hold it up to the glass can roicsan help me cart everything roic glanced at the empty office and cast miles a tiny headshake bodyguardconscious again vorlynkin caught it and said smoothly ill give you a hand jin raven added prudently ill come along actually said miles i think leibers still up there well both come tenbury returned then to continue the interrupted tour with no more than an eyebrowtwitch from mark and a farewell smile from kareen the three went off toward another exit miles followed vorlynkin who carried the sphinxcarrier in jins train plaintive cries of aowt hum drifted back through the stale shadows of the underground garage out home you and me both sphinx his mothers reaction to the sphinx was disappointing jin thought but not surprising familiar in fact and comforting thereby jin no she said holding her hand to her lips where would you keep it nefertiti squirmed in a disgruntled fashion under jins arm as he hoisted her up on his hip for his mother to see and attempted to flap her wings but practice handling the fiercer gyre left jin undismayed ill take good care of her dont i always she came with a file of instructions too so nothing can go wrong his mother rubbed her forehead in her bed beyond the glass wall thats not the point this time jin love mina who had been lurking on the foot of the bed all day sat up interested shes huge bigger than lucky and gyre put together she sort of looks like lucky and gyre put together really oh say yes mommy she wriggled down and exited the booth on a slight puff of positive air pressure did tenbury get the intercom working jin asked realizing a bit belatedly that something new had been added when did he come by no it was consul vorlynkin said mina bending to stare into the sphinxs slow blink she has a funny face oh how i found the onswitch said vorlynkin leaning one shoulder against the glass wall and watching all this in some bemusement ravensensei bent to capture minas mask and pop it into the sterilizer box for reuse nefertiti flexed her claws and growled and jin set her down on her four paws where she flapped her wings with a burring noise for all the world like one of the chickens does she fly asked mina holding out a hand for the sphinx to sniff i dont think so said jin her wings are almost the same size as gyres but shes way heavier these custom genetic constructs are usually made to be decorative not functional advised ravensensei depending on what the buyer orders of course mina frowned that seems mean to give her wings she cant fly with jin crouched on his heels and scratched the creatures shoulder blades between the wings which folded tamely again as she stretched into the caress she could not lick her fur like a cat nor preen her feathers like a bird so jin would have a lot of interesting grooming to do according to the care instructions in the file i wonder do they lay eggs or have live babies one at a time or a litter like kittens i wonder if there are any male ones left over and if he could find one somehow there may not have been any males made mused ravensensei i believe sphinxes were traditionally female but these proprietary constructs normally arent given the ability to reproduce youd likely have to clone her and handraise the babies jins imagination took fire home cloning of small animals wasnt that hard if you could get the right equipment from a pet supply place or hobbyist who was upgrading or quitting hardly something to be found in an alley scavenge but there ought to be used stuff for cheap somewhere hum said the sphinx plaintively she talks cried mina her face breaking into a delighted smile they come with about a twentyword vocabulary according to the file said jin i dont know if you can teach them more like a parrot we can try beyond the glass their mother made a noise of hopeless maternal protest much like the halfway point of other such negotiations so jin took heart but this time she said jin we dont even have a home to take her to right now oh no i just thought of that whats happened to our apartment and all my things nobody could have been paying rent for a year and a half with no one living there ohand my bank accountwhat happened to my money after i was frozen if i have no job no money no place for us to live aunt lorna has some of your clothes in boxes in the attic i know mina piped up and she took my stuff and jins she had to sell the big couch and the kitchen table and a couple of the other big things because she didnt have room though consul vorlynkin turned and spoke through the glass earnestly these are all solvable problems madame sato but none of them need be solved today or all at once as part of the lord auditors casea protected witness more or lessyour immediate needs will be covered by our consulate my committee my friendswhats happened to them all beyond the ones you say newegypt murdered or took away what if they her voice shrank to silence your first task must be your own physical recovery ravensensei put in with a look of concern at her sudden distress your normal mental resilience will follow in two to four weeks not two to four daysyou have to give yourself time ive never had enough time she pressed her hands to her temples and that appalling creature vorlynkin cleared his throat im not sure the lord auditor was thinking it through when he accepted the animal nevertheless it may be kept in the consulates back garden with the rest of jins creatures for now theyre doing no harm at all there livens the place up really the space was underutilized she sighed folded her arms halflaughed quelling jins growing alarm i suppose it just looms so absurdly large because its closest but her eyes sought jin and mina not the sphinx since they werent going back to the consulate tonight after all vorlynkin let jin speak on his wristcom with lieutenant johannes and talk him through how to care for his creatures till jin returned tomorrow johannes didnt even sound sarcastic at the added chores so that was all right for now milessan and roic had taken leibersensei off to another room to talk right after theyd come in they returned at length toting unexpectedly a big stack of dinner boxes from ayakos cafe milessan let it be known this bounty was courtesy of miss kareen who had somehow found out where to get it how to have it delivered to the facility and had paid for it all too they all ended up having a sort of picnic in the recovery room ravensensei even took in a box to jins mother so that when he pulled back the curtains after his medical check it was almost as if they were all eating a family meal together again jin thought she looked a bit better after she ate sitting up less wearily and with more color in her face but then ayakos curry was always very good it was funny to watch big roic sitting crosslegged on the floor being instructed on how to use chopsticks by mina milessan handled his pretty well for a galactic he claimed hed practiced on the ship coming here and at other times in the past when he let slip hed been to old earth itself twice mina made him tell stories of his visits though he mainly told her about his second trip his wife and gardens lots of different gardens all he said of his first trip was that it was purely business hed never got out of one city and that it was the first time hed met his brother which last remark seemed very weird to jins ear consul vorlynkin pulled his lip and looked thoughtful at this but he didnt ask any helpful questions and milessan didnt expand with frequent references to the instruction file jin fed tidbits to nefertiti who apparently could eat some kinds of people food but not others at least not without messy digestive consequences unfortunately ako came in just as the sphinx was having an accident in the darkest corner which was jins fault really because he hadnt paid enough attention to her little mutters of poo pee during her restless explorations of the recovery room ako was very upset and made jin clean it up which was fair but then insisted the creature couldnt spend the night in here ravensensei at least seemed undisturbed by biological messes and stayed out of the debate jin finally promised to take nefertiti back to his rooftop hideout for overnight which satisfied ako but then mina wanted to tag along and see the place milessan and roic had gone off by then to meet with lord mark and suzesan so consul vorlynkin after a glance through the glass at jins worriedlooking mother volunteered to go along and help lug the sphinx carrier and make sure that all was well jins mother smiled gratefully at him so jin supposed that was all right too they were filing down the end stairs when they met bhavya one of akos friends panting up jin have you seen ako tanakasan wants her on the second flooran emergency cryoprep some poor old lady collapsed in the cafeteria all in a heap they say shes up in the recovery room with my mom jin pointed back up the stairs ravensenseis there too bhavya nodded and ran on waving thanks without looking back vorlynkin wheeled to stare after her should we go try to help jin shook his head naw this happens all the time well not all the time but every week or so tanakasan knows what to do vorlynkin looked doubtful but followed jin down to the tunnels the layout down here is very confusing he remarked yah the tunnels below are all offset from the buildings above and run underneath the streets too and some go down four levels and some five or six you kind of have to memorize them jin had no trouble finding his own familiar route even when they passed out of range of the lit section and vorlynkin drew a small hand light from his jacket to illuminate the steps mina who had walked on her own thus far took a prudent grip on his wide coat sleeve in the deepening shadows they trudged upward five flights to come out at last from the exchanger tower door onto jins roof vorlynkin wasnt wheezing too badly for a grownup despite carting the carrier jin had lost track of time in the windowless recovery room but it seemed to have grown very late the air was damp and chill lit by diffuse reflections from the street lights in the area that gave everything a funny brown tinge the city noises had quieted down the way they usually only did after midnight but around the side of the tower jin found his tarps were all still up and taut not blown loose by the weather yet his little refuge was littered with a dreary residue of things not taken away the other daynot needed for his creatures or too big and awkward to fit in the lift van or too junky to salvage hed taken his own hand light down off its wire and packed it along so it was now lessthanusefully back at the consulate but vorlynkin amiably shone his around while jin explained his old life up here to mina and mina made admiring and envious noises when they let her out of her carrier nefertiti did not at once take to her new environment she stared around warily crouching then at last went off in a stifflegged reconnoiter jin followed along explaining to vorlynkin about the gruesome fate of the baby chicks who couldnt fly yet i cant tell if she went over the edge if shed just plummet or flutter down like the big chickens or even fly away the dense muscles jin had felt beneath the golden fur didnt help him decide maybe id better tie a line around her leg like milessan hm said vorlynkin so jin explained his first nights safety procedures which just made vorlynkin go hm and set his teeth to his lower lip but from the way his eyes crinkled jin didnt think he was mad or anything jins old bedding of shredded flimsies was still piled against the wall if he slept out here he could keep an eye on his new pet would mom miss him shed have minaor would mina try to stay out here with him jin rose on his toes to make a grab when nefertiti stretched her considerable length put her front paws on the parapet and peered over but she drew back without any effort to launch herself fatally over the side she visited jins latrine corner and used it properlyjin explained about the bucketflushing to vorlynkinand jin made sure to praise her after the confusions about the corner of the recovery room the sphinx did not quite look as if she believed him she stretched and flapped her wings but folded them again when she went to look over the parapet on the opposite side toward the narrow parking lot behind the old complex and stiffened growling staring down with a predatory intensity like lucky regarding the rats back when lucky had been much younger the fur went up in a ridge along her back and her wings spread and quivered making a sinister rustlingrattling noise her tufted tail lashed foes she whined foes what said vorlynkin sounding startled he stepped up to peer along with her jin joined him mina who was not so fond of heights hung back a few paces and asked what does she see jin wasnt sure what kind of night vision the sphinx had but what he saw was a van parked in the shadowiest part of the lot and some darkdressed men moving about below one swung some sort of long hammer or bat three or four dull thumps and jin heard a groundfloor window pop out and fall from its frame inward perhaps onto a carpet he guessed from the muffled clatter somebodys breaking in to the building he whispered back over his shoulder to mina who at this news overcame her nerves and joined him to stare maybe its robbers she whispered back what would anybody want to steal out of here the building had been stripped of usable furniture and equipment long ago anything left inside was valueless or nonportable two of the men lugged a big barrellike thing from the van they did something to it then hoisted it through the window and let it fall and roll a strange pungent aroma seeped up through the night mist which made vorlynkin jerk back and swear not robbers he said through his teeth arsonists he grabbed minas hand and looked frantically around below one of the men threw something through the window and they all ran for their vehicle theyd evidently left a driver waiting because they shot out of the lot past where the chainlink gate had been broken open in a spray of gravel before the van doors were even all the way shut a flash of orange light below jins feet the building quaked as a boom echoed out across the lot and broke into mumbling thunder against the buildings across the street a greasy boil of flame belched from the window a licking tongue two meters long fire screamed the sphinx all her fur on end and her eyes like gilded saucers fire foes fire we have to get out of this building right now said vorlynkin mina yelped as his hand tightened on hers vorlynkin lurched toward the towers which stairs are farther from the fire not that way said jin theres an outside ladder drops down to the alley on the other side vorlynkin nodded and ran jerking mina along with him jin grabbed up nefertiti and ran after him the sphinx struggled and hissed in his arms was there time to stuff her back into her carrier maybe not vorlynkin reached the opposite edge of the roof and found the steel staples i have to go first to let down the extension jin yelled to vorlynkin mina next said vorlynkin i cant reach that far mina sounded like she wanted to cry ill lower you over and hold you till you get your grip said vorlynkin go jin wholl carry nefertiti vorlynkin choked back something short and said i will jin dropped nefertiti hoping she wouldnt bolt away vaulted over the parapet and slapped down the rungs faster than hed ever gone in his life unlatched the ladder thumped at it prayed it wouldnt stick or hang up it rattled then reached its full extension with a clang all right he called up minas kicking legs dangled over his head then she found her footing and started down with no more than one scared meep the rungs really were too far apart for her to reach comfortably above jin heard vorlynkin swearing and the scrunch of his footsteps and the sphinx screaming fire foes fire and apparently confused in her vocabulary by the commotion food vorlynkin yelped in pain seemingly from some greater distance and swore some more jin reached the ground and stretched up to catch mina whose sport shoes wavered in the air when she ran out of rungs before she ran out of space youre all right just let go she fell into him knocking him to the ground they both rolled then scrambled to their feet and stared upward at that point jin found out how well sphinxes could fly when nefertiti sailed over the parapet wings flapping madly and descended she neither plummeted nor soared but she did land rightsideup on all four paws like a cat hard enough to grunt when her belly hit the ground but not hard enough to break anything vorlynkins big dark shape finally swung out over the edge he dropped the last two meters hit with knees bending like the sphinxs staggered but didnt fall blood was running down his face from a deep triple scratch below his left eye jin vorlynkins voice was sharp and hard brooking no debate take mina straight to your mother and do what dr durona tells you to if this fire spreads they may have to evacuate all the buildings in the complex he raised his wristcom to his lips and began snapping connectcodes into it jin dove for nefertiti who flapped away screeching leave the bloody animal vorlynkin snarled over his shoulder already starting away down the alley both of you run chapter eighteen ted fuwa the old cryofacilitys putative owner turned out to be more or less what miles had expecteda big harried man in his late forties who looked as if hed be more at home on a construction site than in a conference chamber even one so strange as madame suzes quarters at midnight a lessexpected presence was the consulates local lawyer an alert composed compact woman with wiry saltandpepper hair who stood barely taller than miles himself kareen miles was unsurprised to learn had persuaded her to come here after hours madame xia stared back at him with at least as much covert interest as the source of the increasingly bizarre stream of legal questions shed been fielding for the past week or so from her formerly staid and routine client miles trusted she was having her accumulated curiosity satisfied tonight miles missed vorlynkin told off to stay with sato and her children and suze wasnt happy that tanaka had been called away to deal with some medical crisis so he supposed the shifting sides however you counted them were still evenly matched suze and tenbury versus mark and kareen miles as unruly witness with roic his silent partner the attorney throwing in comments and questions now and then that gave everyone pause and fuwa versus everyone although miles wasted little sympathy on him madame suze folded her arms and stared hard at mark you still have given me no guarantees whatsoever about future provisions for the poor im not running a charity you know mark returned irritably i am snapped suze yes but for how much longer asked mark sooner or later and more sooner than later i think it would be your turn to go downstairs and you would lose control of this place in any case tenbury and tanaka might hold things together for a while but after thatwhat its what i was waiting for put in fuwa a bit mournfully suze shot him a scornful look and sat up straighter in her big chair as if to imply hed be waiting for a while yet miles was less sure suzes skin bore more than a little of that pallid slackness that was the harbinger of decline one couldnt say she glowed with health not even in her irate stress if the durona group doesnt step in said mark the inevitable end game is that this place will go to the city or the prefecture or to fuwa and in either case patron intake stops the life of one person isnt long enough to see this venture out although that might change in the future kareen observed or cryofreezing will become obsolete technology and this whole demographic mess kibou has created for itself will be naturally swept away said mark im not so sure of that said miles thoughtfully if people start getting frozen at eight hundred instead of eighty the game will still go on just set to a new equilibrium although at eight hundred its hard to guess how people will think at twenty i could not have imagined myself at almostforty i cant imagine eighty even now suze snorted mark shrugged that will be for them to decide however many decades or centuries from now i expect death will still be cheap and always available doesnt take high tech during the initial transition period kareen said wrenching things back from this flight of speculation to the practical present treatment actually will be free if the subject is willing to sign up for the experimental protocols and give the legal releases and anyone coming in can give their own permissions not needing this implied any cooperation from madame suze and company i expect the group will prefer to have a few more healthy live subjects to start on before tackling the more difficult complications from death trauma and cryorevival although theyll certainly want data on those as well suze growled tenbury scratched his beard kareen regarded her fingernails looked up smiled miles wasnt sure if anyone else caught marks small gesture two fingers held out and then curled once more atop his stomach the pair had the goodcopbadcop routine down to an art miles thought with admiration and it would be a naive observer who concluded that all the badcop ideas came from markor the goodcop ones from his partner for that matter kareen continued serenely the durona group will be doing a lot of local hiring if this goes through for example if you madame suzuki were to sign up for the first round of protocols and they proved to work as well as we hope the position of director of community relations could be made open for you which would put you in place to work on these problems on an ongoing basis right from here this is all too complex to be solved in a night but that doesnt mean its too complex to be solved ever buy me off with an empty title oh as if i havent seen how that works before what you make of it could be largely up to you said mark sounding as if he didnt care one way or another but in three years when all those chambers below stairs are emptied out it may be a whole new situation here employment would keep you in the center of things with real input it wasnt the future suze had set her mind to miles fancied he could hear her imagination creaking with the strain of change like a gate almost rusted shut almost she said querulously what about the rest of us tenbury id hire tonight said mark readily well be wanting a director of physical plant first thingthe place certainly needs significant upgrades and repairs starting from the laboratory core outward well likelyhe flicked a glance at fuwaneed a local contractor medtech tanaka as well raven vouches for her the rest on a casebycase basis i do require competence certification can be arranged suze glowered in suspicion tenbury raised his hairy eyebrows the lawyer madame xia put in smoothly by the tacit contracts argument ms suzuki is the tacit proxy holder for all who have been frozen here and can give blanket protocol permissions for all who entered here under her care i believe i can make this argument work for the city adjudicator since the city doesnt want the liability for several thousand destitute cryocorpses not even if the city could register their votes asked miles seems to me that would be enough to swing a city election if not one on the prefecture or planetary level i think i could guaranteeor at least plausibly suggestexpensive legal challenges about that which the adjudicator would not relish the lawyer smiled quietly unless disunity among the petitioners forces the matter to go before a judge in which case i cannot guarantee the outcome because at that point the issues will become public and political i actually spend most of my working time keeping my clients out of court public and political sounds like a job for madame satos group or something like it miles said i regret that we didnt snatch the other two members of her committee while we were at it wed have them now although an attempt to carry off three cryocorpses from newegypts coffers would certainly have taken more time and might have gone less luckily client confidentiality has certain limits lord vorkosigan xia warned him kindly he thought diplomatic immunity works for you not for me but in this event with criminal charges certainly coming down on newegypt there may be legal ways to wrench mr kang and ms khosla away from their captors subpoena them as witnesses for starters miles tilted his head in appreciation if one could keep them from being destroyed by newegypt en route that would be an important consideration in designing the approach yes mark pointed kareen put her on retainer xia smiled warily my plate at work is actually rather full i was only able to come here tonight because its after hours partner or employee me im one of three associates in the galactic business law department of my firm we work under a partner the durona group will certainly be needing fulltime local legal advice murmured kareen perhaps we should talk instead about salarylater xia waved this away provisionally in any case ms suzuki id invite you to think about what is the better longterm practical result for your patrons you serve one community this technology has the potential to serve the planet if the an echoing boom from outside rattled the windows roic shot to his feet and peered into the night what t hell that sounded awfully close said xia uneasily was that us said madame suze tenbury could be the plastics fabricator next door said fuwa joining roic though i cant think what theyd be doing over there at this hour or something from the streetcollision but with the municipal traffic control net here collisions were vanishingly rare miles had thought its hard to tell the direction said tenbury craning his neck as well go up on the roof and look directed madame suze tenbury was halfway out the door when miless wristcom chimed emergency secured channel vorlynkin not good miles found himself on his feet without remembering standing up vorkosigan here lord auditor vorlynkin sounded winded an arson teami counted four menjust put a fire bomb through a groundfloor window of the heat exchanger building asterzine i thinkit was a twopart liquid firestarter anyway call the local fire guards already did sir the cadence of vorlynkins language was reverting to old military training miles noted in passing police too they should be here in moments good man im looking now to see if there are more intruders havent spotted any so far im fairly sure theres no one left in the exchanger buildingcant speak to under it keep this channel open right sir miles wheeled to find everyone staring at fuwa who stared back in horror it wasnt me the contractor practically wailed not this time why would it be me now im about to get rid of this mess my exchanger towers cried tenbury starting for the door again if they go down everyonell start to thaw suze grabbed his sleeve my exchanger towers cried fuwa my facility tenbury madame suze shook the custodians arm for emphasis tell everyone you see get out of the buildings and assemble on that patch of open ground in front of the intake building ill wake up and warn everyone on this floor the front of the patron intake building was on the opposite side of the fourbuilding complex from the firesofar a map of the layout burning so to speak in miless minds eye so the arson had occurred as far as possible from the intake building and the people now in it this stank of diversion should we go to vorlynkin asked roic jittering like a horse at the start of a race no to leiber anything interesting will turn up at leiber roics eyes widened as he took in the implications miles didnt have to spell them out ah suze well go warn them in the intake building miles added madame suze already short of breath and with her hand pressed to her heart nodded and said i know vristi tanaka is on the second floor i think she just started a cryoprep well get the word to her as well as to our people she waved thanks and tottered out xia going with her in support and asking shrewd questions about where else all the sleeping residents were to be found at this hour tenbury sprinted ahead of them miles and roic followed turning in the opposite direction for the nearest stairs through the office doors miles glimpsed mark and kareen braking fuwa one at each elbow providing a combined resistance that plainly surprised the big man as he was yanked backward almost off his feet fuwasan mark began in his most urbane voice lets talk fire sale jin staggered up the last flight of stairs puffing lugging nefertiti for no discernable reason shed shied and bolted back past him in the alley below the exchanger building as vorlynkin had disappeared around the corner and jin had caught her on a lucky tackle well it had seemed lucky at the time the sphinx seemed to have at least doubled in weight since then she growled continuously and shed fur and feathers on his shirt but didnt try to scratch him get the door jin wheezed and mina nodded and swung it wide it was labeled on this side fire door do not block so did that mean it would stop a fire jin hoped they werent about to find out nefertiti wriggled some more and finally lunged from jins sweaty failing grip just as they made it down the corridor to the recovery room so jin was at least able to spill her into this more confined area leibersensei who was slumped in a battered folding chair staring anxiously into space jerked upright at their entry i thought you went to get rid of that thing he said eyeing the sphinx with disfavor his mother sat up in her bed jin mina whats going on it was ninjas mommy mina declared breathlessly we saw them they set fire to jins hideout what it was not either ninjas said jin impatiently it was just some stupid guys dressed in black stuff was that anything to do with the strange thump we heard through the walls a few minutes ago asked his mother jin nodded it was even louder close up consul vorlynkin said it was some kind of liquid firestarter his mother gasped how close were you we were on top of the roof looking right down at them said mina the fireball was all orange and black leibersensei stood up and gripped the back of his chair looking very uneasy wheres ravensensei said jin vorlynkin said we were supposed to tell him about the fire and then do what he said he went down to the second floor to help medtech tanaka with a cryoprep said leibersensei jins mother slid out of bed and came to the wall of her booth standing with her hands pressed against the glass jin maybe youd better run downstairs and tell them whats going on was the fire spreading very fast we couldnt tell yet maybe id better find a room with a window and look said leibersensei wheres stefin gone asked their mother he was supposed to look after you two i think he went to look for more ninjas said mina she touched her hand to her lips isnt that the sort of thing that armsman roic fellow is supposed to do hes probably with milessan jin called over his shoulder heading toward the door again mina dont let nefertiti get out leibersensei followed close on jins heels and then cringed backward as the door was kicked open from the corridor side mina shrieked so did nefertiti foes foes she screamed flapping madly around the room and up onto a table oh nefertiti youre so right thought jin backing up as chief hans and sergeant oki shouldered into the recovery room the pair seemed out of breath and angry and much much bigger when looming vertically than when theyd been laid out on the floor of the garage office drooling as they snored theyd changed their clothes from the rumpled blue medical smocks theyd worn earlier and were now dressed in uniformlike gray trousers and heavy cloth jackets with equipment belts and big clumping boots but without any insignia or name tags or identifying markers there you are you stupid turd finally growled tall hans to leibersensei whod backed up against a table and turned pale what the hell said broad oki staring around at their audience what are these kids doing here that jerk akabane didnt say anything about kids never mind just grab him oki strode forward and did so yanking leibersensei around doing something with the policemans baton he carried in his hand and hauling the scientists arm up behind his back leibersensei yelped let him go cried their mother through the glass hanss head turned and his eyes narrowed ill say what the hell its that bitch sato they must have woken her up isnt this the jackpot grab her too oki youll have to my hands are full snapped his companion leibersensei tried to resist by going limp and almost succeeded in slithering out of his captors grip but oki jerked him upright once more freed the hand with the baton and slapped it with a loud electric pop against leibersenseis thigh leibersensei yelled really loud with a surprised gasp oki flinched and almost let him go as the electric jolt evidently traveled through his victims body and bit his gripping hand but he renewed his clutch before the shuddering scientist could escape it hans strode toward the booth and hit the lock control the door slid back and air puffed out no said jin panicking so much that his vision blurred shes not supposed to come out yet shell get sick shes going to be a lot sicker when akabane gets done with her hans snarled he lunged for their mother who hopped up and across the bed and almost made it around the end to the door and freedom before he lunged again caught her by the arm and swung her against the glass wall with a sickening thud he manhandled her out of the booth stumbling her long hair tumbling down all over no you cant have my mommy screamed mina we just got her back she grabbed the folding chair flopped it shut and swung it as hard as she could she might have been trying to hit the security chief in the stomach but mina was pretty short and her aim was rather blind as she whirled around instead the chair legs took him square in the crotchbut not quite hard enough he bent over saying really horrible words but didnt let go of their mothers arm with his other fist he backhanded mina who fell on her butt crying their mother tried to kick him more accurately than mina had but she was barefooted and frighteningly breathless how dareyou touchmy children youhorrible murderer remembering the blood running down vorlynkins face jin dodged around the table where nefertiti stood stifflegged wings flapping fur on end in a dark ridge running down her back tail lashing and shrieking incoherently he grabbed her up and flung her at oki who was closest the wide man yelled waving his snapping and popping stick but only connecting with wing feathers which scorched with a dreadful stink nefertiti leaped off him shredding his jacket but only getting in one shallow bleeding scratch on his thick neck leibersensei broke from his grip though the scientist lurched and limped dodging out of the way of the swinging baton oh for gods sake said hans akabane didnt say wed have to capture a damned tribe as jin made a headdown rush with some wild idea of headbutting him in the stomach hans shoved their mother away hard so she fell and skidded on the floor next to mina who scrambled to reach her the tall man grabbed for jin instead catching him by the hair and swinging him around jin yelled tears of pain starting in his eyes he heard a strange snick by his ear and looked down crosseyed to glimpse a steel blade at least fifteen centimeters long glint past his face and lodge below his upraised chin everybody freeze bellowed chief hans everybody did hans added impatiently not you oki hans no hes just a kid after the day weve had dont push me the belief and terror in okis face convinced the others that this was no bluff as nothing else could have jin thought he could feel the edge pressing into his skin and strands of hair popping from his stretched scalp all right said hans the big chest against which jin was now pressed heaved for air and maybe for balance could the big man actually be frightened too that was a weird thought and not reassuring behave all of you or ill cut the damn kids throat got it you quit wriggling he shook jins head back and forth by the hair jins mother still on the floor glared up cold and furious but said in a voice sharp with dread jin hold still jin could see leibersensei swallow the limping sphinx had taken refuge in the shadows under a table where she crouched and mumbled piteously foes foes hurts aowt hum hurts that and people breathing were the only sounds in the windowless room hans straightened thats better now you kid stuff your hands in your pockets jin after a glance at his mother complied you sato stand up you too doctor and put your hands on top your head sato take the minibitch by the hand with your right hand now youre all going to march out in file and oki with his stick will keep you all in line set it on high oki the broad man gulped nodded fiddled with the control in the base of the handle now you all follow oki out the door and turn right sato first leiber next then me their mother her face utterly still and intent grasped minas hand convulsively they both stood up together her bare feet moved soundlessly on the floor her padded robe flapping around her calves mina sniffling and scared trotted alongside leibersensei would have looked silly with his arms up like that as if he were playing some toddlers rhyming game about touching your nose and ears and head if he werent so grim and pale and shivering jin waited for the grip on his hair to slacken the knife edge to press less deeply so that he could twist away and run but the big fists holding him didnt ease they followed the others out into the corridor jins feet barely touching the floor as he was yanked along and turned right they took maybe three steps toward the end stairs a bellow from behind them armsman roics deep voice halt chief hans whirled still holding jin in front of him up the corridor from the other endstairs strode roicsan with milessan running at his elbow and ravensensei sort of dodging behind him roic raised his right arm something in his fist too blurred for jins painteared eyes to make out his expression was very strange cool and remote like no expression at all jin felt his captor flinch the knife edge bit harder hans yelled back you again drop that damned stuh a white light flared from roicsans hand and a strange buzzing noise the world or maybe it was jins head seemed to explode in a jagged shower of colored rain the rain turned black and drowned him deep chapter nineteen to roics surprise he was actually aided in his capture of the remaining newegypt security fellow by dr leiber oki had grabbed the scientist when roic had shouted presumably to keep him from bolting but then found him harder to get rid of leiber hung on to the thick left arm that was trying to shake him off turning and twisting and evading what looked to be a heavyduty shock stick just long enough for roic to close the distance and aim his stunner between okis eyes at pointblank range give it up oki roic advised genially its been over ever since i sent your confessions off in a bottle id have thought you people would have realized that caught and nailed by roics steady and implacable gaze as much as by the weapon aimed at his head oki reluctantly held his right arm wide and released his shock stick which fell with a clatter as he slumped leiber stood away from him wheezing but with his spine actually straight for a change unasked oki folded his hands atop his head and stood looking downright miserable madame sato distraught slid to the floor to gather up her sons limp body the unconscious boy was pale but roic saw with satisfaction that the cut on his neck was a mere shallow scratch barely bleeding im sorry jin was caught in my stunner nimbus maam roic said to her but ive found its usually better to resolve these hostage situations as directly as i can bad to let them spin out this is a nightmare she groaned roic granted this with a nod but said cut short now maam raven will get jin some synergine right awayroic rolled his eye compellingly at ravenand he wont even wake up with a headache raven took the hint and scurried back to the recovery room for suitable supplies mlord strolled up possessed himself of the shock stick and regarded their captive with a curious and thoughtful air like a biologist planning out the dissection of a promising new specimen oki regarded him back bewildered who the hell are you people anyway from your point of view said mlord i suppose were your karma delivery service why the devil didnt you and your buddy hans run and keep on running when you had the chance earlier today yesterday by now i guess why ever did you go back to your bosses we got families you know mlords brows rose had this not occurred to him before now roic wondered if you didnt want to be a disgrace to them youre about eighteen months too late i think oki rocked a bit that and the money mlord brows went up a bit further oki said defensively for the first time in my life the money was good we bought a house okis was not exactly a world of riotous living roic suspected if newegypts plant security hiring practices were any good hed probably been an honest man before hed been sucked down into this bog by his bosses roic glanced at mlord prepared to give a hint and a nudge but mlord was on it already its not too late even now to limit your damages whats the local equivalent of turning emperors witness around here does anyone know they must have one prefectures evidence i believe mlord said roic i happen to have a good lawyer on retainer who can advise you if you cooperate with me in a timely fashion mlord told their captive that means instantly roic took the cue and a tighter grip on his stunner staring along its length into okis eyes for emphasis where were you taking leiber and sato just now asked mlord not for a walk presumably akabanes waiting for us out front in the street with the van mumbled oki the newegypt finance chief alone oki wet his lips it was just supposed to be leiber see mlords eyes lit that one we want roicin flagrante delicto and arrested on the premises if possible an enemys mistake is a tactical gift that must never be wasted oki added unasked it was going to be walltowall lawyers for thempresident kim and choi who runs operations and napak that research head akabane caught us after the big meetingsaid it was plain that him and us were going to be the goats that the other three would hand us over without a blink in the morning if nothing was done but he knew from the last time that my brotherinlaw was with the legacy liberators and division and panic ah said mlord sounding quite satisfied that explains much hurry roic akabanes bound to bolt as soon as the police show up in force raven was returning with a medkit roic passed his stunner briefly to mlord circled oki and fastened his wrists behind his back with his own tanglecuffs was blandly handed back his weapon grabbed leibers arm and jogged for the end stairs what do you want me for asked leiber sounding a touch alarmed as they scuffed rapidly down the steps you can id akabane for me i wouldnt want to stun the wrong fellow after all youre pretty free with that thing its all right i have a license to stun i thought that was supposed to be a license to kill roic grimaced that too but you would not believe all the forms that have to be filled out afterward leiber looked as if he werent sure if that was a joke or not which was all right since roic wasnt sure either the procedures hadnt been all that amusing at the time or in retrospect they pushed through the heavy metal doors at the intake buildings far end turned left and rounded the corner onto its long front side a short ushaped driveway in the center led to a covered entry space where patients and visitors had once been dropped off no doubt the drive embraced what had likely been a sweep of tidy lawn and landscaping but now was a sad stretch of weeds there was no security lighting but a lot of flickering hand lights revealed a herd of elderly people in all sorts of dress and undress milling about on the drive and the exlawn to roics relief no orange fireglow reflected in the night mist from the other side of the complex but various colors of flashing emergency lights did which helped illuminate the scene in a danceparty sort of fashion a double row of parking spaces ran the length of the facilitys frontroic could see the end of the administration building beyond the intake building and mentally located madame suzes corner office on its top floor beyond the parking row the facility was bounded by the dilapidated chain link fence in the street beyond only one or two dark and distant vehicles were parked but just past the gate with its tumbleddown old security kiosk a familiar van lurked in the shadows the gate interestingly had been forced open and left standing wide all right said roic waitll i take cover behind that gate kiosk then go out to the end of the lawn and mill around like the others make sure you can be seen from the street but dont get within arms length of the drive wait what you want to use me as bait said lieber indignant i thought you wanted me to identify akabane thisll do that said roic reasonably nobody else here is going to go grabbing for you plus it will lure him out of his vehicle and onto the grounds i hope why bother first i cant stun him through the side of the van and second if nothing else lord mark can charge him with trespassing which will hold him for the night and by morning itll be too late i thought that fellow fuwa owned the place if lord mark doesnt own it by now i dont know him not that anyone did really know him not even mlord well maybe miss kareen go on roic gave lieber a little encouraging shove then drifted away unobtrusively through the intermittent shadows to take cover on the facility side of the gate kiosk out of sight of the street leiber stumbled around quite convincingly among the weeds albeit at a few meters farther range than roic would have preferred looking up and around as if in bewilderment showing profile and fullface for a minute roic wasnt sure if akabane would rise to his bait and was just trying to think of a next ploy when the van eased past the kiosk roic crouched down in the shadows for a horrible instant he wondered if hed misjudged the situationif akabane just lifted the van to headheight and brought it down hard enough atop his victim leiber would be in no shape to confess anything to anyone again someone had tried to do that to mlord once as hed told the story to roic with several passes like a big stomping boot coming within centimeters of reducing him to a smear on the pavement roic tensed like a runner at the start of a race getting ready to sprint to his baits rescue but maybe these local vehicles had safety sensors to prevent those sorts of accidents or maybe akabane was inhibited by the hundred or so witnesses in any case as its side door slid open the van merely lurched up onto the lawn cutting leiber off from the sight of the old folks who were mostly turned away craning their necks toward the source of the flashing lights a dark shape leaped from the van toward leiber who recoiled roic took a sweeping knee shot and brought the figure down in a muffled cry of astonishment and rage a few swift paces and roic was in position to put his favorite lowstun immobilization into the back of the fellows neck at cantmiss range quick help me toss him back into his van roic told leiber who puffing nodded and complied chief financial officer akabane proved a locallooking sorthe might have been ravens middleaged wicked uncle if the durona clone had owned any uncles of any description although akabane did not look especially wicked at this point just pale and limp and roic hoped defeated for all the days mlord had been playing against the newegypt cabal this was the first direct view roic had gained of the enemys face except for a few vid scans it had all been action at a distance like a space war or perhaps some bizarre mutant form of chess where the rules changed every two moves mlords formidable father whod once been a space admiral might have felt at home and mlord had scarcely been given pause but to roic it felt strange and bloodless and removed though he was very grateful for the bloodless part and then roic wondered how mlords sudden trail of chaos through their affairs erupting out of seemingnowhere must have felt to the confused cryocorp men whod thought theyd had it all locked down that was a vision to make a fellow smile though it was a smile that made leiber draw back in unease from the corner of his eye roic saw the lights of emergency vehicles turning into the street theyd be through the gate in seconds melt into the crowd and meet me back at the end door he told leiber and swiftly followed his own advice melting into this crowd proved a bit of a trick as he was a head taller as well as about a century younger than anyone else around him but there was plenty enough else going on right now that no one spared him much attention leiber arrived a few paces behind him thats it he asked roic nodded mlord will arrange the rest stunner tags over roic took a moments modest satisfaction in his job performance its all words from here on which are not my department he added after a reflective pause thankfully jin blinked open his eyes to discover himself staring at a ceilingof the recovery room he realized after turning his head he touched his face which was tingling and scrunched his eyelids open and shut a few times but he didnt feel especially sick or dizzy he didnt feel especially good either sort of blah really he seemed to be lying on one of the rooms several raised narrow bedtables though it didnt have any sheets and its brittle old plastic felt nasty on his skin jin are you all right he sat up on one elbow to find his mother leaning over the side of the bedtable she was wearing her filtering mask again her robe all belted up tight and her eyes searched him anxiously i guess so he rubbed his face some more then scrubbed his scalp where it still hurt from the hairpulling mina skipped to their mothers side and looked up at him with great interest armsman roic shot you id never seen anyone get shot for real before neither had jin it felt very strange to have been shot for the first time he wondered what it had really been like for milessan when hed been shot with that needlegrenade of course that was nothing like being merely stunned jin supposed but that weird moment of looking into armsman roics unyielding face and feeling so helpless and too late and that his world was being taken away from him by people he didnt couldnt control he scowled not liking that feeling much its not broken came ravensenseis voice and you couldnt prove it by me vorlynkins voice returned jin twisted around to find the pair of them at the next table over vorlynkin was sitting up with his legs dangling his widesleeved coat was off tossed aside along with his undercoat and his shirtsleeves were rolled up ravensensei stood in front of him poking at his left arm which vorlynkin was holding rather defensively vorlynkins face was all washed and nefertitis claw marks were now three thin red lines beneath a shiny layer of transparent plastic bandage there was a lot of drying blood soaked on his shirt collar though and spattered elsewhere on his clothes and jin cringed in guilt for his new pet you will have some magnificent bruises ravensensei continued a crowbar will do that im lucky i didnt get my face bashed in vorlynkinsan found more ninjas mina confided to jin they had a fight vorlynkinsan won vorlynkin looked over and smiled rather ruefully at her fortunately for me not ninjas they were just a couple of borrowed thugs from the local chapter of the nhll finally trying to carry out their slogan i suppose i thought they were all arrested after the conference kidnappings said ravensensei that was an especially radical splinter group apparently their organization is not very unified at the best of times i gather vorlynkin added to jin i found the pair of them around the far end of the next building over from your hideout trying to pry the door open and get down into the tunnels with more firestarter if theyd succeeded it would have been a major mess ravensenseis eyebrows lifted would the arsonists even have gotten themselves out alive hard to say it seems awfully easy to get turned around down there but the department was able to get the fire in the exchanger building under control quickly once id told them it was asterzine ugly product asterzine you dont want to put water on it and it would have been a horrible surprise for the firefighters if they had you can believe theyll be going after the nhll in the morning jins brow wrinkled why a crowbar the door around the next side after that is always left unlocked vorlynkin blinked then laughed then winced touching his scratched face just as well that none of us knew that i suppose after i confiscated the crowbar i was able to hold them till the police arrived some of the firemen were more than eager to help the pair fingered the newegypt security guards as having engaged them evidently just to create a diversion for dr leibers rekidnapping though i gather that some of the liberators grew overeager and exceeded their instructions but it should lead back nicely to the senior men lord auditor vorkosigan wished to target their mother rubbed her forehead frownlines deepening around her eyes if they dont manage to suppress it all again not this time i suspect said vorlynkin smiling at her in reassurance wheres nefertiti asked jin in sudden alarm mina pointed at the desk built into the far wall along with a lot of cupboards from the shadows beneath came a mumbling sort of growl shes hiding maybe you can get her to come out after she calms down i tried some food but i dont think shes hungry right now ravensensei stepped around the tables to smile at jin peer into his eyes thumb back his eyelids and feel his pulse headache nausea not really jin felt down his tingling face to find a strip of plastic bandage across his neck just a nick ravensensei assured him my face is a little numb thats normal itll pass in another hour if it doesnt let me know ravensensei paused and cleared his throat lord vorkosigan said to tell you when you woke up those few minutes of delay you and mina caused with those newegypt thugs made all the difference to us the rescue party as it turned out oh said mina sounding pleased ravensensei nodded if theyd hustled you out of the building before we arrived he said it would have been a long stern chaseone of his military turns of phrase thatmeaning wed have had a hell of a time catching up with you although i imagine he would have somehow he ahtends to be persistent for the first time jin sat all the way up in the glass booth next to his mothers the two big newegypt guys were penned and jin flinched in fear till he saw that hans was still out cold on the floor and oki was sitting with his hands fastened behind his back and his shoulders slumped not paying attention to anything jin pictured itall of them dragged away in some windowless van to whoknewwhere and mom taken away again he gulped which made the bandage tug on his skin his desperate struggle with those big men hadnt seemed to do much good at the time had seemed utterly futile in fact but maybe milessan himself blew in then his step brisk with armsman roic in tow oki still didnt look up and jin was reminded that you couldnt hear anything in those booths ah said roic smiling at jin and giving him a friendly wave youre awake good jin scowled back not quite able to get that new picture out of his minds eye of roic looking through him like he wasnt there while he aimed the stunner roics face fell a little though he then tried his smile on mina to better effect was it all a fake that smile which was the real roic the big smiling man or that cold intent scary one youre all here excellent said milessan to the room at large he hopped up on a chair like a teacher about to give a lecture commanding everyones attention and making himself quite as tall as roic it should have looked silly and jin wasnt sure why it didnt the northbridge police will be here in minutes to start recording statements and to take delivery of our newegypt guests milessan went on with a wave at the jailbooth we should be getting a couple of sleepy lawyers by then too madame xia has categorically insisted she has no expertise in criminal law but weve woken up a couple of associates from her firms criminal department well have the senior partner in later today when were all back at the consulate and have rested up a bit jins mother stiffened we never had good luck with lawyers before this time theyll be on your side milessan promised meanwhile raven dr leiber consul vorlynkin we have just time to get our stories straight ravensensei looked interested leibersensei alarmed and consul vorlynkin resigned milessan went on this whole chain of events is too complex and interlocking to adjust much but on the whole id prefer to be less prominent in it for reasons having to do with the other half of my investigations on kibou which do not concern and should not impinge on your affairs madame sato so dont be alarmed fortunately raven and dr leiber here are well positioned to be the local heroes ravensenseis brows rose leibers stare at milessan grew glumly suspicious short version is when raven and i visited you that first day dr leiber it was because raven was headhunting a top cryopreservatives chemist for the durona groups proposed new expansion to this northbridge facility which is a position you will in fact be offered by the way assuming we can keep you out of jail oh said leibersensei sitting up his sudden smile surprised but gratified at that time dr leiber explained his renewed plans to blow the whistle on newegypt for the decomposed cryosolution and commodified contracts scandal and that he had abstracted madame satos cryocorpse to assure her safety as a future witness seizing his opportunity he engaged dr durona to revive her as part of his price for employment and dr durona anxious to secure his services agreed and carried her stolen cryochamber off to my secret laboratory on the spot inquired ravensensei a bit dryly precisely milessan smiled cheerfully at him though lets not use the term stolen in your statements should the issue arise rescued would be all right or secured ravensensei waved assent and then what dr leibers attempt to leave kibou for escobar was a feint to draw newegypt off and out till madame sato was revived and ready to testify unfortunately it worked a little too well but his rescue by roic at ravens request was allowed by me as a nepotistic favor to my brothers company i was along for the ride tonight merely to keep an eye on mark whose movements are of ongoing interest to barrayaran imperial security for purely barrayaran political reasons which also happens to be true by the way having concluded that there is no current threat to the imperium from marks new enterprise i shall be withdrawing from kiboudaini shortly to tend to my own urgent affairs jin blinked at this news yah wellof course it had to be that way people always left nothing was ever really secure or safe he bit his lip i suggest we not volunteer any information on the late alice chen tonight and i think her existence is unlikely to come up as yet but if it does raven abstracted her at dr leibers request as well as independent physical evidence for the effects of the bad cryosolution raven being enough of both a scientist and a businessman not to put his company at risk on mere hearsay raven tilted his head and grinned at this that works for me milessan rolled his shoulders and stretched he did look a little grayfaced a very fouroclockinthemorning look if no more tired than anyone else here his eyes were bright though he turned to jins mother i have an experienced forensic economics analyst already en route from the barrayaran embassy on escobar as it happens my need for him has been largely shortcircuited the events of the last day but to justify the expenses of his journey i will make you a loan of him for a few days i expect he could be of considerable help in strategizing your next moves should you decide to try to revive your political action committee or even if you dont jins mother rubbed her forehead in a rather thick voice she said but what if the police try to take jin and mina it was a horrible thought one that jin had been trying not to think ever since milessan had announced the imminent arrival of the authorities i think they are unlikely to question minors when abundant adult witnesses are readytohand you are nextofkin theyll have to request your permission to interrogate your children which i suggest you deny for now on the grounds that the pair are too traumatized by the recent fright of their thwarted kidnapping mina made a faint indignant noise at this jin wasnt so sure the lawyer will support you milessan went on if it becomes an issue which i doubt it will in this immediate aftermath tell the police to come see them later at the consulate if neededwhich by then i suspect it wont be and in any case well be on home ground there vorlynkin nodded reassurance at her she shook her head in doubt but jin thought some of the strain eased around her eyes jin glanced up to find armsman roic eyeing him closely jin shrugged uncomfortably and turned his head away madame sato came roics slow deep voice can jin and mina come out in the corridor with me for a moment id like to show them something jin looked back about to decline but mina was already hopping up and down in agreement readily prevailing over their mother who seemed to want to say something to the consul anyway so jin ended up letting himself be shepherded out with his sister roic closed the door firmly behind them to jins surprise roic went down on one knee which made him well not much shorter than jin and still taller than mina i thought said roic that you might like to try firing my stunner he drew the weapon that had hurt so shockingly out of the holster under his jacket and jin flinched ooh ooh said mina wow can we which made it impossible for jin to say no he nodded warily you must never point a weapon at a person unless you intend to fire roic began a short tutorial no matter if you think its uncharged or the safety lock is on or what make it an absolute habit and it will never be a question he pointed out the various features of the device including a sensor in the grip that was keyed to his own palm and which he turned off with a code then he let jin take it making sure it was pointed up the empty corridor the grip was still warm from roics hand like a chair youd sat down in too soon after someone else got out of it the stunner was lighter than jin expected but solid enough the power pack in the grip gave it the most of its heft it didnt feel like a toy jin stared down the sight the way roic told him too and squeezed the trigger the buzz in his hand startled him but there was no recoil and he managed not to drop it encouraged jin let roic show him how the automatic laser sight worked and fired again this time he didnt jump and again the charge hit the wall pretty nearly just where hed intended this time jin didnt exactly smile but he felt his jaw ease mina was by this time eager to try let me let me so jin reluctantly gave the device up to her roic went through his instructions once more prudently kneeling behind mina and keeping a hand hovering to help steady hershe had to hold the thing up in both fistsand the drill was repeated roic stood up reset the code and holstered the weapon better he asked jin yah said jin in some wonder its like a tool its just a tool thats right this time when roic smiled down at him jin smiled up he let the armsman lead them back into the recovery room miles leaned forward and spoke earnestly into the secure holovid recorder i just want you to know gregor that if the planet melts down over all this it wasnt my fault the tripwire was laid long before i stumbled across it he considered the opening remark of his report cover for a moment then reached out and deleted it the one good thing about the very asynchronous vid communication entailed by nexus infosquirts moving at light speed between jump points and shipcarried through them was that if you didnt think before you spoke you could at least think before you hit send not that he hadnt generated some of his best ideas as his brain raced to catch up with his moving mouth also some of my worst he wondered which kind his recent examples would ultimately prove to be he glanced around the consulates tightroom which he had all to himself having run out the exhausted johannes before embarking on this private and personal recording since johannes was the closest thing to an impsec analyst the outoftheway consulate boasted miles had spent much of the past two days in training him in just what information out of the uproar of the local planetary feeds to screen and forward to galactic affairs on komarr multitasking always a good thing johannes proved a diligent enough student if the attache had been one of the imperial services brighter stars hed have been sent to some hotter posting but if hed been less responsible he wouldnt have been sent to such an autonomous one miles added a note commending the lieutenants conscientiousness while he was thinking of it which reminded him in turn of his early suspicions of the clerk yuuichi matson hed caught the tail end of a short conversation between matson and his boss vorlynkin in the kitchen daybeforeyesterday when the media siege of the consulate was just beginning people told me id be able to pocket a tidy amount of baksheesh in this job the clerk complained but in five years nobody offered me anything and when they finally do its because they want dirt on satosan satosan as if i would agh vorlynkins blue eyes crinkled you were doing it wrong yuuichi youre not supposed to wait for offers youre supposed to ask or at least hint you should ask the lord auditor for pointers matson just shook his head and stalked off nursing his green tea and his umbrage miles grinned and bent to add a kind word for the overworked clerk as well trying to bring his mind back into focus miles scanned down the long index of attachments both raw data and his synopses that hed generated for hq a tedious but necessary chore this should suffice to keep some unfortunate team of impsec galactic affairs analysts busy and happy for a week or three till he caught up with them in person well busy anyway the imperial councilor as the barrayaran viceroy on komarr was dubbed would be invited into the loop as well when this arrived by coded tightbeam a full analysis of the planetary voting shares scam should be awaiting the lord auditor by the time he made komarr orbit and a plan for suitable countermeasures for the votetheft as well miles indulged himself with a brief fantasy of ron wing and friends waking up from cryostasis expecting to have stolen a planet as destitute and distraught as old yani alas the affair would doubtless be wound up before matters progressed that far cosmic justice was very appealing but the regular kind would also do putting together his auditorial report had also sufficed to keep miles out of the way of the consulate upstairs and out of sight of its visitors as the consequences had spun out from that very useful night at madame suzes the newegypt execs were under arrest for conspiracy and possibly murder and as the degeneratedcryopreservativesandcommodifiedcontracts scandal hit the newsfeeds in force it was likely that enough other charges would be thrown in atop to keep them from wriggling out the attempted kidnapping involving real kids looked to prove especially damaging to their cause score another point for jin and mina which miles must remember to tell them lawsuits on behalf of madame sato and her group were in preparation and shed given her first interview under the watchful protection of vorlynkin and with the shrewd advice of her new attorney who was working very enthusiastically on contingency whitechrys and a number of other cryocorps shoved into premature responses by these breaking events were making noises like outraged victims after all and miles smirking wished ron wing all the luck he deserved in his damage control asterzine was all very well for setting a building on fire but if one wanted to set a world alightwell miles hardly needed he reminded himself for the nth time to mix in further abovestairs consul vorlynkin was doing a fine job of looking out for barrayars interests not to mention those of the sato family and mark was atop affairs from the durona clinic end miles had danced uncomfortably close to jeopardizing his primary mission with whitechrys on these fascinating sideissues with newegypt but given marks new enterprise they might not prove so sidewise after all miles was not above taking credit for accidental foresight really none of this would have come to pass if he hadnt gone on poking just a little farther than hed needed to he must be sure to point that out to gregor ah gregor the cover message would go to the emperors eyes and ears only for inspiration miles called up a still vid of gregor in full uniform and his sternest glower the official pose that gregor had dubbed the rod up my imperial butt look alas it only inspired miles to want to clown till he made that grave face crack a smile no gregor had clowns enough in his life starting with about half of the council of counts though they seldom made him smile miles hit record once more and began with crisp efficiency good day gregor as my followup note to vorlynkins little misguided emergency message last week indicated suspicions of whitechrys chicanery on komarr have proven correct the raw data and my summations are in the main body of my report im not sure what to do with the bribe im not going to give it back but its not going to be worth what ron wing promised either which makes dumping it directly onto the imperial service veterans hospice a questionable proposition but we can deal with that later ill stop at solstice on my return trip if impsec komarr and the imperial councilor want to ask further questions though really this should be enough to get them started oh and with respect to vorlynkin i want a suitable auditorial commendation to go on his diplomatic department record for exemplary assistance during my visit or ah visitation and after as im running away tomorrow and dumping all of the cleanup on the poor fellow better him than me meanwhile i suppose id better give you a quick synopsis of the erupting newegypt scandal as it has impinged on my investigation it all started when the local loony party broke into the cryoconference and failed to carry me off which i described in brief in my last report but after that as succinctly as he could miles summarized the events of the past days from jins arrival at the consulates back door through the successful arrest of the newegypt crew he was a little out of breath by the time he finished miles tried not to wince as he imagined the look on gregors face as he heard all this out nonplussed pained bland gregor could outbland pym so far no criminal charges have been leveled against me and i trust ill be long gone from kiboudaini before anyone on the other side thinks of it he concluded in cheerful reassurance he sought for an upbeat note on which to end in the department of only on kibou we actually got to summon the dead to testify against the bad guys which is a moment of cosmic justice if ever there was one what was that creepy old quote something read in his academy days or more likely on one of his academy leaves an ancient tale from old earth before cryonics was invented or even imagined so seeming strangely prescient the words were branded in his brain though their literary source was long forgotten buried under the chaos of his intervening decades and possibly a touch of lingering cryoamnesia i will break the door of hell and smash the bolts i will summon the dead to take food with the living and the living shall be outnumbered by the host of them ah not something he cared to share with gregor that gregor as miles had reason to know already had enough creepy crap stuffed into his imperial head that it was a wonder his skull hadnt exploded but it did bring miles to his finale i shouldnt wonder if marks rejuvenation research here doesnt turn out to be more important in the long run than my mission too early to judge but the durona group will be something to keep an eye on and not just impsecs spyeyes either a private word in the ear of laisas greataunt if shes looking for a better investment than whitechrys solstice might be a suitable reward for her first bringing the affair to our attention come to think i missed todays commercial jumpship to escobar but ive snagged berths on tomorrows im eager to get home and oh tell laisa from megood catch miles closed the recording securitysealed it attached it to his coded report and sent it on its way chapter twenty the afternoon sun warmed the consulates back garden murmurous with creatures gyre preened and muttered on his perch the chickens scratched in the grass or dozed in their nest boxes the sphinx nosed and mumbled among the flower beds occasionally sneezing just like jins mom gracing the tabletop the turtle slowly crunched a piece of lettuce donated from minas lunch salad lucky sat in jins mothers lap and purred unsheathing her claws whenever the stroking hand stopped apparently demanding to be petted bald granted that the rats let out for a run earlier and then fed special tidbits just curled up and slept in their cages but then they never made much noise in the first place it was all very alive out here jin thought with satisfaction they had brought out a table to eat lunch under a tree mom and jin and mina and consul vorlynkin and aunt lorna invited for the first time to visit her revived sister jin had been horrified when hed learned she was coming but since she wanted him back in her household quite as little as he wanted to go there theyd actually ended up on the same side in a weird sort of way she still seized the chance to chide him for running off both times shes right jin his mother endorsed this they were all very upset when they didnt know what had happened to you you might have been killed for all she and your uncle knew but if i hadnt run away jin said id never have met milessan and mom would still be frozen vorlynkinsan grinned at aunt lornas flummoxed expression unassailable logic im afraid hed taken off his business coat in the warmth and leaned back in his chair in his shirtsleeves looking more relaxed than jin had ever seen him but then most of the time hed been following milessan around and milessan had a way of unrelaxing people milessan and armsman roic had left yesterday to board an orbital shuttle and catch a jumpship to escobar from where consul vorlynkin had explained to jin and mina with the aid of a wormhole map the lord auditor would transfer to a ship bound for the planets sergyar and komarr and finally to barrayar where his real home was the one with all those children and ponies jin supposed despite the steady procession of lawyers police and journalists into and out of the consulate not to mention jin and mina and their mother and now relatives jin had to admit it had grown a lot quieter around here since the little man had left it had all been very exciting for a time but jin wasnt sorry for the slowdown in any case the parade of people had been closely supervised by the consul at his most formal and intimidating not to mention barrayaran and tall and nobody had tried to take jins mother away again mina had gone inside to go to the bathroom but now the back door slammed open and she rushed out in excitement a familiar box in her hands lieutenant johannes followed warily saying shell be much happier returned to her natural habitat im sure jin mommy said mina look lady murasakis babies all hatched their mother valiantly replied thats nice dear although aunt lorna winced mom stared down through the transparent lid and added faintly my goodness she has a lot of children doesnt she perhaps its time to move them to a larger home like us thought jin let it be like us he eyed consul vorlynkin in fresh speculation lieutenant johannes says i have to put them all out in the garden mina frowned evidently trying to decide if this was a good idea or not behind her johannes made motions that seemed to indicate he didnt want to share the consulate with a hundred active spiderlings which jin thought quite narrowminded of him excellent notion said vorlynkin tactfully i understand their webs look quite attractive in the morning light after a heavy dew jin embarked on a hasty tutorial about what kinds of spiders did and didnt spin webs and the web designs of various species in relation to their prey while mina went off to find some especially pretty flowers on which to release the new family johannes muttered to vorlynkin when she shoved that box under my nose i thought i was going to throw up vorlynkins eyes crinkled i didnt know you were arachnophobic trev you realize the garden is going to be swarming with those gigantic spiders actually said jin the chickens will probably eat some of them johannes eyed the chickens with approval for perhaps the first time ever dont tell mina jin added wouldnt dream of it said johannes and after a polite nod at jins mother and aunt went back inside not five minutes later the back door opened more sedately and ravensensei strolled through jin had never been more glad for an interruption as the grownups had started talking about jins missed school and what was to be done about it and how soon ravensensei gave a general wave to everyonemina waved back enthusiasticallyand came to a stop at the table with a lift of his eyebrows at aunt lorna ah sistersan jin didnt think aunt lorna looked that much like her older sister being both shorter and rounder with bobbed hair and more peevish although any peeve evaporated as she stared up wideeyed at the escobaran surgeon vorlynkin hastened to introduce them and aunt lorna actually smiled and shook hands and when ravensensei turned away to greet mina whispered to her sister you didnt tell me your doctor looked like that decorative and functional mom murmured back his clinic has quite the reputation on escobar im told for a moment consul vorlynkin frowned as if worrying whether to try to look decorative or functional but settled on diplomatic which suited him better anyway ravensensei returned from admiring the spider family and jin at a nod from his mother gave up his chair to the new guest this wasnt so bad as jin then went to lean on her shoulder and she slipped her arm around his waist lucky with a grumpy noise at the loss of the petting hand jumped down i thought you would like the word at once madame sato said ravensensei we retrieved mr kang and ms khosla last night and i did both revivals this morning entirely uneventfully im pleased to report both spoke briefly and about as lucidly as could be expected before i put them back to sleep as soon as your head cold passes off you may come down to the facility and see them jin felt his mothers body tremble her eyes squeezed shut in brief thanksgiving thank you for your excellent work doctor truly said consul vorlynkin he tilted his head in concern at jins mother but eased back in his chair again when she dabbed her eyes and relaxed how soon will they be able to speak to the lawyers and the police detectives they will of course have to stay in biological isolation for a few days but id expect their recoveries to be almost as swift as madame satos they may be coherent enough to give depositions through the booth intercoms as early as tomorrow evening but i told the authorities to come the following morning to be sure and their physical security meantime miss koudelka has arranged that as part of setting up security for the new clinic she turns out to have a knack for that sort of thing did you know her mother used to be a bodyguard to the emperor of barrayar when he was a child impsec trained i gather and she passed it along in the family yes i believe lord vorkosigan did say something about that before he left he does seem to know the most extraordinary range of people only to be expected given his background what is this lord unpronounceable you keep talking about anyway asked aunt lorna what or who said ravensensei although i gather that for him the two are nearly inextricable either both he investigates insurance fraud for somebody jin supplied his boss is named gregor he talks about him a lot vorlynkin blinked ravensensei laughed and jin twisted his toes in unease isnt that right he asked well yes said vorlynkin smiling again emperor gregor vorbarra that is but a lord auditor investigates all kinds of fraud and er other difficult situations that may arise that affect the imperium on the emperors direct orders at the highest levels generally and with very little oversight he once called himself the emperors stirrupman ravensensei confided i wasnt sure if that meant a guardsman who rides at his leaders side or a man who holds the stirrup while he mounts very barrayaran turn of phrase though i thought rides at his side is more correct said vorlynkin although the other isnt out of line jins mother tilted her chin in interest aunt lornas eyes widened a bit i didnt know he was that important said jin thinking back to his first view of the tattered lost druggie and a great deal of really strange behavior and babble subsequently milessan had never acted at all highnosed or stuffy on the other hand hed never acted like the rules applied to him either his father count aral vorkosigan is viceroy of sergyar vorlynkin explained to jins interested female relations and his mother the famous countess is vicereine in her own righther titles a coappointment not a courtesy just because shes his wife his viceroyalty caps a long career in service to the imperium very hard act for miles to follow i gather ravensensei put in jin thought of his own father frozen in time by his death more permanently than by any cryonic procedure jin would never be more than seven in those fading memories never seventeen or twentyseven or almost thirtyeight from the other side what would it be like to have a father when you were both grownups at the same time it seemed a strange uncomfortable tantalizing thought royalty asked mina who had drifted back to her mothers other elbow in time to hear this is milessans daddy some kind of prince a viceroy is ahm vorlynkin paused as if to choose words especially for her emperor gregor cant be on all three worlds at once so he stays on barrayar mostly and sends people to represent him on the other two planets the imperial counselor on komarr the viceroy and vicereine as a team on sergyar same jobs really just under two different titles because the planets are rather different he glanced at jins mother as if to check how she liked this explanation about his home so theyre likedeputy emperors asked jin vorlynkins brows rose in approval yes actually except they are appointed serve terms and then stop emperor is a life sentence so to speak a wry smile crossed his lips so milessan has an important job and an important family said mina testing out these ideas jin wondered if she was thinking about those ponies aunt lorna grimaced is his important relative why he was given the important job no said ravensensei judiciously i expect miles was given his job because hes a damned weasel theres a reason ferret out means what it does you have to have noticed that the man is a hyperactive lunatic surely with a fairminded air he added to the benefit of me and mine to be sure well vorlynkin trailed off vaguely and diplomatically jin supposed jin heaved a sigh i wish i might have ferret jins mother choked vorlynkin glanced at her and at nefertiti who was now nosing among the violets and put in you just got aeralmost a lion at least possibly enough wildlife wishes granted for the moment mina twined her arms around her mother and rested her head on the maternal shoulder mom hugged her back theres a wish thought jin theres a real big wish to have granted bigger than a ferret any day bigger than a lion even althoughjin had seen picturesferrets were really cute cuteandfurry was always an easier sell than carapacedandmultilegged for some obscure reason grownups so unreasonable the grownups started talking about lawyers and lawsuits and newegypts evil executives all under arrest and moms old political action committee and what would happen to it next which theyd been doing nonstop for days practically the whole week since suzesans place had almost been burned down so jin drifted away to watch nefertiti mina equally bored followed him the sphinx was crouched down in the patch of purple and white violets oh no cried mina shes eating them jin worried that the consul might be attached to his violetsthin green stems at this point mostlygrabbed the sphinx and dragged her away scolding fud mumbled nefertiti squashed lavender petals dribbling from her mouth vorlynkinsan mina called in anxiety will eating violets make nefertiti sick jins mother gulped in dismay except that she was also laughing but vorlynkin seemed barely taken aback i shouldnt think so edible flowers are sometimes put on salads and violets i believe are among them theyre also served candied it would doubtless be prudent not to let her eat too many at a time however jin and mina both slumped in relief for slightly different reasons perhaps vorlynkinsan knew all kinds of nifty things and he smiled at jins mom and jins mom smiled back which wasnt something shed done much lately he was actually an allrightallround sort of fellow though he needed to be brought up to speed on zoolology if he wasgoing to stick around so thats all right thought jin miles selected a table at the edge of the balcony overlooking the escobar transfer stations main concourse from here one had a doubly dizzying view of the people passing two floors below and of a broad slice of starspecked space and escobars rim glowing with light and color through the transparent wall above he set out three coffee bulbs took a seat and gestured roic to another the armsman accepted a coffee bulb but shook his head at the seat preferring to lean against the balcony rail and gaze around appearing alas exactly like a bodyguard trying to look like a tourist roic was not fond of these exposed positions miles always enjoyed this cafe when passing through herethis addition to the station was about ten years old he recollected mark appeared spotted himwell roicwaved and trod over miless commercial ship was not leaving for some hours so mark had delayed catching the hourly downside shuttle in favor of a few more minutes with his brother sharing the same ship from kiboudaini had thrown them together for a longer stretch of time than theyd had in years even if theyd both spent much of the time en route in their separate cabins devising detailed directives to send ahead to their respective associates busy and absorbed was on the whole good beat the hell out of insane and dead for example mark sat down swept up the last bulb popped the cap with his thumb took a swig and grimaced when he had time mark was a bit of a gourmet finicky in his tastes for food and drink miles didnt think the flavor was so bad for transfer station bulb coffee as a practical matter you had to allow the modifiers sorry im late said mark at the last moment before disembarking i got a message from kareen and i wanted to play it right away in the privacy of his cabin miles nodded understanding mark had left kareen and raven behind to start the setup for the new durona clinic and incidentally keep an eye on the progress of jins affairs while mark went ahead to deal with the details on the escobar end the separation from his partner temporary though it was left him notably cranky miles thought of ekaterin and sighed news good or news bad miles asked though if there were anything very bad he should have received a tightbeam from vorlynkin not bad kareen reports raven successfully revived those two missing friends of madame satos and theyve given some useful testimony to their authorities legal actions against newegypt proceed apace by legal standards which means glacially by human standards but they are apparently moving in the right directions so far with the murder charges laid the newegypt execs remain in custody the locals accepted a plea bargain of some sort from your friend oki whatever you call it when you rat out your comrades in exchange for a lighter sentence mark didnt sound especially disapproving roic listening raised his coffee bulb in salute and drank oki hadnt been the worst of the bunch to be sure i trust my name hasnt turned up in the proceedings said miles they dont know you from a hole in the ground mark assured him and grinned like a fat shark at his pained expression did kareen really have to sit on you to keep you from giving interviews that was a joke and she knew it miles said austerely yeah right whats next for you i descend on the durona group with a long list of chores not in their prior schedule much as you will when you hit home no doubt i hope to have the setup team for our first offescobar satellite clinic assembled and on their way in a week fuwas repairs are in hand which is a relief most contractors in my experience are only just barely faster than lawyers kareen says his work looks good so far so well be able to employ his company some more seems the least i can do for the man how little did you get him down to that night mark gave a smug duck of his chin thats proprietary information but to thwart sellers remorse i plan to swing him a lot of construction business bet hell try to pad his estimates oh of course mark waved this away as a given miles wondered if sending mark to batten on kiboudaini would prove adequate revenge for whitechryss ploy on komarr on the whole he thought it might and you asked mark are you going straight back to barrayar or will you stop at sergyar to see our parents miles rubbed his knuckles across his mouth and frowned there was no chance to go downside on my outbound trip of course though i did snatch twenty minutes to talk in real time with mother from the orbital transfer station how was she no more harried than usual id promised to stop on the way back but my case ran a couple of weeks over what id initially planneddid that one to myself trueand i might need to spend a few days on komarr setting up the trap for whitechrys with some folks which also wasnt in my initial plan so i may have to wait till they come home for winterfair if they do this year will you and kareen be coming home then not sure yet i was thinking you could pitch your new procedure to the countourfather in person well see how good its looking at that point we might actually have some preliminary results or not a few passersby turned their heads to stare at the two notquitetwins slouching for the moment in identical poses in their bolteddown chairs opposite each other miles studied his clone in a little frisson of wonder hed never quite lost what said mark tilting his head in an invitation to be amused by his progenitorbrothers infamous babble thinking about the uncle we neither of us ever knew our fathers older brother who was killed in that same attack that took out our barrayaran grandmother in the opening salvo of mad yuris war he was in his midteens i believe i was thinking how strange it was that i had a brother i never knew till i was an adult and our father had a brother everyone had forgotten by the time he was an adult were you ever told anything about him at all when you were being trained about barrayar mark shrugged just a name no time was spent on him when there was so much else to learn thats about all ive ever gotten from da either a painful period of his life i gather maybe if you and kareen do winterfair we can tagteam him and get him to disgorge more because im thinkingtheres hardly anyone else alive who knows anything about the fellow by now mark nodded its a deal if we come could be interesting or hairraising or both i sometimes wonder how different things would be if hed lived our father would never have become the count for one maybe not even lord vorkosigan if his brother had managed to pop an heir before our grandfather died hed have spent his life as lord aral ill bet hed still have had a military career though said mark judiciously perhaps or perhaps with the responsibility for our house taken up by someone else hed have felt freer to rebel do something else be someone else huh said mark miles fingered the holocube in his pocket there was no point in pulling it out and showing it to mark again as hed already done so twice you and kareen planning kids yet not to mention marriage miles added in an afterthought the couples informal partnership which would have been unremarkable on beta colony had been a difficult pill for kareens very barrayaran parents to swallow but after several years the senior koudelkas seemed pretty reconciled and kareen had three older married sisters all of whom had sprung at least one sprog so there wasnt the family pressure on her that there had been on say miles children frighten me mark confessed you had your da as a role model but all i ever had growing up was an insane komarran terrorist who spent all his time trying to train me to be you da spent a good bit of time trying to train me to be me too said miles but it wasnt at all the same thing mark snorted indeed we can laugh about this now sort of miles thought pleased and bemused what a journey thats been youd have kareen for a coparent miles offered shes one of the sanest people i know there is that mark admitted so whats your greatest terror now youre a da yourself what if miles pulled at his hair looking up crosseyed to see if he could spot any of the sneaky gray ones but this cut was still too short what if my children find out im not really a grownup how dreadfully disappointed would they be this time mark laughed out loud it was a very good sound miles thought and he grinned back ruefully at his brother i think your wife already knows said mark im afraid so miles rubbed his lips heh dyou think vorlynkin and madame sato will make a match of it good god how would i know i thought he had that look in his eye not as sure about her which gave miles a rather comradely feeling toward vorlynkin now he considered it he wished the man luck roic stiffened peering down into the concourse what said miles theres colonel vorventa roic answered wonder what he wants miles leaned toward the railing and craned to see the barrayaran officer was among other duties senior impsec liaison from the local barrayaran embassy on this main transfer station miles had dealt with him before though more often with his predecessors the colonel looked up saw roic then miles waved in a waitrightthere sort of fashion and made for the lift tubes at the end of the concourse us ill bet or me impsec would have known when their ship was coming in of course you i hope said mark ive had a few conversations with him i dont think he trusts me hes actually pretty cosmopolitan for a barrayaran said miles one of das new men blast i hope hes not bringing me more work it was a compelling and unwelcome notion if some fresh forest fire involving barrayars interests had sprung up somewhere on this end of the nexus well here was one of gregors most notable firemen already halfway there miless lips twisted no ive just been i want to go home now thats funny said roic in slow speculation i dont think ive ever seen him wearing his dress greens before miles hadnt either thats true he always wears local civvies and tries to blend in not today vorventa wore a highnecked military tunic in forest green all his rank tags and decorations squarely in place the green trousers with the red sidepiping tucked neatly into mirrorpolished riding boots and a more inappropriate garb for a space station miles could scarcely imagine damn but he looks shiny wonder whats up well find out in a minute said mark turning in his chair to watch the officer make his way among the tables toward them vorventas steps slowed as he approached and his eyes searched his quarry though his face remained stiff he halted at the tables side cast mark and roic a grave nod came to attention and offered miles a very formal salute though miles was in no kind of uniform at all except his gray trousers and jacket the messenger moistened his lips and said count vorkosigan sir aftermaths a drabble is a story in exactly words aftermaths five views in drabbles mark mark had once shot a man with a nerve disruptor seen the surprised eyes go blank as the charge burned out the brain behind them he didnt know why watching miles take in the news of their fathers death made that black memory surface no buzz or crackle from a weapon here just three quiet words it wasnt for hours after the scramble to rearrange travel that he realized hed witnessed the truth as if harnessed in tandem to the counthisfather lord vorkosigan had died in that moment too old life draining away along with the color from his face miles count vorkosigan stared at his face in the mirror fuck fuck fuck fuck are you all right mlord called roic from the fast couriers cabin of course im not all right you idiot miles snarled and then in a smaller voice sorry sorry i feel like my brains been pulled out and theres nothing in my skull but loose wires waving from my spinal cord god why are we in a hurry now days too late the countess er the dowager counyour mother is waiting for you on sergyar ah said the count yes and sorry well manage mlord cordelia it wasnt cordelia whod found him but it was she whod decided a brain aneurysm a warm afternoon two hours gone while the servants assumed the whitehaired man had fallen asleep in his armchair as he did after lunch these days miless voice was ragged couldnt you have had him cryoprepped anyway the technology might progress to wake without mind or memory soul in tatters he told me himself once no man would want to live on like that or else wake with the burden of his memories intact hardly less a horror could miles understand ensign dubauer im sorry ivan the state funeral ran for a grueling week ivan watched miles mount the podium to present the eulogy gregord lent his best speechwriters miles had edited still ivan held his breath when miles clutched the flimsies in a shaking fist and almost almost cast them away to deliver his wounded words ex tempore till his eye fell on his children squirming and confused in the front row between their mother and grandmother he hesitated smoothed out the flimsies began reading the new counts speech was everything it should be many wept ivan wondered what the old miles would have said gregor the interment at vorkosigan surleau was private meaning a hundred or so people milling around the grave was double but only one side dug the earth waited like a bridal bed the pallbearers were six ivan illyan and koudelka of course duv galeni for komarr admiral jole for sergyar and one other lady alys to whom everyone owed their sanity pointed out that gregors place was with the chief mourners the man has carried me since i was five years old answered the emperor of barrayar its my turn alys gave way as gregor went to help shoulder the bier
