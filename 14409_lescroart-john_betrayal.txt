john lescroart betrayal book in the dismas hardy series to lisa m sawyer who shares my life and owns my heart a mans death is his own business aaron moore first sergeant us marine corps injustice is relatively easy to bear it is justice that hurts henry louis mencken prologue on a wednesday evening in early december dismas hardy standing at the thin line of dark cherry in the light hardwood floor of his office threw a dart it was the last in a round of three and as soon as he let the missile go he knew it would land where hed aimed it in the wedge as had the previous two hardy was a betterthanaverage playerif you were in a tournament youd want him on your teamso getting three twenties in a row didnt make his day although missing one or even god forbid two shots in any given round would marginally lower the level of the reservoir of his contentment which was dangerously low as it was so hardy was playing a nowin game if he hit his mark it didnt make him happy but if he missed it really ticked him off after he threw he didnt move forward to go pull his darts from the board as he had the last thirty rounds instead he let out a breath felt his shoulders settle unconsciously gnawed at the inside of his cheek on the other side of his closed door in the reception area the night telephone commenced to chirrup it was long past business hours phyllis his ageless ogre of a receptionistsecretary had looked in on him and said good night nearly three hours ago there might still be associates or paralegals cranking away on their briefs or research in some of the other rooms and officesafter all this was a law firm where the billable hour was the inescapable unit of currencybut for the most part the workday was over and yet with no pressing work hardy remained over the last twenty years wednesday evenings in his home had acquired a nearsacred status as date night hardy and his wife frannie would leave their two children rebecca and vincentfirst with babysitters then aloneand would go out somewhere to dine and talk often theyd meet first at the little shamrock about halfway between home on thirtyfourth avenue and his downtown office hardy was a part owner of the bar with frannies brother moses mcguire and theyd have a civilized drink and then repair to some venue of greater or lesser sophisticationsan francisco had them alland reconnect or at least try tonights original plan was to meet at jardinière traci des jardinss topnotch restaurant which theyd belatedly discovered only in the past year when jacob the second son of hardys friend abe glitsky returned from italy to appear in several performances at the opera house across the street but frannie had called him and canceled at fourthirty leaving a message with phyllis that she had an emergency with one of her client families hardy had been on the phone when frannies call had come in but hed been known to put people on hold to talk to his wife she knew this clearly she hadnt wanted to discuss the cancellation with him it was a done deal after another minute of immobility hardy rolled his shoulders and went around behind his desk picking up the telephone he punched a few numbers heard the ring waited yellow is the color of my true loves hair he said except that frannies hair is red what kind of greeting is yellow its hello with a little sparkle up front yyyellow see i liked it better when you just said glitsky of course you did but youre a wellknown troglodyte treya pointed out to me and she was right as she is about everything that growling out my name when i answer the phone at home was somewhat offputting not to say unfriendly as a lifelong policeman glitsky had cultivated a persona that was if nothing else selfprotectively harsh large broadshouldered black on his mothers sidehis father nat was jewishglitskys favored expression combined an unnerving intensity with a disinterested neutrality that in conjunction with anomalous iceblue eyes and the scar that ran through both of his lips conveyed an impression of intimidating barely suppressed rage supposedly he had wrung confessions out of suspects by doing nothing more than sitting at an interrogation table arms crossed and staring even if the rumor wasnt strictly true glitsky had done nothing to dispel it it felt true it sounded true so it was true enough for a cops purposes youve never wanted to appear friendly before in your entire life hardy said false at home i dont want to scare the kids actually you do thats the trick it worked great with the first batch the first batch i like that but times change nowadays you want the unfriendly glitsky youve got to call me at work im not sure i can stand it youll get over it so what can i do for you the connection thrummed with empty air for a second then hardy said i was wondering if you felt like going out for a drink glitsky didnt drink and few knew it better than hardy so the innocuoussounding question was laden with portent sure glitsky said after a beat where and when im still at work hardy said give me ten ill pick you up perversely telling himself it was because it was the first place he could think of that didnt have a television hardy drove them both to jardinière where he valeted his car and they got a table around the lee of the circular bar it was an opera night and the barber of seville was probably still in its first act so they had the place nearly all to themselves on the drive down theyd more or less naturally fallen into a familiar topicconditions within and the apparently imminent rearrangement of the police department the discussion had carried them all the way here and wasnt over yet glitsky who was the deputy chief of inspectors had some pretty good issues of his own mostly the fact that he neither wanted to retire nor continue in his current exalted position which leaves what hardy pulled at his beer no let me guess back to payroll glitsky had been shot a few years before when hed been head of homicide and after nearly two years of medical leave from various complications related to his recovery he got assigned to payroll a sergeants position though he was a civil service lieutenant if his mentor frank batiste hadnt been named chief of police glitsky would have probably still been there today or more likely hed be out to pasture living on his pension augmented by piecemeal security work but batiste had promoted him to deputy chief over several other highly ranked candidates in all glitsky pretended that this was a good thing he had a large and impressive office his own car and a driver a raise in pay an elevated profile in the city access to the mayor and the chief but the rather significant in his opinion downside to all of this was that the job was basically political while glitsky was not the often inane meetings press conferences public pronouncements spin control and interactions with community groups and their leaders that comprised the bulk of glitskys hours made him crazy it wasnt his idea of police work it wasnt what he felt he was born to do glitsky tipped up his club soda sucked in a small ice cube chomped it looked across at hardy lanierthe current head of homicideis retiring you know nobodys that dumb hardy said whats dumb id retire myself if i could afford it but hardy was shaking his head im not talking about lanier he said im talking about you im not retiring no i know what youre doing is thinking about asking batiste to put you back in homicide isnt that right and here i thought i was being subtle you and a train wreck hardy sipped some beer you talk to treya about this of course whats she say youll just do that eyerolling thing you do but she says whatever makes me happy makes her happy at hardys reaction he pointed there you go see i cant help it hardy said its eyerolling material have you talked to batiste not yet he did me a favor making me deputy chief i dont want to seem ungrateful except that you are well ive already put in three years there and its not getting any better and homicide would be glitsky moved his glass in a little circle of condensation its who i am more thats all its why im a cop finally getting to the reason theyd come out in the first place its just so different hardy said i mean two years ago ive got two kids and a wife waiting for me when i come home were playing scrabble around the kitchen table for christs sake watching videos together if memory serves you couldnt wait for that to end it was so boring not that boring and even last year the becks off at bu but at least vince was still around at home and wed give a nod to a family dinner a few times a week now hes in san diego and frannies a working fool andits just so different empty nest glitsky said i thought i was going to love it well there you go wrong again he shrugged youll get used to it i dont want to get used to it i want to love it the way it should be hows that should you know like go out on dates with my wife and do fun nonkid things on weekends stay over places go back to being my carefree old self who i dont believe i ever met him you know what i mean it just doesnt seem right what that frannies working no no shes wanted to go back to work forever after the kids moved out ive been totally behind her going back to school and everything i mean weve been planning on it but you just didnt think it would take so much time away from you hardy sipped beer swallowed blew out heavily shes a good woman he said im not saying shes not few better if you do something stupid with her around this ill hunt you down and kill you im not going to do anything im just trying to get my head around where we are now its like her job is her life all the sudden you ever hang out with yourself during a murder trial miss a few dinners did you thats not the hardys tone hardened i was bringing in all the money abe i was supporting everybody thats not the situation now oh okay youre absolutely right it was different when you did it hardy twirled his glass on the table and stared out across the dimly lit bar even going out with his best friend to talk about himself wasnt turning out to be such a party things were going to have to change and as glitsky said he was going to have to get used to it hell things had already changed under his nose and hed barely seen those changes coming its never easy is it he said glitsky chewed some more ice what was your first clue after years of aggravation and frustration hardy had finally broken down and rented some enclosed parking space in his neighborhood the full double garage was still a long block and a half from his home and it cost him nearly four thousand dollars a year but its door opened when you pushed a button on your cars visor it was closer than most of the parking spots he would wind up finding on the streets anyway it did double duty as a storage unit and perhaps best of all it removed both the family cars from the immediate threat of theft or vandalism both of which his family had been the victim of three times in the eighteen months before hardy had plunked down his first rent check the walk home tonight wasnt bad though hed stopped after the two beers with glitsky his caseload was light at the moment and so he was unencumbered by his usual fortypound litigators briefcase the night was brisk and clear his twostory railroad victorian on thirtyfourth avenue up by clement was the only standalone house on a blockful of apartment buildings it sported a white picket fence and a neatly maintained albeit tiny lawn a flowerbordered brick walkway hugged one side of the lawn four steps led up to the small porch a light on by the door more flowers grew in window boxes hardy let himself in and flipped on the hall light the house was called a railroad victorian because the ground floor was laid out like a railroad car all of the roomsliving sitting diningopened off the long hallway on hardys right as he walked through the house to the back rooms turning on more lights in the kitchen and family room behind itthe house was dead stillhe automatically checked in on his tropical fish sprinkled some food on the waters surface and stood in much the same attitude of passive repose hed adopted after his last round of darts earlier that night after a minute of that he took a few more steps and found himself in the corner that held the doors to both rebeccas and vincents rooms he opened the becks first shed slept in this room only a couple of weeks before when shed been home for thanksgiving but there was of course no sign of her now the bed was neatly made the bookshelves organized vin had been home too and his room was pretty much the same as his sisters although somehow louder in his absenceit was more a boys room with sports and music posters and lots more junk everywhere mostly now both of the rooms just seemed empty checking the phone for messages none then his watch hardy called frannies cell and got her voice mail she turned her phone off when she was with clients he said yo its quarter to nine and im just starting to cook something that im sure is going to be fantastic if you get this and youre on your way home let me know and ill hold dinner if not you snooze you lose love you hardys black castiron frying pan hung on a marlin fishhook over the stove and he took down the tenpound monster and placed it over one of the stoves burners turned the gas on grabbed a pinch of sea salt they kept on the counter next to the stove and flung it across the bottom of the pan whatever he was going to make salt wouldnt hurt it opening the refrigerator he rummaged and found mushrooms an onion a red pepper some leftover fettucine with a white sauce he remembered as having been pretty good he threw away one heavily mildewed tomato but that still left two that were probably salvageable if he cut them carefully unawares by now he was humming the tune to baby its cold outsidedriving home hed been listening to steve tyrells standards on his cd player the freezer held a fourpack of chickenandbasil sausages that he loved in five minutes hed chopped all the ingredients put them in the pan added some random herbs and spices and several shakes of tabasco sauce and a half a cup or so of the zinfandel hed opened hed just turned the heat down and covered it when the phone rang certain that it was frannie he picked up on the second ring bobs beanery a male voice replied i must have the wrong number no wait im sorry i thought it was my wife mr hardy speaking mr hardy this is oscar thomasino your honor how are you fine thanks am i bothering you at an inopportune time no but whatever its no bother what can i do for you well admittedly this is a little unusual but you and i have known each other for a long time and i wondered if i could presume slightly upon our professional relationship this was unusual if not to say unprecedented but hardy nevertheless kept his tone neutral certainly your honor anything i can do if its within my power a superior court judge asking an attorney for a favor was a rare enough opportunity and hardy wasnt going to let it pass him by well im sure it is thomasino said did you know charles bowen charlie i dont think so youd remember him flashy dresser bright red hair big beard doesnt ring a bell he a lawyer yes he was anyway he disappeared six months ago whered he go if i knew that he wouldnt be disappeared would he hed be someplace everybodys someplace your honor its one of the two main rules everybody loves somebody sometime and youve got to be someplace during the short pause that ensued hardy came to realize that hed overstepped his tendency to crack wise was going to be the end of him yet but thomasino eventually recovered to some extent even reverting to his own stab at notquitecozy informality thanks diz he said ill try to keep those in mind meanwhile charlie bowen okay yes wellthe point is that he was a sole practitioner no firm no partners but a reasonably robust caseload good for him true but his disappearance hasnt been good for the court or for his wife and daughter either to tell you the truth his wifes hired her own lawyer to file a presumptionofdeath claim which between you and me has very little chance of getting recognized in spite of the fact that it would be convenient for the court whys that because when sole practitioners die and go to heaven the bar inherits the caseload and has to dispose of it what if they dont go to heaven most lawyers argue themselves in dont you think i know you would thanks i think your honor anyway i know its just housecleaning but bowen had a ton of work outstanding and that work needs to get done and while were not going to issue any presumption of death until hes been gone a lot longer last month marian braunanother of the citys superior court judgesruled that his disappearance rendered him legally incompetent and just yesterday the state bar suspended his ticket at the courts request so now theyve got to farm out his cases if he hadnt returned my calls for six months and i was his client i would have fired him by now im sure some of his clients may have done just that but not all by a long shot thomasino sighed charlie was a friend of mine his wifes going to need whatever he still has coming from his cases id like to be sure that the bar puts those cases in the hands of somebody who i know will do the right thing by her anyway bottom line is that i ran into wes farrell today at lunch this was one of hardys partners he said things at your place were a little slow the good news is that you can probably count on some percentage of mr bowens clients hooking up with your firm not that any of em will make you rich reading between the lines hardy knew what the judge was sayingthat this was grunt administrative work the court probably had appointed the majority of charlies clients indigents up for petty crimes and misdemeanors nevertheless the court would pay for every hour hardys associates spent on the criminal cases anyway and if the civil cases made any money the firm could expect reasonable compensation and it was again an opportunity to do a small good deed for a judge and that was never a bad idea you could probably get them all assigned out or closed in the next couple of months im sold your honor id be happy to help you out thanks diz i appreciate it i know its not very sexy ill have it all delivered to your office within the week how much stuff is it thomasino paused about sixty boxes in other words a lot but heres the silver lining its only half as much as it appears since half the boxes are one client tell me its microsoft a soft chuckle no such luck its evan scholler why is that name familiar because youve read all about it the two guys whod been over in iraq together ah it comes flooding back hardy said they had the same girlfriend or something too didnt they i believe so theres a bunch of juicy stuff but youll find that out soon enough i guess but in any event diz i really appreciate you doing this i live to serve the court your honor youre already up on points counselor dont lay it on too thick have a nice night hardy hung up and stood for a moment musing the judges line played back in his mind theres a bunch of juicy stuff in the scholler case hardy thought he could use some juicy stuff in his life about now if his memory served and it always did schollers situation was even more compelling than the bare bones of the murder case because of its genesis in chaos and violence in iraq part one a burntorange sun kissed the horizon to the west as twentysixyearold second lieutenant evan scholler led his threepack of converted guntruck support humvees through the gates of the allstrong compound in the middle of an area surrounded by palm trees canals and green farmland the landscape here was nothing like the sandy flat brown terrain that evan had grown used to since hed arrived in kuwait the enclosure was about the size of three football fields protected like every other safe area by bremer wallstwelvefoottall concrete barriers topped with concertina wiring ahead of him squatted three doublewide motor home trailers that allstrong security an american contracting company had provided for its local employees pulling up to the central temporary building over which flew an american flag evan stepped out of his car onto the gravel that extended as far as he could see in all directions a fitlooking american military type stood in the open doorway and now came down the three steps his hand extended evan snapped a salute and the man laughed you dont need to salute me lieutenant he said jack allstrong welcome to biap calling baghdad international airport by its nickname you must be scholler yes sir if youre expecting me thats a nice change of pace gotten the runaround have you a little bit ive got eight men here with me and colonelim sorry the commander here calliston thats it he wasnt expecting us calliston said you had some beds we could use yeah he called but all weve got are cots really weve got our own on board evan said were okay with cots allstrongs face showed something like sympathy you all been on the road awhile three days driving up from kuwait with a halliburton convoy four days wandering around between here and baghdad watching out for looters and getting passed off around the brass now here we are if you dont mind sir none of my men have seen a bed or a regular meal or a shower since we landed you mind if we get em settled in first allstrong squinted through the wind at evan then looked over to the small line of humvees with their m vietnamera machine guns mounted on their roofs exhaustedlooking and dirty men standing behind them coming back to evan he nodded and pointed to the trailer on his right bring em on up and park over there its dorm style find an empty spot and claim it showers are all yours dinners at eighteen hundred hours forty minutes from now think your men can make it evan tamped down a smile nobody better stand in their way sir nobodys gonna allstrong cocked his head well get em started then it had come to darkness outside through the windows but even inside the noise never seemed to end planes took off and landed at all times beyond that constant barrage of white noise evan was aware of the hum of generators and the barking of dogs hed gotten his men fed and settled and now he sat in a canvasbacked directors chair in the spacious doublewide room at the end of a trailer that served as one of allstrongs personal offices his gaze went to the walls one of which was filled with a large map on the other commendation and service plaques along with half a dozen photographs with recognizable politicians attested to what must have been allstrongs illustrious military careerhis host had been delta force finally mustering out as a fullbird colonel in the army hed received two purple hearts and the distinguished service cross no sign of marriage or family evan taking allstrongs measure as he pulled a bottle of glenfiddich from what appeared to be a full case of the stuff behind his desk put his age as late thirties he had an open face and smiled easily although the mouth and eyes didnt seem in perfect sync with one another the eyes tended to dart as though allstrong was assessing his surroundings at all times which now that evan thought of it probably made sense after a lifetime in theaters of war allstrong wore what hed been wearing when theyd met outsidecombat boots camo pants a black turtleneck he freepoured a stiff shot into a clear plastic cup handed it over to evan and splashed a couple of inches into a cup of his own pulling another directors chair over he sat down dont bullshit a bullshitter he said its not bullshit evan said they werent expecting us two hundred and ninetyseven men and they didnt know you were coming thats correct so what did you do what did they do they had us camp just about on the tarmac at a holding station in kuwait we had all our gear with us they put us on the ground until they figured out what we were here for allstrong shook his head either in admiration or disbelief i love this glorious army he said whos the commander down there still bingham that was the name so youre telling me they had you weekend warriors running your asses off statesidehustling you out of your day jobs rushing you through trainingthen packed you up in a flew nonstop for twentytwo hours travis to kuwaitand its all hurry up move it we need you over hereand you get here and nobody knows youre coming thats right so whatd they do you know camp victory this was a sandswept safe zone five miles north of kuwait city where the army had erected five enormous tents to hold overflow troops camp victory allstrong barked a laugh that kills me he drank off some scotch coughed shook his head and i thought id heard it all how long before they found out who you were we camped there for a week christ a week so howd you wind up here what happened to the rest of your unit evan took a good hit of his own drink for a few months after hed graduated from college hed put away a lot of beer but since joining the police force a few years ago hed been at most a light social drinker here and now though his first sip of real alcohol though technically forbidden while he was on duty always seemed appropriate and even earned i dont know he said most of em are probably still back in kuwait working on the hets they eventually found these were the heavyequipment transporters that hauled to ton cargo trucks and other massive ordnance and equipment from the iraqi or kuwaiti air bases where theyd been delivered to where they were supposed to get used in the field evans national guard unit the d transportation company out of san bruno california was actually a medium transportation unit that had been trained to move troops and equipment so what happened to you guys the nine of you the drink was kicking in quickly evan felt his body relaxing and leaned back into his chair crossing one leg over the other well that was just dumb or bad luck one of the two once bingham found the fleet of hets it turned out most of em didnt work heat sand four months without maintenance you name it so about half the guys got assigned to repairandrebuild work and bingham farmed out the rest of us wherever he needed somebody i was a cop back home and prior service enlisted with the infantry plus i was the only guy with any crewservedweapons experience so bingham had a convoy going to baghdad and me and my men got assigned guntruck support so your other guys theyre cops too no im the only cop and the only one trained on the m if you dont count the fortyfive minutes of instruction we all got before they sent us out now you are shitting me evan held up three fingers scouts honor jesus allstrong said so where do you guys stand now what do you mean i mean whats your mission what are you doing tomorrow for example evan sipped his scotch shrugged his shoulders no clue i check in with colonel calliston tomorrow morning at oh eight hundred and find out i suppose i dont see him sending us back to our unit although thats what im going to request the men arent too hot on this convoy duty maybe wind up getting shot at that wasnt in the original plan a small knowing chuckle came from allstrongs throat well lieutenant welcome to the war plans are what you work with before you get there they give you the illusion youve got some control and you dont im getting a sense of that evan replied so the short answer is i dont know whats happening tomorrow or next week or anything we seem to be the lost company allstrong stood up with his drink and walked over to the map staring at it for a few seconds he spoke back over his shoulder maybe i can talk to bill calliston get you and your men assigned to us howd you like that staying on here yeah doing what allstrong turned well thats the bad news wed want you to support our own convoy trucks but theres a lot fewer of them and were not afraid to drive faster if we need to where to mostly baghdad and back but were hoping to open offices at other bases near fallujah and mosul too wherever we can get work and beat damn custer battles to the punch custer battles new guys contractors like us and kicking ass at it they got the other half of this airport gig and theyre going for everything else we are im thinking of having their people killed evan nearly choked on his drink as allstrong came forward with a laugh thats a joke lieutenant or mostly a joke anyway as you might have noticed were staffing up here in a couple of months this place will be hopping callistons going to want to assign us some protection in any event i figured you guys are already here its a good fit besides over time its only going to get safer here i mean the road between baghdad and biap you mean the one known as rpg alley allstrong smiled you heard that one already huh rocketpropelledgrenade alley just doesnt sound all that safe its going to get better evan wasnt about to argue with his host you guys dont do your own security he asked i thought guys like you were guarding bremer this was l paul jerry bremer head of the coalition provisional authority or cpa who had set up headquarters to administrate infrastructure and the economy and all nonmilitary aspects of the occupation in husseins republican palace in baghdad a couple of weeks before allstrong chortled again yeah true another absurd moment guys like us protect civilians and admin staff but were not supposed to carry heavy arms so the military needs to guard our convoys thats beautiful isnt it anyway if youre interested i could put in a call to bill at least get you guys attached here call it a shortterm home that might be a start to belonging somewhere evan said sure call him route irish from the airport to baghdad proper was a thoroughly modern freeway three wellmaintained lanes in each direction from evans perspective the main difference between it and an american freeway aside from the apparently nearstandard practice of driving the wrong way on any given lane was that from many places cars could enter it anywhere from either sidethe asphalt ended on a sand shoulder that usually proceeded without a demarcating fence or barrier of any kind out across an expanse of flat marginal farmland so once you got away from baghdad where onand offramps and bridges were more common traffic could and did enter the roadway willynilly and not necessarily at designated entrances and exits this became a major problem because of suicide carbombers in the four days since colonel calliston had attached evans unit to allstrong they hadnt gotten approached by any of these yet but the threat was real and ubiquitous on his way through baghdad this morning evan had counted four burntout hulks of twisted metal one of them still smoldering as he drove by after an hours delay while the powers that be stopped all traffic and cleared the road today his assignment was to pass through baghdad and proceed up to balad air base nicknamed anaconda about forty miles north of the capital city and pick up a man named ron nolan a senior official with allstrong whod been scouting potential air bases to the north and west for the past week assessing contracting opportunities after collecting nolan they were to proceed back to downtown baghdad and make a stop at the cpa headquarters for some unspecified business then return to biap by nightfall the roundtrip distance was give or take a hundred miles and they had about twelve hours of daylight but evan wasnt taking any chances movement control had signed off on his convoy clearance and he had his full packagethe three humveesout and rolling at oh dark thirty hours each of his humvees had a driver and an assistant driver who was also in charge of feeding ammunition to the gunner whose body remained halfexposed through the hole in the cars roof the heavily armed men alternated roles on successive trips evan could have claimed rank and never taken a turn as gunneras a lieutenant his official role was to be convoy commander or radio operatorbut he made it a point to ride in each car and take a turn at the crewserve weapon as the opportunity arose today he rode as a passenger in the lead vehicle in one of the two back seats because of the traffic delay the package didnt pass baghdad until eight oclock and didnt make it the forty farther miles to the outer periphery of the enormous anaconda basesoon to be named mortaritavilleuntil elevenfifteen even without car bombs traffic on the road to the main logistics supply area close to baghdad crept at a near standstill not too surprising considering the sixteen thousand flights per month that anaconda was handling when they got through the gate evans driver and the secondincommand of their unit sergeant marshawn whitman drove for a half mile or so through a city of tents and trailers before they came to an intersection with a sign indicating that the camp headquarters was a mile farther on their right but whitman didnt turn the car immediately instead his window down he stared out to his left at two of the corner tents one sporting a logo for burger king and the other for pizza hut am i really seeing this sir arent we in a war here didnt we just make it into baghdad like two months ago can i get out and grab a quick whopper when evan shook ron nolans hand just outside the headquarters tent he had an immediate impression of great strength held in check he went about five ten and came across as solid muscle shoulders down to hips square jaw under brushcut light hair today he wore a sidearm at his belt and a regular army camo vest with kevlar inserts over his khaki shirt lefftenant nolan boomed pronouncing the word in the british manner and smiling wide as he fell in next to evan i sure do appreciate the punctuality time is money after all and never more than right here and right now i trust the limos got good airconditioning evan slowed jerked his head sideways uh sir but with another booming laugh nolan slapped him on the back joking with you son no worries aint no part of a humvee dont feel like home to me you know were planning to stop off in baghdad those are my orders yes sir nolan stopped reaching out a hand laying it on evans arm at ease lieutenant he said you a little nervous im fine sir but id be lying if i said baghdad was my favorite place well we wont be there for long if i can help it and i think i can jack allstrongs a master at keeping doors open he paused for a second so you regular army no sir california national guard yeah i heard they were doing that how bigs your convoy three humvees sir they were approaching it now parked just off the pavement here they are nolan stopped hands on hips and looked over the vehicles bristling with weaponry damn he said to evan thats a goodlooking hunk of machinery nodding at corporal alan reese a former seventhgrade teacher now manning the machine gun on the closest humvee he called up to him how you doing son good sir where you from back home san carlos california sir san carlos nolans voice thundered i grew up right next door in redwood city he slapped the bumper of the vehicle you believe this small world lieutenant this guy and me were neighbors back home we all are evan said sharing the enthusiasm although he couldnt exactly say why our units out of san bruno the nine of us were all peninsula guys son of a bitch nolan crowed i got hooked up with the right people here thats for damn sure how long have you guys been over here going on three weeks evan said get shot at yet not yet dont worry about it nolan said with a grin you will for an obscure and possibly impenetrable reason they got routed through the mixed neighborhood of mansour by haifa street rather than through the militaryonly secure road they normally took when coming in to cpa headquarters from biap ron nolans destination was saddam husseins old republican palace in central baghdad and the line of traffic on haifa waiting outside the checkpoint to get into the green zonebumper to bumper with weapons offsafe ready to reactstopped them cold nolan extricated himself from his seat and opened his door stepping out into the street and stretching evan loath to let his passenger out of his sight overcame his own reluctanceiraqi civilians were all over the street any one of them possibly an armed insurgentand got out as well it was late afternoon by now sweltering hot with nary a freshening breeze the air was heavy with the smells of roasting meat and fish manure oil and garbage haifa street was wide and lined with threeand fourstory concrete buildings most with at least some of their windows blown out from the crowd on the sidewalks including women and children no one would conclude that they were in a war zone though merchants had lined up where most of the traffic into the green zone had to pass and the street had the air of a bazaarmakeshift stands sold everything from clothing to batteries toilet paper to money to candy nolan taking it in seemed to be enjoying it all finally he caught evans eye and grinned over the hood of the car we can make it in half the time if we walk you up for it evan reluctant to leave his troops would have much preferred the relative security of his humvee but he also had a responsibility to protect ron nolan and get him back to allstrong and if that meant braving the streets of baghdad this was something different he should do as well the mutually exclusive options played across his features nolan noticed the hesitation come on lieutenant no guts no glory just thinking about my men mr nolan evan covered hey if they get to the gate before were done have em pull over and well meet em there but at this rate they wont even be there by the time were through and id like to make it back to biap before dark their humvee moved forward about six feet and stopped again either way nolan said im going you with me sure evan leaned inside the passenger window and told marshawn what he was doing i dont like being out of contact his driver replied i dont either marsh this is all new to me too he indicated their passenger with a toss of his chin but hes going and things here look pretty calm yeah marshawn said the before shot they both knew that he meant before the bomb exploded in the crowded marketplace lets hope not evan said and the sooner we get done and leave baghdad the sooner were back home im not arguing sir if you got to go you got to go but what if youre not at the gate what are we supposed to do where will you be for an answer evan shrugged and held up his portable motorola radio which was good for about a mile nolan whod heard the exchange leaned back to marshawn budget office down in the basement of the headquarters building you cant miss it but a hundred bucks says we beat you back to the gate the traffic gave and marshawn crept forward another five or six feet before stopping again the line of cars stretched for at least a quarter mile in front of him thats a bad bet for me sir he said even if i had the hundred bucks i think so too sergeant thats why were walking nolan snapped his fingers remembering something and reopened his back door reaching in he emerged a second later with his backpack apparently empty cant forget this he said with another grin and strapped it onto his back over the kevlar vest ron nolan waited for evan to fall in next to him then said and by the way my names ron okay mr nolans my dad you okay with evan thats my name yeah well evan i didnt mean to put you on the spot back there with your men and i apologize but you cant afford to be tentative here youve got to make decisions and run on em thats the main thing about this place i just made my decision but im not sure that leaving my convoy was the right one weve had it drilled into us that procedures are crucial to maintain order they were walking shoulder to shoulder at the curb nolan shook his head disagreeing my experience says its more important to trust your gut and im not talking just about deciding in a split second whos a muj and whos a hajjthese were the mujahideen and the hajji the bad guys and the good guys respectivelywhich is life and death and i mean right now but the business environment herechrist what a gold mine but youve got to see the opportunity and jump and im talking like yesterday or it all goes away did you get a chance to talk to jack allstrong at all back at biap a little bit he tell you how he got the airport gig the one that got us on the boards no he never mentioned it well its a perfect example of what im talking about you know what our half of that contracts worth if you guess sixteen million dollars youre on it to do what i saw the trailers but it wasnt clear what you guys were doing there were guarding the airport thats what what about us what do you mean us i mean the military the army the marines what about us were not guarding the airport no youre fighting the insurgentsmost of the regular units anyway jerry bremer god love him in his wisdom fired all the iraqi police and disbanded the military so nobodys left over here except us contractors to provide security for the people who are coming in droves to do oversight and infrastructure which is like everybody else evan had his hand on the weapon in the holster on his hip most of the local people in the street and on the sidewalk were simply stepping out of the way as the two americans passed by but many of the children were smiling and jogging along with themevan had already learned along with the iraqi kids that us servicemen were a common source of candy from their mre kits but evan had no candy on him and he wanted to get inside the green zone as fast as he could so he kept pressing through the crowd meanwhile ron nolan kept up the patter jack really hadnt been doing too good after he cashiered out hed been trying to set up a security business in san fran looking into water supply issues and the whole domestic terrorist thing but it wasnt going very well so then baghdad falls and what did jack do same thing as mike battles with custer battles he hopped on a plane with his last couple hundred bucks and flew over here to suss the place out for business opportunities nolan spread his arms theatrically et voilà couple of months later sixteen million smackeroos just like that almost jack still knew a few guys from when hed been in and they turned him on to the airport gig and talked the guy in charge into letting jack bid on it but howd he get it in spite of himself evan found himself taken by the narrative and by nolans enthusiasm i mean im assuming hes bidding against the giants right halliburton blackwater kbr kbr was kellogg brown and root unbeknownst to evan kbr was itself a subsidiary of halliburton not truly a separate entity yep and dont forget dyncorp and armorgroup international the big boys to say nothing of custer battlesactually they gave us the toughest run for it but jack wrestled em down and pulled out half the gig even in the madness of baghdad s afternoon market nolan beamed at the memory so what did he offer well first a low bid but that was basically because he was clueless and didnt know what it was worth but the main thing was time he promised to have almost a hundred and fifty men on the ground out here within two weeks two weeks two weeks they walked on for a few more steps before evan couldnt help himself how was he going to do that what was he going to pay them with in fact who was he going to hire did you guys have a hundred and fifty employees in san francisco you could fly out here nolan howled out a laugh are you kidding he had three employees in san francisco and hed paid them off of his credit cards in june it was the end of the road for him if this didnt work but it did howd that happen theyd come almost to the checkpoint while the traffic hadnt budged and nolan stopped and faced evan thats the great part jack didnt have any more credit nobody would lend him any more money back home so he flew back here and convinced the cpa that they needed to lend him two million dollars against his first payment on the contract two million dollars in cash nolan said in new hundred dollar bills so jack packed em all up in a suitcase and flew to jerusalem where he deposited it all in the bank then called me and told me to get my ass over here he was in business at the gate in spite of the crowd pressing up to get admitted nolan flashed his creds and the two men breezed their way through the cpa checkpointeven the grunt guards seemed to know who he was he and evan crossed an enormous open tankstudded courtyardat least a couple of hundred yards on a sidethat fronted a grandiose white palacelike structure that up close bore silent witness to the bombardment that had rained upon the city in the past monthswindows still blown out the walls pocked with craters from shells bullets and shrapnel inside the main building in the enormous open lobby pandemonium reigned in a babel of tongues military uniforms mingled with business suits and dishdashas as half a thousand men jostled and shoved for position in one of the lines each line wended its way to one of the makeshift folding tables that apparently controlled access to the inner sanctum of bremer and his senior staff the noise the intensity the hundredplus temperature and the general stench of humanity assaulted evans senses as soon as he passed through the front door to all appearances nolan was immune to all of it he hadnt gone three steps into the lobby when he plucked evans sleeve and pointed to their right so they hugged the back wall skirting most of the madness and making progress toward a wide marble staircase that led down the crowd on the stairs was far less dense here than in the room behind them whats all that about evan asked as soon as he could be heard nolan stopped at the bottom step those folks he said are basically the ones who got here a day late and a dollar short id say theyre jacks competitors except most of em are angling for subcontracts with the big boys basically the entire countrys for sale and bremers trying to administer all the deals from this building from those tables each of which represents a different ministry if you can believe that seventeen twenty of em i dont know and with as maybe you can see mixed results everybody wants a piece thank christ were beyond that stage fucking bedlam isnt it but he didnt wait for an answer turning nolan continued along the wall evan tagging behind him the crowd gradually thinning around them the farther they went along the hallway after thirty yards or so finally they turned a corner another long corridor stretched out before them startlingly untraveled a man in a military uniform sat at a lone table a little more than midway along and three other men apparently civilians stood in front of him but otherwise the hallway was empty the noise and craziness behind them still echoed but suddenly evan felt psychically removed from it in spite of the fact that there was still a terrible odor of human waste andeven with holes where the windows should have beenno ventilation nolan never slowed down if anything checking his watch he glanced up at the window openings high in the wall and speeded up but as they approached the desk he put out a hand to stop their progress and swore whats up evan asked nolan swore again and came to a dead stop it would be charlie tucker when were in a hurry maybe your sergeant shouldve taken my hundreddollar bet who is he hes a twerp senior auditor for aviation issues i think back home he was a librarian here hes a bean counter but mostly hes a pain in the ass for people like jack and me who are actually trying to do some good and make things happen but evan was starting to understand that nolan wasnt the type of guy to brood about stuff like charlie tucker or anything else he pasted on a brave smile but hey he said thats why they pay us the big bucks right we get it done in the short time it took them to walk to the desk major tucker had processed one of the three men whod been standing in front of his desk as nolan got closer the man in the back of the line turned and took a step toward them and bowed slightly mr nolan he said in accented english how are you sir kuvan from the apparently genuine enthusiasm kuvan might have been nolans best friend from childhood kuvan seemed to be in his early thirties the face was lightskinned bisected by a prominent hooked nose and featured the usual iraqi mustache nolan came up to him arms extended grabbed him by both shoulders and the two men seemed to rub noses with one another they then exchanged what evan had already come to recognize as the standard muslim praises to the prophet after which nolan continued kuvan krekar this here is second lieutenant evan scholler california army national guard hes only been here a few weeks and im trying to make him feel at home then to evan kuvan helped us with some of our filipino personnel down at biap hes a genius at finding people who want to work as krekar put out a hand and offered evan a firm and powerful grip he smiled and said all people treasure the nobility of work if everyone had a job there would be no war then id be out of a job evan said surprising himself krekar took the comment in stride his smile never wavering but not for long id wager even my friend mr nolan here a professional soldier of some renown has found meaningful work in the private sector in any event welcome to my country lieutenant youre in good hands with mr nolan im getting that impression evan said krekar brought his smile back to nolan one hears rumors that mr allstrong is going to be bidding on the currency project this was the contract to replace iraq s old currency thirteen thousand tons of paper that featured the face of saddam hussein on every bill with one of a new design twentyfour hundred tons of new dinars would have to be distributed in under three months this would involve hundreds of iraqis in all parts of the country all of whom would need to be housed and fed in new camps with new infrastructure and internet services at mosul basra and many other sitesexactly the kind of work allstrong was doing now at baghdad airport it would also involve supplying a fleet of fiveton trucks to carry the people and the money its entirely possible nolan said although i havent talked to jack in a couple of weeks and you know here a couple of weeks the world can change well when you do see him krekar said please mention my name to him the paper and pressing plants as well as the design elements and the banking issuesi know some people with these skills and perhaps jack and i could reach an arrangement if allah is willing ill be sure to let him know kuvan if hes bidding at all that is behind them tucker cleared his throat krekar bowed a hasty goodbye to nolan and evan and then stepped up to the desk backing up a couple of feet bringing evan with him nolan spoke sotto voce talk about getting it done if kuvans with us on this currency thing were going to lock it up taking nothing away from jacks accomplishment without kuvan we dont have the airport and thats no exaggeration whatd he do well you know i told you it was all about getting a lot of feet on the ground here in a couple of weeks jack promised he could do it and the cpa believed himhes a persuasive guy but still push came to shove and custer battles was beating us getting guys to work for them at every turn jack had no idea where he was going to find guards and cooks and all the other bodies he was going to need so it turns out that one of jacks old delta buddies does security for kbr and he turns him on to kuvan whos connected to this endless string of mulesnepalese jordanians turks filipinos you name it you give these guys a buck an hour theyll do anything for youcook clean kill somebody a buck an hour is that what theyre making give or take for the cooks and staff guards maybe two hundred a month nolan lowered his voice even further gestured toward the desk but dont let tucker hear that jack bid it out at around twenty an hour per man but as i say kuvans a genius his fee is two bucks an hour which takes our cost up to three an hour so were hauling in seventeen thats per hour twentyfour seven times a hundred and sixty guys so far with another two hundred in the pipeline and the more we bring on the more we make like i told you you play it right this place is a gold mine how much they paying you evan two grand a month close plus hazard duty nolan cut him off with a laugh hazard duty whats that a hundred fifty a month thats what our cooks make yeah you mentioned that the news disturbed evana hundred and fifty dollars extra per month and he faced death every day after a little pause nolan looked at him sideways you know what im making no idea you want to know a nod sure twenty thousand a month thats taxfree by the way of course ive got lots of experience and theres a premium on guys like me but still guys like you can finish up here then turn around and come back a month later with any of us contractors and youre looking at ten grand minimum a month a sixmonth tour and youre back home loaded this thing lasts long enough the smartmoney bet by the way and i go home a millionaire up at the desk major charles tucker looked like he could use some time in the sun hed sweated through his shirt he sported rimless glasses had a high forehead and nearly invisible blond eyebrowsa caricature of the harried accountant and he made no secret of his disdain for nolan lets see your paperwork who signed off on it this time colonel ramsdale sir airbase security services coordinator another one of mr allstrongs friends a comradeinarms yes sir they were in desert storm together im happy for them tucker looked down at the sheets of paper nolan had handed him he flipped the first page studied the second went back to the first everything in order sir nolan asked with an ironic obsequiousness this is a lot of money to take away in cash nolan he gestured to evan whos this guy convoy support sir protection back to the base tucker went back to the papers okay i can see the payroll but whats this sixtythousanddollar addon forhe squinted down at the paperdoes this say dogs yes sir bombsniffing dogs which we need to feed and build kennels for along with their trainers and handlers and ramsdale approved this apparently so sir nolan leaned down and pretended to be looking for ramsdales signature evan stifled a smile nolan punctiliously polite somehow managed to put a bit of the needle into every exchange im going to have somebody in audit verify this nolan shrugged of course sir sixty thousand dollars for a bunch of dogs bombsniffing dogs sir nolan remained mild and the infrastructure associated with them but apparently there was nothing tucker could do about it nolan had his form in order and it was signed by one of the armys sanctioned paymasters he scribbled something on the bottom of the form then he looked up behind nolan the line had grown again to four or five other customers specie tucker said i beg your pardon nolan replied dont fuck with me nolan dollars or dinars i think dollars yes i thought you would think that youre paying your people in dollars thats all theyll take sir the old dinars a little shaky right now tucker made another note tore off his duplicate copy and put it in his top righthand drawer this is going to audit he repeated then looked around nolan and said next that night in his trailers office jack allstrong sipped scotch with ron nolan while they tossed a plasticwrapped bundle of five hundred hundreddollar billsfifty thousand dollarsback and forth playing catch allstrongs office nice at it was remained a sore point with him this was because the main office of his chief competitor custer battles cb was in one of the newly reburbished terminals when mike battles had first gotten here two months before he found that hed inherited several empty shells of airport terminal buildings littered with glass concrete rebar garbage and human waste he had cleaned the place up carpeted the floors wallpapered all of his supplies bought and shipped from the united states put showers in the bathrooms and hooked the place up to a wireless internet connection at about the same time jack allstrong had had to start work on his trailer park to house his guards and cooks although he still couldnt compete with such cb amenities as a swimming pool and a rec room with a pool table allstrong knew that these types of cosmetics would be important to help convince his clients that he was serious and committed to the longterm success of the mission but he was initially hampered by lack of infrastructure and simple good help but then that genius kuvan krekar had come up with the idea of dog kennels as another income source and that was already working allstrong now had a decent number of the ministry people starting to believe that iedand bombsniffing dogs would be an essential part of the rebuilding process in bases all over the country so all in all jack was in high spirits for a variety of reasons kuvan was in fact interested in going in with them on their currencyexchange bid which gave it immediate credibility and might make them the front runners over cb the cpa was still paying them in dollars which meant allstrong could buy his own dinars to pay his local workers at the deeply discounted blackmarket exchange rate the bombsniffingdog revenue wasnt going to be stopped at least in the short term by bureaucrats like charlie tucker the bottom line was that the two million dollars in cash that nolan had retrieved today and carried here in his backpack covered approximately four hundred thousand dollars in the companys actual current expenses including tips to colonel ramsdale and several other middlemen everyone was too busy andor too afraid and the times were too chaotic for anyone to bother keeping close tabs on exactly what the money was used for or exactly where it went there was plenty of it in cash and the mandate was to get iraq up and running again subtext whatever it cost for example in the first month of the contract allstrongs trailer park had run out of drinking water within a week a true crisis jack had gone to ramsdale and told him he desperately needed to buy more water immediately but that he was out of money what with payroll housing costs legitimate security equipment weapons and vehicles such as armored mercedesbenz sedans and all other daily supplies for his now close to man staff without a personal look at the situation and apparently without a qualm ramsdale signed off on an authorization for allstrong to add six hundred thousand dollars to the original sixteenmilliondollar contract over its sixmonth lifepeanuts considering the fact that the contract as written already was paying allstrong a little bit more than eightyeight thousand dollars a day all of it in cash allstrong had requested a total of a hundred thousand dollars from ramsdale for the water but the colonel had been so used to thinking in onemonth units that hed okayed six times the requested price and allstrong had seen no reason to correct him and after all the truth was that they were all working in an extremely hostile environment where the danger of death was real and omnipresent in allstrongs view that risk should not go without significant reward even if much of it turned out to be under the table it wasnt as though people like ramsdale didnt know what was happening in fact ramsdale was planning to retire from the active military before the year was out and hed already made a commitment to stay on in iraq as one of allstrongs senior security analysts at a salary of per year standing over by his wall map allstrong caught the latest toss of the packet of bills from nolan and turned it over in his hands so it wasnt a question it wasnt an answer the tone seemed to say im holding on to fifty thousand dollars in cash when last year i was flat broke he smiled how sweet is this huh ron yes sir nolan tipped up his scotch its turning out to be a good year yes it is allstrong crossed over to his desk casually flipping the wrapped bills package over to nolan and i think it could be even better but im leery of burning out my best assets which are men like you no no no dont give me any of that false modesty bullshit i send you out to do a job and you get the job done its not every guy in the world can walk around with two million dollars and not be tempted to disappear with it this was more than just idle chatter that exact temptation though for far less moneya quarter of a million dollarshad proven too strong for at least one of allstrongs other senior employees in the past two months beyond that almost two dozen of his first crew of guard hiresfrom prekuvan sourceshad disappeared with guns and credentials almost as soon as theyd been issued them but ron nolan merely shrugged you pay me well jack i like the work its nice to get a regular paycheck beyond whichhe broke his own smilei disappear with two million of your money im pretty sure youd hunt me down and kill me allstrong pointed a finger at him youre not all wrong there nothing personal no of course not allstrong put a haunch on the corner of his desk what im getting at is whether youre starting to feel stretched a little thin no im good i ask because another opportunity has come upi know theyre growing on trees nowadays but if i dont pick em somebody else will anyway i wanted to run it by you see if you wanted to take point on it i should tell you i consider it pretty high risk even for here taking a walk over here is high risk jack yes it is but this is in the sunni triangle nolan tossed the package up and caught it he shrugged whats the gig pacific safetyrick slocums outfit hes tight with rumsfeldjust pulled in a contract through the corps of engineers to rewire the whole goddamn triangle in three months highvoltage wiring and all the towers to hold it you ready for this hes going to need seven hundred guards for his people nolan whistled seven hundred i know a shitload but im sure kuvan can get em im sure he can too you gotta love them kurds who doesnt soyou want to hear the numbers sure nolan said i havent had a good hardon in a couple of days with the wrapped bills in one hand and his tumbler of scotch in the other he got up and crossed over to allstrongs desk his boss pulled over the adding machine and started punching and talking lets assume two hundred a month for the guards what were paying now good weve got seven hundred guys working for ninety days thats four hundred twenty thousand plus food and ammo and other incidentals lets go wild and call that twenty bucks a man per day so fortytwo grand shooting high call our whole expense five hundred grand slocum told me off the record that because of the high risk in the area he expects the winning bid to come in at no less than twelve mil which is exactly what im going to bid it at and which if youre doing your mathhe hit the calculatoris a threemonth profit of eleven million five hundred thousand dollars ive definitely got wood nolan said so youre in if we get it all the way jack wed be crazy not to i agree but im not sugarcoating it im thinking we might lose a dozen guys im talking dead not deserted or disappeared okay thered be a significant bonus in it for you twenty a month sound good when do i start first lets get the gig but remember i want you to be sure youre good with it youll have your bare ass hanging out there and seven hundred guys guarding it jack can i bring my escorts i like that guy scholler he runs a tight ship ill talk to calliston but i cant imagine thered be any problem he doesnt even know who those guys are poor bastards hey allstrong said they enlisted whatd they expect he went around his desk and stood looking out the window at the airport outside an enormous c globemaster iii transport plane coasted by on the tarmacseveral hundred more tons of supplies and equipment direct from the united states without turning around he said so between now and then whats your schedule look like when exactly next couple of weeks pretty free i got the message out up at anaconda and tikrit weve definitely got friends trying to hook us up in both places but theyve got to clear their own brass first we might have to sub under kbr but i got the sense theyre generally open to us doing what weve done here whatever happens its going to take a little time why now allstrong did turn id like to send you back to the states for a week or two clean up some problems in the home office id go myself but i dont feel like i can leave here just now if we want to pick up these jobs were talking about youd be back in plenty of time for the triangle thing if that comes about and after today payrolls covered until next time what kind of problems well allstrong tipped up the last of his scotch i hired a private eye and hes found arnold zwick the idiot went back home to frisco zwick was the companys senior executive whod disappeared with a quarter million dollars of allstrongs money about six weeks before id kind of like to get my money back i was hoping you could talk some sense into him after that take a little welldeserved r and r wherever you want to go sound good when do you want me to leave i can get you on a plane to travis tomorrow morning done allstrong broke a smile you know ron i hate it when you take so long to make your decisions i know nolan said its a flaw im working on it at his desk allstrong picked up a manila envelope and handed it across to nolan if whats in that doesnt answer all your questions ill brief you further in the morning now youd better go do some packing im gone nolan executed a brisk salute and whirled around his hand was on the doorknob when allstrong spoke behind him arent you forgetting something nolan straightened up and turned around as he pulled the packet of bills out from under his jacket he was smiling oh you mean this old thing he tossed it back to his boss just seeing if youre paying attention jack keeping you on your toes pretty much always allstrong said i can see that catch you in the morning dear tara so today i got to walk through some of the mean streets of scenic baghdad with this crazy guy ron nolan who didnt seem to know or care that we were in hostile territory hes one of the security guys for allstrong which you may remember from my last letter if youre reading them is the contracting firm that weve somehow gotten semipermanently attached to i find it ironic to say the least that im supposed to be out protecting him this guy needs protection like a duck needs a raincoat it was too surreal hes there to collect the companys payroll for this month so im thinking were going to go in someplace like a bank and get a check from bremers people that allstrong can then go deposit in their bank wrong theyve got barbed wire and cement blocks set up in the hallway in front of this door nolan shows his id to the marine sergeant on duty with his whole platoon the place is a fortress anyway we pass the id checkeverybody knows nolanand theywalk us into this tiny internal roomno windows out to the hall even stucco is still all over the floors from when the building was bombed in april no drywall either after saddam left town the looters came in and took everything and i mean everything rebar out of the walls internal wiring you wouldnt believe it theres not a desk in the whole ministry buildingeverybody uses folding tables like you get at walmart i wouldnt be surprised if we bought em from walmart and had em shipped over anyway so were in this small dim dirty room four lightbulbs its roughly a hundred and fifty degrees in there and theres these two guys who take nolans papers check em over then disappear into what looks like a warehouse behind them ten minutes later theyre back with a shopping cart full of packages of hundreddollar bills im standing there thinking theyre kidding me right but they count out these forty wrapped bags of fifty thousand dollars each andyou wont believe thisnolan signs off on the amount and together counting them a second time we load em all up into his backpack picture this nolans got two million american dollars in cash in a backpack hes wearing and were walking out through this mob of not very friendly people in the lobby of the republican palace and then were back outside the green zone strolling through the impoverished baghdad streets that are crawling with citizens who make less than a hundred dollars a month and who really dont like us was i a little nervous is this guy out of his mind or what and i got the sense he was loving it long story short a couple of blocks along through this really really crowded marketplace and finally we hooked back up with my guys in the convoy and made it out of town and back to the base here where jack allstrong has supposedly got a huge safeflown in from america of coursebolted into the cement foundation under his office anyway lots more to tell about some of the other insane elements of the economics of this placeall the cooks here at the base are filipinos and the actual guards out at the airport are from nepal we met a guy named kuvan today who evidently supplies allstrong with all these workers nolan tells me none of them make more than a hundred and fifty bucks a month where he makes twenty thousand he tells me thatwhen i get done with my service here i should volunteer to come back and work for allstrong examerican military guys make out like bandits here youd love it if i went that way huh okay enough about this place you hear about iraq enough anyway im sure what id really like to know is if youre reading any of these if im at least communicating with you a little its hard you not answering tara if youve gotten this far on this letter and you dont want me to write to you anymore just tell me somehow and i promise ill stop if youve made up your mind and its completely over but some part of me holds on to the hope that you might be willing to give us another try when i come home i know as you said a hundred times if i get home well heres the deal im coming home im just having a hard time accepting that our slightly different politics have really broken us up its true that i think sometimes its okay to fight for something either because you believe in the cause or because youve signed on to fight youve given your word its as simple as that maybe you dont think that and we can argue about it more someday i hope if you could just write me back one way or the other tara id love to hear from you i love you still hey evan he looked up to see ron nolan standing in the doorway that led back to the dormitory where his men slept he had written his letter sitting in muted light at a table in the otherwise empty mess hall now hed just finished addressing his envelope and put his pen down nodding in acknowledgment sir nolan stepped into the room hey havent we already been over this youre evan im ron what are you twentyfive twentyseven well im thirtyeight give me a break you call me sir i feel old i feel old i get mean i get mean i kill people then youd be to blame its a vicious circle and it would all be your fault the last words hed written to tara still with him evan had to force his face into a tolerant smile youd just kill somebody at random nolan was up to the table by now grinning its been known to happen its not pretty you want a beer evan had a nagging feeling that this recreational drinking could become a slippery slope it would make the second time hed had alcohol since his arrival over here but then really he thought what the fuck with everything else that was going on over here who really cared nevertheless he took a halfswing at reluctance were not supposed to drink he said oh right i forgot nolan cocked his head are you fucking kidding me somebody here gonna bust you youre in charge here dude i know im thinking about my men whats that like a mantra with you you see that in a movie or something i dont see any of your guys around who are going to be scandalized they wont even see dont be a dweeb ill get you a beer one evan was talking to his back as he turned okay for starters nolan walked back into the kitchen opened an enormous doubledoored refrigerator and returned carrying two bottles of budweiser twisting off the top of one he slid it down the length of the table to where evan stopped it and brought it to his lips when he finished his first sip nolan was sitting across from him theres email out here you know he pointed at the envelope mom or girlfriend exgirlfriend i emailed her all during training and she never answered its too goddamn easy to hit delete or change your address so now i write letters he shrugged stupid but maybe some kind of physical connection if shes your exgirlfriend why are you writing her i dont know its probably a waste of time im an idiot he took another pull at his beer id just like to know if shes even getting these damn letters so thats not the first one its like the tenth and she hasnt written back not even once it was a pretty bad fight we disagreed about the war people dont break up over that we did he looked across the table but then sometimes i think maybe somethings happened to her i cant believe she wont write me back maybe shes not getting them if shes read em i know shedmaybe she died or something happened and she cant cant what i dont know nolan spun his bottle slowly dude he said no offense but youre sounding a little pathetic here you are laying your life on the line every day you got bigger fish to fry yeah i know he slugged down a mouthful i know you want to just give it up if i heard from her maybe itd be easier you are hearing from her think about it yeah youre right i know youre right he tipped up his bottle and drained it nolan got up and went back into the kitchen returned with another round twisted off evans cap and passed it across to him as he sat down so whered you go to school santa clara college boy huh at evans shrug nolan went on hey no crime in that i went two years to berkeley couldnt stand the place though so i went out and enlisted made the seals and life got good you finish yep whatd you do after became a cop nolan cracked a grin and nodded i had a feeling you were a cop whys that you look like a cop i know a lot of cops who dont look like me you know what youre looking for i bet they do nolan drank his grin in place its how you walk how you carry yourself youre a big guy you keep yourself in good shape i would have guessed a cop heres to good cops everywhere nolan straightened up raised a flat palm and evan reached up and slapped it hard enough that the clap rang in the empty room back down on his seat nolan raised his bottle and the two men clinked them together and drank them down in one long gulp when nolan got back with the next round and theyd clinked again he pointed down at the letter still on the table between them you in touch with anybody else back home who can talk to her find out whats happening not really this place isnt the best for communication maybe youve noticed you got family yeah butwhat am i supposed to do ask my brother or my mother to go see if tara s okay thatd just be weird shed think i was stalking her or something well nolan tipped up his beer again heres the deal im flying back to san fran tomorrow you give me that letter ill go put the damn thing right in her hand ask her if shes read the other ones find out the story be back here in two weeks youre going home what for he waved away the question just some logistics stupidity for jack office problems show a presence and make sure the staff is on board with the big picture we get either one of these new contracts were going to need a new building back at home he shrugged business stuff but the point is ill have plenty of time to drive down to redwood city suss out whats going on with your babe exbabe whatever he reached out and turned the envelope around looked down and read tara wheatley cute name anyway cute girl evan said i believe you you really wouldnt mind going down and giving her the envelope nolan spread his hands expansively hey dude please forget about it its done ron nolan sat on the top step of the shaded outdoor stairway that led to the second landing at the edgewood apartments in redwood city california the shade came courtesy of a brace of giant magnolia trees that stood sentinel over the entrance to the apartment complex an hour ago at about five oclock hed climbed the steps and rung the doorbell at c but no one had answered he could have called first and made an appointmenttara wheatley was listed in the phone bookbut he thought it would be better if he just showed up and delivered the letter in person he didnt want to give her the option of saying she wouldnt see him didnt care if she ever got another letter from evan that would have complicated the whole thing it was better to simply show up and complete the mission he wasnt in any hurry hed give it an hour or two and if she didnt come home in that time hed come back either later tonight or tomorrow evan had told him that this time of the summer she was probably spending most days in her classroom preparing it for the start of the school year tara taught sixth grade at st charles a catholic school in the next town evan assumed that she wasnt dating anybody else at least not yet so he was reasonably sure shed be around by dinnertime most nights if everything was still okay with herif she wasnt hurt or sick or dead so nolan waited comfortable on the hard stone step the weather was really ideal an afternoon floral scent from the gardenia hedge overlying the auto exhaust from the busy street the freshcutgrass smell from the lawn below him a faint whiff of chlorine from the complexs pool a corner of which was visible off to his left if he closed his eyes nolan could almost fool himself that he was back for a moment in high school people were laughing and splashing down at the pool and the disembodied sounds combined with the softness of the air to lull him after a while carrying him away from what had become his real world of dust and duty danger and death like the trained animal he was he came back to immediate full consciousness as a new vibration from the steps registered with his psyche he looked down and saw a woman in a simple twopiece blue bathing suit stopped now on the third step turned away from him exchanging some banter with other friends whod obviously just left the pool too from the shade of her wet hair he imagined it would be blond when it dried a thick fall of it hung down her back to a little below the halter strap shed hooked a finger through her beach towel and thrown it carelessly over one shoulder nolans eyes swept over the length of her body and he saw nothing about it he didnt like her skin was the color of honey he shifted on his step to get a better look just as she turned and glanced up at him catching him in the act she shot him a brief complicitous smile that was neither embarrassed nor inviting then quickly went back to the goodbye to her friends one of them left her with some parting remark that nolan didnt quite hear but her spike of carefree laughter carried up to him he hadnt heard a sound like that in a while then she was coming up the stairs toward him nolan stood up he was wearing black shoes pressed khakis and a tuckedin camo shirt he was holding evans letter in his hand suddenly she stopped halfway up all trace of humor suddenly washed from her face as tears welled in her eyes she brought her hand up to her mouth oh my god she said its not evan is it tell me its not evan realizing what she must be thinkingthat he was the armys messenger sent to inform her of evans death in iraq nolan held out a reassuring hand and said evans fine completely fine im sorry if i startled you you must be tara still knocked out of her equilibrium she nodded yes butthis is about evan down below one of her male friends called up to her tara everything okay it gave her an instant to collect herself turning she waved im fine its okay coming back to nolan her voice had firmed up who are you then what are you doing here you had me thinking evan had been killed im sorry my names ron nolan im a friend of evans over there i should have realized what id look like waiting here for you to show up im sorry okay youre sorry she pointed at the envelope he held whats that then its a letter that evan asked me to handdeliver to you he was worried about you why would he worry about me hes the one in the war zone well he hasnt received any letters back from you thats right thats because i havent written any we broke up maybe he didnt tell you that what does he want me to say i dont know nolan held the envelope out to her im just the messenger here my job is to give you this last letter and then to tell evan that youre all right im fine yes i can see that you want to take this she didnt move he waited the envelope in his outstretched hand looking at her taken by her remarkable face her hair was pulled back it revealed a clear wide forehead shed just come from swimming so there was no makeup to cover the landscape of pale freckles under her widely spaced glacierblue eyes that spilled over onto welldefined cheekbones even without lipstick her mouth looked slightly bruised nolan forced himself to look away it took a serious effort tara looked down at the envelope does he think i havent gotten his other letters she asked her shoulders settled as something seemed to give in her i dont want to start again with him doesnt he see that its never going to work because you disagree about the war its not just that no no why do you ask that because he seems to think it is just about the war i mean although i told him and ill tell you the same thing people who love each other dont break up over that over agreeing about whether or not killing people is the way to solve the worlds problems oh yes they do i think neither of them moved and i didnt say that i loved him she said cocking his head he said when you thought i was here to tell you he was dead it seemed like you cared about him more than a little bit you can care about someone without either loving them or wanting them to die dont you think thats possible sure the woman was beautiful but nolan thought that a little attitude check wouldnt hurt her anythings possible he said for example its possible that you might even change your mind someday about the people who are risking their lives to guarantee your freedom hed clearly hit a nerve her whole face went dark thats not fair she said i have nothing but respect for the military his mouth smiled but his eyes didnt follow sure you do he said you just wouldnt want to marry one besides she went on this war isnt about guaranteeing anyones freedom its just about oil nolan shook his head as though fighting for oil or anything you needed was wrong he looked down at his hand and held it out are you going to take this letter or not her mouth set in a hard line she stared at the thing as though it were alive and could bite her and perhaps in some sense it could at last she shook her head i dont think so i havent even opened any of the others im not going to start reading them now he nodded again as though shed verified something for him what does that look mean nothing there was no look yes there was and it meant something okay you said you werent going to start reading evans letters now i guess the look meant spoken like someone whos afraid that if she gets some facts about what shes already decided on she might change her mind perhaps suddenly aware that she was standing arguing with a man while she was wearing less than her everyday underwear she pulled the towel up over her shoulders and held both ends of it closed over her breasts her voice went soft and low in anger im not afraid of getting facts misterwhat is it again nolan ron nolan all right mr nolan ron okay again he grinned taunting her okay ron hed gotten her heated up which was his intention for your information as a matter of fact i do have all the facts i need about evan and about this stupid war in iraq and i dont need his letters to make me feel sorry for him he made the decision to go over there he decided to leave me and do that now ive moved on and he cant just think hes going to explain his way out of it and if id just understand how hard it was for him then somehow wed get back together im not going to do that no i can see that nolan held out the letter again last chance when she didnt move to take it nolan slipped it into the pocket of his shirt and said ill tell evan youre in fine health excuse me nice to have met you moving past her he started down the steps when he got to the bottom she spoke mr nolan ron turning he looked up at her im not against the military she said im against evan being in this war theres a difference nolan raised his hand in a salute yes maam he said if you say so at seventhirty he rang her doorbell again she answered the door in tennis shoes a pair of running shorts and a black nike tank top her hair back in a ponytail she still hadnt put on any makeup and it looked as though shed been crying im not going to read that letter she said first thing i already told you yes you did im not here for that wellwhat well pretty clearly youre not with evan anymore i thought maybe youd like to go get a drink somewhere she crossed her arms youre asking me on a date im asking if youd like to go get a drink or something not that big a commitment i thought i made it clear how i feel about getting involved with military people you did which would break my heart if i were a military person which fortunately im not but you said you were with evan over there i am but im a civilian i work for allstrong security evans based with our headquarters group im back home on assignment here for a couple of weeks and tonight im looking at dinner all by myself which isnt my favorite so as a last resort not exactly that but we had a couple of issues we could have fun talking about if we left evan out of it he looked around behind her into her apartment it doesnt look like youve got much of a party going here anyway no she sighed sensing that she was weakening he asked have you eaten no you can pick the place he said anywhere you want skys the limit sighing again she broke a weak smile and nodded thats a nice offer eating by myself isnt my favorite either and ive been doing a lot of that she met his eyes then looked away wrestling with the decision i dont want to have another fight about this war or about evan i dont want to fight either i just want to put myself on the outside of some good food and drink that does sound good she gave it another second or two then stepped back a bit holding the door open for him you want to come in and sit down a minute ill go put on some clothes she picked an understated and very good italian place on laurel street in san carlos maybe a mile from her apartment a car ride short enough to preclude much in the way of conversation nolan usually voluble in any situation found himself somewhat tonguetied from the minute she walked out of her hallway in low heels and the classic simple black spaghettistrap dress she wore a gold necklace that held a single black pearl and matching earrings shed put her hair up revealing a graceful neck showcasing the face in relief neither the bathing suit shed been wearing when hed met her nor the tank top tennis shoes and running shorts when shed opened the door tonight had prepared him for the sophistication that she now exhibited before of course shed been pretty enough to attract himgoodlooking californiagirl cheerleaderbut now something in her style bespoke a worldliness and maturity that frankly intimidated him nolans style and his plan for that matter had been to tease her about her political leanings and beliefs wear her down get her laughing and eventually tipsy bed her and report back to evan that he was lucky she hadnt read his letters or written backshe wasnt worth the trouble now ten minutes of silence on the drive over pretty much shattered that plan try as he might and as much as he might have wanted he wasnt going to be able to take her that lightly it wasnt just the bare fact of her substantial beauty but a seriousness a gravitas that he couldnt remember ever having encountered before in the women hed known handing his keys to the valet in front of the restaurant nolan noticed that tara remained seated her hands clasped in her lap a test would he be a chivalrous gentleman if he opened the door or would that make him a chauvinist pig he hadnt worried about a social nicety like that in ten years and now suddenly he badly wanted to make the right decision to look good in her eyes but his only option was to be who he was and his parents had raised him to have oldfashioned manners so he came around and got her door for her she rewarded him with a small smile in which inordinately pleased he read approval the tuxedoed maître d knew who she was at least by looks he greeted her familiarly kissed her hand nodded at nolan with respect and perhaps a soupçon of envy and led them to a private banquette in the back lighting in the place was dim with pinpoint lights onto the tables to facilitate reading the menu tara ordered an italiansounding white wine hed never heard of and he asked for a beefeater martini up the waiter left tara sipped her water i said i didnt want to fight but were allowed to talk if you want if we dont it might get to be a long night ive been trying to avoid sensitive subjects okay but you havent said two words since my apartment thats because everything i thought of seemed risky like what nolan hesitated came out with it like how lovely you look see ive offended you already im not offended i think you are you frowned i did definitely i didnt mean to frown im not offended it wasnt an offended frown im even flattered thank you she scratched at the napkin next to her plate im just not very comfortable with compliments i suppose plus im a little nervous this might have been a mistake what you and me going out for dinner it just sounded so good to go out and sighing she killed a moment with another sip of water i dont want to give you the wrong impression about what about if this is a date like a boygirl date okay ill try not to get the wrong impression what would be the right one that its just dinner two people out at a restaurant together he smiled across at her as opposed to what a romantic dinner i guess i wasnt thinking this was going to be a romantic dinner thats probably why i frowned back to that huh you frowned because i said you were lovely which means im romantically interested something like that i suppose the waiter arrived with their drinks and nolan waited until hed moved out of earshot then sipped at his martini and picked up where theyd left off okay he said i promise im trying not to be romantically interested youre the girlfriend of a pal of mine so that would be awkward except you said that youre done with him i think ah a change in the story no not really i just wasnt thinking that i was going to go out with anybody else so soon i mean on a date ive got an idea how about we dont call this a date or anything else just let it be what it is do you have to decide that right away maybe not i just dont want to send you any mixed signals im not really with evan anymore but im you still care about him she raised her shoulders i dont know not answering his letters is a decision not having feelings about him isnt something you just decide i cant say im there yet and now here we are you and me you asked me out and i said yes i dont know why i did that you were hungry we could have gone to mcdonalds i didnt have to get dressed up this feelsdifferent than mcdonalds id hope so nolan leaned in across the table caught and held her gaze look tara its not that complicated i dont know you and the only two things i know about you are one that we probably disagree about the military which were not allowed to talk about and two youre very pretty thats just an observation and risky because you might think i was coming on to you which would put this more in the line of a date i admit so lets get that off the table right now he straightened back up this is not a date im way too old and what are you twentytwo try twentysix well im thirtyeight thats too much right there i could be your father around a small smile she sipped wine only if you were a very precocious elevenyearold i was he said and held out his stem glass heres to precocious children she stopped her glass halfway to his i dont know if i can drink to that i teach elevenyearolds if they were any more precocious wed need bars on the windows nolan kept his glass where it was all right he said heres to peace then is peace okay to drink to she clinked his glass peace is good she said peace would be very good nolan pulled into a space in the parking lot by her apartment he killed the engine and his lights and reached for his door handle you dont have to get out she said no i do a gentleman walks a woman to her door on a dark night thats all right ill be fine he sat back in his seat then turned to look at her youre trying to avoid that awkward hereweareatthedoor moment understood you dont have to ask me in for a nightcap i wont try to kiss you goodnight even if i am finding you marginally more attractive than before wed had such a good time that was a great meal it was but she spoke without much enthusiasm her hands clasped in her lap she sat facing forward stiff and unyielding what is it he asked are you all right she exhaled do you still have evans letter yes maam she didnt move i think i should read it i should read the other ones all right its in the glovebox right in front of you help yourself he opened the car door and stepped out the night smells of gardenia jasmine magnoliahed forgotten how beautiful it could be here in california in the summertime walking around the car he opened the passenger door tara sat still another second then opened the glove compartment picked out the envelope swung her legs and got out she said really ron im okay thats my place right up there you can see it from here yes you can but its against my religion to let you walk up there alone she sighed okay and no funny stuff he said from you i mean amused in spite of herself she looked up at him and shook her head ill try to keep myself under control holding up the letter so he could see she had it she turned and he fell in beside heracross the parking lot up the outside stairs unlocking her door she pushed it open and turned on the inside light safe she said thank you youre very welcome he executed a small bow i had a great time he said you sleep tight saturday he took her up to san francisco this one was a nondate he told her because it was in the daytime and a real date by definition had to be at night he picked her up at tenthirty in the morning and with the top down on his corvette they took highway up to the city the beautiful green back way crystal springs reservoir on their left and then farther on the great expanse of the glittering bay down to their right she didnt know the city as well as he did shed told him that at dinner and hed used it as his excuse to ask her out again she couldnt live as close as she did to one of the worlds great cities and not know very much about it it was morally wrong so they hit the palace of the legion of honor then swung back through golden gate park stopping for tea at the japanese tea garden after an hour inside the de young museum the fine august weather was holding up and parking at ghirardelli square they walked back up polk street and ate baguettes and pâté and drank red wine at one of the outdoor tables of a french bistro taking a walk afterward idly sightseeing they essayed the descent of lombard the crookedest street in the worldalthough it wasnt in fact even the crookedest street in the city nolan told her that distinction belonged to vermont street down in potrero hill nevertheless lombard was crooked and steep enough and he told her that she might want to put her hand on his arm for balance and she did in north beach at caffe trieste nolan brought their cappuccinos over and put them down on the tiny table in front of her okay he said riskyquestion time again this time more comfortable with him by now she smiled and said uhoh think you can handle it you never know but ill try evans letters what about them have you read them she looked down at her coffee lifted the cup and took a sip then put it down carefully why dont you just tell me im pretty again and well run with that instead okay youre pretty again after that ugly time you had back there for a while yeah that was terrible but the gag wasnt working her mouth went tight and she closed her eyes sighing then opened them and looked him full in the face not yet i tried starting to read them the other night but im still too emotional about him i havent changed my mind about what hes doing so theres really nothing he can say nolan took a long moment before he sipped his coffee another one before he spoke you dont see anything noble or glorious or even good in the warrior do you she briefly met his eyes the warrior she said in a derisive tone the warrior thats right she shook her head evans not a warrior ron evans a simple soldier a grunt whos taking orders from men he doesnt respect fighting in a country that doesnt want us there risking his life for a cause he doesnt believe in i have a hard time with words like noble and glorious and good coming into that equation when i keep seeing waste and stupidity and ignorance okay nolan said we could maybe get in a good fight about this particular war but thats not what im talking about im talking about the philosophical concept of the warrior her face was still set in stone i never think about the warrior ron war is whats wrong with the world and always has been again nolan let a silence accumulate with all respect tara he said quietly you owe it to yourself to think about this to myself if youre dumping the guy youre in love with over it then yes to yourself ive told you i dont know if im in love with him anymore because he went to fight she slowly turned her coffee cup around i told him we could go to canada or anywhere else and what happens when canada or wherever feels threatened and needs soldiers but thats the point ron there was no threat iraq was no threat it was preemptive like germany invading poland america doesnt do that thats the point there are no wmds you wait and see the whole things a sham its about oil profits and thats all halliburton and those people cant you see that defense contractors you mean yes defense contractors big business cheney and his buddies well of course i see what youre saying but im in a little bit of a bind here because a defense contractor is who i work for but from my perspective were the guys who are protecting the army and the civilian admin guys over there were the ones feeding our troops moving water and supplies doing good work saving lives trying to rebuild the country that we destroyed in the first place nolan took a breath look tara war may be hell but that doesnt mean everybody involved in it is evil ive seen evil and believe me its a whole different animal than what youre thinking of so lets not talk about this war i grant you its got some issues lets talk about the warrior the warrior the warrior i dont want the warrior in my life thats all i dont want the warrior in the world ah but theres the crux of it of course it would be wonderful if there didnt need to be warriors just like it would be great if there were no evil in the world but heres the thingthere is evil and without warriors evil would triumph how bout this ron without warriors evil couldnt attack so its chicken and egg is that it which came first nohe put his hand on hers took it away as though it burned himlisten my point is this there is always going to be evil and yes it will attract evil warriors you buy that so far she managed a small nod okay he went on so evil and its minions are a given right right come on you admit that youve just admitted it and ps its true she hesitated then said okay yes so so once evils on the march whats going to stop it except a greater force for good she sat back and folded her arms the greater force doesnt always have to be physical it can be spiritual look at gandhi or martin luther king fighting should be a last resort i think a lot of socalled warriors are really warmongers picking fights to justify their own existence sometimes they are yeah and gandhi and king great men both of them no question and both assassinated i might point out and neither used their nonviolence in an actual war okay they fought evil but it wasnt on the march it wasnt to the warrior stage yet but even so for every king or gandhi youve got a neville chamberlain or somebody who doesnt want to fight its not till you get yourself a warriorlike say churchillthat you really can stop active evil you think hitler would have stopped by himself ever or saddam hussein for that matter we did stop him hussein she said he wasnt a threat nolan let his shoulders relax his face took on a peaceful neutrality his voice went soft tara please youve got it backward if he wasnt a threat it was because we did already stop him once our warriors stopped him in kuwait thats the only thing he understood tara was twirling her cup around in its saucer biting on her lower lip eventually she raised her eyes i dont like to think about this ron about evils place in the world he kept his voice low met her eyes again put his hand over hers and this time left it there i dont blame you tara nobody likes to think about it and some places like here in the us and on a gorgeous afternoon in this great city it can seem so far away as to be nonexistent thank god i mean thank god there are islands where the beast is kept mostly at bay its in its cage but the thing to remember is that somebody sometime had to put the beast in there and has to keep it there and thats why we needwe all need the world needswarriors how did you feel about evan being a cop her frown deepened her head moving from side to side i dont think i was exactly thrilled but that was different how she worried her lip for another moment soldiers their job is to kill cops they mostly protect and sometimes to protect dont they have to kill but its not the main job could that be because individual bad guys dont need an army to defeat them he took his hand away from hers and sat up straighter lifted his cup to his mouth put it back down looking at her he saw that her eyes had gone glassy and tears hung in their corners im sorry i dont mean to ruin your day and make you cry we can stop talking about this one tear fell leaving its streak on her face i dont know what im going to do its so hard it is he said i know im trying to do the right thing i can see that i should at least read his letters that might be nice but im still she stopped looked at him shook her head again i dont have any answers i dont know what i should do you dont have to decide anything today hows that she gave him a grateful smile better okay then he said i think thats about enough philosophy for one day why dont we blow this pop stand one of the landmarks of old san francisco was trader vics the restaurant where the mai tai was purportedly invented and a favorite hangout for the famous columnist herb caen and his pals the original vics had gone out of business decades ago but a couple of years back theyd opened a new one near city hall it had a great buzz and was the same kind of placea pacificislandthemed destination spot serving enormous pupu platters of vaguely asian appetizers that could be washed down with mai tais or any other number of generous rum drinks many of them served for two out of hollowed coconut shells nolan and tara had ordered one of these when they sat down and then had another with their dinner their relaxed sightseeing and later the intense conversations had drawn them closer somehow and blurred the distinction between date and nondate and by the time the waiter cleared the dinner trays and left them the check nolan was beginning to let himself consider the possibility that this incredible woman might like something in him after all clearly tara had an ambiguous commitment at best to evan scholler and she seemed to be enjoying his companylaughing teasing drinking not quite outright flirting certainly not coming on to him overtly but giving him a lot of her time and attention her foot nowhere near the brakes his personal code of honor regarding a fellow warrior wouldnt permit him to pursue her if she claimed any sort of allegiance to evan but shed rather definitively avoided that and if she responded to one of his overtures later then that would be a clear answer in itself nolan had known that they had valet parking at trader vics but as a general rule he wasnt too comfortable letting valet attendants get behind the wheel of his corvette so keeping his eyes open a few blocks before theyd reached the restaurant he had spied a miraculous section of free curb and hed pulled into it without much thought it had still been warm with a certain softness to the dusk light and walking a few extra blocks with tara had seemed both natural and appealing now outside it had grown dark in typical san francisco summer fashion the temperature had dropped twenty degrees in the past two hours and a chill biting wind off the pacific was scouring the dust off the streets and making the very air gritty they were on golden gate avenue an eastwest street that funneled the blow and intensified the unpleasantness tara said howd it get this nasty this fast the city got the patent on this weather back in the fortyniner days it was supposed to keep out the riffraff i dont think its worked too well but theyve kept it up why dont you go back inside and ill get the car and come back for you we dont have to do that its not that far i can take it youre not too cold tara was wearing sandals and shorts and a tshirt with the midriff showing california summer gear now ridiculously inappropriate but she just laughed its only a few blocks its invigorating dont you think nolan in civilian shoes khakicolored dockers and a tommy bahama silk shirt nodded and said invigorating good word you sure lets go at the first corner they hit polk street they stopped at the curb for the light he noticed that her teeth were beginning to chatter its closer going back to trader vics than it is to the car youre sure you dont want to do that you think im that much of a wimp i never said that but you do seem cold ill be fine promise okay then he put his arm around her this is for warmth only he told her dont get any ideas perhaps a little tipsy she folded her arms across her chest and leaned slightly into him warmth is good she said then added come on light come on but just then before the light changed a break in the traffic opened up and taking her hand he squeezed it vámonos and they darted out into the street in the next block and the one after that the streetlights werent working even though they were only a few blocks from city hall nolan realized that they were entering the tenderloin district one of the citys worst neighborhoods where services tended to need upkeep they walked quickly still holding hands their footfalls echoing and at the next crosswalklarkinhad to stop again for traffic and the light behind them a prostitute in a black minidress and fishnet top stepped out from the lee of a building are you two looking to party from the voice nolan realized that the woman was a man ive got a place right here behind us thanks but were good nolan stepped between tara and the prostitute just going to our car isnt this the street up to the left tara whispered to him one more they jumped the light again and moved into the next darkened block suddenly the glittering city theyd been enjoying all day had disappeared the breeze carried on it the acrid smells of garbage and urine in the passing cars headlights nolan could see that nearly every doorway they passed held a person lying down bundled up in cloth or newspaper at a break in the traffic they crossed over in midblock all but running now with cold and adrenaline they turned up leavenworth toward eddy into the heart of the tenderloin butthe good newsthey were now only a bit more than a half block from where theyd parked as it turned out though that distance wasnt going to be short enough the three young africanamerican men appeared out of nowhere and blocked their way tara whispered oh god and moved in a step behind nolan all of the men wore heavy hooded jackets and as they fanned to surround the couple the one in front of them flashed the blade of a knife where yall hurryin up to he asked nolan following the flow as the men moved into position one to the side into the street and the other behind them let go of tara s hand and put an arm protectively around her waist our cars just up the street there he said pointing the vette im guessing thats right nice ride yes it is im hoping that its still in good shape the leader spoke to his troops he hopin it still in good shape you hear that man worried about his wheels coming back to nolan he moved the knife to his other hand thing is we been watchin it make sure nobody mess wid it you know what im saying i appreciate that nolan said he turned now placed the position of his other two assailants clearly in his mind then moved sideways a bit with tara so that he could see any movement from the man behind him in case he was getting ready to strike looking now directly at the three men one at a time he said but my girlfriends cold and she really needs to get inside the car right away he reached behind him as though reaching for his wallet how much can i pay you gentlemen for watching over my car for me ron tara began just stay cool he whispered tightening his grip on her waist holding her to him somehow hed taken the keys from his pocket and now he found one of her hands and pressed them into it when it starts he whispered directly into her ear get to the car and get it running when what starts ron you cant nolan started to reply when with no warning beyond a guttural obscenity the leader suddenly lunged forward leading with the knife nolan pushed tara back out of the way then ducked away from the attack deflecting the knife and kicked out behind him hitting the trailing man in the knee the man screamed and went down nolan whirled kicked again and caught the leader in the hip knocking him into the third guy coming in from the street it was only a temporary holding action but it gave the couple an instants reprieve and for tara a clear run to the car go he yelled to her she ran nolan saw the shadow looming up in his periphery and he ducked away and slashed backward as he turned seeing the glint of the knife he came down with a chop on the wrist above it and it clattered away on the sidewalk he no longer knew whether he was fighting the leader or the second guy but it didnt matter close enough to smell him now he lifted a knee into the mans groin and when he doubled over followed it with a rabbit punch to the mans neck knowing that hed killed him as much by the way he fell as anything he saw that there was still another knife in the equation the other man swung a wide broadside at him and nolan stepped back let it pass harmlessly in front of him then stepped inside and delivered a flathand uppercut to the base of mans nose driving the cartilage back into the brain the body straightened for an instant before crumpling back to the street looking back at the first man whose knee hed shattered nolan realized that while he was no longer a threat he was a witness and witnesses nolan firmly believed were bad luck a brief scan of his surroundings confirmed that there were no othersnone of the homeless were huddling in doorways on this block the man was still down moving on the ground pushing himself in a crablike fashion back and away from the fight it took nolan only a few steps a couple of seconds to get back next to him dude he said he was breathing hard but his voice was almost apologetic devoid of any emotion this was a bad idea you got to stop this shit your leg okay can you get up you ought to get that looked at here let me help you the young man hesitated for a minute but then took nolans outstretched hand and allowed himself to begin to be lifted but as soon as he had the leverage he needed nolan reached his other hand around the mans neck found his chin and gave it a vicious snap back and sideways letting this last body fall back to the sidewalk nolan looked down at the carnage hed wreaked satisfied he broke back up the street at a jog jumped over the fallen leader and in a couple of dozen steps was where tara had started the car and already maneuvered it out from the curb ready to make a getaway he knocked on the cars trunk as he was going around the back of it and then opened the passenger door and jumped in breathless are you okay he asked her can you drive she was holding the wheel shivering and managed a nod hit it then now tara drove in silence for about six blocks before she pulled over and stopped the car i dont think i can drive anymore she said ill take it she looked over at him for the first time since hed gotten in with her are you hurt no what happened to them i dont know they got tangled up in each other and that must have slowed them down enough to give me a minute to come running after a minute she said we could have been killed couldnt we i dont know about that i think maybe they were trying to feel us out thats all they didnt have guns they probably would have just taken our money and other stuff if we would have let them she sat still and allowed the silence to gather there in the confined space then letting out a staggered breath she opened the car door and got out nolan took the cue and did the same on his side waiting for her to get in the passenger seat before he closed the door behind her behind the wheel he belted up and got back into traffic god she said after a while youre sure youre all right i cant believe that just happened it was so fast just suddenly they were there yeah thats how it happens he glanced across at her i shouldnt have parked there i should have known better i wasnt thinking im so sorry you dont need to be sorry it wasnt your fault in fact if you hadnt been there but he shook his head then you wouldnt have been there you would have parked at the valet station like any other thinking human being well still she hugged her arms to herself god i just cant stop shaking its okay he said its just adrenaline he took his right hand off the wheel and held it out if itll help he said heres a hand you can hold it took her a moment to decide she took in a breath and let it out then reached over and put her hand in his bringing both hands over the gearshift and into her lap then covering them with her other hand thank you she said that helps there was no argument about whether he should walk with her to her door she opened it flicked on the inside light and turned back toward him her face reflecting her turmoil breaking a weak somehow apologetic smile she started to raise her hand then let it fall i was going to say thank you i had a good time butshe met his eyesim a little confused right now is that all right thats fine nolan said im going to read evans letters as well you should i dont want you to think im being ungrateful why would i think that well for saving my life and everything for being a warrior that brought the trace of a smile i wondered if that had occurred to you but you dont owe me anything tara and certainly nothing for that he gently chucked her chin with his index finger dont you worry about me im fine youve just had a trauma youre going to need to process its okay youre home now have a good night and with that he came forward quickly kissed her cheek and backed away close the door he said thats an order unable to sleep she finally got to the letters they were from evans heart and soul the way she remembered him came through loud and clear in every onemostly chatty and irreverent but then always there with the real stuff at the end he missed her he loved her and wanted them to try again when he got home when but it wasnt when she knew it was if there was no certainty that hed come back alive or in one piece she couldnt shake the idea that even as she was reading his words he might already be dead she wasnt about to commit to him again and then have him die over there there would be no commitment she knew until they were back together in person until these philosophical issues had been resolved one way or the other to give him hope before that would just be counterproductive and stupid tara was reading in her bed with blankets over her wearing pajamas and her warmest bathrobe against her continued shivering even though it was a balmy night in redwood city finally she put down the latest letterit was the fifth or sixth one shed readand closed her eyes trying to picture the evan she had known in her mind trying to dredge up a feeling from the time when shed thought they were the perfect couple that theyd marry and have a family and a wonderful life together it wasnt coming easy part of her perhaps most of her still believed that she loved him that he would come home from this war and theyd start over and work out all the issues but hed been gone now for several months and shed spent the time putting him behind her when he came backif he came backtheyd see where they were she thought that if she and evan were in fact the perfect couple if they were meant to be together then nothing could keep them apart but in the meanwhile she had her life and her principles she wasnt going to remain in a relationship where those principles were compromised from the beginning but tonights object lesson with ron nolan had shaken some of those core beliefs they had been set upon by bad people who wished them harm and without nolan to defend her she might very well suddenly the memory of the assault came over her againthe men surrounding them with knives glinting in their fists the utter lack of warning when the unexpected first thrust came at them if ron hadnt been thereor no more than thatif he hadnt been who he was it could have ended so badly it could have been not just a robbery but the end of her life of everything a fresh wave of adrenaline straightened her up in the bed throwing off her covers she went to the window in the bedroom and pulled aside the drapes a couple of inches just enough so that she could see out the bluelit water in the pool down below was still no shadows moved on the lawn in the surrounding hedges all was peace and suburban serenity letting the drapes fall she crossed her bedroom and turning on lights as she walked she went out into the living room she opened the closet in that room the other one by the front door then she turned and went into the kitchen the window over the sink looked down on the parking lot and she turned out the kitchen lights so that she could more clearly see outside in the puddle of one of the streetlights ron nolans corvette faced away from her apartment toward the entrance to the driveway that led into the parking lot the top was down and it was close enough that she could easily see ron himself still in the front seat his elbow resting on the windowsill she looked at the clockhed left her at the door nearly fortyfive minutes before ron hed heard the footsteps coming up and had forced himself to remain still facing forward until shed come abreast of him now he looked over at her in her tshirt jeans and sandals hey lowkey what are you doing just sitting here enjoying the night she seemed to need more explanation and he gave it to her i was a little wound up earlier i thought id decompress a little before braving the roads again i thought youd be asleep by now no she said i was wound up too pausing she let out a small breath i read evans letters i think hes still confused i know i am about what us me and him what im going to do what do you want to do about evan if i knew that i wouldnt be confused would i i havent been fair to him either i should write and tell him what ive been feeling and what is that that maybe we still have a chance if hes willing to try to get through all this stuff but that has to be in the future when he gets back if he does get back i cant commit again until then till we see what weve got does that sound fair to you im not an unbiased source he said it sounds to me like you just said you werent committed to him we broke up five months ago ron she took in a breath what were you really doing out here she asked i was enjoying the night the smells the absence of gunfire he looked up at her i was also hoping you might not be able to sleep and youd see me down here and that youd come down and that id see you again maybe walk you back to your door after a second she said you could do that in san francisco deputy chief of inspectors abe glitsky entered the homicide detail at ninethirty on the following monday morning darrel bracco one of glitskys early protégés looked up from the report he was writing and almost spilled his coffee standing up to attention saluting yelling tenhut glitsky felt the scar through his lips straining against the rare urge to smile in the end as usual the smile never appeared some inspectors in the room looked up of course though nobody else went military on him but bracco was still on his feet expectantly he evidently had some knowledge of why the head of homicide lieutenant marcel lanier had summoned the deputy chief marcel told me to keep an eye out for you sir i was just warning him that youre here glitsky stopped on the off chance that hes misbehaving in some way you never know bracco said he fell in beside glitsky then nodded at another inspector a woman named debra schiff who looked up and was getting to her feet while bracco went on schiff was in there with him with the door closed for an hour already this morning to look at her youd never know she was a screamer schiff gathering some stuff from her desk nodded at abe and replied in a conversational tone bite me darrel glitsky kept walking bracco and schiff behind him at laniers open door he knocked the lieutenant was on the phone feet up on his desk and waved everybody in his new office upstairs was at least twice as large as the cubicle he and glitsky before him had inhabited one floor below there was room for as many as half a dozen people in front of his desk with four chairs folded up against the back wall with its active homicides blackboard glitsky unfolded one of the chairs and let the other two inspectors grab theirs i understand lanier was saying into the phone yes sir thats why ive asked abe to come down and get briefed nohe rolled his eyes with the tedium of it alli realize we dont want to he moved the telephone away from his ear and glitsky could hear a voice he recognized as frank batistes the chief of police so whatever this was about it had some profile already yes sir lanier repeated in the next pause thats the idea i will yes sir finally he hung up got his feet back down on the ground and brought his upper body in close to the desk elbows on it that was the chief i got that impression glitsky said hows frank doing this fine morning franks concerned about our citizenry lest they panic and why would they do that well thats what i asked you down to talk about since the medias going to be all over this if it gets out and i know how much you cherish all things that give you face time in front of cameras everyone appreciated the irony of laniers statement within the department glitsky was notorious for two things he didnt tolerate or use profanity and he hated interactions with any form of media unfortunately this latter made up about eightyfive percent of his job now a tight look of resigned patience firmly in place abe sat back and crossed one leg over the other one ankle on knee okay what do we got lanier glanced at his two inspectors came back to glitsky weve got the possibility of a serial killer ah glitsky said and we havent had one of those for a while hence the panic lanier said which frank would so like to avoid anyway i thought id let darrel and debra get you up to speed and you can decide where we are exactly and how we handle things if it gets hot he nodded at his female inspector whose pretty face she tried to make invisible with limited success by wearing a tough expression most of the time debra you want to start sure bent over slightly in her chair she had her elbows on her knees her hands clasped in front of her raising her chin she shifted a little to face glitsky its not much of a story by itself but last wednesday i got a late call down in the mish early am theres a body in an alley down there around the corner from the makeout room white male decently dressed his wallets still in his back pocket turns out hes a thirtysixyearold exnavy seal named arnold zwick no criminal record unmarried and unconnected currently unemployed but hed evidently come back from iraq recently where hed done some work for allstrong security which is based here in town what kind of work glitsky asked whatever they do over there with former military guys i went back to allstrong and they told me that their main contract right now is protecting baghdad airport but they didnt know where zwick had gone to the manager of the office told me they thought that he might have been killed over there one day he just disappeared except that we now know he came back here and some witnesses i talked toneighbors hed made friends withseemed to have had the impression that he had a lot of money but its not in a bank account that ive been able to find and there wasnt any cash in his apartment so robbery might still be a motive either that or he had the stuff hidden pretty well glitsky asked do you think its possible he stole money from allstrong over there debra nodded apparently pleased at the question that was my assumption too sir especially given the way he died and how was that somebody snapped his neck close work glitsky said not that easy its even harder when you factor in zwicks training and that there was no sign of struggle or a weapon from his attacker and zwick was heavily armed he had a knife in a sheath on his leg and a fortyfive carried loose in his coat pocket both still on him when i got to him so his killer glitsky said was another commando you were thinking probably with allstrong somehow getting back their money debra nodded that is kind of where i was going until marcel called me yesterday and told me about darrels latest glitsky shifted his interest over to bracco talk to me he said three street thugs all with sheets all of em young strong and armed out for a good time on saturday night in the tenderloin all of em killed by hand maybe they just decided to mug the wrong guy the same guy who killed zwick but thats a stretch dont you think the stretch is why he would have stayed around glitsky said if hes one of the allstrong people there arent any allstrong people though debra said the whole staff is over in iraq theyve got a woman manager over here in a tiny office by candlestick and a couple of clerks none of em had ever met zwick personally and i believe them on the other hand lanier interjected maybe we got a bona fide wacko whos getting off on killing people with his hands these tenderloin meatballs we got two broken necks and a septum jabbed up into the brain but theres no connection we can come up with between zwick and these dirtbags none of the victims had anything stolen off them glitsky scratched at his cheek how many brokenneck murders have you seen in the past twenty years marcel the lieutenant nodded i know what youre saying abe and every one of the very few was in the course of some kind of a fight these guys there was hardly a sign of a struggle the problem is that we got reporters already onto the storyi got a call at home this morning and so did frankand theyre salivating over this serial killer possibility glitsky chewed the inside of his cheek for a minute and allstrong hires navy seals and guys like that for their security work over in iraq thats what i gather debra said theyve got nice brochures but really as i said no people but lets not lose sight of the main question lanier said we dont want to spin this toward a serial killer loose in the city frank would have my balls excuse me debra but glitsky was standing up im doing my very favorite mondaymorning press briefing in fifteen marcel ill put that fire out at least until we get another broken neck what are you going to tell em lanier asked ill say i cant comment on ongoing investigations except to say that it would be irresponsible to print or run rumors of a serial killer when there is no evidence to support it and none of these victims are high profile we got three dead brothers in the hood and one dead unemployed white guy in the mish this stuff is unfortunate but it happens and the story goes away even if this guys the same guy bracco said who did all of them if it was glitsky said ive got to believe hes long gone by now and never coming back major charles tucker the senior auditor for aviation issues didnt like to leave the green zone any more than anyone else did but in the past ten days since ron nolan had shown up downstairs at the republican palace with his million requisition he had signed off on another million in cash to allstrong securityall of it approved by airbase security services coordinator colonel kevin ramsdale jack allstrong himself had shown up at his desk four times patiently explaining to tucker that obviously if he continued to question the need for money he was unaware of the sheer vastness of the task that allstrong security had contracted to undertake the airport itself biap was enormousthirtytwo thousand acres securing even half of all that land alone in a hostile country was a monumental job besides that allstrong needed immediate money to buy the cars and trucks that would deliver the new dinar cash all over the country on his latest contract he also needed more money for the bombsniffing dogs for his enormous payroll for food for his constantly growing influx of employees in spite of the danger inherent in every trip outside of the green zone tucker decided he had to see for himself what was going on out at biap leaving the republican palace in the early afternoon and in uniform he was chaffeured through the city and out to the airport by a threemercedes convoy of kbr security people who carried only sidearmsthe irony wasnt lost on him nevertheless by the time they arrived at the first airport checkpoint it was nearly four oclock in the afternoon there was as always a long line of cars ahead of his convoy all of them waiting to be searched and to have their papers inspected at this rate tuckers convoy wasnt going to get inside for at least another hour so to save himself the time he decided to get out of his vehicle and enter the compound on foot with any luck he could complete his informal inspection and start back to baghdad before his convoy even made it as far as the gate anyway they could uturn away and be gone with that much less of a hassle but no sooner had he gotten out of his car than he became aware of the sound of gunfire not distant gunfire which was so common in baghdad and often relatively harmless but nearby gunfire that seemed to be coming from the neighborhood just to his left adjacent to the eastern border of biap in contrast to the airports western edge which bordered the euphrates river and opened into a plain of flat and formless ditchcrossed farmland that gradually degraded into desert this eastern nomansland was a densely populated area of the ubiquitous lowlying dungbrown structures that seemed to make up so many of baghdads suburbs and that tucker knew to be home to hundreds of saddam husseins former officers gunfire in this area wouldnt be good news but still if it was confined to the neighborhood he knew that it neednt necessarily concern him here squatting moving along the safe side of the line of vehicles tucker had almost made it to the gate when he realized that the gunfire was in fact close by stopping he saw a handful of men scurrying along just outside the compound by the barricades that had sprung up along the perimeters fence all of the blackclad men had camod their facestucker knew that they werent regular army they all carried rifles and belts of ammunition and they were firing out into the suburbs still keeping low he sprinted to the gate where four menalso heavily armed in matching dark fatigueswere manning the entrance seemingly unconcerned with the firing going on behind them tucker walked up to the nearest of them hey holding up his hand major charles tucker what the hells going on over there the man who was not american looked over his shoulder then back at tucker he shrugged and spoke in a stiltedly correct british accent we were taking some fire from over there jack allstrong ordered our men to put them down youre attacking them it appears so yes you cant do that thats against policy again the man shrugged mr allstrong called them out well lets get mr allstrong here so he can call them off you cant conduct an offensive with nonmilitary personnel another man with the same accent as the first broke away from his inspecting comrades and got in front of tucker is there a problem sir you bet theres a problem he pointed to the shooters im assuming those men are working with allstrong whos in charge here i am whats your name khadka gurung where are you from nepal well mr gurung im a major in the us army private military forces are not allowed to attack insurgent groups but we were fired upon first from over there he pointed vaguely to the general neighborhood you were fired upon yes sir tucker pointed was anyone in this line of cars hit i dont believe so no sir but the cars were just sitting here like they are now thats correct and none of them were hit i dont believe so and nobodys firing from over there now no we must have driven them off either that mr gurung or there wasnt much of a concerted attack if they couldnt manage to hit stationary vehicles at less than a hundred yards maybe the attack was just celebratory gunfire which we hear all the time in baghdad how about that thats not impossible at that moment several of the group of commandos broke into a run across an open area toward the iraqi buildings theyre attacking for christs sake thats blatantly illegal wheres jack allstrong now hes got to call this off i need to talk to him right away do you think you could manage to arrange that gurung nonplussed by tuckers apparent anger said of course please to wait here and ill try to reach him in no great hurry he walked over to a small stucco building that looked as though it had recently been constructed just inside the gate he picked up a telephone tucker meanwhile whirled back to face the first man hed talked to who are you he snapped i am ramesh bishta well mr bishta while were waiting for mr allstrong can you tell me whats holding things up so badly here why cant you get this line moving the drivers he explained so many do not speak english it is difficult of course they dont speak english theyre mostly iraqis theyre delivering iraqi goods doing iraqi business dont you have people here at the gate who speak arabic no sir im sorry but no how about translators again no maybe someday tucker brought his hands to his head and squeezed his temples hed personally overseen the transfer of nearly six million dollars to allstrong security in the past two weeks and apparently jack allstrong couldnt find one local worker to speak arabic to the iraqis who needed to get into his airport to say nothing of the fact that against all regulations he was paying his private commandos to lead offensive military strikes against the civilian population tucker had come to believe that allstrong was playing fast and loose with the chaos that was iraq but now he was starting to believe that he didnt understand the half of it gurung returned and informed tucker than mr allstrong was on the way the next car at the gate finally got approval and moved on into the compound the raiding party seemed to have stopped for the moment at the back line of the neighborhood buildings tucker took the opportunity to ask gurung about the dogs im sorry the unfailingly polite guard shrugged the bombsniffing dogs i would assume they would be here at the gate checking the cars the trunks no i havent seen these dogs yet perhaps soon still smiling the soul of cooperation gurung asked to be excused for a moment he went over to bishta and after a short conversation the two men went and had a few words with their other two colleagues almost immediately they stepped away from the next car in the line and waved it through the gate and then the next and the next the line was starting to move tucker watched for a minute then stepped in front of the next car up holding up his hand to stop it the driver laid on his horn but tucker kept his hand up where it was holding him back mr gurung he yelled out whats happening now youve kept these people sitting here for hours and now youre just letting them in this finally brought a disturbed frown to gurungs face mr bishta said you told him the line should be moving faster yes but wellyou dont just wave em in now for christs sake you still gotta get their papers and check the cars maybe you get some iraqis down here at least a translator somebody who can speak arabic you get your bombsniffing dogs gurungs expression changed in the middle of the tirade his focus went to someplace out over tuckers shoulder and then suddenly he was walking away across the parade ground to intercept jack allstrong who was jogging up the two men stopped maybe twenty yards from where tucker stood after a short exchange of words allstrong put a quick reassuring hand on gurungs shoulder and then went past him as he strode toward the gate at this moment tucker still in the middle of the road holding up the flow of traffic got another blast from the horn of the car in front of him by now truly enraged he put his hand onto his sidearm and pointed the index finger of his other hand at the cars driverthe warning explicit and eloquent behind him he heard allstrongs relaxed voice maybe you want to step out of the way and let my men do their job major tucker whirled on him how can they do their job and question these people when they dont speak the language he said without pause he went on pointing to the commando team now hard up against the back of one of the buildings but before anything else youve got to call those men off they cant conduct an offensive sweep allstrong glanced over to them we were being fired on major its defensive we have to protect ourselves and we have every right to your men here tell me that nothings been hit which makes me doubt there was much of an attack allstrong pulled himself up to his full height his usually affable expression suddenly harsh maybe you missed the mortar attacks last month major that punched holes as big as volkswagens into the runways out here and killed four of my workers and wounded twenty more or the rifle fire that shot my office up and oh yeah killed another two of my guys it was allstrongs turn to point to the lowlying buildings that neighborhood over there is a breeding ground for attacks on this airport and its my job to stop them tucker stuck his chin out theres no attack going on now allstrong you either call your men back or i swear to god ill personally intervene with calliston and even your buddy ramsdale to cut your funding off we dont need wildcat contractors playing cowboys out here you play by the rules or you dont play at all by this time gurung had come up near them allstrong glanced again at his commandos then nodded to his employee radio them to come on back in he said fights over for today then back to tucker but that isnt why you came out here no its not i came here to inspect what our moneys being used for you realize that your gate guards here dont speak arabic how are they supposed to get information from these drivers when they dont speak the language allstrong shook his head these men are britishtrained gurkha guards major the pride of nepal theyre completely capable of handling this mission ive tried hiring locals a few times and you know what happens they either steal my shit or they dont show up or both theyre afraid if they take a job with me their families will get killed and theyre not all wrong my guys are thorough and they get the job done if its a little slower than american standards well excuse me all to hell but were in a war here what about the dogs the bombsniffing dogs what about them were still training them ive got sixty trainers and a hundred dogs working fulltime out behind the terminals when theyre ready ill put em all to work meanwhile again i go with my guys im going to want to see your kennels and your fleet of trucks and cars that weve coughed up the money for in fact you can just look on my visit here today as an unannounced informal audit to see if weve got to come back with a fullon inspection ive got preapproval both from calliston and the inspector general of the army good for you allstrong backed away a step and crossed his arms over his chest but im afraid i cant allow you inside the compound the hell you cant you watch me major youre forgetting that i dont work for the army my contract is with the coalition provisional authority jerry bremer through kevin ramsdale i dont hear a calliston in there do you or a tucker and my bosses are happy enough with the job im doing that im getting almost more work than i can keep up with so look you want to check up on me clear it with ramsdale ive got nothing to hide but im not showing my books to anybody who doesnt have permission to see them so thanks all to hell for your interest major but im afraid this trips going to turn out to be a waste of your time he turned to his worker mr gurung major tucker is not to enter the compound today or any other day without my permission is that clear gurung nodded yes sir tucker glared at allstrong im going to go to ramsdale and even bremer if i have to he said if i were you allstrong id get my books in order im going to be back with all the authority i need you just wait ill look forward to it meanwhile you have a nice drive back to baghdad major and keep your head down allstrong broke his trademark smile you never know ron nolan had arrived back in the compound earlier that same day and now he and evan scholler sat on the steps to the chow trailer a few minutes of natural sunlight remained in the hot august evening dust from the afternoon winds hung in the air smearing it yellowishbrown dude nolan said im telling you shes moved on you ought to do the same evan didnt argue with nolan this time about whether or not hed have another budweiser hed already had threecans this time not bottles he popped the top and lifted the next cold one to his lips he wiped foam from his lips was there anybody else what you mean with her did i see anybody havent we been through this already no nolan took a pull from his can but were talking about a total time in her presence of about three minutes all of it at the door to her apartment trying to get her to just take the damn letter if there was some guy inside with her i didnt see him so maybe but nolan cut him off maybe nothing evan dont do this to yourself you had to see her facegreat face by the way so i know where youre coming from and youve got my sympathybut if youd seen her face you wouldnt have any doubts she didnt want anything to do with you or that letter you want to hear it again she says im not going to read it and i go you dont have to read it but i promised evan id get you to take it from my hands you can do that cant you so she goes im just going to throw it away and i go thats your call but ive got to give this to you so she takes it says thanks and looking straight into my eyes she rips the envelope in half evan sipped beer and blew out a breath fuckina right i agree its a bitch but hey the good news is you dont have to wonder anymore nolan hesitated sipped his beer shot a sideways glance across the steps i dont know if you want to hear this my friend but ive got to tell you or youll never know she put a move on me too holding out a restraining hand nolan hurried on nothing i couldnt handle and i very reluctantly gave her a pass but if you needed any more certainty no that ought to cover it i hear you but you know give me certainty anytime i can deal with that any day over not knowing maybe youre right damn straight i am evan looked over at him she really came on to you nolan nodded solemn and i didnt get the impression it was the only time since youve been gone the girls a stone fox ev you think shes sitting home alone nights watching tv come on shes human lifes short and shes got a life back there this isnt rocket science you guys broke up before you came here its over accept it evan hung his head he couldnt seem to muster the strength to lift it up shit nolan was thinking maybe the guys not going to get over her that possibility hadnt occurred to him nolan had told the small lie about tara ripping up the envelope because he thought it made for a convincing story brought the finality of evan and taras breakup a bit closer to home but now he saw that evan might not accept it he might keep trying to reach her again might find out what had gone on in redwood city might even manage to snag tara back away from him nolan couldnt let that happen he wanted tara hed gotten her and he intended to keep her until he didnt want her anymore which might be a very long time however evans reaction caught him off balance now hed simply have to adjust finetune the mission keep him away from her all was fair in warfare anyway and the old saying was right in love the same thing you needed to be willing and able to adjust to the unexpected evan scholler was stationed in a dangerous place after all where anything might happen to him nolan could tweak the odds just a bit give evan a little something else to deal with instead of tara wheatley he reached over and hit evans arm hard but friendly you know what you need dude you need something to take your mind off all this thats all and thats always an easy call here at party central hey theres things to do here you just got to know where to look right you doubt me for an answer evan drank beer the man doubts me nolan shook his head in disbelief dude he said put your beer down come with me evan took a beat then tipped his can up emptying the contents into his mouth when he finished he got to his feet where we goin smokecheck party nolan said whats that smokecheck the muj youll love it the spy for jack allstrong in the airports adjoining neighborhood was an educated exrepublican guard officer a sunni named ahmad jassim mohammed no one knew the exact game he was playing and this was no doubt the way ahmad preferred things but the pretense was that he had accepted the new postsaddam status quo and wanted to work with america and its allies to help rebuild his country hed gotten connected to allstrong during the july mortar attacks on the airport when under the guise of offering his services as an interpreter hed instead provided five thousand dollars worth of information that had proved valuable in identifying several target houses in the airports neighboring slum that had contained large caches of weapons mortars and other explosives though no one least of all jack allstrong ruled out the possibility that ahmad might in fact be a spy checking out airport conditions for the insurgents and though the consensus among nolan and the other executives at allstrong was that ahmad was using the american military presence to settle vendettas with his personal enemies among his former republican guard colleagues the fact remained that his information tended to be correct when the targets hed provided were eliminated the mortar attacks on the airport had abruptly come to an end that was about as far as allstrong or calliston needed to take it allstrong had paid ahmad for similar information several times now and counted on the intelligence he supplied to keep a step ahead of the insurgency just outside his perimeter and so far it was working no one had expected todays attack but ahmad had arrived at the compound in its aftermath now in the sultry early night he sat in the front seat of one of allstrongs convoy vehicles ron nolan was driving evan scholler in black fatigues his kevlar vest and with four beers in his bloodstream stood uncomfortably manning the machinegun platform on the vehicles roof behind him in the seats two other blackclad gurkha commandos checked their weapons the party rolled out of the main gate off to their right they could sense more than see the slumlike contours of the mudcaked domiciles of the residents a quarter mile or so outside of the compound the humvee veered suddenly right and began bouncing across the nomansland that separated the airport from the homes nolan killed the regular beams leaving only the cars running lights on evan squinted ahead into the night unable to make out many details either to the sides or ahead of them he wished he hadnt had those beers he wasnt drunk but he could feel the alcohol and though nolan had assured him that they faced little or no danger just an awesome adrenaline rush hed also insisted that evan wear his bulletproof vest as all the others had done evan thought he might in fact wind up needing all of his faculties and couldnt shake a keen awareness that his reflexes might not be there for him in a pinch so his mouth was dry his palms sweaty his head light he was alone up here halfexposed behind him in the car he heard nothingand that didnt help his nerves either what the hell was he doing in another minute theyd entered the town itself as theyd approached evan thought for an instant that the car might just try to crash through one of the yards but evidently ahmad knew where he was directing them suddenly they were in a street so narrow it barely fit them it was lit only by the lights from within the houses but the place wasnt dead by any means the locals were outside smoking talkingtheir humvee picked up some kids running along beside the car whistling calling out for food or candy the foot traffic forced them to slow down nolan honked from time to time never stopping forcing his way ahead making the populace move out of his way evan sweating heavily now kept his hands gripped tightly on the handles of his machine gun even as he heard nolan call up to him stay cool dude nothing happening here were not there yet they turned left then right then left again now down unmarked and unremarkable streets into more of what looked like a marketplace area closed up for the night with few if any pedestrians nolan accelerated through the space and entered another quarter of the suburb people still milled about but less of them and with far fewer children nolan made another turn and pulled up to a stop at a large open space in front of what appeared to be a mosque here the foot traffic had all but disappeared the only light or soundtelevision and musiccame from a twostory dwelling at the next corner down on their left the passenger door opened and ahmad got out of the car closed the door gently then leaned back in the window and said something to nolan then he turned and ran disappearing into another of the side streets nolan killed even the running lights next and then immediately they were moving only to stop again sixty yards along after theyd passed the house ahmad had pointed out to them this time the engine went quiet the radio music from the house was louder down here providing cover for whatever noise they made as nolan and his two commandos opened their doors and got themselves and their weapons out into the street they all gathered now down under and just to the side of evans position theyd blackened their faces and hung grenades on their vests since theyd gotten into the humvee and these two details chilled evan who could barely make out anything but nolans teeth in the darkness he seemed to be smiling im leaving the keys in the car he said to evan in case you need em you remember how we got here right a joke even in this setting nolan went right on if you need to hop in the drivers seat and get out any way you can but this shouldnt be long and hey remember were in black but were the good guys for when we come out then he illuminated the light on the helmet he wore as did the other men all of these were clearly wellrehearsed maneuvers at a nod from nolan the men broke into a trot toward their target in an instant one stood on each side of the door of the house nolan took a position in front of the door and without any warning or fanfare opened fire with his submachine gun this knocked the door open and nolan kicked it and led his men in immediately bedlam ensued screams and yelling shots and sporadic bursts of automatic weapons fire then the three men assembling outside againevan thinking it was already overwhen the night was split by a shattering explosion out of the lower window and the men rushed in again this time into pure darkness evans knuckles tightened on the handles of his machine gun behind him he heard a sound and whirled he couldnt make the gun turn a full oneeighty and he suddenly realized that if anyone were to come up behind him he had no defense drawing his sidearm he ducked down for a second below the backseat and peered back behind him but there was nothing in the street in the house across the way the yelling and the gunfire continuedagain individual shots followed by bursts of automatic weapons another explosion ripped through the night this one blowing out the upstairs windows and then suddenly all went quiet a few seconds later the three men in black fatigues appeared outside the front door again two of them bolted back toward the car while the third reentered the building then emerged on a dead run just as his two colleagues got to the car behind him in the house two nearly simultaneous explosions blew out any remaining glass in the downstairs windows and halfway knocked him to the ground but he kept running until he too reached the car by this time nolan was back in the drivers seat breathing hard starting the thing up over his shoulder he yelled up at evan that was the place all right that ahmad is okay must have been a dozen muj in there dude maybe two hundred aks rpgs you name it but nothing that a few frag grenades couldnt cure god i love this work how bout you was that fun or what hang on were rolling behind him fire and smoke were beginning to billow out of the buildings windows evan couldnt take his eyes off the spectacle he was vaguely aware of doors opening on the street around him people pouring out into the night more shouts the screams of women behind them now he heard the crack of what he imagined must be gunfire but he saw nothing distinctly enough to consider it a target but then they had turned the corner and were headed back through the space in front of the mosque then the marketplace evan swallowed against the dryness in his throat his stomach knotted up inside him his knuckles burning white on the handles of his machine gun a while after midnight evan tried to carefully and quietly navigate the three steps up to the dorm trailer between the news from home about tara and his involvement in the raid he figured he had every excuse in the world to split most of a bottle of allstrongs glenfiddich with nolan after they returned to biap and now the ground was shifting pretty well under him he was looking forward to lying down on his cot tomorrow hed try to process most or all of what hed been through tonight the aftermath he and his reservists had worked it out with the filipino cooks and clerical staff and now had a dorm section of their own eight cots in a doublewide bedroom when he pushed open the door the greeting was like a surprise party without anybody yelling surprise suddenly all the lights went on and these nearly blinded him especially in his inebriated state stumbling backward against the brightness his hands up in front of his eyes he might have tripped on the steps and fallen back out of the trailer if one of his guys alan reese hadnt been waiting there to grab him as the glare faded evan blinked himself into some recognition facing him some sitting on their cots some standing was his squadron marshawn whitman his sergeant and secondincommand much to evans surprise was standing at attention and even offered a legitimate salute before he began with a formality hed never used before lieutenant he said we all need to have a talk evan tried to focus so that he only saw one marshawn instead of two looming there in front of him he put a hand out against the doorjamb to hold himself steady his tongue too big for his mouth in any case could only manage the word now now would be best whitman said we need to get out of here where to back to our unit our unit how we gonna do that we dont know lieutenant but being here just isnt right evan stalling for time looked over first at reese standing next to him then around to levy and jefferson and onofrio sitting forward on their cots identical tripletselbows on their thighs hands clasped in front of themand finally to pisoni and koshi and fields who were standing with their arms crossed leaning against the wall whatever this was about these guys were a unit all of them in it together and from the looks of them all of them angry guys evan said its not like we got a choice they sent us here well not really they sent us up to baghdad then we wound up here im not sure i see the difference marsh corporal gene pisoni a sandyhaired sweettempered mechanic for a honda dealership in burlingame and the youngest member of the squad cleared his throat we could get shot at doing what were doing here is the difference sir they shot up this base today weve just been lucky out in the streets up until now next to evan reese piped in the casualty figures posted today list a hundred and sixteen dead this last week in baghdad alone our luck cant hold much longer lance corporal ben levy a law student at santa clara added to the refrain weve been here almost a month sir this was supposed to be a temporary assignment wasnt it evan still felt the room swaying under him but part of him was sobering up well first our luck can hold guys if we just stay careful but im not arguing with you this isnt what we got sent over here for i agree i just dont know what we can do about it talk to calliston nao koshi was japaneseamerican a software engineer whod been pulled out of what hed thought was the worlds best job at google he assigned us here he can assign us out we shouldnt be doing this a thicknecked caltrans employee from half moon bay anthony onofrio was thirtythree years old he had two young children and a pregnant wife at home he was perennially the saddest guy in the group but rarely spoke up to complain now though he continued this really is all fucked up sir theyve got to have the trucks were trained to fix at least down in kuwait by now we ought to be down there doing what were trained to do not standing up behind machine guns i agree with you tony you think i want to be here but i thought you guys were happy to have regular quarters regular meals the guys we came over with marshawn said theyve probably got that by now too wherever they are maybe better than we got it here were all willing to risk it huh guys a general hum of affirmation went around the room bottom line ev whitman continued is what tony said us going out in these packages every day is just bullshit we dont want to die driving jack allstrong or ron nolan around to pick up money nobody does marsh i dont either well the way its going now whitman said its only a matter of time evan shook his head in an effort to clear it then wiped a palm down the front of his face you guys are right im sorry ill talk to calliston see what i can do at least get things moving if i can sooner would be better pisoni said i got a bad feeling about this things over here are heating up too fast its only going to get worse im on it gene evan said promise first chance i get tomorrow if hes around oh and sir whitman added it might be better when you get to see calliston if you were sober hell take the request more seriously no offense no evan said of course none taken you guys are right as it turned out colonel calliston did not have a free seventeen seconds much less fifteen minutes that he felt obligated to devote to the problems of a reserve lieutenant whose squadron was gainfully employed doing meaningful work for one of the cpas major contractors finally evan took the guys beef to nolan who listened with apparent sympathy to the mens position and promised to bring the matter up with allstrong who in turn would try to make a pitch to calliston but like everything else in iraq it was going to be a timeconsuming lengthy process that might never show results anyway nolan suggested that in the meanwhile evans squadron might want to write to the commander of their reserve unit or to some of their colleagues in that unit wherever they happened to be in the war theater in the few days while these discussions and negotiations were transpiring things in baghdad bad enough to begin withbecame substantially worse especially for the convoys one of the kbr convoys delivering several tons of dinars in cash from baghdad to biap was ambushed just outside of the city and barely limped into the compound with one dead and four wounded the lead vehicles passengerside window was blown out and the doors and bumpers sported dozens of bullet holes the attack had been a coordinated effort between a suicidevehicleborne explosive devicean svbedand insurgents firing from rooftops the consensus was that the damage could have been much worse but the marines in the convoy had shot up the suicide vehicle and killed its driver before he had gotten close enough to do more significant damage earlier in the week another convoy manned by dynacorp contract personnel had shot out the windshield of the humvee carrying the canadian ambassador as a passenger when his car hadnt responded to a warning to stay back luckily in that incident because the contractors had used rubber bullets no one was badly hurt but nerves were frayed everywhere tempers short traffic still insanely dense by now most of the routes in and out of the city had been barricaded off and access to those thoroughfares was nominally under the control of the cpa and iraqi policemilitary units all vehicles had to pass at least one and often several checkpoints to be admitted to these streets unfortunately the inner city was a cobweb of smaller streets that fed into the larger main roads and access to these was much more difficult to control a convoy like schollers would be sitting in traffic downtown essentially stationary and a car with four iraqis in it would suddenly appear out of one of these alleys and begin crowding the convoys in the slowly moving endless line of traffic since many of these cars were in fact svbeds they too ignored escalation of the hand and audio signals in their efforts to get close enough to destroy the convoys theyd targeted and of course in these cases the machine gunners standing through the roofs of the humvees in the convoys had little option if they wanted to save their own lives but to open fire on the approaching vehicle tragically though all too often the approaching car held innocent arabicspeaking iraqi civilians who simply didnt understand the english commands to back off or the simple arabic commands soldiers had been taught to give to help with the confusion or they failed to appreciate the urgency of the hand signals in the first months after the occupation of baghdad these shooting mistakes had come to account for ninetyseven percent of the civilian deaths in the cityfar more than the deaths caused by all the insurgents ieds sniper fire and suicide bombers combined if a car got too close to a convoy it was going to get shot up that was the reality nolan scheduled for the rear car this tuesday with evan picked right up on the bad vibe that had been riding along with schollers squadron for the past few days now as he walked up to the convoy he was somewhat surprised to see evan outside his vehicle having some words with one of his men greg fields tony onofrio another of the guys was standing by listening obviously uncomfortable because i say so evan was saying thats why that aint cutting it lieutenant ive been up there three days in a row how about we put tony on the gun today fields was obviously talking about the machine gunners spot the main target popping out of the roof of their humvee tonys a better driver than you are greg and youre better on the gun so thats not happening mount up but fields didnt move nolan had been aware that the units respect for evans leadership had declined over their recreational drinking coupled with evans inability to get them transferred and now it looked as though fields might flatly refuse his lieutenants direct order so he stepped into the fray hey hey guys no sweat ill take the gun greg you hop in the back seat and chill a while nolan knew that the men might also be mad about his own role in evans drinking plus driving him all over to hell and gone but figured that neither as a group nor individually could they resent him if he took a turn in the roof although this was technically forbidden caught in the middle evan felt that he had to assert his authority i cant let you do that ron sure you can he gestured toward the machine gun im a master on that mother im sure you are evan said but youre only allowed to use a sidearm flashing the smile he used to disarm nolan stepped up and whispered into evans face dude the other night ring a bell thats not your rule thats the recommendation for contractors nothing to do with you im betting fields has no objection he turned that right son the young man didnt hesitate for an instant absolutely fields isnt the issue evan said even as the guys from the other humvees were moving down in their direction wondering what the beef was about im the issue to me lieutenant fields said it aint right me being up there every day if mr nolan wants a turn i say tell him thanks and lets roll out of here evan didnt want this to escalate in front of his other men nolan was throwing him a lifeline that could save his authority and preserve some respect in front of his squad and maybe what he said was true maybe it was a rule for contractors and none of the armys business all right evan said at last lifting a finger at fields this one time greg now evan and his very disgruntled guys were in a baghdad neighborhood called masbah where nolan was to meet up and conduct some business with a tribal chief who was a friend of kuvan theyd already passed the checkpoint into the wide main thoroughfare that was now choked with traffic on either side storefronts gave way to tall buildings pedestrians skirted sidewalk vendors who spilled over into the roadway on both sides of the road but in contrast to many of their other trips through the city today theyd encountered quite a bit of lowlevel hostility kids who even a week before had run along beside the convoy begging for candy today hung back and in a few cases pelted the cars with rocks and invective as they drove by older kids indistinguishable in many ways from the armed and very dangerous enemy tended to gather in small groups and watch the passage of the cars in surly silence the large and evergrowing civilian death toll from quicktriggered convoy machine gunnersin evans view often justifiable if tragicwas infecting the general populace and in a tribal society such as iraq s where the death of a family member must be avenged by the whole tribe evan felt that at any time the concentric circles of retribution might extend to themall politics and military exigencies aside riding along with nolan on the big gun above him evan was more than nervous he honestly didnt know his duty he hadnt been briefed on this exact situation and had no ranking officer above him to tell him the rules should he have stood up to nolan and forbade him to man the machine gun alienating himself from his men even more could he just continue to let him ride up there and hope the problem would go away but playing into all of his ruminations was the fact that since the unauthorized raid into the biap neighborhood everything about nolan had him on edge the more evan reflected on it the less defensible that attack seemed the more like some variant of murder evan had been a cop long enough in civilian life that he was sensitive to the nuances of homicide and the raid had certainly been at the very least in a dark gray area if the house that nolan and his gurkhas had trashed had in fact been identified as a legitimate military target shouldnt it have been a military unit that took care of it though it was possible that the house full of aks and other ordnance could have been an insurgent stronghold evan couldnt shake the thought that the attack might have been more in the line of a personal reprisalpayback to one of ahmads or kuvans enemies or even to a business competitor now stuck in traffic in the passenger seat on a sweltering morning in masbah and still hung over from the previous nights beers evan tried to get his thoughts in order he had to figure out a way to get his troops out of this assignment he had to stop drinking every night with nolan he had to accept that it was over with tara he had to get a plan for his life when he got out of here he closed his eyes against the constant dull awful throbbing in the drivers seat tony onofrio must have caught his moment of weakness because he turned the music way up to a painful decibel leveltoby keiths new hit courtesy of the red white and blue the angry american this was tonys notsosubtle punishment for the fact that evan hadnt succeeded in getting them transferred yet the other beautiful aspect of the earsplitting volume was that evan couldnt acknowledge that it bothered himto do so would be admitting to his hangover tony of course knew he had the hangover the message was clear enoughif evan could jeopardize all of their safety putting more priority on drinking than on getting them out of here then tony could play his goddamned music as loud as he fucking wanted but suddenly all the cogitations became moot they were moving along at about ten miles per hour and they had just passed a side street when nolan slapped three times rapidly onto the hood of their vehicle heads up he yelled down with real urgency bogey at ten oclock ten oclock instantly jarred alertthis was a situation evan had been trained forevan hit his radio and passed the word up to the rest of his squadron pisoni gene any way to speed up then he yelled at nolan handsignals first ron back em off back em off from the radio he heard negative sir were stuck up here nolan shouted comin on dont fire repeat do not fire he knew that he had to see how serious the threat was before he could formulate his response if nothing else he needed to make sure that this encounter went by the rules of engagement the escalated warning process but on the other hand if it was a suicide bomber who had targeted them it would happen quickly and he couldnt be afraid to pull the trigger he drew his own sidearm the mm baretta m and turning halfaround in his seat stuck his head out the window behind them just out of the alley and pulling out ahead of the backedup traffic in the space behind them was a beatup white sedan with no license plates the rear car in all of the convoys already sported relatively large signs written in english and arabic warning following vehicles to leave at least one hundred feet of space and experienced drivers in baghdad tended to err on the side of caution and yet this car had entered the roadway at about seventyfive feet and was advancing looking up evan saw that nolan had drawn himself up to full height and was standing with both arms extended palms outthe classic stayback signal in any language trying to get a better glimpse of the car behind them evan stuck his body out even farther with the sun beating down on the windshield the view inside the vehicle was generally obscured but evan was fairly certain that he could make out two people in the front seats the back window on his side was down as well and he caught a glimpse of forearm for a moment instantly retracted theres three of em in there at least he called up to nolan then into the radio again gene can you get to the side and go around the sidewalk even clogged up sir negative in fact slowing shit evan knew that they had a megawatt flashlight in the backseat for just this situation he pulled himself back in and told greg fields behind the drivers seatwho should have been up where nolan wasto find it and shine it at the approaching drivers face it was supposed to be for nighttime use but it might do some good during the day as well digging in his duty bag on the floor at his feet evan pulled out the airhorn klaxon they carried for just such a moment amazingly enough it seemed that even this many months into the occupation some peopleeven whole familieswould simply take to the streets in their cars to go shopping or run an errand theyd get to talking or arguing and never see the warning hand signals until it was too late coming out the window again airhorn in his hand evan looked quickly to the roof nolan had gotten down out of his extended position and now his palms were gripped around the handles of the machine gun hold off nolan hold off wait for my order the car had closed to under forty feet in ten seconds and seemed to be accelerating like everywhere else in the civilized world iraq seemed to raise drivers who abhorred a vacuum between vehicles even in the bright sunshine even with the glare off the windshield evan could see that fields had trained his blinding light on the driver from his own side he held out the airhorn and let out a blast the radio squawked out deadlock up here sir slowing down evan checked the position of the approaching carwas it too slowing down at last good it had stopped in time thank god this crisis would pass he reckoned that he had time for a quick look ahead of them turning he was about to order pisoni onto the sidewalkthe pedestrians would have to scatter and that was just too damn bad onofrio hit the brakes and they came to a complete stop all was still evan breathed a sigh of great relief and then with a maniacal war whoop right above him ron nolan opened fire the car did not explode that alone was enough to cause evan grave concern that and the fact that in the seconds before nolan had started shooting the car had finally gotten the frantic message from the lights and airhorns and without a doubt had come to a complete halt only after the first hail of bullets had slammed into it had it started moving againthe dead drivers foot letting up its pressure on the brakescoming on actually faster now with nolan continually pouring rounds into it until it rammed into the back of evans car and shuddered to a stop dont leave the cars unattended evan tried to keep his rising panic out of his voice stay at the wheel man your guns whos riding shotgun in your car gene well get reese back here with us fields he yelled at his assistant driver out with me the street had first seemed to go eerily silent but already now as he all but fell out of the car evan became aware of the upswell of volume that was growing around them back behind them on the sidewalk a man was screaming keening and there appeared to be a form down on the sidewalk next to himone or more of nolans bullets had apparently hit a bystander as he or she was walking down the street this was perhaps unavoidable once the shooting started but it aggravated the situation terribly a man on the curb was yelling at him in english he was stopping he was stopping back at the shotup sedan fields and reese on the other side evan approached with great caution although the windshield was blown out and red streaks tinted the inside of the other windows someone might still be armed and alive inside or there might still be an unexploded bomb evan came up to the passenger door gingerly pulled it open then spoke into the radio to pisoni gene get through to somebody somewhere and tell them about this give em our location and tell em we need support yesterday anything they can get to us behind him he became aware of more shouts randomly laced with fury he turned his attention to the bodya woman judging by the bloodied shreds of the niqab or veil that now stuck to what had been her face now she sprawled partially out of the front seat her upper body bleeding into the street on the other side of the car fields had opened the back door and stepped back in disgust and horror holy shit ev theres kids back here a minute later the first of the rocks hit his humvee for perhaps ten minutes though it seemed more like an hour evan tried to direct events even through the bombardment of projectiles that the entire convoy was beginning to endure he gave his machine gunners including and especially nolan strict orders not to fire into the crowd he hoped that the reinforcements that pisoni had called for would arrive in something like a timely manner and he entertained the hope that this wouldnt escalate further at least until the cavalry showed up but he couldnt keep the crowd from closing in around the white sedan some members of it clearly recognizing the family that nolan had just slaughtered as evan and his men retreated back to their own bunchedup vehicles they heard from pisoni that iraqi police units stationed nearby were on their way meanwhile though some of the crowd members had laid down blankets in the street and begun the process of removing the bodies from the car first the woman then her husband whod been behind the wheel finally the three childrenby the size of them none older than six or seven all of them were badly bloodied but one was apparently still breathing and someone grabbed that child and disappeared with it into the crowd nolan still up behind his gun now had his eyes on the street in front of them which had cleared as the forward traffic had begun to move evan he said and when scholler looked up he pointed check it out evan turned what were good to go dude what are you talking about were not going anywhere weve got a multiple fatality incident here ron we stay till were cleared bad idea lieutenant we go while we can these people will take care of their own but wed best be gone by the time word gets out around here we cant be gone weve got to report report to the local cops and then what no man what weve got to do is get out of here now while we can before it gets ugly and personal personal with us we killed em lieutenant we didnt kill em nolan you killed em so split a straw theyre not gonna care were on the same side is all that matters this is a clan culture so everybody in these poor fuckers clan is honor bound to kill us its going to get personal in about two minutes i promise evan looked off down the street at the stillreceding line of traffic that had been blocking their way all morning behind them the horns of a hundred other cars urged him to drive off clear the road get out of the way he didnt know how he could in any kind of conscience leave the scene of an incident such as this oneall his police training went against it there would have to be an investigation photographs testimony taken they couldnt just see an opportunity to get away and run from all this could they from across the car fields said i think mr nolans right sir weve got to get out of here we get back to an fob someplace fields was picking up the jargon an fob was a secure troop area or forward operating base with bremer walls crewserved weapons and security checkpoints we make our report out of there evan didnt respond and instead went to his radio gene he said whats it look like for getting out of here when right now decent theres an offroad to a barricade point another quarter mile up and i can at that moment a low hum filled the torpid air around them nolan yelled out rpg down and sixty feet from where evan stood the first humvee suddenly exploded in a ball of flame knocking him fields and reese to the pavement nearly deafened evan still registered that nolan had come up out of his crouch and turned his machine gun to the building from which he believed the rocketpropelled grenade had been fired gene pisoni and marshawn whitman had just taken a direct hit that they couldnt have survived across the hood of evans own humvee reese stood back into his view the left half of his face awash in blood he was trying to say something motioning to evan but either he wasnt saying any words or evan couldnt hear them through the deafening roar in his head fields too finally got to his feet apparently unharmed and pointed to the humvee then to the empty street yawning open before them in an unambiguous gesture it was past time for talking about it they had to get out of there he was right now the second and third humvees were open targetspossibly saved evan later realized by their proximity to the white sedan or to the crowd that had initially gathered around it but that wasnt any part of his consideration as he pointed reese to the second humvee and hopped into the third one just as a spray of bullets pinged off the street in front of them all cutting across the hood of his vehicle nolan wheeled and fired into the buildings again onofrio had his vehicle in gear and started forward in the second humvee just in front of them reese reached the open passenger door and half jumped half fell inside joining levy koshi and davy jeffersona twentyfouryearold innout manager from sunnyvalewho was stationed on the machine gun and perhaps because of fear or maybe an understood complicity among the locals evan noticed the crowd had suddenly fallen back from around them isolating them as targets even further up out of the roof of the humvee in front of them davy jefferson had opened fire at some rooflines as well another spray of bullets kicked at the street between the two vehicles over evans head nolan fired another burst which was followed closely by a terrifyingly close low humming vibration as another rpg somehow missed them and exploded into a storefront over on their left glass and stucco dust rained down over them evan hit his drivers arm and pointed to the burnedout still smoking remains of their vehicle he still could barely hear himself although he was yelling gene and marsh gene and marsh telling onofrio he wasnt going to leave his dead men behind to be mutilated by the mob which was the way this scenario looked like it was starting to develop they pulled around next to their humvee and at evans signal he and fields jumped out into the street again evan motioned to nolan and jefferson on the two stillworking guns to cover them as they ran to the destroyed still smoking humvee whitmans charred and bloodied body had been blown clear out of his hole by the machine gun and now lay sprawled over the roof evan and fields grabbed their fallen comrade by the arms and pulled him down then began dragging him as fast as they could back to their vehicle for a few seconds the firing ceased evan and fields managed to load whitmans body into the back of their car then they turned and went to join alan reese who had come out of the humvee and was trying to open the front doors to the first car and get pisoni out but the doors were still too hot to touch as well as sealed shut the windows of course had all been destroyed by the blast as well so fields leaned in on the drivers side and tried to get some purchase on pisonis lifeless body but couldnt get it to budge hes still got his seat belt on he called back the force of the grenade had all but knocked the back door on the drivers side off its hinges and evan was able to force it further open with a few kicks they could get pisoni out that way evan got fields over next to him put his shoulder to it and had just started to push when more rounds of automatic weapons fire exploded from the roofs around them fields at his elbow made a sickening guttural sound then spun around and collapsed to the ground in a sitting position on the other side of the car reese fired off a few useless rounds with his sidearm just as heavy automatic weapons fire began coming from the roofs of buildings on reeses side of the street as well somewhere behind them nolan was firing continuously now back and forth side to side from the roof of his vehicle but when evan looked over hoping he might be able to direct some covering fire from the other humvee he saw that davy jefferson had disappeared and that bullet holes had pocked across the windshield as well if levy and koshi hadnt been hit in their front seats it was a miracle alan evan yelled to reese get around here on this side reese looked at him over the humvees hood and nodded turning still firing his sidearm at the rooftops on his side he made it nearly to the back side of the car before several more automatic rounds straightened him up threw him up against the cars body and dropped him out of evans sight his own gun drawn evan sat next to fieldss crumpled body on the pavement in the partial cover of the humvee up to his left he could make out a couple of running figures at the edges of the roofline but nolan was doing a decent job of keeping them down stippling the fronts of the buildings they occupied holding their fire to a minimum but nolan was the only machine gunner left and at his firing rate he would soon be out of ammunition evan nudged at fields cmon buddy weve got to move he pushed at fieldss shoulder again and the mans body slumped all the way to the side on the ground the front of his shirt soaked in red another burst of machinegun fire shattered the air directly behind him and evan turned and saw that it was his own humvee nolan on the roof coming around in the street and running its own screen between the buildings to cover him but he had three men down here at the humvee and three more in he could only guess at reeses condition perhaps hed only been wounded hed have to get around the humvee here to check that out and then still there were koshi jefferson and levy over in hed have to order nolan and onofrio to help him load the dead and wounded into the backseat and cargo area of the one working humvee he couldnt leave his men out here in the street it wasnt possible that hed lost so many of them in so short a time and then his own humvee pulled up the back door open onofrio behind the wheel frantically gesturing that he should jump aboard screaming at him although evan could barely hear him it was his only chance their only chance but here was fields right at his side bleeding to death if not already dead there was no option but to try to get him in the car first theres no time nolan yelled down from the roof at onofrio keep driving go go go he fired a short volley up into the rooflines move it seemed like nolan was urgingorderingonofrio to save themselves and abandon evan with the rest of the men but his driver slowed the vehicle as it came abreast of evan looked over in panic and desperation reached out a hand across the seat nolan yelled from the roof leave em leave em theres no time theyre gone the humvee stopped now and onofrio leaned over further and pushed open the passenger door his hand outstretched evan reached around trying to get ahold of fields to pull him along getting a purchase on his squadmates sleeve evan was halfway to his feet his own free hand out to onofrios when deep in his bowels he felt again the low hum of another incoming rpg it was the last thing he felt for eleven days part two from ron nolans perspective there was just no benefit to staying in iraq and talking about it the inquiry into the incident looked like it was going to be a tricky thing onofrio was the only witness left in the immediate aftermath and nolan believed that his testimony wouldnt be harmful onofrio had been busy driving and wouldnt have had a clue about whether the following car was in fact stationary when nolan had opened fire on it but the word from the street the result of jack allstrongs reaching out to the local iraqi and us military cops had already filtered back about what had actually happened and there was a reasonable chance that nolan would be arrested the good news was that the abu ghraib scandal had just surfaced and every american remotely connected to law enforcement in iraq had been assigned to that investigation even major charles tucker that painintheass beancounter whod been constantly in their shit about money found himself reassigned to that scandal but in spite of that and though he knew that jurisdictional issues were problematic at best in iraq especially when they involved contractors accused of criminal activity such as in this case murder nolan was unwilling to risk his own arrest you never knew what could happen then the cpa might decide to use him as an example for other triggerhappy contractors or give him to the iraqi prosecutors both nonstarters from nolans point of view in fact nolan didnt feel particularly bad about what hed actually donehey youre in a war shit happens the dumbasses shouldve stopped sooner or better yet stayed off the street entirely what the hell were they thinking if he had it to do over again hed do the very same thing rules of engagement or no and although he did very much regret the loss of life among his own convoy again this was just another turd in the gigantic shitpile that was this war who could have predicted such a massive local retaliation for such a small localized event and then again how was he supposed to know that this particular mohammed raghead the father whod stupidly driven his whole family into the killing radius of nolans humvee was in fact jahlil alpalawi a major tribal leader and the most influential shiite in the masbah neighborhood anyway clearly the intelligent thing to do was for nolan to blow dodge until this incident blended into the chaos of all the other ones that were happening somewhere in the country just about every day in a few months nolan could always come back with allstrong or with another security outfit and pick up where hed left off in the meanwhile jack allstrong certainly didnt want an army of investigators coming into biap without his sayso who knows what theyd see that they didnt like and report back to the cpa so within a week of the incident nolan was back in redwood city after negotiations with jack allstrong that consisted of a couple of glasses of glenfiddich each the company chose to construe his departure as caused by an act of god which meant it would honor his contract for a sixmonth hitch at full pay and with some of this apparently inexhaustible supply of money nolan put a down payment on a modern and elegant furnished townhouse near the sylvan border between redwood city and woodside still employed by allstrong he was the companys chief bay area recruiter of exmilitary personnel he knew the kind of people jack allstrong needed over in iraq and he generally knew where to find them tara wheatley was surprised to see nolan back so soon shed spent the weeks he was gone coming to grips with her nagging sense of guilt which was she told herself ridiculous she was an adult who could make her own decisions and she and evan had been broken up for months she hadnt betrayed anybody she was moving on in her life shed finally gotten around to reading the last four of evans letters but after the night when she had invited nolan back to her apartment she couldnt make herself get around to writing back to him what was she supposed to say oh and under local news i slept with your friend ron who came to give me your letter i didnt really mean to but i was confused and lonely really lonely and scared to be alone hed just more or less saved my life that particular night and i never thought you and i would ever work out our problems anyway it was just time to act on us being finally apart okay we werent together anymore and werent going to be together so i could sleep with another man if i wanted and you had no say over it okay okay there could have been some element where i was punishing you for going off the way you didif you can leave me then this is exactly what youre risking and nowyou see you dummyits happened no she wasnt going to write that letter not now not ever and evan of course never wrote to her again either ron nolan was a strong powerful attractive older guy and if her life wasnt going to work out with evan and it clearly wasnt then with his charm experience confidence andadmit itmoney nolan would at the very least be able to help her get over her first love she could use a simple uncomplicated relationship until the next real one came along as if thered ever be another one as real as evan nolan never saw the need to tell her about the ambush at masbah what had happened to evan or the role that nolan himself had played in it all as far as tara knew nolan had voluntarily made the decision to come home possibly even as a result of some of their discussions about the morality of the war explaining it to her he had kept it all as his old english teacher used to say vague enough to be true and in fact all nolan knew about evan scholler was that hed sustained a serious head wound from the last grenade they had taken and by the time nolan had flown out of baghdad still hadnt been expected to live he might in fact already have died although nolan suspected that if that had happened tara would have heard about it from somebody but whatever had happened to evan nearly three months had passed tara had moved on for ron nolan there just didnt seem to be any benefit to talking any more about it she was standing in front of the artichokes in the vegetable aisle of the grocery store two days after the start of her schools christmas vacation the canned music coming in to keep everybody merry and bright had just changed from the ridiculous to the sublimethe chipmunks version of rockin around the christmas tree segueing rather inharmoniously into aaron neville singing o holy night the latter had been her and evans favorite recording of any christmas song and suddenly hearing the first notes tara s mind had gone blank looking down at the bins of produce arrayed in front of her she suddenly had no idea why she was here or what she wanted to buy unconsciously her hand came up to cover her mouth and she sighed deeply through her fingers her eyes welling beyond all reason god she whispered to herself tara is that you letting out another breath she started out of her reverie eileen evans mother was still quite attractive and tara had always thought it was not so much about her trim body or her pleasant vaguely nordic facial features but because she exuded kindness in eileen schollers world everybody was equal and everybody was good even if the rest of humanity didnt think so and she was going to like you and treat you fairly and gently no matter what now her head cocked birdlike to one side she frowned with concern are you all right you look like youre about to faint thats what i feel like tara tried to put on a smile but knew it must look forced wow i dont know what just happened bracing herself against her shopping cart she again forced an unfelt brightness stress im sure the season but how are you you dont shop here normally do you but its so good to see you i was on my way home from work and remembered i needed some veggies but im glad i stopped here now its so good to see you too her expression grew wistful weve missed you you know tara nodded sober ive missed you too i really have yes well i dont think you children realize what you put us poor parents through when you break up with each other here we were considering you all but the daughter we never had and the next thing you know youre not in our lives anymore its the saddest thing i know tara said im so sorry i never meant that to be part of it i know dear its nobodys fault its just one of lifes little heartbreaks or as jim says its just another fog lowering her voice she came closer fucking opportunity for growth pardon my french its pardoned how is evan by the way well we still worry of course but he seems all right there are still some issues but were going out to see him for christmas so well have a better idea how hes doing after that youre going to see him for christmas yes were flying over next week to iraq for an instant eileen scholler went completely still no dear her eyes narrowedwas tara kidding heralthough the kindness remained in them to walter reed walter you didnt hear i was sure you must have heard in fact i was a little bit annoyed to be honest that you never called us if id have known you didnt know i would have tara waved her off that doesnt matter eileen heard what did something happen to evan over there he was wounded she said this past summer badly in the head he was nearly killed oh my god suddenly her legs felt as though they werent going to support her she tightened her grip on the shopping cart looked plaintively at eileen what happened they got attacked someplace in baghdad most of his squadron was killed they were all from the peninsula it was everywhere in the papers and on the news didnt you see anything about it i stopped reading all of those articles eileen and watching the news on tv it says iraq and i tune out i just cant stand it i figured if anything happened to evan id hear about it i couldnt face the news every day well fortunately he wasnt killed and thats all they seem to report its like the wounded dont count so you might never have seen his name anyway but his squadthose poor boys all of them died all but one i believe two counting evan oh god eileen i am so sorry how is he now getting better every day hes making more sense when he talks on the phone the doctors wont say for sure of course but his lead neurologist predicts that evan might be one of the very very few to recover almost completely though its probably going to be a while hes what doing therapy every day physical and mental but as i say hes really coming along now for a few weeks there after he first arrived we didnt even dare hope for that so this is all really good news once they decided he was eligible for therapy its been better why wouldnt he have been eligible eileen pursed her lips there was some question about whether hed had something to drink before he went out on his last convoy nobody said he was drunk butanyway they had to clear that up first if he was in fact under the influence he might not have been eligible for benefits even though he was shot eileen took a calming breath he wasnt shot tara it was a grenade that news stopped her briefly okay but even so they werent going to treat him if hed been drunk maybe not or not right away anyway and weve learned time is everything with his kind of injuries believe me but tara was still reeling from the revelation i cant believe they really might not have treated him how could he not be eligible for benefits if he got wounded in a war zone its one of the great mysteries dear but dont get me started on how theyre treating some of those other poor wounded boys at walter reed its atrocious butyoull really love thiseven after they ruled that he was eligible for benefits the army made it one of the conditions of evans treatment that he wouldnt complain about conditions at walter reed to the media or anybody else she laid a hand on tara s arm forced a tepid smile so the thing to do now is be grateful that theyre finally helping him and we are you are a way better person than id be eileen i dont know about that its the only way i know how to be of course its frustrating and terrible but at least evans getting better now i dont see how making a stink at this point would do anybody any good closing her eyes tara blew out her frustration she didnt believe eileen was rightshe thought that making a stink might in fact help things improve but suddenly the countrys culture seemed to have shifted to where everybody was afraid to make a stink about anythingit meant they werent patriotic it meant they supported the terrorists and this whole mentality was to her mind just stupid but she wasnt going to get in yet another argument about this ongoing and disastrous warnot with eileen not with ron nolan not with anybody else at least it appeared that bad though it might have been the worst medical part of evans ordeal was over so hes been there how long now she asked about three months we hope hell be coming home in a couple more but were afraid to move him too quickly at least hes got quality care now and we dont want to rush his recovery when he comes back we want him all the way back you know eileens serene gaze settled on her mighthavebeen daughterinlaw and how about you tara how have you been mostly good i think mostly good you think thats not the most enthusiastic response ive ever heard no i guess not im justkind of at a loss somehow i dont really feel whole in some way its like im waiting for something but im not sure what it is or even if ill recognize it when it comes along does that make any sense more than you think are you seeing anybody more or less im a little conflicted about him too in fact she stopped eileens head fell off angling to one side in her trademark gesture yes tara sighed this close to eileens physical presence now she almost imagined she could feel emanations of her son in the air around them and it affected her still this sense of some deeprooted connection between them that shed never approached with anyone else certainly not with ron nolan so why then was she still seeing ron was it only because shed given up on evan after hed clearly stopped caring about her or was there something simply easier about ron love didnt have to be allencompassing and overpowering did it true deep abiding love was a fairy tale a myth shed found that out the hard way now shed moved on into an adult realitybased relationship that could never hurt her the way shed been hurt with evan and that was smart she was in a better place all in all she had to believe that besides evan would never take her back now not after what shed done she knew that and she didnt blame him tara eileen stepped closer to her what she tried to smile mostly failing in the effort nothing really just what i said being conflicted about this guy well if youll take some advice from an old woman who loves you dont do anything irrevocable unless youre sure oh dont worry im a long way from either of thoseirrevocable or sure i keep thinking its the christmas season those old high expectations that dont seem to pan out she swallowed against a surge of emotion that suddenly had come upon her maybe evan and i shouldnt have had such good times with you and the family back in the day i keep waiting for it to feel that way again at christmastime it still can you know well maybe i can keep hoping at least putting on a smile now tara reached for some vegetables anyway i dont mean to sound so negative next to what youre going through my lifes great ours is too dear eileen said evans alive and we pray hell be fine someday its been a bit of a challenge but the worst is definitely behind us having gotten through the worst of it i dont know if we could be happier well thats the best news i could hear you deserve it everybody deserves happiness dear good people deserve it more i dont know about that eileen laid a hand on tara s arm but either way you do youre a good person not as good as you think not even close she thought she could not shake the feeling that somehow she had cheated on evan even though theyd broken up even though they werent a couple any longer even though she hadnt written him one letter since hed gone overseas i shouldnt have been so pigheaded with evan she said i should have written him and hey hey hey eileen moved up closer to her you two had a disagreement you did what you thought was right and so did he thats not either of you being a bad person youre both good people she rubbed tara s arm reassuringly maybe you could write him now just a friendly little note im sure hed like to hear from you no i couldnt do that besides its too late for that now hes better off without me dont you think he should be the judge of that maybe ill just tell him i saw you and you said to tell him hello i know hed be glad to hear that would that be too much i dont know eileen it might be if he wrote you do you think you could write back tara s head tracked a pathetic little arc she bit at her lip i dont even know if i could promise that she put her own hand over the other womans we tried eileen we really did but now its justshe shruggedits just behind us eileen ever serene nodded and thats all right too if you change your mind and want to see him when he gets back youve got our numbers still im sure or even if youd like to drop by and see us before that youre welcome anytime you know that i hope i know that thank you she leaned over and planted a kiss on eileens cheek youre great i love you eileen held herself against tara for a moment then pulled away i love you too girl and youre also pretty great us pretty greats have to stick together and try not to be so hard on ourselves ill try she said tara s vision had suddenly misted over ill really try i know you will it was wonderful seeing you dear be happy with a quick last little kiss on the cheek and a smile eileen pushed her shopping cart by behind tara turned the corner at the end of the aisle and was gone nolan arrived at tara s place within twenty minutes of getting her call now tara sat in her big chair drinking her second glass of wine it was nearly dark inside the only light in the living room coming from the kitchen with his own drink of scotch in hand nolan sat with his elbows on his knees way forward on the couch intent youve got to be kidding me it must have happened within a week or two after i left you didnt know anything about it nothing why would i know anything about it dont get defensive ron you were there thats why im sorry but no it must have been after i left evan was trying to get himself and his guys transferred out of the airport and back to their regular unit the last couple of weeks i was there it sounds like thats what must have happened if they were still with us jack allstrong would have mentioned it to me im sure pushing himself back into the cushions he sat back and crossed his legs his mom says hes at walter reed now for the last few months jesus he said thats unbelievable but if nolans pose was relaxed he felt far from ithis assumption had all along been that evan was dead or at least permanently rendered mentally incompetent after the rpg hit at masbah onofrio had insisted that they pile evan into the humvee nolan had fieldassessed the damage to evans head and it didnt look like the kind of wound from which people recovered so hed let himself be persuaded now nolan drummed his fingers on the arm of the couch but his mother said they expect him to get better completely though maybe not soon well thats good news at least and she told you all of the other troops were killed all but one thats what eileen said and then evan nolan raked his palm down the side of his face god those guys they were good kids i cant believei mean they shouldnt have even been there they should have been fixing big trucks he looked across at her so lovely and vulnerable in the dim december night her tears had begun again and now glistened on her cheeks how are you doing with this t you want to go see him no the word came out in a rush then more reflectively she said i dont know what good that would do i just didnt really expect anything like this thats all maybe i should have you know but it justwhen its someone you know who you loved she let out a weary sigh i dont know what to do with it i want him to be okay but eileen asked me if i wanted to get back in touch with him and i couldnt say i did although sometimes i think what no it just would sound bad for us i mean i can take it i know that ron you can take anything but maybe sometimes a person doesnt need to say everything youve just got to get through stuff he sipped his drink sometimes you think you would want to go see him or talk to him if it wasnt for us is that it because if it is i wont stand in your way i really wont t he came forward but let me ask you this were you thinking a lot about him before you ran into his mother and found out hed been hurt not a lot no sometimes so maybejust a thought heremaybe its guilt maybe on some level you feel like you need his permission to do what move on have a life of your own she sat on the edge of her big chair biting her lip holding her forgotten wineglass in both hands between her knees eventually slowly she began to shake her head no she said i dont think thats it okay nolan said ive been wrong before twice i think a quick smile trying to break the tension it didnt work whats your theory its not a theory so much as its a change in the facts i was living with i thought he stopped writing to me because hed stoppedloving me maybe he stopped writing to you because you didnt write back okay maybe some of that too but that wasnt really him i dont think hes a stubborn guy i mean he wrote me ten letters and i didnt answer any of them so why would he stop at number ten i think he would have kept on until i told him to stop except he got shot and he couldnt so hes still carrying a torch for you he might be and that would make a difference she blew out the breath she was holding id gotten comfortable thinking it was over thats all mutually over thinking he was okay with it it made it easier for me with me you mean she nodded which is really why i didnt write back to him you know that yes i do he sat back let out his own long breath and took a drink do you regret that us tara s head kept moving slowly from side to side i dont know ron i just dont know youre a good guy and weve had a lot of good times but she raised her eyes and looked at him her lovely face drawn with indecision and regret but i think i might need some time to sort this out a little her eyes widened god i dont even know where those words came from im not saying i want to stop seeing you i dont know what im saying nolan pushed the ice around in his glass with his index finger sitting back now an ankle on its opposite knee he let the silence hang for a few beats heres the deal he said at last you take all the time you need do everything you think you need to do the downside is i might not be around anymore if the deciding goes on too long thats just reality i dont want to lose you but i dont want half of you either just so its clear where i stand its always clear where you stand thats one of the great things about you he leveled his gaze at her youre going to call him i dont know i shouldnt at least not right now his mother made it sound like he still wasnt all the way back to normal i dont want to hear him or see him and start to feel sorry for him that wouldnt be good no it wouldnt its easy to confuse pity and love but its bad luck but ive still got to figure out where to put him for my own peace of mind and to be fair to us i get it nolan said truly he drained his drink and got to his feet but as i say t dont be too long i want for you what makes you happy but id be lying if i said i didnt hope that that was me it might be ron but im just all confused by this right now please dont hate me i couldnt hate you t you get this settled maybe we can start over thatd be good i hope it would he offered her a cold smile well listen youve got all my numbers ill wait for you to call nodding he placed his empty glass carefully on the coffee table crossed over to the front door opened it and stepped out into the night evan scholler was the enemy sometimes it was a splitsecond evaluation and sometimes a longconsidered one but once you made the decision that an enemy had to be eliminated it came down to tacticshow to do it and in this case there was no more time to be lost tara remained undecided about getting in touch with evan but that could change in the blink of an eye for all of tara s apparent reluctance at some point shed need to see or talk to him and any contact between the two of them would be a disaster nolan had lied to evan about what tara had done with his letter hed lied to her about the incident in masbah and many other things those lies and all the other ones would come out and hed lose her he couldnt let that happen so evan was the enemy nolan left taras went home and packed a bag with a heavy jacket in it and made it to the oakland airport by ten oclock in the mobbed waiting room at the jetblue terminal he found a likely looking college kid chatted him up and ended up giving him three thousand dollars in cash to cancel his own ticket so that nolan could get his own lastminute ticket on the otherwise soldout redeye flight to washington he caught four hours of solid sleep on the fivehour flight the sky was deeply overcast a light snow was falling and the temperature hovered at twentysix degrees at ten twentyfive when he arrived by cab from national airport at the main entrance to the enormous complex that was the walter reed army medical center the place brought him up a little short though he had some general understanding of the numbers of injured service personnel being treated at the center he had more or less assumed that the place was in essence just a big hospitala building with a bunch of patients and doctors it was more like its own city the main reception area throbbed with humanity it reminded him in some ways of the main hall of baghdads republican palace by the information board he checked out a rendering of the facility and saw that there were nearly six thousand roomshe figured probably fifteen to twenty thousand bedsspread out on twentyeight acres of floor space turning back to the mob he scanned the cavernous lobby hoping to get his bearings somehow a large information booth commanded a good portion of the reception areas counter space but nolan was here to neutralize one of the hospitals patients it wouldnt be a good idea to call any attention to himself returning to the rendering he found a building labeled neurology and decided to start there grabbing the map from its slot he started out across the huge campus the snow had begun to dump more heavily by the time he reached his destination and he stopped inside the door to shake out his jacket and stamp his feet the lobby here wasnt nearly as crowded as the main reception lobby but it still was far from deserted he was surprised to see four gurneys lined up against one of the walls each of them featuring hanging drips and holding a draped body the line for surgery for a room he didnt know and wasnt going to ask but it struck him as out of place and terribly wrong these guys had no doubt been wounded in the line of dutythe least the army could do he thought was get them some rooms but he wasnt here to critique conditions at walter reed the army he knew was so fucked up in so many ways that hed given up thinking about it besides that he had been running on a mixture of adrenaline and lowlevel rage ever since hed left tara s apartment last night and now suddenly the logistics of carrying out this particular mission demanded his complete attention as the tide of humanity continued to flow past him in both directions nolan experienced a rare moment of indecision why did he assume that evan scholler would be here anyway the front door of the building identified it as the neurology surgery center but evans surgery had possibly been months before and he was now probably somewhere among these fifteen thousand beds recovering or in rehab how did nolan propose to find evan without asking directions and without calling attention to himself and then once found how did he propose to kill him especially ifas seemed likely if overflow gurneys here in neurology were any indicationhe was in a room with other patients of course he could eliminate them all collateral damage was inevitably part of the equation in any military strike but this wasnt iraq where he could simply disappear without a trace here potential witnesses would have to inform him of evans location staff members or nurses might be mandated to accompany him if he visited any of the patients beyond that and perhaps most significantly nolan had to consider that lieutenant evan scholler wasnt some raghead nobody shop owner in baghdad if he were the victim of a murder here at walter reed every aspect of evans life would come under the microscope including the incident in masbah the scrutiny for which nolan had thus far managed to evade the authorities would find a reason to talk to tara and that would eventually inevitably lead back to him bottom line it was mission impossible fuck that nolan thought the guy is going down excuse me a young woman in a pressed khaki uniform smiled up at him you look a little lost can i help direct you somewhere nolans face relaxed into a smile im afraid im having some trouble finding a friend of mine one of your patients youre not the first person thats happened to she said ive got a directory over at the reception desk that is marginally up to date if youd like to come follow me he started walking next to her only marginally up to date rueful she nodded i know but were so slammed lately sometimes it takes the computer a while to catch up that darned computer nolan said i know but were trying the good news is if hes not where the computer says he is at least there theyll probably know where he went that would be good news youre being sarcastic she said and i dont really blame you but believe me good news around here is scarce enough you take it where you can get it they arrived at the reception desk now your friend she said whats his name smith nolan said first initial j we called him j but he might have been jim or john i know he added with a whatcanyoudo look its a guy thing evan scholler stared out at the falling snow he had either been asleep or didnt remember when it happened but somebody had tacked up some christmas decorations on the wall there was a tree and those animals that flew and pulled santas sledhe couldnt remember what they were called but he was sure the name would come to him someday then there was frosty the snowmanhe remembered frosty and even the song about him sung by that guy with the big nose theyd also hung up by the door one of those round things made out of evergreen branches and ornaments it was making him crazy he knew what objects were he just often couldnt remember what they were called what he did recognize as a real memory was that he was in his third room since hed arrived at walter reed his first stop for about ten days had been the intensive care unit where hed mostly been unconscious and about which he had little recollection except that while he was there he was unwilling to believe that he wasnt still in baghdad it didnt seem possible that he could have gone from squatting next to his humvee in masbah directly to the icu here of course that wasnt what had happened his speech and language therapist stephan ray had made his physical and mental journey a kind of a recognition game that hed memorized as part of his therapy his first stop after masbah had been to a combat support hospital in balad which was where they took out a piece of his skull the operation which gave his brain room to swell was called a craniectomyremembering that word had been one of evans first major successes in therapy when hed gotten it right repeating it back to stephan the day after hed learned it stephan had punched his fist in the air and predicted that he was going to recover what the doctors did next still in balad was pretty cool theyd taken the piece of his skull that theyd cut out and put it into a kind of a pouch they cut into his abdomen he could still feel it in there a little bigger than the size of a silver dollarthey were going to put it back where it belonged in his head in the next month or so when his brain had healed sufficiently from balad theyd evidently flown him to landstuhl in germany where after a quick evaluation they decided to get him here to walter reed his second room here was in ward the neuroscience unit his mom and dad told him that for his first days there the doctors more or less left him alone while the army decided if he was eligible for benefits he didnt understand thateventually they had worked it outbut nevertheless he had nothing but good memories of the ward because this is where he had met stephan though evan hadnt had a clear sense of where he was or what had happened to him in fact his therapist was there to explain things and pull him through some of the tougher disorienting times basically what they did in those first days was play games do flash cards and puzzles and simple math exercises neither stephan nor his doctors seemed to understand exactly why but evans progress was surprisingly rapid far better than that of most of the other soldiers who were in here for head wounds after only about a week in the ward they moved him again to the room he currently occupied on the fourth floor above the pediatric icu there were nineteen j smiths at walter reed but only one with traumatic brain injury similar to evans the nice nursereceptionist at neurological surgery checked her monitor at the desk and told nolan that his friend was listed as being in ward the postop neuroscience unit but that if he was still under observation thereit was only one step removed from the icushe didnt think he would be allowed to see visitors that cant be right nolan said i know his mom and dad have already been in to see him he gave her a warm smile why do i sense computer issues again im sorry she said i told you it might take a little patience he kept smiling relaxed patience is my middle name is there someplace they send brain injury patients when theyre starting to get a little better after this ward fiftyeight she screwed her lips in frustration i dont really know but wait picking up the telephone she leaned down to read something from the computer monitor then punched in some numbers hi this is iris simms at neurosurgery reception ive got a guest here to visit one of your patients jarrod smith and the computers still got him in your unit and the guest doesnt think he could still be there in which case where would he be she covered the phone and conveyed the message to nolan theres a lot of overflow but theyre saying maybe you could check the upper floors of the pediatric icu building but wait she raised a finger went back to listening he is oh i see but i understand his parents were able to see him she waited for the reply okay thank you ill let him know hanging up shaking her head in continued frustration she came back to nolan im afraid jarrod is still in ward fiftyeight but they say hes still pretty incoherent and they dont allow nonfamily guests in that unit im sorry nothing to be sorry about nolan said you gave it a good try ill call first before i come next time thanks for all your help no problem she said anytime evan might be recovering faster than most but to him it was still agonizingly slow going this morning hed tried to get once through all of his flash cardshe had six hundred of them now in a shoe box next to his bedbut by about number two hundred his head felt as though it was going to explode so hed closed his eyes just for a minute and opened them more than two hours later all of his three roommates were gone out with their rehab or other therapies outside the snow was falling in heavy clumps which he found depressingso depressing in fact along with his failure to succeed earlier with his flash cards that for a moment he succumbed to the blind hopelessness of his situation here he was never going to recover in spite of what they said hed never really be normal again people would notice the dent in his head even after they put his skull back together hed never again talk like a regular person hed never have another relationship like the one he had had with tara he wished the shrapnel had just cut a little deeper and had killed him the way it had his troops so many of them gone now so many gone regular guys and hed been leading them to their deaths sitting up in his bed he closed his eyes against the unexpected sting of unwelcome tears bringing both hands to his face he pressed hard against his eyelids willing himself to stop in an instant before he was even aware of it the selfflagellation and depression had turned as it often did to fury he was goddamned if he was going to cry but why had this happened to him why wouldnt they let him out of here why were we having this fucking stupid war anyway who cared if he ever learned his fucking flash cards he turned his head ready to slap the damn box of the things to the ground when his eyes grazed the wall again stopped for a second at the new decorations santa and reindeer those flying animals pulling the sled were reindeer that was the word he started to laugh at first it was just a small chuckle emanating from his throat but it soon swelled to something completely out of his control paroxysms that violently shook him until he could no longer catch his breath his shoulders heaved and heaved some more as he tried to grab air into his lungs and now suddenly he was crying again crying for real exhausted his body shaking with the release of so much that hed kept pent up he collapsed back into his pillows tears flowing unabated in a steady stream down his face stephan was wiping his face with a warm towel what happened here nothing what do you mean i mean your face is wet are you all right i got frustrated then the reindeer right stephan perhaps more attuned to absurdist dialogue than most people nodded as if he understood the meaning of what evan had just said but youre all right now fine youre sure sure because ive got a staff meeting in ten minutes but ill bail on it if you need me here even just to talk no im good really stephan everythings okay nolan was thinking that this was why you didnt waste too much thought on what could go wrong you just kept moving forward you kept your goal in your sights you pushed the niggling doubts out of your mind walter reed wasnt wallowing in chaos by any means but clearly it was an understaffed and overburdened institution in theory maybe somebody was supposed to inquire whom he had come to visit somebody should have checked his idhe had almost hoped for that since he had a canadian passport in his pocket that identified him as trevor lennonbut no one had beyond those oversights the crowding had become so serious that in many areas and specifically on the upper floors of the pediatric icu building that had been pressed into service for recovering brain trauma patients there was no video surveillance he was invisible there was no need to be impatient the building had six stories and hed covered floors two and three already walking the hallways with a purposeful stride as though he knew exactly where he was going he stepped into each room on both floors checking for evan as he walked the halls between rooms he nodded to patients lying on their gurneys or shuffling with their walkers gave a brisk hello to anyone who looked like a doctor or nurse or staffer he even had a name jarrod smith if anyone asked him who he was coming to visit but he didnt think that was going to prove necessary turning into the third door down on the fourth floor he saw evan in the bed across the room over by the window the three other beds in the room were all unoccupied he walked into the room and closed the door behind him checking the terrain thinking on his feet that the best way to do it would be out the window depressed braininjured guy left alone by a high window an obvious suicide dude for some reason evan found himself tempted to laugh inappropriate laughter stephan called it a normal symptom of his kind of brain injurythis time he was able to resist the impulse i know you he said after a moment of course you know me im ron nolan evan nodded thats it ron how you doin ron im good the question is how are you doing they tell me im a miracle in progress but i dont much feel like it what are you doing here i was in town and found out you were too i thought id come by and say hi what town evan asked washington dc or close enough they dont tell you where you are no they probably do he smiled i dont remember everything the way i should yet well nolan said wait a second he walked around the bed and over to the window looking left outside then right he suddenly threw up the bottom half of the doublehung window and stuck his head out bringing his body back in he asked can you get up out of bed slow but steady well check it out come on over here next time you forget where you are look out hereyou can read the walter reed logo out there on the whats a logo evan had thrown off his covers and was sitting on the edge of the bed i told you he explained some words nolan reached out a hand ostensibly to stop his talking hey a pictures worth a thousand of em come here taking him by the wrist he pulled him gently off the bed to a standing position then backed away from the window to let evan look out three steps and then nolan put a hand on the center of evans back a slight pressure moving him forward two steps whats that window doing open stephan ray yelled from the doorway youre going to freeze yourself and the rest of the room to death then pointing at nolan and who the hell is this nolan recovered without missing a beat pasted the smile back on as he turned ron nolan he said i was with evan over in iraq he was with me in iraq evan repeated glad to hear it but lets close that window what do you say and evan you shouldnt be walking around too much without the walker right he softened his tone spoke to both of them falling would not be a good thing right now no i hear you my fault nolan said sorry the door was still open to the hallway and now another man came in with his therapist and the two started to get the patient arranged on his bed the moment had passed plan b wasnt going to be nearly as satisfying final or effective in fact it might not do any kind of a job at all but at least it would give nolan time and keep evan and tara apart but he had to work his way into itbesides it was about the only possibility left with the other witnesses remaining doing their therapy on the other side of the room and with nolan identified for who he really was your nurse seemed a little upset he said when stephan had left them hes not a nurse hes a the word therapist suddenly wasnt there evan searched the corners of the ceiling for an instant and couldnt find it up there either so he regrouped came out with hes ahelper hes here to help me and sometimes i get upset tbi will do that to you tbi traumatic brain injury thats what ive got or had they tell me im getting better im not sure i believe them evan picked up the sheet that covered him he wiped some sweat off his brow it was if anything still cold on his bed but something about this man nolans presence stoked him up made him sweat with nerves what are you really doing here ron i told you i had some business in dc and thought id drop by and see how theyre treating you theyre treating me fine the snow out the window held his attention for a beat then he came back to nolan and youre not here from baghdad no i left about a week after you did what for were you hurt nolans cheek ticked no me and onofrio we picked you up then made a run for it and got out clean it was a lucky thing you got me out yeah i dont remember any of that no i dont suppose you would i didnt expect you to live nobody did i should thank you nolan shrugged line of duty dude we couldnt have left you behind what about the other guys what happened to them nolan took a breath they were all killed evan no i know that but what happened to them their bodies if we didnt get them out nobody will tell me anything about that you dont want to know dude really he paused and that ought to tell you everything you need his jaw set evan looked over again at the snow then came back to nolan so whyd you leave if you werent hurt politics they were going to offer me up maybe to the cpa maybe to the locals either way i lose so im out of there for a while at least until it blows over or all the other shit that happens every day over there covers it up what do you mean exactly what are they accusing you of some lying witnesses over in masbah said i fired too soon that the car we hit had already stopped which is bullshit since it kept coming and slammed into us way after i blew out the whole front windshield but they were going to lay it all off on me i didnt see any point in sticking around the nebulous memory in evans gut began to coalesce around nolans words the allbutforgotten moments just preceding the attack coming back to him with a sickening urgency it wasnt some lying witnesses in iraq it was people who had seen what had happened and were coming forth with the truth and the truth was that this triggerhappy son of a bitch was responsible for everything that had happened in masbah for all of evans mens deaths for all of his own suffering nolan oblivious to evans growing awareness continued anyhow this way im home for christmas doing business development over here for jack allstrong you wouldnt believe how many soldiers like me want back in on the private side the contractors market is going through the roof over there and we get the pick of the litter evans blood pounded in his brain pinpricks of bright light danced in the periphery of his vision the pain forced him to close his eyes to bring his hands up to cover them but you know nolan went on his voice suddenly taking on a confiding familiarity what im really here for is to talk about tara evan opened his eyes the throbbing inside his head squeezed itself down to a tiny pulsing silent ball of focus bringing his hands down slowly to avoid drawing attention to the internal violence of his reaction he forced a curious expression to gather in his facial muscles tara what about her is she all right shes fine shes terrific in fact nolan cleared his throat the thing is though the main reason i wanted to see you in person i thought i owed it to you what to tell you to your face that tara and me were kind of an item were going out together i thought the right thing would be to let you know evan felt his hands tighten into fists again under the sheets but he couldnt find a response in words right away until at last he said all right now i know i dont blame you for being pissed off nolan said evans nostrils flared and his breath seemed to be coming in ragged chunks but he said im not pissed off its none of my business we were broken up yeah sure but i met her doing an errand for you thats got an odor on it you being hurt makes it worse so you want some kind of forgiveness youre barking up the wrong tree dude i dont think so and i dont have a guilty conscience i just wanted you to know how it happened so youd know it wasnt me i didnt start it i dont care how it happened no youd want to know it was when i came to tell her youd been hit you did that what for i thought i owed it to both of you nolan raised his right hand i swear to god i went over to her place as your comradeinarms i told her the whole story that youd been talking about her the night before the attack that you knew shed ripped up your last letter and were still going to try to work things out with her beyond the bare truth of tara and rons involvement with each other a far more important fact leapt out at evan and he wanted to make sure of it youre saying she knew i was hit from before i even got here to walter reed nolan nodded within a week of it anyway all she said was that this is what she assumed was going to happen when you went over in the first place when you actually left she was done thats why she never wrote its why she never contacted you here it was over dude when she knew i was coming out here this trip i told her i was going to come see you and at least try to explain my side of it theres nothing to explain who wouldnt want her you think i blame you for that i barely knew you for a few weeks in iraq you didnt owe me squat ron and okay you got her good luck i mean it now get out of here would you get out of here im going nolan said but theres one last thing i asked if there was anything she wanted me to say to you you need to hear this you know what she said i cant imagine heres the quote im sad he got hurt and i hope hes okay but ive really got nothing to say to him he made his bed he can lie in it it took tara three days to work up the nerve to call evan still uncertain exactly about what she was going to say even once shed made up her mind to call she actually wrote some ideas down so shed hit all the notesshe didnt know hed been injured she missed him mostlyshe wrote it five separate timesshe was going to say she was sorry she was going to tell him that when shed found out what had happened to him she was resolved to reach out and try to connect with him again in spite of how badly shed treated him by not answering his letters she hoped he could forgive her she had been wrong and she was sorry sorry sorry now she had to know where she stood with him before she could go on with her life anymore in spite of their philosophical differences theyd had something rare and special he knew that she was sure theyd both changed since hed left and possibly it could never work between them but maybe they could at least start talking again and see where that led sitting in the big chair in her living room she listened to the ring at the other end of the line three thousand miles away her mouth was dry her heart pumping wildly she realized that she was holding her breath and let that go with an audible sigh reminding herself to breathe again hello hello evan is that you no this is stephan ray do you want evan scholler im his therapist yes please if hes there just a second can i tell him whos calling tara wheatley stephan repeated her name away from the phone and then she heard evans voice unnaturally harsh and unyielding tara wheatley i dont want to talk to any tara wheatley ive got nothing to say to her stephan must have covered the mouthpiece with his hand because his next words were muffled but even through the muffling there was no mistaking what evan said next it was loud enough they probably heard it at the pentagon didnt you hear me i said im not talking to tara wheatley get it im not talking to her tell her to get out of my life and stay out i mean it next she heard what sounded like a heavy object being thrown against a wall or knocked onto the floor and swearing evan insane with rage or just insane from what hed been through back in redwood city tara stared at the mouthpiece that she held in her shaking right hand then slowly as though the violence shed heard in it might escape and hurt her further she lowered it into its cradle five months later at the main redwood city police station evan scholler sat waiting in a hard chair just outside the room to which he had been summoned the small wireglassenclosed cage that was the office of his boss lieutenant james lochland evans shift had ended twenty minutes ago at five oclock the summons had been taped to his locker downstairs now as he sat he could see lochland at his desk moving paperwork from a pile in the center of it to one of the trays at the far right corner when the surface of the desk was clear the lieutenant drew a deep breath looked through his wired glass met evans eyes and in his nononsense style crooked an index finger at him indicating he should come on in lochland was a young forty and considered a good guy by most of his troops who as patrolmen were by and large like evan young themselves the scars from a severe case of teenage acne marred what would have been an otherwise handsome face so that now he came across as approachable he wore his brown hair a little long by cop standards and cultivated a mustache that could use a trim now he told evan to shut the door behind him to take one of the two seats that faced his desk he had his hands clasped loosely in front of him on the pale green blotter and waited while his visitor was seated whats up sir you wanted to see me yeah thats why i sent the note i thought maybe itd be a good idea if we had a little informal chat and maybe nip a couple of habits or tendencies in the bud before they get you in trouble but before we go into any detail on those things i wanted to ask you how you think things are going in a general way in your life i mean pretty good sir i think but listen if thereve been complaints lochland held up a restraining hand if there have well get to em promise but were not there yet meanwhile what im really asking about is your state of mind how you feel about being back here in the job pretty good i feel okay about it im glad to be back lochland nodded put on a tolerant look you sleeping evan let out a breath started a smile that went nowhere most nights whenever i can you need help with it whats that getting to sleep sometimes ill have a drink or two yes sir when i cant get my mind turned off what are you thinking about evan shrugged iraq he let out a long sigh lifted his shoulders again i cant seem to get it out from inside me the guys i lost my girlfriend the whole thing you talking to somebody a shrink you mean anybody i talked to some woman at the palo alto va until my discharge came through and that was just before you started here right april nineteeth not that ill have a party on that date for the rest of my life or anything so yeah a couple of weeks before i started here and youre not talking to anybody since then they didnt give you any referrals for when you were done with them this brought a snort uh no im reading between the lines here but youre saying you think ive still got issues im asking thats all im asking if maybe its a little too soon if you feel like youre under too much stress you mean posttraumatic stress lochland shrugged any kind of stress stress you dont need if youre trying to do a good job as a cop what im saying is that there are programs weve got here and people we could recommend if you think you need it i dont want to go down that road what road ptsd you get that label youre damaged goods the army says im good physically and mentally im the miracle child now if one of our own shrinks says ive got ptsd im done thats not exactly accurate evan shook his head its close enough post traumatic stress disorder disorder lieutenant thats a mental illness im not copping to that period thats not what im dealing with im fine sir maybe i just need to let a little more time go by again evan let a long breath escape there lochland said thats what im talking about what you dont feel that when you do it youre sighing like a bellows evan every time you open your mouth its like youre lifting this burden and dropping it on the side before you can say anything after a second evan hung his head he came close to whispering thats the way i feel raising his eyes he looked across the top of the desk so how am i screwing up on the job i mean in spite of military guidelines supposedly guaranteeing that police officers who got deployed to active duty from the reserves or the national guard would be returned to their civilian work without demotion or loss of time served evans assignment since hed come back to work as a redwood city patrolman was roving grammar school officer for the drug abuse resistance education dare program in that role he visited classrooms of fourth fifth and sixthgraders all over the city spreading the doctrine of clean and sober living though it wasnt a technical demotion and paid what he was making when hed been called up it still was not a job normally held by someone with three full years on the force but it was the only opening theyd had when he was discharged and ready to go back to work and he had taken it now lochland reached out and took a small stack of papers from his top tray removing the paper clip from the top he leafed through them quicklythere were perhaps a dozen pagesthen put them all down on his desk i dont think we have to go over these one by one ev theyre pretty much the same evan sat stiffly his back pushed up tight against the chair he had little doubt as to what the complaints had been about i just cant stand to see these kids whove got everythingi mean everything lieutenantipods twohundreddollar shoes designer clothesi cant stand to see how spoiled they are how they dont take anything seriously i mean this whole dare thing its a joke to them and when i think of the kids i saw over there in iraq with nothing no shoes no food begging for mre handouts he shook his head the rave worn down by its own momentum lochland sat forward elbows on the desk hands templed in front of his mouth youre not there to yell at them evan you cant let yourself lose your temper they dont listen lieutenant they dont listen to a word i say theyve got everything going for them in the whole world and they dont give a good goddamn still lochland pushed the papers around in front of him the point is schools out soon enough anyway anywhere you get assigned next i solemnly promise youll have more aggravation than these kids could give you on their best day serious aggravation you cant go out there on the streets halfcocked and ready to explode that just cant be any part of the job he pulled himself up in his chair lowered his voice look evan were all proud as hell of you of what youve done of the fact that youve come back at all youre our poster boy too but youve got to get yourself under control youve got to let this stuff go yes sir i know i do im sorry sorrys a good start but im thinking maybe you want to think about anger management maybe take a class maybe talk to somebody some professional im afraid that if i get any more complaints after this little talk it wont be a request and next time well have an hr person in here with us understand yes sir you think you can do this yes sir i think you can too evan but get some help and some sleep yes sir thank you sir ill try he wasnt supposed to engage in any sports that had a physical risk or contact element for at least another year and depending on his followup neurological examinations maybe forever this left out his favorites softball and basketballhed been active at least a couple of nights every week on a cityleague mens team in both sports before hed been deployed but the police department had a bowling league and while it wasnt much in the way of exercise it was something to do to get out of the apartment at night and mix with some of his colleagues even if they were generally from a somewhat different subsetheavier slower and olderfrom the softball and basketball guys the positive aspect of this population was that it included men who had attained seniority or rankevans three teammates included two sergeant detectives and a lieutenant all of whom were more than happy to have recruited a returning young war hero with an average of they all thought the kid had a chance to seriously turn pro he was a natural tonight his threegame score of was fifty points better than any of them individually and more than enough to ensure the totems victory over their opponents the waterdogs so heres to the totems intoned robberydivision sergeant stan paganini hoisting a gin and tonic in the trinity lanes bar after the games and their upcoming undefeated season lieutenant fred spinoza raised his glass of bourbon on the rocks and to our own uncontested rookie of the year doctor evan scholler spinoza often bestowed random honorifies such as doctor on his colleagues when he got enthusiastic or excited six twentyone thats got to be close to the record set i know ive never heard of a higher one three twohundred games in a row that just doesnt happen in this league in any nonpro league they ought to write you up ev get your name in the sports page this was whitecollardivision sergeant taylor blades drinking a brandy alexander thanks anyway guys evan had acquired a taste for scotch but couldnt afford any of the single malts so he was drinking a cutty sark and soda on the rocks but ive been in the paper enough to last me for a while yeah but not as a sports hero paganini said you get known as a sports hero you become a babe magnet its a known fact hes got a point spinoza acknowledged your teammates could benefit too we could pick off stragglers from the swarm around you think about that what it could mean to us and our happiness yeah but you guys are all married anyway evan said youd just get in trouble and besides which i think the whole babemagnet question in an amateur bowling league even if its a really good article is going to be more or less underwhelming no blades said theres got to be bowling groupies in fact i think i see a bunch of em coming in right now maybe the word got out about your set already he snapped his fingers youtube somebody was filming you on their cell phone and they posted it right up and all these chicks but spinoza was holding out a hand stopping blades midrant ev he said is everything all right in the bathroom evan threw water in his face a few times checking his reflection in the mirror to make sure nothing showed in his expression when he went back to the guys he told them that hed just gotten whacked by a wave of dizzinessan occasionally recurring symptom from his head wound he excused himself apologizing for raining on the postgame parade saying he thought hed better go home early like now and lie down if he was going to be any good for work the next day instead he went outside and moved his car to the back of the parking lot so they wouldnt see it when they left a half hour later after hed seen them all leave he got out of the car and walked back into the alley where he took a stool at the bar and ordered another cutty sark a double this time on the rocks taras lane wasnt fifty feet from where he sat she was with three girlfriends all of them acting animated and happy she wore a short white polkadotted red skirt that showed off her shapely legs and on top a red spaghettistrap silk blouse that he fancied he could see shimmering to the beat of her heart drinking off his scotch in a couple of swallows he ordered another double and watched the group of young men from the next alley strike up if not a conversation then from the body language a running flirtatious banter at least evan thought she wasnt here with ron nolan that would have been very hard to take far harder than seeing her alone which was difficult enough was she still seeing him he wondered or could she in fact be unattached again and if she was unattached but what was he thinking this was the woman who hadnt even cared about his neardeath in iraq whose selfrighteousness made her write him off forever when he was simply trying to do his duty who never even wrote him one letter or returned one email from the minute he left looking at her now so carefree it suddenly seemed impossible to him that the person hed known and loved for two years had changed so much she had always had strong opinions but one of her best traits and what his mother had always loved about her the most was her innate kindness tara had always been a good person what had happened that had changed her so very much well he was going to find out putting a twentydollar bill in the bars gutter he again emptied his glass like a man dying of thirst when he stood up the dizziness hed invented for his teammates came and whopped him upside the head for real he stood leaning against the bar for a few seconds getting his bearings surprised at how tipsy hed becomehed only had four or five beers during his games and then the five shots of scotch in the bar or were they all doubles he took a step or two and had to grab the back of a nearby chair at one of the tables for support this wouldnt do he wasnt about to approach tara as a stumbling and slurring drunk he didnt want to make it easy for her to dismiss him out of hand as a common nuisance he would pick another time when he was sober looking down at her and her friends one last time he concentrated on his walking and made it to the front door without mishap then down the steps and out to his crv in the darkness at the back of the lot settling into the front seat he locked the car doors and fastened his seat belt lowered the backrest nearly to horizontal leaned all the way back and closed his eyes evan heard the reports from heavy rifles bullets pinging now off the asphalt all around him he was screaming at alan and marshawn get down get down take cover the barrage continued a steady staccato as the car was hit and hit again he turned to look and the second car behind him now was a twisted wreck the bodies of two more of his men bleeding out onto the street where theyd been thrown from the force of the blast and then suddenly he was aware that it was dark and that the beam from nolans headlamp was on him blinding him as he tried to get his humvee moving from his position up on the roof of it his hands up in front of his face he yelled down to the driver kill that light now more bullets raked the car but as the muffled sound filtered into his consciousness it became more of a repeated thudding a knocking when he opened his eyes the light was still in his face but this time he recognized it for what it wasa flashlight outside the car still shaking from the fear and immediacy of the dream he took another second or two before he knocked on his own drivers window then held his hand up to block the light he could see enough in the pool of the streetlight above them to make out a couple of uniforms cops his brethren he rolled down the window halfway hey guys whats going on he shot a glance at his watch it was three thirtyfive the officer with the flashlight moved back a step or two could you please show us your drivers license and registration sir well sure i uh he reached for the door handle and pulled it to open the door but the near officer outside slammed it back closed spoke through the halfopen window please stay in your vehicle license and registration please whereve you been buddy evan stopped digging for his wallet for a moment and sat back closed his eyes tried to remember trinity lanes he said at last the view of a suburban street out his cars windshield had him disoriented i was bowling and drinking it would appear so which leads to the question of how you got here but as he opened evans wallet the officer would have had a hard time missing the badge holy christ he said with disgust and flashed it at his partner handing him the id then back to the car he said you know how you got here from the lanes somebody must have driven you right evan just looked at him cause you wouldnt have tried to drive in the state youre in would you but then the second cop butted in youre evan scholler this one he could answer yeah number two said to his partner the guy from iraq then to evan am i right pal right you dont have your gun on you do you nope in the glovebox the first cop shook his head in frustration then said you want to get out now you can he pulled open the door smells like a distillery in there pal not surprised evan replied you might want to open the windows let it air out for the next time youre driving the first cop said so for the record he continued do you remember who drove you over here by now evan knew where hed gotten to and where hed parked although the piece of the puzzle concerning the actual drive over was a complete blank my girlfriend he pointed to the apartment building across the way she lives right up there we had a fight and she left me in the car to sleep it off thats a good story the first cop said you want to lock up here and go up there now well stick around till you get in evan leaned back against his car he swayed slightly from side to side were not living together she wont let me in ive got to get back to my place the second cop handed the wallet back to evan how you gonna do that evan took a beat deciding whether or not he should laugh he decided against it good question he said excellent question he looked from one of them to the other i guess ill walk its not that far thanks guys sorry for the hassle hed gone about five steps none of them very steady when one of them spoke from behind him scholler maybe you want to lock up your car stopping he turned back to them the first cop said itd be a bad idea to pretend to walk until we pulled out and then come back and try to drive yeah evan said thatd be dumb wheres your place the second cop asked just up by the college evan said the second cop said to his partner not that far only about four miles all uphill the one with the flashlight said get in the squad car with me and hell follow us to your place in your wheels you barf in my car you clean it up got it evan said evan was at his parents home for a sunday dinner that had become a more or less regular event since he had come back out to california once daylight saving time arrived every year jim scholler barbecued almost every night and on this warm evening in late may hed grilled chicken which theyd eaten with fresh spring asparagus a loaf of sourdough bread and eileens famous tomatopotato salad with cilantro and red onions now still long before true dusk they were sitting outside in the schollers large backyard in the long shadows cast by their miniorchard of plum fig lemon orange and apricot trees over their last glasses of cheap white wine and with evan now reemployed with the police department ensconced in his new apartment and with the immediate physical danger from his head wound behind them at long last eileen had mustered the courage to ask evan about his love life he dredged up a chuckle what love life youre not seeing anybody at all thats not been at the top of my priorities mom im not really looking his father cleared his throat what about tara what about her the answer came out more harshly than hed intended didnt i mention that she never answered one of my lettersnot one dadand i wrote about a dozen of them that said it all clear enough plus last i heard she had another boyfriend when did you hear that eileen asked at walter reed in fact the guy came to see me who did jim asked taras new boyfriend whyd he do that i dont know guilt probably over dating tara jim asked over stealing my girlfriend after i sent him over with one of my last letters to hand deliver to her and instead he snags her away while im halfdead in the hospital could a person feel guilt about that or maybe if you were the reason a whole squad got wiped out you mean your boys eileen asked are you saying that taras new boyfriend is the man in your convoy who shot too soon you got it mom ron nolan i believe ive mentioned him once or twice never nicely jim said evan slugged some wine whats nice to say evan eileen frowned and threw him a quizzical glance i dont think id heard before that he was seeing tara but wait a minute jim said i thought you and tara broke up over the war wasnt this guy nolan over there too yeah evan said funny huh so i guess maybe it wasnt the war with me and tara after all maybe she just wanted out and that was a good excuse no eileens voice was firm thats not who tara is she would have just told you the truth he shook his head i dont think we know who the real tara is mom not anymore anyway but jim came back with his original question so this guy nolan came to walter reed to apologize or what that was the spin he put on it but you ask me it was to rub it in why would he do that eileen asked because thats who he is mom hes a mercenary who shot up that iraqi car because he wanted to period because he could and if you want my opinion he came to walter reed among other reasons to show me hed gotten clean away with it and while he was at it he stole my girlfriend this is not a good guy believe me then what does tara see in him thats what ive been getting at mom shes not who you think she is i still dont see how you can say that facing his mothers implacable calm her hardwired refusal to think ill of anybody evan suddenly felt his temper snap he slapped a palm flat down on the table his voice breaking okay how about this mom when nolan told her id been wounded you know what she said she said i made my bed i could sleep in it her exact words his eyes had become glassy but the tears shimmering in them were of rage not sorrow she just didnt care mom thats who she is now for a few seconds the only sound in the backyard was the susurrus of the breeze through the leaves of the fruit trees i cant believe that eileen said finally that just cant be true evan drew a deep breath and raised his head to look straight at his mother exhausted and angry he nevertheless had his voice under control no offense mom but how can you know that thats what she said eileen reached out across the picnic table and put a reassuring hand on her sons arm and when was this she asked when was what when she heard that youd been wounded and said youd made your own bed and you could sleep in it i dont know exactly sometime in early september right after nolan got back home about the time i got to walter reed no thats not possible she told him about meeting tara just before christmas in the supermarket i may be terminally predisposed to seeing the good in people she said and i know that sometimes im wrong but there is no possible way that she had heard about your being wounded before i told her and that was in december if thats true why didnt she call me then just to see how i was doing wish me luck some he stopped abruptly suddenly remembering the reindeer on the wall across from his bed and that her call to him at walter reedwhen hed refused to speak to herhad been just before christmas or if his mother was right within a few days of when tara had heard for the first time that hed been injured eileen patted evans arm she didnt call you because maybe she was already going out with this nolan man by then maybe she felt guilty about that or maybe she just thought it would be too awkward but my point is she certainly didnt know back in september that youd been hurt and it really doesnt sound like her to say youd made your own bed but then why would jim whod been listening carefully to the debate suddenly couldnt keep the enthusiasm from his voice he knew the answer before evan finished asking the question why would nolan come all the way to walter reed to tell you a lie could it be so that youd get to hate tara so much that you wouldnt be tempted to call her when you got back evans flat gaze went from his father over to his mother back to his father again you know dad he said youve gotten pretty smart in your old age the sun was just settling in behind the foothills as evan ascended the outside steps at taras apartment building and rang her doorbell when there was no answer he walked down to the kitchen window and peered inside where the lights were off and nothing moved he should have called first and made sure she was home but the determination to go directly from his parents house and talk to her had come as an impulse and acting on the impulsehe was mostly sober wellrested recently showered and shaved thered never be a better timehed told his parents goodnight jumped in his car and driven down since she hadnt been with nolan at the bowling alley evan had more than halfway convinced himself that her relationship with him was over and if that were the case hed talk to her and see once and for all if there was any trace of a spark left to what theyd had in spite of everything at least theyd be dealing with the truth hed parked not in the buildings parking lot but out in the street in the same space his unconscious had apparently picked the other night now he went back to the car and got in taking out his cell phone he began to scroll down to her numbers both cell and home but then stopped if she was still going out with nolan or worse if she was out with him at this moment the timing would be disastrous he turned on the cars engine for a minute so he could roll down the drivers window and saw that the clock on the dash read ninefifteen one of the inviolable rules of taras life while theyd been going out was that she wouldnt stay out too late or party too hard on a school night and sunday was a school night setting his seat back down a couple of notches but to where he could still see above the ledge of the window he turned the engine off and settled down to wait it didnt take long there was still a trace of natural light left in the day when a yellow corvette top down turned into the lot tara was in the passenger seat and still with nolan all right he got out and came around and opened her door and they walked casually familiar hand in hand across the parking lot and up the stairs she opened the door and they both went inside and evan felt the blood pulsing in his temples he put his hand gently over the area when hed been wounded and imagined that it felt hotter than it had been in the apartment the kitchen lights went on in the front window a shadow passed into the frame occupied it for a moment or two then moved out the roomand the entire apartmentdarkened again evan placed his shaking hands on the steeering wheel and tried to get some physical control back into his body swallowing was difficult sweat had broken on his brow and down his back what was he going to do cmon cmon cmon cmon cmon he said to himself but it was an empty imperative with no meaning seeing them together knowing that they were in fact a couple rendered unimportant the days discovery that perhaps tara hadnt cruelly ignored his injuries what did that matter if she was sleeping with nolan if he was in her life and evan wasnt suddenly rocked with selfloathing and hatred he allowed a steely calm to wash over him like most offduty cops he kept his weapon available for emergencies his semiautomatic was locked in his glove compartment and now he took it out checking the chamber and the safety he took a breath and then opened his car door tucking the gun under his hawaiian shirt into his belt he stepped out into the street evan sat at one of the computers at police headquarters there wasnt much call for accessing the department of motor vehicles database with his work in the dare program and this was the first time hed actually had occasion to use the departments software so far it hadnt gone as quickly as he would have liked in a perfect world he could have already been in and out and nobody would have seen him which would have been his preference but his world hadnt been perfect for a long time and sure enough suddenly at ninethirty on a sunday night when the whole station should have been all but deserted somebody called out his name from the doorway straightening his back he hit the esc button and jerked his head to the side so quickly he felt a crick in his neck as he looked over to see lieutenant spinoza from the totems now coming toward him breaking a casual smile he said hey fred whats going on people keep killing each other thats what so we poor public servants have to burn the midnight oil and then some he gripped evans shoulder but hey how are you feeling he said i didnt like the way that dizziness came up on you all of a sudden the other night no im fine i dont know what that was my brain whacking out on me again well whatever it was you looked like you got hit by a train and i mean that in the most flattering possible way he pulled around the chair next to evan and straddled it backward youre aware i hope that when youre not feeling good you can call in sick everybody knows what youve been through you dont have to push it nobodys going to bust your chops if you need a little time off plus the major issue just to keep life in perspective we need you sharp for the game next tuesday rather than frittering away your energies trying to convince kids not to smoke dope im all right fred really i dont need to take time off obviously if youre down here now whats so important on a sunday night evan gestured vaguely at the screen in front of him honing up on my computer skills he crossed his arms over his chest all nonchalance but why are you here id say the usual but its not spinoza had clearly put in a long day already does the name ibrahim khalil mean anything to you should it is that an iraq question the response slowed spinoza down no he said but where youre coming from i can see thats how it would hit you but no mr khalil liveslivedin this mansion in menlo park he owns about half the elevens on the peninsula owned he and his wife dont own anything anymore though if it is him and his wife what do you mean you dont know spinoza shook his head well we know it was their house and we know there were two bodies in it but its going to be a while before we can put the pieces back together the pieces of what their bodies evan digested that for a second then asked did somebody cut em up no somebody blew em up like with a bomb or something which of course set the house on fire and burned half of it down around them so we wont for sure know much of the details for a while but the neighbors all heard an explosion and then the fire somebody trying to get rid of the evidence spinoza broke a small weary smile of approval not only does he bowl he said he also thinks i think i see a detective badge in your future my son lets get me out of dare first thats a good idea how much longer you on that well after schools out evan let out a tired breath i can handle it if i can just keep from strangling any of the kids yeah dont do that parents get all upset suddenly spinozas gaze went to the computer and he clucked in a schoolmarm fashion a couple of times this boys and girls is a bozo nono what is what is he asks im sure you think im an idiot he spoke in an exaggerated stage whisper weand by we i mean the departmentwe officially frown upon this method of meeting pretty young women he lowered his voice further but really privacy issues dont go there if you got busted it wouldnt be pretty im not trying to find a girl fred spinoza nodded of course youre not perish the thought i just thought on the off chance that you were that id point out to you the departments policy so whose address are you looking for then just this guy spinoza raised his eyebrows same rules go for cute guys he said i know were not supposed to ask about sexual orientation but im not gay fred some of my dare kids say this guys selling dope so why dont you just kick it over to vice cause theyd just put it on a back burner and if i find out this guy is really selling drugs to my kids im going to hunt him down and kill him thats different then why didnt you just say so spinoza moved in closer to the keyboard so you got a plate number for the first time since hed left walter reed evan felt he needed to talk to his therapist stephan ray he didnt know if there was a technical term for what he was experiencing but subjectively it felt somewhat similar to his inability to recall the names for things in the first months after his surgery except that now and several other times in the past few days he had found himself in the middle of some activity or in the grip of some emotional reaction and didnt seem to have a memory of how hed come to be there or any control over his actions earlier tonight by the corvette with the gun for example what did he think he was going to do with the gun what did he want to do with the gun he didnt know didnt recall any moment of actual decision first he was sitting in his car waiting for tara to come home so he could have a reasonable discussion with her and the next thing he knewthe next thing he rememberedhe was standing by the corvette in the parking lot with his gun in his hand wondering why his gun was in his hand surely he wasnt planning to shoot nolan or tara or god forbid both of them maybe hed decided to shoot out one or more of nolans fancyrimmed tires in the dim light of early evening that at least seemed like a semibaked idea but his sentient mind realized that this would produce a loud noise and the very likely possibility that hed at least be seen and possibly be recognized it would alsoperhapsannounce himself as interested in nolans activities in a way that hed rather keep to himself until he made some rational decisions about what he wanted to do with the rest of his life with tara the stop at the police station had been a rational decision he knew what he wanted there though he wasnt sure why he wanted it and he knew how to get it but now having learned where nolan lived and having driven up there he found himself sitting in his car parked curbside again with his gun in his hand if nolan came home alone it wouldnt be the same situation at all as it had been when tara was with him this was a quiet street far less traveled than taras lined with mature trees the address was a nicelooking standalone townhome with attached garage amid a cluster of similar units separate yet somewhat isolated perfect for for what he asked himself and suddenly again the awareness of where he was of what he was doing flooded back he was doing something herefiguratively staring at a drawing of a reindeer and wondering what the name of it wasbut the exact nature of what he hoped to accomplish continued to elude him looking down at the gun he reached over and placed it back into the stillopen glove compartment then closed the door behind it turned the key to lock it up then the keys in his hand he realized that he had to get out of here before he did something stupid something that he couldnt even explain to himself so he hit the ignition the dashboard clock read ten fortytwo putting the car into gear he pulled out from the curb and hadnt gone twenty feet when he jammed his foot on the brakes enough to make the tires squeal his windows were down he hadnt turned his headlights on and running dark with a warm breeze over him sparked a jolt of familiarity in the months since hed been injured it had left the forefront of his memory but now suddenly all the elements of this night rekindled a vision of the episode with nolan when theyd raided the insurgents lair in the neighborhood close to biap the bright light and the terrific explosion blowing out the windows the flames licking into the night as gunfire erupted behind him a mercenary mission to kill an explosion and then a fire a dog barked somewhere in the neighborhood evan let out the breath hed been holding turned on his headlights and eased his foot off the brake well my son the latest theory which might still be wrong spinoza said is that it was a thing called a fragmentation grenade you ought to know about them theyre evidently using em in iraq right now blow the shit out of everything so you need a snow shovel to pick up the pieces which pretty much fits what happened here by the way he sat back in his chair and picked up his sandwich putting his feet up on the desk he took a bite so why do you want to know you teaching execution techniques in dare to the little fuckers no reason really evan said i just thought it was interesting i dont think ive ever heard of somebody being killed that way at least not here in the states yeah well the lieutenant chewed thoughtfully its not the norm ill give you that somebody wanted these people completely dead in a big loud way it wasnt some gangbanger taking potshots at a residence and hoping somebody gets hit could the guy the victim have done it himself spinoza shrugged not impossible i guess theres no evidence pointing to anybody else but also theres absolutely no sign so far of why mr khalil would want to do that the businesses were going great he apparently loved the wife no health problems at least thats what we got from the rest of the family and believe me theres a lot of the rest of the family so im betting against murdersuicide which leaves a pro cause ill tell you one thing whoever did this did it right at this moment the only evidence weve got ismaybethe bits of the frag grenade and just between you and me im kind of hoping we dont have that why not because as we stand now weve got a local murder of a businessman at least we can get away with calling it that since ibrahim was a naturalized citizen whered he come from i thought i told you that last night iraq half his family evidently still lives there the other half has the eleven concession for the bay area wrapped up here so whats the issue if youve got a frag grenade you cant own a frag grenade its a federal offense which means the atfs involved which in turn sucks so how do you find out if it was a frag grenade spinoza came down in his chair brought his feet to the floor fear not my son the atf has already picked up samples from the scene theyll have it analyzed by tonight and soon well all know for sure if it is what it is the fbis in before morning the preliminary call is yep frags so its gonna be their case whys that so bad fred dont they have a lot more resources than we do oh no question spinoza said more resources more money more access to data the whole nine yards the thing is thoughthey dont share so we wind up spending a week finding stuff they already have its kind of a race to see who can get there fastest but weve got one leg tied behind our backs i dont think thats exactly the expression no spinoza popped his last bite of sandwich well thats what it feels like he knew the locksmith from ace hardware both from his high school class and from his mens softball team now at a few minutes before two oclock on an afternoon after evan had told his lieutenant james lochland that he was suffering from a migraine and needed to go lie down in his dark bedroom dave saldar pulled up outside of nolans townhouse and parked in back of evans crv evan in his police uniform to reinforce his legitimacy got out of his car and they highfived each other on the sidewalk after a couple of minutes of catching upsaldar had heard some of evans story from guys on the teamthey got around to what evan had called dave up here for you didnt hide a spare under a rock or something saldar asked no i didnt think id ever forget my keys who forgets their keys my wife does every time she leaves the house yeah well i dont i never have before i would love one thin dime for every time id heard those exact words why do you think the world invented locksmiths i never could figure that out well now you know saldar inclined his head toward the townhomes okay which ones yours they went down to nolans doorway partially enclosed and blocked from the street by an lshaped glassblock privacy screen saldar got out his tools and went to work evan found that his legs were weak enough that he had to lean against the screen for support with each passing second the enormity of the implications of what he was doing worked on his system he felt as lightheaded as hed been on nolans night raid outside of biap a jackhammer pulse pounded where theyd cut open his skull the migraine hed invented for lieutenant lochland threatened to become a realitypinpoints of light exploded at the outer edges of his vision he kept looking to the street nearly passing out when a yellow miata convertible crested the incline and drove by saldar noticing something in his reaction glanced up at him you all right good he said in fact he could feel the sweat breaking on his forehead summoning all the control he could muster he brought his hand up and dragged it across his brow at last saldar turned the knob and pushed the door open there you go a minute and fifteen seconds this could be a new record im sure it is dave thats awesome saldar was holding open the front door hey are you okay ev you really dont look so good im all right the heads acting up a little thats all he reached back for his wallet thinking ive got to get him out of here what if nolan shows up but keeping it casual he said so whats the damage lets call it thirty since were friends you want you can go grab your set of keys and i can make you a couple of quick copies right out of the truck five bucks each thats all right evan fished out two twenties i know ive got some dupes inside ive just got to remember to put em out here somewhere for next time but right now i think id better get in there and lie down a minute sure okay but let me run and get you your change no keep it i cant take tips from teammates ev its one of my rules ive got some cash back in the truck wont take me thirty seconds he put a firm hand on his friends shoulder dave really im hurting a little here thanks for your help but ive got to get horizontal pretty quick or im going to get sick seriously take care of yourself ill see you around you need a doctor the effort for even half a smile was almost too much to bear you dont let me get inside pretty quick youre gonna need a doctor you hear me all right all right but stop by the field sometime were still playing tuesdays and thursdays i will promise ill buy you some beers with your tip money deal evan said stepping inside the door later he stood in the living room part of him had a hard time believing that he was truly here illegally inside another mans home it felt surreal this wasnt who he was it wasnt the kind of thing hed ever done or even thought about doing but now once inside he couldnt let those considerations slow him down there was no telling when nolan might return evan had no idea what hours he worked or what he did on a daytoday basis or even if he had any regular schedule at all if there was something incriminating to be found in this place and evans guts told him there was he had to find it and then get out fast it wasnt a matter of finding evidence that could be used in courthe simply wanted the knowledge or at least thats what he let himself believe he would decide then how to use what he knew at his leisure the room he was in was spartan furnished with a leather couch and matching twin leather chairs in front of builtin mostly empty bookshelves on either side of the fireplace a large mirror over the mantel gave an impression of space but the room probably wasnt more than ten feet wide half of the back wall was a glass doorway that opened onto a small brick patio shaded by large oak trees a potted plant squatted in the corner the first glance told him that there would be nothing of interest here but he forced himself to slow down and make sure when he was done he parted the blinds in the front window saw nothing out in the street and crossed the tiled entry area that led into the kitchen which didnt have much more personality than the living room it was however quite a bit more exposed since the doublewide window over the sink looked out over the small lawn to the street beyond it didnt appear that nolan did a lot of cooking for himselfthe refrigerator had eggs beer a pack of american cheese and milk with tomatoes and lettuce in the vegetable bin and some condiments while the freezer held three boxes of frozen spinach a carton of ice cream and a few packages of chicken breasts and ground beef a door next to the refrigerator led out to the small singlecar garage where nolan had hung his empty duffel bag and two empty backpacks on hooks on the far wall an uncluttered workbench obviously hadnt seen much use and neither had the drawers under it back in the kitchen evan finally got his nerves under control as he scoped out the street again and then ducked under the window passing through just off the living room in the back of the house he entered a decentsized den with a desk and a computer the wall featured a tackedup map of iraq with several colorcoded pins stuck in various spotsbaghdad mosul kirkuk abu ghraib anaconda evan tried the mouse first to see if the monitor screen came on and when it didnt he hit the button on the cpu while it booted up he went through the next door into the bedroom and stopped in his tracks drawing a heavy breath he crossed over to the bureau next to his enemys perfectly made bed and picked up the photograph of nolan and tara in a heavy silver frame they were hugging each other for the picture obviously from the deck of a boat out on the bay both smiling out at him on a lovely day he held the picture long enough that the urge to smash it against the wall came and went then replacing it carefully in its original position he went back to his searching in earnest dresser drawers bathroom drawers cupboards and closets the headboard of the bed yielded up the first weapon another m beretta the same weapon that evan had carried in iraq he smelled the barrel and picked up no odor then removed the clip and verified that it was full but a pro like nolan if he had used the gun would have cleaned it and reloaded immediately afterward the bedroom closet neat like the rest of the house contained another backpack on the top shelf this one he emptied out on the bed piece by piece it held another beretta mm ten clips of ammunition and six hand grenades evan didnt know for sure if they were fragmentation grenades or the socalled flashbangs which were nowhere near as lethal but either way he was willing to bet that they were illegal in the hands of private citizens evan was sure that they would be of interest to the police once he figured out a way to get some law enforcement person interested in nolan as a suspect in the khalil murders replacing the backpack he went back into the den and sat in front of the computer clicking on the icon labeled allstrong he scanned through a few documentsmostly what appeared to be copies of or amendments to government contracts or work orders that the company had secured overseas there were also a significant number of email files and several résumés of people who had served in the military which attested to the kind of work nolan was probably doing over here stateside evan entered a few more of the documents and searched for the name khalil but came up empty lacking a password though he tried several obvious ones he couldnt get into nolans regular email file the icon named my pictures by contrast came right up immobilized by what he feared he might see theremore photos of nolan and tara in much more intimate settings than the deck of a boathe finally clicked on the first folder and finding not even one picture of tara sighed in relief these appeared to be shots nolan might have taken when he was shopping for a house here was a treelined street just like the one he lived on cars parked along the curb then different angles in different lights on another house large and grandiose in fact on closer inspection on the clearest picture from directly in front of the building the place was actually a pinkhued monstrosity what in the world evan wondered could nolan have seen in the place that would have prompted such a detailed study suddenly recognition straightened him upright in the paper that morning evan had seen a blackandwhite picture of the remains of mr khalils house which of course no longer looked very much like the residence in this picture but in the article hadnt he read something about the house being pink hurriedly he started pulling open the drawers to the desk there was a digital camera in the middle drawer and for a second he considered looking at what it contained but he couldnt take the time he checked his watchtwo fortyfive hed been in here too long already in the lower right drawer he found an open tenpack of floppy disks four remained in the box and with his hands shaking now he took one out inserted it into the adisk slot and copied the file from the my pictures photo onto the disk ejecting the disk he put it in his breast pocket then sat back took a breath and walked himself through turning the computer off the careful way through the start menu keenly listening for the sound of the garage door opening or of a car pulling up out in the street he forced himself to wait until the terminal screen went black then he got out of the chair and replaced it where he hoped and thought it had been he pushed all the desk drawers flush against their inserts checking one last time to make sure that he still had the disk in his pocket he walked back up through the living room locked the front door from the inside looked out through the window saw that it was safe and let himself out the last child had gone home two hours ago the sounds from the hallway were small and distant the occasional whirrings of the xerox machine way down in the office barely registered on taras consciousness as she looked out at the view from her classroom window shed always considered it a particularly fine view with the small grove of scrub oak hugging the hilltop just across the street she could imagine that the hilltop was far from anything mundane or suburbansay in tuscany where shed never been sometimes in the late afternoon like this with the springtime scents of lilac and jasmine coming up on the breeze mingling with the closer smells of pencil and chalk this classroom was her favorite place in the world she felt that she could count on her fingers the times when shed been the absolute happiest and most content and many of them had been right here some of the longtimers here at st charles had gotten perhaps a little cynical over the years but either tara hadnt been here long enough yet or she didnt have the genes for cynicism she wasnt that kind of a person she still loved her kids every year a new batch and every year with fresh challengesoh yes thank you challengesbut also with something new to learn to connect with to love new clay that was how she always thought of her classes when the year began new clay sitting back in her desk chair she daydreamed her face relaxed in contented repose an almost infinitesimal upturn to her lips it had been a day almost exactly like this one soft and scentedhad it been three years now she remembered that the whole day shed felt almost sick with herself since shed been so easy on the first date with this new guy evan too easy shed been too attracted and let him know it and wasnt really inclined to fight herself not against that kind of heat but what if it turned out to be that old cliché and he didnt respect her and never called again hell she was an intelligent woman with a fine career and knew that she would never build her world around some man but the thought of never again seeing this man shed met only one time just suddenly didnt seem bearable and she had gotten up from her desk sick at herself and went to smell the outdoor smells by the window which always helped when she was worried or depressed and she looked down and there evan was getting out of his car with a bouquet in his hand the happiest single moment of her life sighing she opened her eyes surprised at how quickly the contented daydream had retrieved enough emotion to nearly bring her to tears breathing deeply she dabbed at her eyes and pushed back from her desk thinking that oh well it was time to go home no need to dwell on the past it was still a beautiful day with the incredible floral perfume outside on the breeze she crossed over to the window to smell the day one last time and then she looked down in the street evan was getting out of his car no flowers but it was him nevertheless coming to see her at last tears welled again and her hand went to her mouth then after a moment she brought it down to rest over her heart hi hi i thought you might be here you were right its a beautiful afternoon my favorite time i remember a silence shed been standing when he got to the classroom door and now she boosted herself back onto her desk so how are you she finally asked you look good im okay i still get headaches but basically im mr lucky thats what ive heard im glad for you glad youre alive me too he moved a step closer to her are you all right you look like youve been crying she shook her head smiled with a false brightness allergies the downside of all these blooming flowers she sucked in a quick breath and let it out then tried another smile that died on the vine i tried to call you i know i was a shit i could say i was still recovering and dont remember anything about it but thatd be a lie im sorry she shrugged i was a shit too too inflexible too stupid okay he said were a couple of shits stupid shits she corrected him and finally a small smile took better he said he looked away over at the window to the oakstudded hillside coming back to her his jaw somehow had a harder line he drew a breath and blew it out sharply you still seeing ron nolan biting at her lower lip she nodded answered in a very small voice sometimes love him she shrugged shook her head shrugged again i dont know evan weve had some good times but i dont know loves a big word yes it is what are we going to do about it what do you mean we you and me we the usual meaning the fact that i love you oh god evan she shook her head from side to side dont say that why not its true well she slipped herself off the desk and walked over to the windows again stood still a moment then turned back to him please dont say that she repeated i dont know what to do with that you dont have to do anything although thats one of the reasons i came here to tell you that just so that if you were wondering youd know her gaze settled on his eyes okay she said softly okay now i know bringing her hand up to her forehead she pushed until her fingers went white then pulled her hand away were there other reasons other reasons for what for why you came here you said one reason was to tell me you loved me what was another one evans brow clouded overhe couldnt remember for an awful moment he thought he might have forever lost the real reason hed come to see tara today he hadnt come to tell her he loved her he hadnt been sure of that until he was with her but then theyd started talking and that had come out and now he was unable to retrieve the real purpose of his trip here im trying to remember he said can you give me a couple of seconds this was the first time she was seeing an effect of his injury and he was acutely aware that this moment might change everything forever between them he might in her eyes now be damaged challenged handicappedsomehow not as sharp as hed been not quite exactly the same person not quite her equal he couldnt let that happen closing his eyes concentrating he thought come on brain come on retrieve it then he opened his eyes as the answer found its way to his tongue the other reason i came here he said is i wanted to ask you a simple factual question at once she was all the way with him again her expression now relaxed she moved a few steps toward him her arms crossed over her chest i can do simple factual she said a smile played around her mouth okay do you remember when you first heard about me getting hurt her quizzical look stayed on him for a long moment as though she were surprised that he would have to ask that question at all sure she said i ran into your mom at the grocery store one night i think it was a few days before christmas i know it was a few days before i called you you mean called me at walter reed when i didnt talk to you right youre sure of that the time i mean just before christmas of course thats when it was when else would i have heard how about back when it happened say september no way evan how could i have known then he shrugged well when did you start seeing ron nolan what does ron have to do with that i would have thought hed have mentioned it thats all he never knew about it evan you guys all got transferred out of his base the week he got back evan canted his head a bit to one side studying her expression he read only sincerity openness perhaps a bit of confusion but one thing was clearshe was telling him the truth as she knew it we got transferred thats what ron said whered we get tranferred to tara did he tell you that no i dont think he knew right he didnt know you know why because we werent transferred we ran our last mission out of baghdad airport where wed been with ron all along you can look it up the germ of confusion spread like a plague over her features mouth tightened brow furrowed eyes darting seeking a place to land but the word hung in the room between them her arms hung down inanimate at her side i dont get this ron was with us in the convoy tara he was in my humvee he was next to me when i got hit no that cant be true why would i make it up tara im not saying youre making it up evan although i could see a reason why you might but i dont think youd do that i wouldnt im not making it up he said its what happened she held his gaze for a minute and then her voice barely audible grabbed at the next straw maybei mean im just thinking could it be with what happened to your headmaybe you dont remember it all exactly he noddedsober patient restrained thats a legitimate question i have forgotten some stuff i dont remember whole days and weeks from when i woke up but ron was with us in that convoy i remember everything about that if you still dont believe it you can look it all up on the web just google masbah he spelled the name of the neighborhood in baghdad its all there hes the reason it all went down and thats the reason he had to get out of iraq so fast they were starting the investigation and he knew it led straight to him the color had drained from her face her eyes flitted to the corners of the room as though she hoped to find some answer there she brushed a strand of hair from her forehead placing her hand flat on one of the students desktops for support she lowered herself into the connected chair he told me he had no idea youd been hurt she said that he found out about it from me after i ran into your mom that night and she told me christmastime she nodded definitely and he told you he knew nothing about it before nothing i swear evan no he swore hed never heard a thing about it he didnt have to hear about it tara evan said he was there he fired the first shots spinoza poured them both a cup of coffee and took evan out into the backyard so they wouldnt interrupt the movie leesa and their four young kids were watching in the family room the day with at least another half hour of light in it continued warm and fragrant the two men sat down at a picnic table under a vinecovered trellis so spinoza began did you get your dope dealer yet not yet he said hes out of town timings everything spinoza said i dont know evan replied timings important but id give points for location too a quarter inch either way and my storys different thats been pretty good nightmare material id imagine so then going back to his original subject spinoza said you know hes out of town evan shrugged his cars gone nobody answers the door dont do anything stupid ev the lieutenant said if you think theres really something to this guy send him to the narcs spinoza blew on his coffee and took a sip and in other news you know mr khalil who we talked about at lunchtime as of a couple of hours ago mr khalil is officially a jointjurisdiction case you remember the frag grenade issue we talked about well the feds have conclusively determined that thats what blew up the room and started the fire so theyre in the case in spite of the fact that it also looks like mr khalil and his wife were first shot in the head with a nine millimeter bullet evans face must have betrayed something spinoza abruptly put his coffee cup down on the table what nothing evan said evan left spinozas home in great frustration hed plannedhopedsomehow to get the picture from nolans computer in front of spinoza but there was no way he could tell his lieutenant how hed gotten itthat hed broken into someones homeand that rendered hopeless his entire illconceived plan but cruising down to the khalils ruined house evan had satisfied himself that the house in the picture was in fact theirs then decided that the thing to do would be simply to send the disk to the fbi the bureau would have nolan in their database and know all about his history the advantage to his new idea was that both the atf and the fbi were known to play fast and loose with due process and probable cause if they came to think that nolan had killed the khalils especially if there was an iraqi or terrorist connection they would find a way to question him and perhaps even get inside his house where they would discover the grenades the other pictures the guns in any event after they got the disk nolan would be on their radar after that it would only be a matter of time before they could take him down now night had fallen in his kitchen evans head throbbed and again the pinpricks of bright light at the edges of his vision presaged the onset of a migraine hed already taken a couple of vicodin and as soon as he finished the last of his business he had to get to bed if he was going to work tomorrow wearing blue latex gloves he pulled the selfadhesive manila envelope over closer to him it had taken a while lefthanded to write down both nolans address on a piece of notepaper and the fbis address on the envelope but now he was satisfiedthe writing was legible yet unidentifiable as his own he slid the slip of paper with nolans address into the envelope along with the disk then pulled the paper strip from the adhesive and closed the top he peeled off ten selfadhesive stamps from the roll hed bought and stuck them on tomorrow he would stop off in another neighborhood and drop the envelope into a mailbox now he set the thing on his table and gave it a quick onceover satisfied that it couldnt be traced back to him he walked back through his apartment to his bedroom turning off the lights as he went lying down on the bed his clothes still on he pulled a blanket up over his shoulders turned on his side and closed his eyes a little while after it was truly dark tara called evans mother eileen and got his address she waited and thought and secondguessed herself and eventually left her place sometime after eleven oclock and drove parking out in the dark street across from his apartment she sat for another five minutes or so with her car windows down her hands in a prayerful attitude in front of her mouth by the time she got to the door she barely heard her own timid knocking over the beating of her heart after a minute she knocked again harder and waited a light came on inside and hearing his footsteps she held her breath the door opened hed been sleeping in his clothes his hair was tousled his eyes still with that sleepy look she remembered so well she looked up at him realizing that she loved having to look up had missed that loving the size of him so different from looking across at ron nolan everything was so different and so much better with evan how could she have forgotten that she couldnt get her face to go into a smile she was too afraid the blood now pulsing in her ears her hands unsteady at her sides he just looked at her is it too late she asked tonight i mean no i needed to talk to you some more would that be all right everythings all right tara you can do whatever you want you want to come in stepping back away from the door he gave her room to pass and then closed the door quietly behind her as she kept walking through his living room stopping by the counter that delineated the kitchen and turning back to face him her shoulders rose and fell from over by the door he said i cant guarantee talking too well ive been having some trouble sleeping so im a little doped up plus ive had a couple of drinks im drinking too much i need to stop are you in such pain he managed a small shrug sometimes but thats not it really he took a second to continue i know that whatever they say im not all the way back maybe ill never be to tell you the truth it freaks me out sometimes when im alone mostly but i dont want to have anybody feel like they have to be with me all the time either your mom for one example yeah anybody really but itshe shrugged againits just what im doing now tara holding on getting better i hope getting over what happened evan still stood by the door making no effort to close the space between them she felt the distance tugging at her causing a pain of its own and took a step toward him then another but thats all just me evan said what did you want to talk about ron i neveri wanted to tell you that it was never like it was with us it was just a completely different thing was past tense she let out a heavy breath yes after what you told me today okay and how was it with us that was so different tara put her hands together at her waist she deserved that question and he deserved the real answer because we connected evan so basically he nodded i know i dont think that ever goes away no me neither she looked across the living room into his eyes why are you staying over there its almost like youre afraid of me i am as much as i need to be how much is that that depends on how much being done with ron means youre back with me she waited another few seconds and then closed the space between them looking up at him again now the smell of him so close does it hurt you to touch the scar she asked its just a scar but he inclined his head so that she could see it almost a perfect circle slightly indented slowly she reached out her hand and brought it up to his head as soon as she touched it she felt something give in her legs as she traced the shape of the scar tears sprang into her eyes and she made no effort to stop them evan brought his head down leaning into her bringing her other hand up into his hair she cradled his head in both her hands holding on to her his arms behind her he went to his knees in front of her his face first pressed to one side against her thigh but then her hands on his head now directing him she turned him to be up against her his hands gripping her from behind pulling her into him while she pressed herself against him she pulled him gently away for an instant only long enough to let her step out of her clothes and then brought him back to where hed been beyond any time then she was on the floor with her legs around his neck until the surge of blood and heat shed only known with him took her and then there was the taste of her on his mouth and his own cry as everything between them came back and came again and left them both flung out on the floor wasted and sated and connected in every part the relevant portion of the email from jack allstrong that had put nolan on the road had read when the cpa hands over the government to the iraqis uncle sam is going to be shipping over billionthats right billionin shrinkwrapped s thats twentyeight tons of greenbacks ron almost all of it earmarked for infrastructure and rebuilding which means us my standing directive to you is to recruit as many qualified personnel as you can find starting now now nolan was just getting back home from a productive couple of days frequenting the bars around some of californias military basespendleton ord travished recruited four men for allstrongs ongoing and growing operations in iraq though allstrongs security work was dangerous and demanding exofficers who were bored or broke or both in civilian life often jumped at the chance to resurrect their careers their selfesteem and their bank accounts and to once again utilize the special skills that had served them well in the military and nowhere were they needed more than in anbar as jack allstrong had predicted in august the rebuilding of the electrical tower infrastructure in that province was turning out to be a gold mine for the company albeit a costly one in terms of human life allstrong had by now put more than five hundred men to work on this latest contract which initially bid out at forty million dollars although it had grown to more than one hundred million in the past seven months allstrong security jack liked to point out was in the fastestgrowing company in the world outstripping google compliments of us largesse and jacks ability to surf the chaos of the reconstruction but in anbar the company also had already lost thirtysix of kuvan krekars men and kuvans supply chain of bodies was growing thin and dispirited beyond that kuvan had been facing severe competition from another broker named mahmoud alkhalil who was not only supplying cheaper workers but was perhaps terrorizing and even killing kuvans people to discourage others from signing on why so that mahmoud and not kuvan could pocket the extremely lucrative cash commissions well with the recent untimely demise of his paterfamilias in menlo park mahmoud would hopefully soon conclude that competing directly with allstrongs chosen subcontractor was not a sound business decision hefting his duffel bag nolan let himself into his townhome through the garage door to the kitchen he walked through the living room stopped in his office and turned on his computer then went into his bedroom where he dropped the duffel bag on his bed then returned to his desk and checked his email andfirst things firstmade sure hed been paid he had with that taken care of nolan went back into his bedroom and started to unpack grabbing a pair of pants he turned and opened the closet and stopped short something was not right nolan didnt spend much time thinking about his militaryingrained penchant for order but when he woke up in the mornings he automatically made his bed with hospital corners so that the covers were tight enough to bounce a coin off them the spare shoes were always shined and perfectly aligned on the floor of the closet he hung his shirts and pants in order from light to dark the hangers spaced with an automatic and practiced precision now he stared at the row of hangers he didnt specifically remember taking down the shirts and pants that hed packed for his trip but could not imagine that he would have taken down his clothes and left the hangers spaced unevenly as they were now his eyes went to the backpack on the top shelf he had lined it up exactly with the break in the hangers between his shirts and his pants and now it was clearly centered over the shirts reaching up he pulled it toward him relieved by the familiar weight he opened it and saw that nothingnot the grenades the gun or the ammowas gone which was weird maybe hed imagined that the hangers had been moved it didnt seem possible that someone would have broken in here and not taken the grenades and the gun but it wouldnt be smart to take chances reaching into the backpack he removed the beretta and slammed one of the clips into place then racked a bullet into the chamber he dropped the backpack next to the duffel bag on his bed and went to check the bathroom where an intruder might still be lurking finding no one there he went back out into the living room to the front door where the piece of scotch tape that hed laid over the connection between the door and its jamb was now stuck under the jamb somebody had definitely been here methodically now he went back out to the garage where he patted down the empty backpacks hanging against the wall he was about to start opening the drawers when he straightened up stopping himself he didnt see how it could be remotely possible but it occurred to him that if one of the members of khalils extended family could have somehow traced the patriarchs execution back to him their method of retribution might include a bombopen a drawer and it goes off by the same token his experience with ieds in iraq told him that if there was a bomb someone would have been hiding somewhere outside seen him drive up and sent an electrical pulse to detonate the device after he was inside alternatively nolan could trigger the bomb himself by switching on any one of a dozen electrical connections in the house but any of those scenarios contemplated the possibility that someone had identified him as the khalils killer which from nolans perspective was flatly not possible hed made no mistakes therefore there was no bomb hed also already turned on his computer and several lights walking back out to the garage this time he opened all the drawers back in the kitchen he did the same opened the refrigerator he had no idea what if anything he was looking for but someone had been in his house in his absence and if it hadnt been to take something what did that leave he just didnt know back in his office he sat at his desk laid the gun on it and stared for a minute again at his computer picking up his telephone he got the pulsing dial tone that meant he had messages and entered his password the first message was from an obviously very distraught though composed tara who had called him on monday night ron evan scholler came by to visit me today at the school we had a long talk with one another and he told me some things that shocked meyou probably have a good idea what they were i dont know what to say to you other than that i just want you to know how completely violated i feel and how used i dont know how you could have lied to me so much im leaving this message on your machine on purpose because i dont want to talk to you or even see you anymore i cant believe youve done this it just doesnt seem possible that anyone could be so cruel and so selfish im so sorry for who you are ron but not for what im saying goodbye dont call me dont come by just stay away i mean it the phone still at his ear he hadnt let up his grip yet on the receiver when the next message began the call had come this morning about six hours ago mr nolan my name is jacob freed im a special agent with the federal bureau of investigation and i wondered if we might be able to take a few minutes of your time to talk to you about a routine matter involving national security thats come to our attention i dont mean to be unnecessarily vague but im sure you understand that these days some things are best left unsaid over the telephone if you could call me for an appointment at your earliest convenience when you get in or alternatively ill try to get back to you in the next day or two my number is when nolan finally hung up he sat unmoving with his right arm outstretched and his hand covering the beretta after a minute or two he let go of the gun and moved his hand over to the mouse as soon as he saw the my pictures icon he realized that hed made an error by not erasing that file before hed gone away opening it now intending to close the barn door after the horse had escaped he checked the access record and saw that someone had indeed looked at the file two days beforethe same monday that tara had spoken to evan scholler though it might be too late he still thought it would be better to delete the file now so that if the fbi came and looked except he knew that there wasnt really any such thing anymore as truly deleting something experts could always retrieve whatever it was from the hard disk still his finger hovered over the mouse as he stared at one of the many pictures hed taken of mr khalils house while he was working on access and egress one click and all of that would at least be gone for now sitting back his eyes narrowing he took his hand abruptly off the mouse suddenly he decided that he did not want to delete the picture file after all although he would have to remove the memory chip from the digital camera in the desk drawer and get rid of it tapping his index fingernail against his front teeth he sat as if in a trance for a full minute and then another one the idea looked perfect from every angle he reached again for the telephone agent freed please this is he agent freed my name is ron nolan you left me a message about a national security matter and asked me to call for an appointment yes sir i did thanks for getting back to me i think maybe i should be the one thanking you sir ive just returned from a business trip while ive been gone somebody let themselves into my house i was going to call the regular police but then i got your message i dont know if you know it but i do some sensitive work with allstrong security a government contractor in iraq and i thought what you wanted to talk about might have something to do with that well as i mentioned perhaps it would be better to meet in person to talk about the issue thats come up with us although if youre reporting a robbery or burglary you should probably call the regular police thats not really our jurisdiction agent freed this wasnt a robbery whoever it was didnt take anything they left something plus they messed with my computer i dont know what its all about but its almost like somebodys trying to plant something on me like what well i just found one thing but there might be more im afraid to look in case hes planted a bomb someplace whos he i dont know i mean the person who broke in okay so whats the one thing this is whats so weird its a backpack full of ammunition and youre not going to believe this it looks like about a half dozen hand grenades hand grenades yes sir as you may know ive been over to iraq several times i know the ordnance and these look like fragmentation grenades to me freed and his partner a middleaged fireplug named marcia riggio sat with nolan on the small oakshaded back patio inside the townhouse a threeman team of forensics specialists having already confiscated the backpack with its contents were fingerprinting every clean surface and cataloging anything that might be of interestnolans other gun from the beds headboard the digital camera in the desk drawer downloading his hard disk nolan didnt want to rush anything with these federal cops he didnt want to appear to point them in any specific direction but now as agent riggio looked up from her notepad nolan decided that it was getting to be the time let me ask you something he said is there any scenario you can think of that makes any sense of this to you the two agents exchanged a glance riggio got the nod from freed and took point do you have any enemies she asked nolan frowned even if i did he said what does this do to hurt me unless i pulled the pin on one of those grenades which anybody who knows me knows im not going to do maybe its not about hurting you riggio went on maybe its about framing you for what but freed stepped in before we get to that he said lets go back to your enemies this time nolan broke a grin i dont see it really i like people i really do and they tend to like me my boss thinks its a flaw in my character he shrugged so id have to say no no enemies okay riggio said how about rivals in business business pleasure whatever he took his sweet time savoring the anticipation the only even remotely he shook his head no never mind freed jumped on it what nothing really just a guy i knew in iraq who used to date my girlfriend but that was a long time ago if hes in iraq freed said hes out of this well hes home now here and hes not over her your girlfriend riggio asked i dont know he had a hard time with it at first but now i havent seen the guy in months but look this is a dead end hes a good guy in fact hes a cop hed never freed interrupted hes a cop yeah here in redwood city his names evan scholler he got hurt over there and they let him out early so he would have had access to these types of grenades over there yeah but he wouldnt have taken any home he did a few months at walter reed before he came out here soldiers have been known to send illegal ordnance and contraband stateside as souvenirs on the slow boat riggio said its a problem it happens all the time well i dont know what evan would havei mean whats the point of putting hand grenades in my closet im not going to blow myself up with them its not like theyre going to get rid of me as his rival riggio and freed again shared a glance and again exchanged the imperceptible nod riggio came forward elbows on her knees do you know a man named ibrahim khalil no nolan said should i he was a local businessman with ties to iraq he and his wife were killed last weekend well im sorry to hear that but ive been out of town i havent heard about it would evan scholler have known you were gone nolan shrugged if he knew where i lived he could have just checked to see if my car was in the garage if it is im home has he ever to your knowledge been up here riggio asked no as i say were not exactly pals anymore as though it had just occurred to him nolan added but hes a cop he could find out where i live easy enough couldnt he thats what it looks like hes done freed picked it up so sunday morning early you were with this same girlfriend that this evan scholler likes tara nolan said tara wheatley and yes shes the one so whats this all about those pictures you couldnt identify on your computer riggio said they were pictures of mr khalils house before somebody killed them and hit it with a fragmentation grenade and before it burned down a frag grenade nolan didnt want to overplay his apparent naïveté both freed and riggio knew that he had seen combat and they might even know more than that this was about the moment in the interview that against his own deepseated reluctance to believe ill of a fellow soldier he might finally come to accept the apparent truth so he nodded somberly and met both of their gazes in turn hes trying to set me up christ he killed them didnt he the early evening sun baked the parking lot and the landing outside tara s apartment she could feel its warmth in her hand through the closed and locked front door as she stood behind it i told you i wont see you i dont want to talk to you i need to talk to you though t please i need to explain theres nothing you can say to me nothing id believe i cant believe youd even come by here and try this you lied to me ron youve been living a lie for all these months no ive been living the truth and the truth is that i love you you dont lie to someone you love youre right that was a mistake i shouldnt have done that i am so sorry sorrys not enough i dont want to talk about this i need you to go away now i cant t i cant leave it like this could you please open up just so i could see you when she didnt answer he went on talking at the door listen i knew you were confused about evan especially the timing about how we started i thought that if you heard hed been woundedthat youd feel sorry for him or like you owed him another chanceand that whatever happened somehow id lose you and now thats whats happened i cant accept that tara i didnt think he was going to live i didnt think it would matter thats not the question ron you lied to me everything we did was false dont you understand that if you couldnt stand to have evan in the picture on any level even if he was dying how were weyou and meever going to amount to anything anyway we did amount to something no we didnt thats the worst part we supposedly trusted each other now that cant ever happen again dont you see that because of one mistake you really dont see it do you i see somebody who was terrified he was going to lose the woman he loved who wanted to make sure they had some time together without the distraction of a wounded exboyfriend who might never be coming home alive anyway thats all you thought evan was to me a distraction the chain lock rattled and the door opened the couple of inches that the chain allowed im not going to yell at you through the door anymore i just need you to go youre actually scaring me now all right how can i be scaring you t im here begging you just to listen to me to give me another chance he shifted his weight is it because of him do i still love him you mean i dont know about that i lost track of who he was and now i dont know what i feel but i know youre scaring me now and why because you lied and lied and lied i lied once t once to try to protect what we were starting to have thats all no it isnt ron what about masbah what about it you firing on that innocent family i googled you and read all about it you started that whole thing ron hung his head wiped his brow against the glaring heat i was trying to protect the convoy i thought the car was on a suicide mission you had to have been there but i cant apologize for what i did the report said theyd stopped way back you cant believe everything you read it was a damn close call and if i waited another two seconds we all could have been dead most of you died anyway how about that not my fault the point is that if i fired too soon and im not saying i did it was on the side of caution ron you killed an entire innocent family doesnt that bother you at all it bothers me a lot t it makes me sick to think about it but i cant say given the circumstances that i wouldnt do the same thing again it was a splitsecond lifeordeath decision and i decided i had to try to save my men thats not what evan says ron and he was there too i guess he doesnt mention the part about me pulling him out of the line of fire and getting him out of there alive so now youre the hero im not saying that im saying evans memory maybe isnt the most reliable thing in the universe right now im also saying that hes got a reason to make me look bad he didnt make you lie how many times do i have to apologize for that however many it takes ill do it and what about the other lies what other lies there were no other lies how about me ripping up that last letter that you delivered to me you didnt rip it up right but you told evan i did no i didnt did he tell you that yes then hes lying i dont believe that ron and what about when you visited him at walter reed when you told him i said hed made his own bed and he could sleep in it nolan looked down and shook his head what she asked him thats not true either t why would i say that i went to see him to see how he was doing if he was going to be all right thats all hes the one who didnt want to hear anything about you thats not what he told me no i guess not and why do you think would that be through the crack in the opening he saw her close her eyes lean her head up against the wall next to the door he was wearing her down getting to her do you want to hear something else he asked something truly scary especially if you think your friend evan is so innocent and so nice you want to hear what he left in my house after he broke into it last weekend after tara watched nolan finally drive away she went into her living room sat down and put her feet up on the coffee table templing her fingers over her lips she closed her eyes and tried to get herself to breathe deeply a whirlwind of conflicting possibilities and emotions was literally causing her body to shake ron nolan had maintained a sustained falsehood but did that mean that every word out of his mouth was a lie she hadnt expected him to show up here or to own up to the lies upon which hed based their relationship perhaps the truth was that he loved her and had made a mistake a terrible mistake yes and one he sincerely regretted just like killing the iraqi family what was the truth in that story had he been justified shooting when he did and in fact had he pulled evan to safety and saved his life theyd been outnumbered and surrounded if there had been a bomb in the car none of them would have survived might she have made the same decision to fire under the same circumstances it struck her forcefully that maybe it was she who was being unfair ron nolan had always treated her well better than well hed literally saved her life that time in san francisco and surely his appearance today to beg her forgivenesseven while admitting hed done the unforgivablespoke to a depth of character shed never given him credit for people grew people changed people learned from their mistakes and if what ron had told her about evan were true he might himself be in danger no she could not believe that that was more of rons poison trying to get inside her after seeing evan in her classroom and then the intimacy last night she knew what she feltnot just the stillpowerful physical bond but a connection that went down to the bottom of her soul it was irrational chemical fundamental and she knew that she would never feel it with anyone else but now according to ron evan had lied to her too a known liar accusing another of lying it was like game theory where a always told the truth and b always lied but you didnt know which was the truthteller and which the liar who did you believe could evan have made up the story about ron saying shed ripped up his letter or the walter reed moment evan admitted that his memory had been faulty especially early on could he have lied to her and not even known he was lying finally could evan have broken into rons house and tried to frame him for a murder a murder that he himself had committed tara could not believe any part of that she knew who evan was even after all this time and all of their problems she knew his heart he was not a liar he was not a murderer and this meant that ron nolan was lying to her again and lying to the fbi and possibly to the local police liars deal in lies suddenly she opened her eyes and sat up she needed to get to evan she needed to warn him though it wasnt really a hangout for cops the old town traven wasnt far from the police station downtown and it served a decenttasting though nutritionally suspect happyhour spread of chicken wings peanuts in the shell tiny meatballs in gravy and popcorn even though happy hour had officially ended more than two hours before there was still plenty of food available the traven didnt exactly pack em in and now evan whod changed out of his uniform at the station and his bowling partner stan paganini also in street clothes held down one end of the bar all by themselves between his lowwatt nervousness over the envelope hed mailed to the fbi and his need to keep himself occupied so that he wouldnt do something stupid and try to get in touch with tara until shed dumped nolan if she actually was going to dump him after all evan felt that a drink or ten wouldnt be amiss pass the difficult night in a haze and see what tomorrow brings now it was half past nine and he and paganini were on to the name of the place due either to the marginal intelligence of its owners a drunken mistake a simple typo or all of the above the neon sign above the door read old town traven the places business cards also had tavern spelled incorrectly so evan decided it was probably that the proprietors just werent too bright and certainly had not been the san mateo county spelling bee champions as he had been when hed been in eighth grade no you werent paganini stabbed the last meatball on his plate with a toothpick and washed it down with a good swig of his gin and tonic was too i won on hygiene which is almost unfair its such an easy word wait dont tell me paganini took in a little more of his drink h y he began good so far g he paused glanced at evan i before e evan tipped his vodka rocks all the way up except after c dont tell me i just did or when sounded like a as in neighbor or weigh okay trying the old headfake double reverse i get it but im on to you boy so here goes again h y g e buzz youre out evan shook his head i just told you i before e stan i told you the whole damn poem you think i was making that up i thought you were trying to trick me and then g is close to c soundwise so it was the exception nope its the rule evan spelled the word out that doesnt sound right im going to look it up at home you want to bet no i dont want to bet but youre right thats a pretty simple word to win the whole county spelling bee on well harder than tavern anyway and they got that one wrong here twice three times who knows maybe more they might have it on the matchbooks yeah well paganini shifted his bulk and cried out hey what sat on something paganini slid himself off his stool and was digging in his pants pockets plopping down a large set of keys in the bars gutter he reached in again and produced a heavy item that he plunked onto the bar knucks he said at one of their bowling league nights the cops had gotten into a discussion about various common enhancements to a mans natural defensive arsenal brass knuckles had featured large in paganinis experience and evan said hed never actually encountered them now he picked up the hunk of fitted metal heavy sucker get hit with it youre clocked paganini said although who fights with their fists anymore huh nowadays you know youre going to be in a fight you pack heat am i right maybe you dont want to kill who youre fighting paganini chuckled yeah like that happens anymore go ahead put em on keep em if you want i collect the ones i get off perps i got a half dozen like these at home as evan was pocketing the brass knuckles the bartender a midthirties slacker with a wispy effort at a beard suddenly appeared in front of them paganini looked down at his glass we empty again seem to be evan said lets double us up here would you jeff jeff looked from one of them to the other you guys walking home from here you pull a dui they can come back and get us were not going to get any dui paganini said he reached around into the back of his pants and pulled out his wallet opened it to the badge pour us a couple more would you please and i wont report the obvious health violation keeping those meatballs out so long awesome meatballs by the way remind me of my moms he cocked his head over toward evan i believe the gentleman requested a couple of doubles jeff took a beat nodded and then turned to get fresh glasses and ice evan lowered his voice leaned into stan am i slurring nope youre as eloquent as cicero how about me how about you what am i slurring no you keeping track of where we are the traven paganini replied drinkwise stan drinkwise i know where we physically are four i think maybe couple of doubles is six and weve been herehe checked his watchthree hours so i figure were blowing point oh five six max which means were totally cool to drive and will be for the foreseeable future but evanall too familiar with the average cops rationalization genius when drinkingwas doing his own math he was fairly certain theyd had more than four drinks already maybe as many as six or seven and if they had a couple of doubles on top of that two doubles each that would take him up to eleven generous pours he was just about to say that maybe hed better stick with singles to give them a better chance to metabolize off when the bars door opened glancing up at the mirror behind the bar he put a hand on paganinis arm and without a word stood up and turned around your mom said this was where she might look for you from their table in the back where they couldnt be heard by anyone else tara looked around the seedy bar nice place you come here often sometimes nights get long and i go crazy at home some nights i bowl or read or something two days ago i was at mom and dads ive got a life of course you do i didnt mean that yeah you do he sat back and folded his arms you disapprove of me being here he looked at her flat affect you come down here to bust my chops no she said no i dont mean to do that i came down here towell just to talk to you again jeff showed up with two drinks and put them down at their table and for the lady maybe ill just have one of his and some cranberry juice when jeff left tara pulled her chair up reached out across the table and touched evans hand im really not here to criticize you evan its just that the other night you said youd been drinking too much and were trying to slow down a little yeah well i guess im not succeeding tonight whats that look you dont think a couple of drinks is a good idea i didnt say that if you need it you need it she pulled his hand from his glass and covered it with hers look she whispered i dont know even any small part of what youve been through youre the one who said it would be better if you didnt need so much alcohol that would be better i agree defiantly he picked up his glass and took a long drink but that doesnt seem to be what im doing right now which is trying to keep things together what things my job for one what happened with my guys in iraq why im still alive anger guilt you name it he brought his eyes up unfocused heavylidded and all those are before we even get to you jeff showed up with taras cranberry juice placed it on the table in front of her turned and left a silence settled evan again lifted his glass then put it back down you want to tell me about you and ron there isnt any me and ron not anymore how can you even ask that after she swallowed i called him after i saw you at school on monday its over sighing she went on but then this afternoon he came by didnt take the hint huh how did that go i never let him in he told me he never said id ripped up your letter evan took that in with a solemn nod the guys a congenital liar evan look at me her eyes bored into his youre swearing to me that he said that you didnt make that up to make him look bad i know its awful of me to ask but ive got to ask you straight out ive got to know for absolute certain evan covered taras hand with both of his i swear to god he said i swear on the memory of the lives of my men i have never lied to you tara let out a long shuddering breath as though something that had been squeezing her had suddenly let go he also denied what he told you i said in the hospital about making your own bed and you could lie in it evan shook his head almost in admiration old ron was on a roll lifting his glass he finished his drink reached across and took the second one from in front of tara he said it all right he said something else today too i cant wait to hear it what did i kill somebody now but tara had straightened up god evan why do you say that what that youd killed somebody i didnt i was kidding what she started to talk and stopped herself then started again ron told me you broke into his house last weekend and left stuff that youd somehow smuggled out of iraq to make it look like ron had killed this man and his wife when in fact it was you whod killed them evans shoulders sagged he slumped in his chair he lifted his drink and put himself on the outside of it in one gulp evan that fucker that motherfucker she went on he said youd brought over hand grenades and guns to his place that youd smuggled out of iraq and planted incriminating pictures on his computer evans body molded itself back into his hard chair he spoke slowly with great caution lest his thick tongue betray him this guy who got killed khalil he was iraqi think about it think about rons real job over here what do you mean rons a recruiter mostly hes no listen hes a mercenary mostly those were his weapons his grenades his pictures tara sat back and crossed her arms you mean you do know about this how could you know about this or about ron he just looked at her opened his mouth closed it again she came forward now are you telling me he wasnt lying about you breaking into his house did you do that evan tell me you didnt do that no i evan shook his head hard trying to clear away the fog of alcohol i mean okay i went in you broke into rons house and did what nothing i didnt do anything no he said thats not true i got on his computer and got pictures of this guys house before it burned down why did you do that cause rons a murderer tara he killed this guy and this was the evidence so what did you do with it mailed it to somebody the fbi you mean she hit the table with her palm did you send your diskette to the fbi evan because ron had the fbi over at his house today and he told them youd planted all that stuff there and now you tell me you were actually inside so theyll find your hair or fingerprints or something dont you see that hes trying to have you framed for this she ran both of her hands through her hair over her scalp down to her neck god god god how can this be happening they may be at your apartment right now wanting to talk to you do you realize that and then what are you going to do what are you going to tell them he stared blankly at her for a long minute then brought his hand up and chewed at the knuckle of his index finger enough of this shit his words starting to slur evan she gripped at his hands hes already got the fbi in on it dont you understand its already happening cant be ive got to stop him no dont you do anything get a lawyer or talk to one of your bosses maybe they can deliver a message get something through to ron but you stay out of it personally rons dangerous evan and hes out to get you youve got to be smart get sober and get a plan evan slammed a heavy hand on the table what do you mean get sober is that what everythings about whether im sober or not im sober right now enough for fucking ron nolan evan she pleaded youre not listen to yourself you dont swear when youre sober you dont slur when youre sober she stood up reached out and touched his arm look why dont you come home now with me i could drive us and then what evans thick voice trembled with rage and then the fbi finds me there or at work tomorrow what do i do then come home with me we can talk about it and work something out she let her arm fall along his sleeve and took his hand come on really no he pulled his hand from hers turned away his shoulders rose and fell and then he turned back to her i am not fucking dealing with him anymore this has got to end it cant go on youre right but it cant end tonight evan yes it damn well can tara kept her voice low conciliatory restrained evan come on theres no way you can do anything the way you are now so dont be crazy youre just really mad way more than that tara im going to kill the son of a bitch shh shh shh she moved up and put her fingers to his lips dont talk like that thats just crazy drink talk lets just the two of us get out of here and hey taking her hand down roughly away from his mouth listen to me low and deadly earnest its got to stop it cant go on its not about fucking drinking are you hearing me its about honor who i am what hes done to us dont you see that yes i do see that youre right youre completely right but this isnt the time to fix all that she moved in close and stood straight before him arms at her side please evan im going to ask you one more time please come home with me whatever it is well work it out together i promise but the glaze in his eyes was all that answered her standing weaving slightly he gripped the back of his chair enoughs enough he said she looked him in the face one last time im begging you she said please if he heard her at all he didnt show it he stared blankly ahead at her shaking his head shaking his head then he started walking toward the door evan please she called after him wait he stopped and for a second she thought that shed convinced him he turned back to her leave me alone he said i know what ive got to do and im gonna do it and then he turned and again started walking unsteadily toward the door part three tarahad never felt so grateful for her job it was getting to the end of the year and her kids were handing in their big reports and concluding their projects on the ancient world in preparation for the schools open house on friday night when all the work would be displayed in the classrooms in taras room they had rearranged all the desks to make room for the papier mâché pyramids the dioramas of the growing cycle along the nile the plumbing schemes for the residences of the pharaohs hieroglyphics the early domestic cat the library at alexandria moses and the exodus so all day and much of the nights of thursday and friday tara was busy organizing and tending to lastminute crises among her students and often their families she had no time to contact evan to find out what if anything had happened after hed stormed out on her on wednesday night and truth to tell she wasnt too inclined to call him anyway she thought she would let him take a few days to sober up and get over his embarrassment about how hed acted then after hed called her and apologized theyd see where they were but in the meanwhile she had her job and her kids she thought that a couple of days respite from the emotional turmoil and upheaval surrounding ron and evan might do everybody involved a world of good saturday she slept in until nearly ten oclock then went down to the pool and swam a hundred laps coming back upstairs to her apartment she showered and threw on some shorts and a tshirt made a salad for lunch and after that dozed off watching a tennis match on tv when she woke up she graded the last of the written reports for another hour or so at a little after four she was just finishing up the last one when her doorbell rang checking the peephole she saw eileen scholler her face blotched from crying limping scabbed and bruised in his orange jail jumpsuit evan entered his side of the visiting room chained to twenty other men watching the line enter tara stood among a loose knot of mostly women in a kind of bullpen waiting area on their side of the plexiglas screen that separated the visitors from the inmates a row of facing pairs of talking stations bisected the room from one end to the other tara had to fight to hold back her tears as they unfastened evan from the chain of men to whom hed been attached he saw her and started to raise a welcoming hand but his wrists were still attached to the chain around his waist the guard directed him to one of the desks and tara excused herself through the nowpressing crowd of visitors and sat herself at last facing him there was a hole in the plexiglas through which they were supposed to talk it was wednesday his fourth day in custody and the first day that his injuries had healed enough to allow him to walk unaided and to see visitors in the first moment neither could find anything to say they looked at each other then away and back again how could either of them be here how could it have come to this finally evan leaned forward shrugged manufactured some kind of brave face i guess i should have gone home with you after all tara didnt trust herself to say anything i am so sorry he said tara opened her mouth but again no words came now unexpectedly tears began to overflow onto her cheeks she didnt try to stop them oh babe he said then i dont think he shook his head and looked at her his shoulders rose and fell i dont believe i killed him tara was still reeling from the bare fact that ron nolan was dead putting evan together with that on any level wasnt yet possible for her the idea couldnt bear any scrutiny instead she found herself fighting a sense of unreality that permeated her waking hours as though she were living within a bad dream from which she couldnt will herself awake i wouldnt have killed him he said then waited for her until he couldnt take it any longer can you say something please what am i supposed to say what do you want me to say im here that says something doesnt it i hope it does i hope so too but im not sure are you hurt ill be all right will you when will that be what does that mean he just looked at her ten weeks passed before they saw each other again in that time evan was charged with the murder of ron nolan but no charges were brought against him for the khalil slayingsthe district attorney doug falbrock decided that the evidence tying evan to those murders wasnt strong enough to convict as almost always in a murder case bail was denied tara had cleaned up her classroom and then hung around her apartment for the first couple of weeks of summer on the fourth of july she went up to her parents condominium to spend the holiday near homewood on lake tahoe and decided on more or less the spur of the moment that she wasnt going to go back home she couldnt bear reading about evan every day in the newspapers down there she needed to be away from the whole thingthe requests for interviews with reporters her proximity to the jail the expectations andor accusations of people who didnt know her she wound up staying alone at homewood until late augustreading running at altitude dead sober swimming in the cold lake finally it was time to come and get her classroom ready for the new year she drove down on a thursday morning cleaned up the dust that had gathered in her apartment stopped by the school and started in again on the familiar yearly routine and somewhere in the middle of it she realized that shed come to her decision finishing for the day at a little after three oclock she drove directly to the house evan had grown up in parked out front in the street and knocked at the door eileen greeted her as she always dideffusively sincerelywith a welcoming smile a hug a kiss on both cheeks they went together into the airy modern kitchen and made catchup small talk until eileen had poured them both iced teas and they were sitting across from each other at the table in the nook that looked out at the eden that was the schollers backyard at last eileen cocked her head in her trademark fashion so what brings you around today i wanted to ask you if you think evan would want to see me again i think hed want that more than anything i wasnt too good the one time you know did he tell you about that he didnt give me too many details he said it wasnt very easy between you two but he didnt blame you nobody blames youi mean we dontyou know that dont you tara nodded i just didnt know where to put any of it everything happened so fast finding out about all the lies ron told me and then thinking evan and i we might get another chance then that last night in the barwhere i thought she stopped swallowed shrugged eileen reached over and patted her hand its all right if it means anything and i think it does evan has no memory of what happened over there he doesnt believe he killed ron he says thats just not who he is he never would have done that i believe him so do i but somebody did maybe somebody connected to these khalils thats what everett says he believes everett everett washburn his lawyer a rueful smile his expensive lawyer she waved away the comment but thats all right weve got enough savings thank god i cant think of anything better to spend it on tara hesitated then came out with it they want me to testify about that last night against him everett said they would i think itll be all right if you just tell the truth the truth wasnt too pretty eileen no i understand but you cant do anything about that tara twirled the iced tea in its little ring of condensation i could marry him she said sitting back and straightening in her chair eileen drew in a big breath and let it out welland here ive been thinking these old bones would never be surprised by anything again but i dont think youll have to take it that far not just to keep from testifying eileen ive had all summer to think about how i feel about all this stuff and over the weeks its just gotten clearer and clearer whatever happens im on evans side if he still wants me if hell see me again eileen patted tara s hand oh i wouldnt worry about that at all dear not in the least little bit im going down there to visit him in the next fifteen minutes if youd like to come along when evan saw tara standing next to his mother on the other side of the room he turned his face upward and closed his eyes his body seemed to heave in relief tara came to the windoweileen waiting in the backand sat down across from him hi she said hi you look a lot better than last time i feel a lot better too how have you been good gone im sorry its been so long he shrugged i was trying to figure things out she said any luck pretty much i finally got so i could see what ought to have been obvious all along which is what that if id have just gotten down off my high horse when this all started when you deployedi was just afraid i was going to lose you that youd be killed i couldnt believe youd be willing to sacrifice everything we had i was so mad he raised his palm hey hey hey weve been through that enough havent we she nodded almost letting a smile break way enough youre right now he reached his hand out and put it against the plexiglas separating them its so incredibly good to see you do you know that you too she leaned in toward him i came down here to tell you that i love you you know evan scholler ive always loved you all that other stuff not answering your letters everything with ron i was just young and stupid no the stupid award goes to me walking away from you that night at the traven this time a smile broke okay maybe were tied on that one but im not going to be stupid anymore he sat back then came forward again his voice raw you realize people might say that this is stupid visiting me getting involved again with me on any level if youre going to be doing that i am and its not stupid its right this is what i need to be doing this is who i am who we are im just sorry it took me so long to figure it out you dont have to be sorry for anything he said but she shook her head no youre wrong im sorry for everything thats got us to here im just so so sorry evan i really am his eyes met hers i am too tara he said at last i am too on tuesday morning the second week of september an assistant district attorney with the impossible name of mary patricia whelanmiille looked at her wristwatch in department of the san mateo county courthouse in redwood city it was nine fortytwo am this meant that court was starting a few minutes late but the tardiness didnt bother her mary patricias lawschool friends had given her the nickname of mills almost before shed gotten her full name out for the first time and now mills with excitement and some trepidation took in the scene around her she was exactly where she wanted to be at this momentin a courtroom as a prosecutor about to begin the trial of her life and one that had a chance to become a defining moment in her career oh there would undoubtedly be pitfalls ahead as in fact there had already been her boss doug falbrocks decision to abandon the charges against evan scholler in the murders of ibrahim and shatha khalil for lack of evidence for example had been a bitter pill for her to swallow in the early innings pulling tollson a multidecorated vietnam combat veteran whod lost a foot to an antipersonnel bomb in that war as the trial judge perhaps wasnt the greatest bit of good fortune imaginable either probably fewer than two or three years from retirement tollson as the prototypical éminence grise had earned the sobriquet his griseness from millss paralegal felice brinkley and it fit perfectly outside of the courtroom in the buildings halls tollson limped along exuding a nearly boyish enthusiasm he came across as preppy favoring casual menswear instead of coat and tie he wore blue contact lenses his perfectly combed silvertipped grecian formula hair nearly luxuriant in a man his age but on the bench he wore the black robe and thick black eyeglasses that magnified a pair of rheumy depthless black pupils his hair remained permanently in disarray as though he spent his time in chambers running his hands through it in constant despair at the human condition add the permanent scowl which emphasized heavy brows a prominent and aggressive nose and the thinlipped set of his mouth and his griseness was a formidable and vaguely menacing force that attorneys in court crossed at their own peril nor was mills entirely sanguine about the defense attorney who was now standing behind his desk fifteen feet to her left everett washburn somewhere north of seventy whitehaired and in rimless glasses wore a light tan suit that was at least one size too large his shirt had had all of its washnwear washed out of it the tie was an orangeandtan paisley design three inches wide his florid face was a creased dried apple and his voice combined equal parts honey and whiskey he had the teeth of a horse yellowed with age cigars strong coffee and wine washburn reportedly had lost a murder trial once but nobody remembered when mills herself had come down to court just to watch him perform several times and considered him tenacious brilliant ruthless and unpredictable a dangerous combination plus and this made it worse he was a famous nice guy a favorite of all the judges bailiffs clerks and even prosecuting attorneys such as herself he knew every birthday and anniversary in the building and reportedly spent in excess of fifty thousand dollars a year on political fundraisers charity events and lunches and that didnt include his bar tabs but all of that being said mills liked her chances greater forces were at work here the first of which was the fact that some benign karma had delivered her to san mateo county her first seven years as a prosecutor had been in san francisco and in spite of always being prepared beyond reason and never seeing a suspect who hadnt committed the crime of which he or she had been accused she had only managed four jury trialsthe rest had been pled out by her superiors for far less than any sentence they would have received in a fair worldand her record in those trials had been three hung juries and an acquittal san francisco juries she believed because it was true just didnt convict but san mateo county she loved san mateo county as it in turn hated its criminalsits vandals gangbangers burglars petty thieves and murderers all alike san mateo county wanted these people dealt with and trusted the system to deal with them as did mills whose parents shed loved in spite of the mouthful of moniker theyd laid on her at birth and whod been murdered in a carjacking when she was sixteen so there was san mateo county essentially on her side it was a miracle given her record that theyd hired her here the interview had come on the particularly bad afternoon when the big fourth of her four losses had come in and shed been in a quiet and reasonable fury in her interview with falbrocka real idontgiveafuckwhathappens mood karma again shed found herself launched into her takenoprisoners tirade before she could stop herself and much to her surprise and delight after she gave her exceptions about people the state should put to death falbrock had smiled and said i dont know im not so sure we shouldnt execute shoplifters its a gateway crime and hed hired her on the spot there was next her victim ron nolana young wealthy cleancut handsome and charismatic exnavy seal recipient of three purple hearts the afghanistan and iraq campaign medals the liberation of kuwait medal the global war on terrorism expeditionary medal the meritorious service medal and the bronze star mills learning about the extraordinary life of ron nolan as she had investigated his death had wondered more than once why she hadnt had the good fortune to have met him in her real life before hed been murdered she hadnt quite fallen in love with his memory but she felt a fascination bordering on infatuation that she couldnt deny and if she could avenge his senseless death in any way she would consider it her privilege and duty which brought her to her suspect she stole a glance over to where evan scholler stood to her he was the definition of scumbag and it still galled her to see him in the courtroom now all cleaned up with a dress shirt and tie and nice jacket but she was convinced that by the time she was done the jury would see beyond the façade that washburn was so adept at creating beyond the injured war veteran with the pretty and supportive girlfriend and the loyal parents to the alcoholic and vicodin addict whose incompetent leadership had led his squad of san mateo county boys into their fatal ambush in iraq as she waited for the judge to enter the courtroom her heart was beating hard in anticipation she was particularly keen to face some of the issues that were to be adjudicated before jury selection was to begin the most important of which was going to be up first today mills had prepared a motion requesting a foundational hearing to determine the admissibility of evidence related to posttraumatic stress disorder from the outset it had been clear that everett washburn intended to use ptsd as an integral part of his defense of evan scholler after all the young man had endured exactly the kind of severe personal trauma during wartime that had produced volumes of literature on the subject hed also exhibited to a host of witnesses over a substantial period of time some if not all of the classic symptoms of ptsd so for a while early on mills had let herself get lulled into a grudging acceptance that ptsd with its expertwitness madness media appeal and the emotional overtones it created particularly in the context of the increasingly unpopular war was going to be part of the trial and then one day it came to her that washburn couldnt have it both ways either he could argue that scholler had killed ron nolan but that ptsd was an extenuating circumstance or even a defense or he could maintain that scholler hadnt killed ron nolan at all in which case he wouldnt strictly speaking need any other defense if scholler didnt do it then it wasnt ptsd or selfdefense or anything at all that had made him do it so believing that she had logic on her sidenot that it always matteredmills had written her motion she wanted a fullblown hearing on the issue and was prepared to argue heatedly for it all rise hear ye hear ye the superior court state of california in and for the county of san mateo is now in session judge theodore tollson presiding now she stood up and brought her eyes forward tollson had ascended to the bench the clerk said you may be seated after fifteen months interviews filling thirtyseven binders twelve pretrial written motions three boyfriends and the hint that the proper outcome would garner a sixfigure bookdeal offer they were about to get on the boards at last tollson glared down from the bench to both attorneys tables back over the small bullpen partition and across the packed gallery he looked in no way amiable he straightened his back and pushed his glasses up to the ridge of his nose mr washburn he began ms miille are you ready to begin both intoned yes your honor all right then before we get down to it lets spend a few moments in my chambers and with that he was up again off the bench and through the side door to mills there was an absurd quality to the judges formal entrance minutes before followed by his nearimmediate retreat back to his private office but it was far from the only absurd moment shed spent in and around courtrooms by the time shed gathered her papers everett washburn had come over to her table and like the cultured gentleman that he was waited for her to come around she almost expected him to hold out his arm as a courtier might for her to take it but he merely bowed and let her precede him across the courtroom and to the back door where the bailiff was waiting in tollsons chambers a faded greenandgold pennant from the university of san francisco took pride of place on the wall behind the large oak desk a trophy case held more than a dozen ancient baseball and football trophies a golf bag sat up against the bookshelf wall a credenza sported a dozen or more framed photos of family members someone had arranged his diplomas honors and ceremonial pictures in a large rectangular pattern that covered the last empty wall the bailiff stayed until they were seated then disappeared leaving only the two lawyers and the judge tollson in his robe and glasses behind his desk nevertheless was his casual outofthecourtroom self as he began so i take it you two havent reached a lastminute settlement mr washburn the old lawyer sat back with his legs crossedbemused tolerant goodnatured thats correct your honor so what are we looking at for time the question was asked of both of them but mills spoke up first the peoples case your honor maybe four weeks depending on cross ive never worked with mr washburn before so i dont know how long he takes ill let him give you the estimate for the defense i dont know about rebuttal she paused decided to hedge her estimate a lot will depend she said on what you let in well be getting to that here tollson said jury selection probably a couple of weeks your honor i would suggest a week of hardship based on the length she was suggesting that they first screen prospective jurors to see who could be with them basically without pay for what looked like a couple of months the idea was that it was wise to eliminate the vast majority of prospective jurors whose employers would not pay for that length of jury service or who could not otherwise handle the commitment only those who survived the initial screening would undergo the more complex and timeconsuming questioning that would decide who would sit on the jury she went on so weve got twenty peremptory challenges each and some hotbutton issues such as the iraq war and maybe some psych stuff depending on your rulings we use questionnaires we should get our hardships done in three days or so and the regular jury picked a couple days after that give or take tollson nodded mr washburn sound about right to you pretty close he intoned i agree we should hardship first and have the jury fill out questionnaires he reached into his inside pocket and extracted a handful of paper folded the long way and i just happen to have a proposed questionnaire for this case with me handing a copy to mills and the judge he added ill need about a week for the defense your honor tollson perusing the questionnaire didnt look up but said motions this time washburn went first limit the use of autopsy photos your honor they dont need a bunch of gory photos to prove this guy is dead your honor mills said this guy the victim was in superb health somebody beat him to a bloody pulp not a robber or a burglar but someone who hated him the jury will need to see the savagery of the attack to appreciate that this was a personal killing washburn shot back too many autopsy photos might unduly prejudice the jury tollson held up a hand show me the photos you want to have admitted ill let you know which ones you can use before we start jury selection anything else this was the moment mills produced copies of her motion for washburn and tollson and said mr washburn has discovered some stuff on ptsd your honor and has expert witnesses on his list we would like a fullblown hearing on what youre going to admit before we get near a jury she wanted the judge to require washburn to call his witnesses outside of the presence of the jury and have them testify under oath then the two sides could argue over whether such testimony was admissible and the court could rule on it if the evidence was admitted the same witnesses would have to give exactly the same testimony later in front of the jury if the court refused to hold the hearing testimony got heard for the first time with the jury present in this case if the court then ruled that the testimony should not have been admitted the only remedy was to instruct the jury to pretend they had never heard it popularly known as unringing the bell this was a notoriously ineffective way to deal with the problem mills went into her pitch the defendant claims ptsd your honor but the defense here is that he didnt do it if he didnt do it then his state of mind is irrelevant all this is going to do is put his war record and injuries in front of the jury to excite sympathy washburn leaning back with his legs crossed ran a finger around in his ear my client was blacked out during the period where it appears mr nolan was killed your honor first evidence of ptsd will support his claim that he cant remember anything about this period second if he did kill someone and there is a doubt about his mental state because he might have been in a ptsd episode then he is entitled to that doubt the crime would certainly be less than premeditated murder maybe voluntary or even involuntary manslaughter this brought the first sign of tollsons courtroom testiness i believe i understand the issues counselor he spent a few more seconds looking over millss pages then squared them and put them down with washburns questionnaire im going to allow two weeks for motions until we know what the jury will hear we cant tell them how long the case will be so jury selection starts two weeks from today sound good it sounded good to mills shed gotten her hearing a good omen tollson continued my staff will have the jury commissioner start to put panels together six court days for jury selection including three days of hardship six weeks of trial or so if you get into ptsd probably four at the outside if you dont lets get outside on the record and get to work everett washburn stood in the center of the courtroom addressing his first witness in the hearing on ptsd dr sandra overton was a frizzyhaired earnest psychiatrist in her midforties she wore a dark blue business suit with low heels she had already recited her credentials and experience as a psychiatristie a medical doctorspecializing in veterans returning from active combat in your experience with these veterans doctor washburn asked her have you run across a condition known as posttraumatic stress disorder or ptsd she almost laughed at the question its pretty much all i work with can you tell the court exactly what it is then certainly she looked across at the prosecution table where mills sat with her hands folded in front of her then around and up to where the judge sat on the bench its pretty much what the name says its a psychiatric disorder that occurs after an episode of traumatic stress a psychiatric disorder do you mean its a mental illness she shook her head thats not really a descriptive term legally it would qualify as a disease defect or disorder medically it is more a range of continuing symptoms and reactions experienced by someone whos endured a traumatic event the key word being continuing in what way well almost everyone who experiences a traumatic event has a reaction to it shock or depression or insomnia but with ptsd the reaction first tends to be more serious and second it persists for a lengthy period of time sometimes forever it becomes a disorder not a reaction and what is a traumatic event doctor again overton shook her head theres no one definition whats traumatic for one person might be relatively innocuous to another but certainly traumatic events would tend to include military combat serious accidents crimes such as rape natural disasters terrorist incidents and the like military combat yes very commonly although the disorder wasnt much studied until after the vietnam war before then when people talked about it at all it was usually called da costas syndrome but since vietnam estimates of soldiers with combat experience suffering from ptsd have run as high as thirty percent and what are some symptoms commonly associated with ptsd one of the main symptoms is a reliving of the original traumatic experience through either flashbacks or in nightmares beyond that theres insomnia of course and a sense of disconnect with life then depression memory and cognition issues abusive and selfdestructive behavior a huge range of personal and societal problems actually doctor you referred to abusive and selfdestructive behavior could this include alcohol abuse yes of course and memory issues do you mean blackouts yes blackouts are not uncommon especially if coupled with excessive drinking or drug use or both i see washburn acted as though he were hearing all of this for the very first time in his life now he moved a step closer to his witness doctor is there a physical component to ptsd or is it simply what a layman might just call a mental problem as washburn intended this question kept overton from becoming lulled in her relatively straightforward recounting this hearing hadnt been his idea but since he was in it he was dryrunning her to play to the jurys sensibilities when and if she testified at trial she sat up stiffly her expression defiant absolutely not in the first place a mental problem is a real problem its as real as a broken leg secondly with ptsd there is measurable altered brainwave activity decreased volume of the hippocampus and abnormal activation of the amygdala both of the latter having have to do with memory the thyroids affected as is production of epinephrine and cortisol i could go on but suffice it to say that there are many many physical and neurological changes and reactions associated with ptsd i see doctor thank you washburn said now have you had an opportunity to interview and examine my client evan scholler with regard to ptsd i have what were your findings i found that mr scholler clearly suffers from the disorder his memory particularly seems to be compromised and this symptom has been aggravated by a traumatic brain injury he suffered in iraq in august of two thousand three he suffers from frequent migraine headaches beyond that he has reported the experience of blackouts and episodes of rage shame guilt and depression sleeping has been a consistent problem finally he has spoken to me about a tendency to abuse alcohol and other painkilling drugs such as vicodin all of these symptoms are not only consistent with ptsd they are diagnostic of it and what about the physical changes youve describedto the amygdala and hippocampus and so forth did you test mr scholler for these yes i did what were your findings i found decreased cortisol with increased epinephrine and norepinephrine levels together these hormone levels impact the bodys fear response and the startle reflex both of which i found to be in the abnormal range with mr scholler and your conclusions as a medical professional does mr scholler suffer from ptsd dr overton looked over at the defense table where evan sat yes unremitting and severe ptsd without a doubt in my professional opinion without a doubt thank you doctor washburn inclined his head in a courteous bow facing mills he turned his palm up your witness counsel dr overton the assistant district attorney began youve testified that blackouts were not uncommon among people with ptsd were you saying that ptsd causes blackouts not exactly i believe i said that blackouts were common especially when drugs or alcohol were part of the picture oh so ptsd does not in itself cause these blackouts is that true well in a sense you can say that doctor im sorry its a yes or no question does ptsd cause blackouts overton frowned glanced over at washburn they are commonly associated with ptsd yes again doctor not my question does ptsd cause blackouts washburn cleared his throat and spoke from his table objection badgering tollson didnt take two seconds to make up his mind overruled he leaned over to speak to the witness please answer the question doctor mills jumped right in would you like me to repeat it tollson transferred his scowl down to her can the sarcasm counselor doctor answer the question does ptsd cause blackouts yes there are some reports of that some how many of these reports are you personally familiar with im not sure to the best of my recollection a few a few all right and do any of these few reports with which youre familiar speak to the duration of any of these rare ptsd blackouts from behind her everett washburn rumbled forth again objection assumes facts not in evidence the doctors awareness of only a few reports on blackouts doesnt mean that the blackouts themselves are rare sustained but mills came right back at overton doctor she said do any of these few reports with which youre familiar speak to the duration of any of these ptsd blackouts yes they do mills had her own expert witness on this topic although she wasnt sure she was going to use him in any event shed done her homework and knew her facts doctor she said isnt it true that these ptsd blackouts tend to be of very short duration yes along the line of forgetting where you put your keys for example im not sure i understand what you mean you put your keys on your kitchen counter for example then are struck with a vivid posttraumatic flashback when its over you cant remember where you placed your keys thats the kind of ptsd blackout discussed in the literature is it not in other words a memory lapse of relatively short duration i think so yes mills walked back to her table took a drink of water turning around to the witness she asked doctor are you aware of any ptsd blackouts that extended for more than a day no ive never heard of that how about an hour no i dont think so ten minutes somewhere in that realm i believe the flashback usually tends to be intense but shortlived the gallery might not have understood exactly what mills was getting at with this questioning but the doctors answer of ten minutes sent a buzz through the room galvanized by it the prosecutor moved in closer to the witness doctor youve also testified about blackouts that are coupled with excessive alcohol and drug use or both would you characterize these blackouts as caused by ptsd or by the alcohol andor drug use well theyre related the ptsd exacerbates the abusive behavior but it is the drinking or the drug use that causes the actual blackouts is it not i dont think we can say that well doctor alcohol and drug use by themselves can cause blackouts correct yes and this is a fairly common and welldocumented phenomenon is it not yes but blackouts associated with ptsd are both rare and of short duration isnt that true washburn knew that this was a compound question and hence objectionable but saw nothing to gain by further interruption yes so mills continued if you had a blackout for an extended period of time doctor say a couple of days there is scientific evidence that it could have been caused by alcohol and no scientific support for the suggestion that it was caused by ptsd alone correct yes thank you doctor now youve said that mr scholler told you that he had abused both alcohol and vicodin isnt that so clearly frustrated now overton had come forward in the witness chair her hands on the balustrade of the box thats right did he also tell you doctor that he had abused alcohol in iraq before one of these socalled traumatic experiences your honor finally washburn was moved to rise to his feet in outrage i object to counsels characterization most of us humans would consider sustaining a severe head wound during a rifle and grenade attack on foreign soil in defense of our country a traumatic event there is nothing spurious or socalled about it this brought the gallery noise now to a full hum and tollson dropped his gavel for the first time without a word he glared around the room until all the noise had ceased mills broke the silence ill withdraw the word socalled your honor but she wasnt backing down perhaps the court reporter can reread my question without the offending word tollson looked down over the bench at his reporter and nodded the woman pulled the tape up and read did he also tell you doctor that he had abused alcohol in iraq before one of thesea pausetraumatic experiences overton her mouth set shot a glance at washburn then came back to her tormentor yes he did in other words mr schollers alcohol abuse preceded his ptsd and by itself was capable of producing extended periods of memory blackout isnt that so apparently overton snipped out that would be a yes then is that correct through all but gritted teeth now yes and mr scholler told you that the particular blackout after the death of the victim ron nolan lasted approximately four days isnt that true yes thank you doctor mills said no further questions lawyer and client sat knee to knee in a holding cell behind the courtroom during the lunch recess outside their two small wired windows it was a bright and sunny day their view included a small city of media vans that had set up out in the parking lot washburns mouth was full of liverwurst on rye but it didnt shut him up it doesnt matter he said whats important is she established the ptsd now weve just got to make sure we get tollson to let it in you gonna eat your pickle no im not holding anything down you go ahead washburn stopped chewing you nervous why would i be nervous on trial for murder and all youve got to keep your strength up washburn grabbed the pickle and took a bite of it after he finally swallowed he sipped from his bottled water and cleared his throat but we need to talk about what we do if he doesnt allow it you mean tollson a nod and the ptsd we get that were going to have the jury on our side theyre going to see what happened in iraq what youve been throughits decent odds they dont convict on the other hand this morning i was hoping ted would rule to let the ptsd in without a hearing but he didnt do that which means hes thinking about it maybe he thinks its bogus why would he think that he lost a foot himself yeah but remember whatever else happened to him he didnt get any ptsd from it which means maybe that to him its just a bunch of mumbojumbo from weakass lesser beings or shyster lawyers like me is this supposed to cheer me up washburn shrugged took another monstrous bite of his sandwich just running down the possibilities look he went on dont get down about this half the worlds on our side which means half isnt but we dont need half we just need one out of twelve so get over it the fact is youre a wounded veteran whos the victim of an extremelynowunpopular war the more we get the war in as a villain the more we got nolan as a victim of the war himself without the war nobody would have been killed your guys in iraq nolan nobody plus we got our big surprise when you testify which will sway some hearts and minds since it brings it all around and gives them an alternative theory to think about but all thats counting on the ptsd without which its a different ball game taking another drink of water washburn swished it around so the question is tollson doesnt let it in we might want to talk about a plea evan closed his eyes for a second then shook his head no way wait before you everett listen millss last offer was forty to life i cant do forty washburn looked at his client hed been here with other clients more times than he cared to remember but it never got easy tollsons ruling to hold a hearing on the ptsd evidence was unexpected and perhaps ultimately disastrous washburn had truly believed that his argument in chambers casually though he had phrased it would carry the day and that tollson would allow the ptsd evidence at the trial but now possibly that wasnt to be the case washburn wasnt giving up it wasnt in his nature to do that but he had to get it through to evan that they might after all lose im sure i could get doug falbrock to drop the gun he said any use of a gun in the commission of a murder in california added an automatic twentyfive years to the sentence plea to a second get them down to say twelve to life evan was sitting back arms crossed wasnt it you who said the immortal words anything to life equals life i was being glib he said youd be a model prisoner out in the minimum still evan said twelve years washburn unfolded his hands took his last bite of sandwich im just sayinghe chewed a couple of timesim just saying you might want to think about it washburns plan to get the war into the trial at every opportunity was behind his decision to call anthony onofrio as his next witness onofrio had come home six months ago and had immediately contacted washburns office asking if and how he could help with evans defense as an older veteran a father of three whod left his caltrans job and home in half moon bay to do his duty as well as the lone military survivor besides evan in the baghdad firefight he was in a unique position to recount the traumatic event that was at the heart of this hearing but no sooner had the clerk sworn in the thicknecked friendly looking workman than mills stood to object your honor the last witness has already testified and established to the peoples satisfaction that mr scholler suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder we are willing to concede that point though we still contend that its irrelevant the people fail to see what probative value if any this witness can bring to these proceedings he wasnt even here in the united states during the time of the murder and his testimony can have no bearing on the defendants guilt or innocence judge tollson leaned back in his chair on the bench his eyes nearly closed he inclined his head a quarter of an inch mr washburn your honor this witness is foundational there can be no posttraumatic stress without an original trauma and mr onofrio was an eyewitness to the trauma that mr scholler experienced and to the effects of which dr overton just testified we did not simply hire a rentashrink to come in here and invent a condition following an event which never took place without the event there can be no condition for a long moment and against all reason since he was basically correct washburn lived with the agonizing possibility that tollson was going to dismiss his witness and call an end to his entire line of questioning he also had time to reflect that millss objection made little sense in theory by granting this hearing without the presence of a jury tollson had provided her with a bonusshed get to see all of his evidence before he could present it at trial she should want to hear everybody he brought in so shed in effect have two chances to take them apartnow and when the jury had been impaneled but then he realized she was probably running mostly on nerves and adrenaline herself and the fact remained that if tollson did side with her and preclude onofrio from testifying the same objection and rationale might get some traction regarding calling his following witnesses as well and that would truly be problematic tollson ended the suspense ms whelanmiille he said this is a hearing that means we get to hear what people have to say before we get to trial mr washburn is right this witnesss proposed testimony is foundational to the question of trauma the objection is overruled mr washburn you may proceed trying to hide his sigh of relief from the court washburn leaned his head forward the merest hint of a bow thank you your honor he turned to the witness now mr onofrio can you please tell the court about your relation to mr scholler until he was wounded he was my squadron leader in iraq in the summer of two thousand three over the next few minutes washburn walked onofrio through the makeup of the squadron and its general duties as a military convoy unit then came back to the main thrust mr onofrio youve said that mr scholler was your squadron leader until he was wounded would you please tell us how that came about sure we were escorting ron nolan to a meeting with excuse me washburn said you were escorting the same ron nolan who is the victim in this case yes he was with you in iraq was he he came and he went but basically yes he was working for allstrong security which was handling the baghdad airport and doing other work over there it was one of our regular jobs driving him where he needed to go all right so he was with your convoy on the day the mr scholler was hit yes he was onofrio sat back in the witness chair and basically told it as he remembered it the tension on the citys streets nolan firing on the purported suicide car the discovery of what it had really been and who had been in it the rockthrowing and then the sustained attack from the surrounding buildings and rooftops just after it all started though the actual rifle firing and the first rpg we had a chance where maybe we could have gotten out but the lieutenant wouldnt give the order to pull out until wed gotten the men whod already been hit into one of our vehicles he wasnt going to leave anyone behind this was important information carefully rehearsed washburn wanted it to be clear in the jurys mind when it came to it that evan was in grave danger in the thick of it and had acted nobly no sir so he ran up to the lead car which was still smoking and tried to get out the guys whod been hit he did this while you were under heavy fire yes sir but then the second car took a hit and a couple of the other guys went down so it was obvious there wasnt going to be any chance for any of us to get out if we didnt move pretty quick so nolan kept firing through the roof and had me drive up to where evan was pinned down he still wanted to try to carry some of the guys out if he could get to them but an rpg went off somewhere behind us and next time i looked over he was down what had happened he was hit by shrapnel or something in the head there was blood everywhere i thought he was dead i thought we were all dead all right thank you mr onofrio im glad you made it home alive he half turned back to mills your witness mills saw this as a nowin crossexamination and almost passed the witness but decided she had nothing really to lose if she just took the judges advice and heard what the man would say no jury was listening now and maybe shed strike some promising vein that she could mine when she had him again during the trial if washburn was going to call up what she considered these largely irrelevant witnesses she might as well take the opportunity to go fishing with them mr onofrio she began first let me say that i too and all of us in the courtroom are grateful that you made it home alive thank you for your service to our country shrugging embarrassed onofrio mumbled youre welcome one of the things i was struck with in your testimony was the fact that you were not sent over to do convoy work did i get that right onofrio nodded thats right we were supposed to be doing maintenance on heavy equipment transport vehicles but when we got to kuwait they werent there yet so they farmed a bunch of us out as convoy units the questioning was getting far afield but washburn took his own advice and let it go better to hear the answer now than find out for the first time in front of a jury about some land mine in the witnesss testimony how did you feel about that mills asked he smiled either at her naïveté or at the question they didnt ask us it wasnt like it was negotiable no i understand that but the convoy work at the front wasnt it more dangerous than the work youd originally been scheduled to do only by about a factor of ten maybe twenty so much more dangerous then yes way more mills paused and kept casting didnt you and the other men object to that sure but what were we going to do i dont know mr onofrio what did you do well we complained about it to lieutenant scholler we asked him to talk to the base commander and see if we could get transferred back to our regular unit and did he do that he tried but he couldnt get in to see him not in time anyway then trying to be helpful onofrio added he was going to see if nolan could pull some strings with the brass but again that didnt happen in time mr scholler thought that mr nolan might be able to pull some strings for him why was that were they friends id say so yeah close friends well i dont know he shrugged again then unwittingly dropped his bomb drinking buddies anyway the words had barely registered as significant when mills heard washburn all but erupt behind her objection irrelevant but this was the purest bluff no one in the courtroom thought the answer was even remotely irrelevant and tollson sealed that opinion in an instant overruled mills kept her mouth tight to avoid telegraphing her pleasure thank you your honor she said then back at the witness mr onofrio when you characterize the friendship between mr nolan and mr scholler as that of drinking buddies do you mean that they literally drank together onofrio picking up the panic in washburns tone flashed a quick look over to the defense table occasionally i think yes do you think they drank together or did you see them drinking together yes they drank together mr onofrio is there a rule in the military against drinking on duty or in a war zone yes but mr scholler broke this rule i suppose so you witnessed this yourself personally yes how many times i dont know exactly a few more than five times your honor washburn said badgering the witness overruled mills nodded more than five times mr onofrio maybe more than ten i didnt count the times onofrio said i really couldnt say for sure once a day once a week once a month a few times a week all right then did mr scholler drink to excess objection washburn sang out calls for a conclusion overruled tollson said a lay witness can give an opinion as to sobriety mills slowed herself down she was close to something very good here and didnt want to blow it did mr scholler ever appear drunk to you when he was on duty objection conclusion sustained mills tried again did you personally ever see mr scholler intoxicated after hed been drinking with mr nolan onofrio threw another worried glance over to washburn and evan yes maam and by intoxicated do you mean that you heard him speak with slurred speech or have trouble walking yes maam mr onofrio when was the last time you remember noticing these thingsdefendants slurred speech or the uncertain walk onofrio looked down at his lap his last night over there the night before this incident at masbah is that what youre saying he blew out and slowly nodded thats what im saying mr onofrio on the day the shooting started when mr scholler was leading the convoy that got ambushed did he appear to be intoxicated no maam onofrio answered strongly mills paused then came out with it but he certainly was hung over wasnt he stephan ray the language and recreational therapist from walter reed nodded enthusiastically at washburn from the witness stand he is definitely one of the success stories he worked very hard and was also very lucky but his success doesnt take away from the seriousness of his injuries there was a real question for at least a couple of months as to whether hed live and then a further question about how completely if at all hed recover what were the areas most affected well most obviously affected were speech and memory although there were also some coordination issues early on that cleared up more or less on their own so how did these memory problems manifest themselves well at first just after the surgery of course he remained pretty much continually unconscious for three weeksin fact i believe they kept him in an induced coma until they were confident that hed gotten sufficiently well to handle consciousness although im not a hundred percent sure of that i wasnt on his medical team im not a doctor but when i first encountered evan he had what id call severe memory and cognition issues he didnt know where he was he thought i worked for the cia he didnt know what had happened to him exactly but mostly he didnt have a vocabulary no vocabulary at all at first very little but then over time as the healing progressed he recovered the use of most common words was this a natural event to some degree yes but a lot of it was a matter of training the brain again or relearning what hed once known we used flash cards just the way you would if you were learning a new language and evan made really remarkable progress especially compared to many others of our patients who never recover their ability to talk or to reason washburn nodded even with all this progress how long did evan remain in therapy with you at walter reed nearly six months six months and during those six months while he was progressing so well did he also suffer from blackouts im not sure exactly what you mean by blackouts periods when he could not recall what hed done or where he was as you described when hed first come out of surgery ah well yes they were not infrequent not infrequent so they were common yes but thats always to be expected in a case of traumatic brain injury and how long could a blackout period last again it would vary i remember a time with evan this was after three or four months of therapy when he woke up one morning convinced that he was in baghdad he didnt understand why there was snow outside when it was summer in baghdad i thought it was a serious enough setback to bring it to the attention of the doctors but he woke up on the third morning and was fine he didnt think he was in baghdad anymore no he knew he was in walter reed he picked up just where hed left off in terms of his recovery but for those three days he was different as far as he was concerned he was in baghdad i see now let me ask you this mr ray after evan woke up realizing that he was in walter reed and not in baghdad did you ask him about his memory of the time hed imagined he was in baghdad in other words did you ask him about his memory of his past three days yes i did he remembered none of it none of it none in fact he thought i was playing a joke on him those days were just gone as though hed never lived them thank you mr ray ms whelanmiille your witness mr ray did ron nolan visit mr scholler at walter reed yes he did i met him on that occasion did you play a part in their conversation not really no mills went right on would you describe evans demeanor after mr nolan left he was very upset and angry to the point of tears i remember distinctly that later he developed a migraine headache so severe that he had to be sedated for a time mills stood still for a moment wondering how far she could push this point surely if she got ray at trial she could take evans anger and jealousy further but today she didnt want to overplay her hand she knew hed be there for her if she needed him at the trial thank you mr ray she said no further questions because she was on the peoples witness list tara wasnt allowed in the courtroom now at fivefifteen in the jails visiting room she bit her lip and tried to keep up a brave smile every time she met evans eyes and then they were at the window that would be theirs for today one chair on either side of it the hole in the plexiglas through which they had to talk it was by now all so familiar and still so awful but tara wasnt going to concentrate on the bad she could take her cues from eileen upbeat and positive i saw you on tv in a coat and tie i thought i told you i get to look like a regular person in court you look like a regular person now if you took a poll i bet most people would say i look like a regular jailbird what with the jumpsuit and all whatd they say about things on tv they said it was a mixed day what do you think he shrugged theres no jury yet so really none of this counts but it didnt feel too mixed to me this prosecutor woman is pretty tough shes pounding on the drinking theme why does she want that so much everett says its all positioning for the jury theyre not going to be disposed to like or believe a drunk whereas if im suffering from ptsd and blacking out then im a wounded war veteran with a mental illness whos caught in a terrible situation he didnt really create and the sympathy flows like honey i know its a little cynical but the point is if we get the ptsd then to some extent it explains the drinking not that im using that as an excuse for myself the drinking i mean he lowered his gaze for a moment i still dont know what got into me that night why i didnt just go home with you did it ever occur to you that maybe what mr washburns arguing is actually true and not cynical after all that your physical brain wasnt healed yet so you werent completely rationalyour cognitive powers just werent all there and you put ptsd on top of all that i dont see how a jury could ever get to firstdegree murder well lets hope he fell silent seemed as if he were about to say something but held it back what she asked he drew a breath and let it out at lunch today everett said that i might want to start thinking about if i wanted to take a plea bargain after this hearing phase if the judge doesnt let in the ptsd a plea bargain why hes been saying all along we were going to win apparently its not such a sure thing without the ptsd well why wouldnt the judge let it in i dont know everett didnt even think it would be an issue until tollson ordered the hearing this morning but now it is and if we lose it he lifted his shoulders what would you plead to seconddegree murder everett thinks he could talk them into dropping the gun charge so how long would that be he hesitated for a beat twelve to life taras head dropped as though shed been struck after a minute she looked up again her eyes brimming with tears if you do plead isnt that admitting you did it yeah you cant do that no i dont think i can you dont remember anything about those four days tara weve been over that a thousand times well maybe the thousand and first he shook his head its not going to happen i remember going to rons after i left you i remember hitting him and him hitting me back both of us getting into it then nothing until i woke up in jail im sorry im just so sorry but theres nothing there its like i disappeared into those damn bottles tara bit down on her lip you cant plead that you did it evan we cant let ourselves accept were going to get beaten here thats what i was thinking too but if we doget beaten i meanthen im going to be in prison for a lot longer than twelve years id wait evan i really would i could never ask you to she was rubbing her hand back and forth over her forehead god god god i dont think hes listening evan said over the next two and a half very tedious days of technical testimony everett washburn called two psychologists who had administered batteries of tests to evan over the previous several months personality tests neuropsych tests intelligence tests perception tests concentration tests memory tests both agreed with dr overton that evan clearly suffered from symptoms that were consistent with ptsd washburn called several members of the redwood city police department who had worked with evan and who had specific recollections of times when hed exhibited ptsd symptoms in their presenceparticularly inappropriate laughter and speech aphasiaan overlong pause in the stream of his conversation lieutenant lochland described his irrational anger and some of the complaints hed fielded about evan related to the defendants work in the dare program now it was friday the lunch recess was over as was the ptsd hearing and judge tollson had both attorneys back in his chambers in contrast to his usual outofcourtroom affabilityperhaps worn down by the gravity of the issues perhaps chastened by the enormity of the decision he had to maketoday the judge sat all the way back in his chair his arms crossed over the robe at his chest still and expressionless he waited until both washburn and mills had taken their seats and the court reporter set up her machine finally he looked over got a nod from her and cleared his throat mr washburn he said for the record have you called all your witnesses related to the ptsd evidence that youre seeking to place before the jury yes your honor ms miille do the people have any evidence they wish to offer on this issue no your honor all right and before i make my ruling on the peoples four oh two motion do you have any comments that youd like to make just what i said at the beginning your honor that my witnesses proved beyond a doubt that mr scholler suffers from ptsd and this in turn supports his claim that he cant remember anything about this period tollson turned to the prosecutor ms whelanmiille comment after hearing all the evidence your honor the people still believe the entire issue of ptsd is irrelevant and highly prejudicial to this case the defendants position here is that he didnt commit the murder so hes not arguing a quarrel with the victim or heat of passion or even selfdefense the only possible result of allowing this ptsd evidence will be to create sympathy for the defendant with the jury tollson sat still for another few seconds then came forward and rested his arms on his desk his hands clasped in front of him mr washburn i substantially agree with ms whelanmiille ive given this matter long and hard thought in terms of weighing prejudice against probative value and my ruling is that im not going to allow this ptsd evidence washburn staggered by the ruling brought his hands up to both sides of his face then rested them on the side of his chair while he got control of his emotion your honor he said with all respect this evidence needs to be admitted for your purposes perhaps but not as a matter of law counselor its inadmissible because it has no relevance to the evidence related to mr nolans murder beyond that it has the strong possibility of wasting a lot of time and confusing the jury if i let in your expert testimony on psychological issues the jury is necessarily going to have to hear about a lot of hearsay which would not otherwise be admissible would not be subject to crossexamination and would be likely to prejudice the prosecution by exciting sympathy for the defense and a dislike of the victim when you balance that against the entirely speculative argument that the defendant might have been undergoing an episode of ptsd when he killed the victim which by the way he entirely denies doing the whole thing is just designed to turn this trial into a circus until you tell me your client or somebody else is going to testify to a selfdefense claim now at this eleventh hour this evidence does not come in your honor washburn uncrossed his legs and moved to the front of his chair normally unflappable the old barrister had broken a sweat over a flush during the judges monologue he wiped at his neck with the handkerchief from his jacket pocket looking over at the court reporter he sighed in pure frustration of course this guts the defense your honor and i hope the court will keep an open mind toward reconsideration as the case comes in of course counsel tollson at his most brusque this courts openmindedness is legendary ladies and gentlemen of the jury todaya wednesday two weeks after the ptsd rulingmills wore a subdued blue suit over a white blouse no jewelry low black pumps jurors knew she had a government salary and she was expected to dress in a lawyerlike ladylike fashion her presentation was supposed to be professional any sign of flamboyance might be taken for disrespect or even arrogance representing the people of the state of california before this jury of seven men and five women she wanted nothing to call any undue attention to herself neither aggressive nor hostile she was to be the plainspoken voice of truth and reason recounting the prosecutions case starting in the middle of the courtroom mills walked a short course up to the foremans position along the front row of the jury panel and then after a quick stop at her desk to turn the page in her binder and check her notes back to where shed begun she did this as a kind of timing device to slow herself down she also believed in making eye contact with each and every member of the jury the message was clearshe was leveling with them person to person looking them right in the eye and telling them the unblinking truth good morning as you know from the questions you answered during your selection as members of this jury well be here for the better part of a couple of weeks hearing the evidence that proves that this defendanthere she turned and pointed to evanmurdered a man named ron nolan the defendant hated ron nolan theres no doubt about it he thought ron nolan had stolen his girlfriend he hated him for being a business success in iraq where defendant had been injured while serving in the army he blamed ron nolan for the injuries hed received injuries that actually occurred because defendant after a long night of drinking led his men into an ambush in iraq evan scholler hated ron nolan he made no secret of it he told his parents he told his girlfriend he hinted as much to some of the police officers with whom he worked he stalked ron nolan by illegally using police information to keep track of his whereabouts he broke into ron nolans house and tried to frame him for the killing of two iraqi citizens murdered in the united states finally the evidence will show that defendant carefully planned and premeditated this murder several days before his attack on mr nolan defendant while on duty and in uniform as a policeman for the city of redwood city contacted a locksmith and tricked him into letting him into mr nolans townhouse the locksmith admitted defendant into the home in a subsequent search the fbi found planted in that house evidence related to the murders of ibrahim and shatha khalil unfortunately for defendant his plan failed when ron nolan found the evidence that was planted and called the fbi who then discovered defendants fingerprints in mr nolans home the defendant hated ron nolan and when he couldnt frame him for murder in a drunken rage he went to ron nolans house and killed him the actual cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head not just to the head mind you but fired from a gun held just inches from the skull but defendant didnt just murder ron nolan first he administered a savage beating he broke his jaw he broke his wrist he broke at least two of his ribs he left bruises and cuts and injuries over a lot of ron nolans body the evidence will show that this defendant hated ron nolan and he killed him but if that is what happened how do we know he did it well for openers he told his girlfriend he was going to he left his fingerprint on the murder weapon found by the body and within hours after nolans body was found the police found defendant cowering in his apartment ron nolans blood still on his hands and clothes the injuries hed received in the fight still unhealed and the murdered mans blood still on the brass knuckles he used to inflict the beating ive described this defendant hated ron nolan and he killed him and he killed him in a way that the law defines as firstdegree murder at the close of the evidence in this case ill stand before you and that is the verdict for which i will ask mills was doing it by the book dispassionately laying out the elements of the peoples case like all prosecutors she would consistently refer to the deceased as mr nolan and later sometimes even ron to humanize him to the jurya living breathing human being whose life had been prematurely taken from him by the same token evan scholler would forever after remain the defendant or even less familiarly simply defendanta clinical term denoting the place in society to which hed fallen a nameless faceless perverter of the social order who deserved only the most cursory acknowledgment as a human being and no sympathy in the center of the courtroom one more time she paused noting that washburn had let her go on this long without objection it was a calculated technique she knew to signal to the jury that in spite of this apparently damning litany condemning the defendant the defense remained confidentnay unconcerned by these allegations letting out a theatrical sigh mills again allowed herself a glance over to the defendants table but this look communicated sadness and resignation no one would have enjoyed putting on the kind of recitation shed just completed the human condition was sometimes a terrible burden mills had done her disagreeable though imperative job hoping to bring justice to the evil defendant and closure to the victim and to those who had loved him washburn had the option of coming out swinging now with his defense opening statement or waiting until the people had presented their case and delivering it then after mills had sat down tollson asked him what he wanted to do and he said hed be going right ahead with his statement now he didnt like to let the jury sit too long with one story without being made aware that there was another one or another version of the same one he found that if the prosecution got to make an unrebutted opening statement and then followed it with up to a week or more of its own witnesses all he could do was play defense and this passive style didnt win too many cases but furthering his earlier strategy of avoiding interruptions and objections he no sooner indicated to the judge his decision to give his opening statemententhusiasm to defend his innocent clientthan he got the gallery chortling by commenting in his folksiest manner but after ms whelanmiilles eloquent opening statement your honor the bladder of a poor old country lawyer could sure use a short recess which of course reflected his opinion that the prosecutions opening had not in any way threatened his client or even called into question evans innocence washburn would get to all that in just a minute in his own opening statement and clear up any nagging little inconsistencies that might point to evans guilt but first he had to pee though actually he didnt the judge gave them fifteen minutes and washburn and evan took the opportunity to walk out the courtrooms back door to the small holding cell where they sat across from each other on the cold cement blocks that served as benches washburn had shaved carefully but had missed a fairly obvious spot along his jawline for three days running now beyond that never sartorially close to splendid in a toolarge wheatcolored suit with a ludicrous orange tie he looked particularly disheveled today as he would every day of the trial his tenyearold brown wingtips had frayed laces and holes in both soles so he could cross either leg and get the regularguy message out juries he believed didnt like fancy dressers as defense lawyers they liked real people who talked straight and respected their intelligence and it didnt hurt if you had a personality either but now his immediate concern was his client evan had cleaned up pretty good in contrast to defense attorneys juries tended to like handsome and decently dressed defendants not too handsome especially in a jury with seven men but respectable evans body language already spoke with an accent of defeat and dejectionnot unexpected given millss effective castigation of himbut troublesome nonetheless they both sat with their elbows on their knees heads nearly touching you dont look good washburn said that get to you evan raised his eyes i cant believe i did so many stupid things you were injured washburn said with apparent sincerity you werent back to yourself yet you are now you believe that i do a pause you believe me i wouldnt be here if i didnt is that true washburn took a long beat that is gods truth my son you may not know what you did and you know what thats consistent with whats that innocence if you werent there you wouldnt know what happened would you evan sighed everett i broke into his house you did not break into his house you let yourself into his house either way that was just stupid granted its one of the things i find fascinating about this case all the stupidity he held up a hand no im serious youve admitted to a lot of stupid behavior plus you were drinking way too much which never helps but youve never admitted planting that evidence at nolans have you thats because i didnt you know that i know it and that would have been another stupid move so its not the stupidity thats keeping you from copping to it you see what im saying staying drunk for four days after your fight with nolan was stupid not going to work all that time was stupid but you didnt drive up to nolans in an alcoholic stupor somehow get into his home without alerting him get ahold of his gun and kill him you couldnt have done it your state of mind pardon me was too stupid whoever did this planned it timed it did it right and call me a softhearted romantic i dont see that being you evan almost broke a smile you going to argue that if i can get the right spin on it which might be a trick but listen the main thing im listening i need you to buck up in there you dont have to be indignant or angry or anything negative but youve got to sit up straight and dont let the weight of all the shit shes piling on you get you down youll look guilty and pathetic you want me to look happy no god no youre unjustly accused nobodys happy with that but youre a soldier youre fighting the good fight youve been through battle betrayal brain injury bottleepsy and now this bullshit you beat every other one of em and now youre standing up to this one thats the message stick with it those jurors are going to try to be objective okay but theyre twelve unpredictable human beings dont forget that and if theyre inclined to like you thats not a bad thing every one of their votes is going to count equally you get one of em on your side its over evan sat up straight his back against the wall you really think we can still win this thing were not in it to lose evan so when i go out and razzledazzle em in the next few minutes itd be good to have an enthusiastic fan in the peanut gallery you think you can do that ill give it a shot if i knew what the peanut gallery was you know the peanut gallery howdy doody buffalo bob clarabelle the clown all those guys but clearly evan was clueless about the howdy doody show washburn hit him on the shoulder anyway so forget the peanut gallery just hang tough out there and remember that the jurys looking at you were doing good if you say so everett if you say so at that moment the bailiff knocked and opened the courtroom door telling them their time was up washburn let evan precede him then stopped short in the doorway his heartbeat stuttered and again hed had a heart attack about five years previously and this did not feel like that there was no pain the arrhythmia caught his breath that was all and then the moment was over but suddenly he found that the confidence hed been exuding in his pep talk with evan had vanished the harsh reality as his body took another opportunity to remind him was that he was getting old he persisted in living each day with the myth that he was still at the peak of his powers and would live forever when in truth he was even older than the howdy doody generation maybe even older than buffalo bob himself now long deceased hed lost the ptsd fight to a far younger opponent and now no matter what hed told evan he faced a far more difficult uphill battle against mills it struck him that he might not have the advantage this time that age and treachery might not overcome youth and skill as he stepped into the courtroom behind his client he realized that hed allowed his shoulders to slump that his right hand had lingered at his chest he willed it down squared himself away caught the eye of the young and confident mary patricia whelanmiille at her table and flashed her a mouthful of teeth that would have done a horse proud my friends im going to speak to you for just a few minutes to tell you about the rest of the evidence in this casethings that the prosecution chose not to mention because they dont fit ms miilles version of what happened and things that at the close of this case will still be unexplained this evidence will make you wonder whether evan scholler killed ron nolan and will leave you with a reasonable doubt and will require yourequire you if you fulfill your oaths as jurorsto find evan scholler not guilty washburn stood with his hands in his pockets relaxed and genial hed actually won a round or two with tollson in chambers though it really didnt feel like it but the whole question of iraq hed argued had to be part of the trial it was relevant on its face and essential if the jurors were even going to begin to grasp any of the complexities surrounding both the defendant and the victim and tollson had agreed with him to a point he intended to find out where that point exactly was this case and the issues surrounding it began in iraq he intoned its important to understand the significance that iraq plays in the affair because so much of the evidence presented by the people that appears to cast mr scholler in a negative light in fact paints a very different picture when viewed in its true context the context of what happened in iraq you will hear testimony that the deceased was a highly trained mercenary with a long history of both overt and covert operations in some of the most violent places in the worldafghanistan kuwait el salvador and iraq at the time of his death he was working as a government contractor for allstrong security which has offices both here in california and in iraq all of his adult life the man was surrounded by death and violence this was his livelihood and he was good at it evan scholler on the other hand worked as a redwood city police patrolman until he was called up for deployment to iraq in the first months after the invasion he served over there for about three months before he was involved in a firefight against islamic insurgents in baghdad in which he suffered a head wound and traumatic brain injury in a coma that lasted eleven days he was airlifted first to a field hospital in iraq then taken to germany and finally brought to walter reed hospital in march of two thousand four he came back to work for the police department here in this city he paused to meet a few more eyes in the jury box there it was he thought with some satisfaction and relief short and sweet and hed gotten it in hed hoped that bringing in this information first thing and right up front might catch mills in a firstinning lull and sure enough hed pulled it off dang he loved the drama of a trial taking a breath his heart palpitations forgotten he moved on to the more pressing evidentiary issues ms miille has described at some length the evidence that she says will compel you to convict evan of firstdegree murder that evidence is neither as clear nor as uncontradicted as she might have led you to believe she talked a lot about the day of the killing just for openers we dont know the day of the killing mr nolan was last seen on wednesday june third he was found dead on saturday june sixth now the prosecutor says he was killed on wednesday the third if so that would be convenient for the prosecution because that is a date when my client spoke harsh words about mr nolan the evidence will show and it is in fact undisputed that evan had too many drinks that night at a bar a few blocks from here called the old town traven there he learned that the deceased had tried to implicate him in the murders of two iraqi citizens tara wheatley evans girlfriend will tell you that drunk and in a rage he told her that he was going to go to mr nolans house and kill him and in fact evan has never denied that he went to mr nolans house that night and that the two men fought so the prosecution says and wishes you to conclude that thats the night the deceased was killed but as the saying goes wishing dont make it so there is no evidence that mr nolan was killed on wednesday as opposed to thursday as opposed to friday and lets take the two motives that according to the prosecution caused evan scholler to commit murder first jealousy ms wheatley will testify that on the evening of june third she came to find evan at the old town traven she invited him to come back to her apartment for the night she told him that she had stopped seeing mr nolan and that she was in love with him as though taken by an apparition washburn stopped in his tracks spread his palms to the jurors now its been a few years since ive experienced some of the finer emotions such as young love but if my memory serves when a woman tells you shes dropped another boyfriend in your favor thats when jealousys much more likely to go away than to make you want to go and duke it out with your rival this last witticism produced a gratifying hum from the gallery several of the jurors broke smiles as well feeding off those vibes washburn went on now anger the evidence will indeed show that evan was angryangry enough to drive to mr nolans house and engage him in a fistfight he was angry the evidence will show because he believed he was being framed for a murder he didnt commit thats a good reason to be angry washburn added it might make any of you angry your honor objection washburn turned and took the opportunity to glance out at the gallery always a reasonable litmus for how he was doing nobody snoring yet anyway he produced his patented halfbow acknowledging the objection and turned back to the jury box without even waiting for the judge to rule ill withdraw that last comment your honor he said and continued why you may ask did my client illegally let himself into his rivals house he had come to believe that mr nolan was in fact the killer of ibrahim and shatha khalil he will testify that he accompanied mr nolan on a killanddestroy mission in iraq that featured the same type of fragmentation grenades as were used in the khalil murders this might have been an error in judgment but it was not a prelude to murder had he intended to kill mr nolan he could have simply waited in his home and done it instead of gathering evidence against him to send to the authorities these are all points that the prosecution has presented to you as facts and they simply are not did my client hate ron nolan yes he did was evan scholler struggling to recover from the physical injury and mental anguish he sustained as a result of fighting for his country in iraq yes he was as a result of the pain both physical and mental did he sometimes drink too much during the months of his recovery yes he did and as a result of the combination of these things did he display bad judgment without a doubt he did misuse his authority as a policeman to keep track of ron nolans whereabouts he did break into ron nolans house in the belief that ron nolan had a hand in the deaths of the khalils he did give way to despair and alcohol and anger and threaten ron nolan he did go to ron nolans house and fight with him on the night of june third he did all of these things and has freely admitted doing all of these things but these are not the things for which he is on trial ladies and gentlemen of the jury at the close of all of the evidence you will find that what evan scholler did not do was kill ron nolan that is something the evidence does not show and when at the close of the evidence you can see that this has not been proved against my client you will be obliged by your conscience and by the laws of this state to find him not guilty after the opening statements they got right down to it as mills called her first witness the medical examiner dr lloyd barnsdale had been in his position for fifteen years dry as dust pale as the corpses in his lab the bespeckled and weakchinned coroner wore what was left of his graying dirty blond hair in a combover today though the warm indian summer days of september continued outside he wore a cardigan sweater over a plain white shirt and a snapon bowtie mills waited impatiently for the me to be sworn in the confidence shed felt in the morning when shed finished with her opening statement had pretty much dissipated under the amiable onslaught of washburns monologue the truth was that she had her work cut out for her it would never do to become complacent washburn would eat her alive if she gave him any opportunity at all dr barnsdale you did the autopsy on ron nolan did you not i did would you please tell the court your ruling as to the cause of death certainly death was caused by a gunshot wound fired at close range into the head barnsdale had of course been a witness a hundred times before this did not necessarily make him a good witness he spoke with a wispiness that was very much of a piece with his looks mills from halfway across the room found herself straining to hear him she saw that the jurors had to a person come forward in their chairs it did not help that outside the building road construction continued unabated on redwood citys neverending downtown beautification project the noise of the heavy equipment was nearly as loud as the buildings airconditioning mills backed up a couple of steps to just beyond the last juror in the box if she could hear the witness so could all the jurors she raised her own voice hoping to lead by example doctor she asked were there other marks or injuries to the body yes there were multiple signs of bluntforce and sharpforce traumacontusions bruises and lacerations on the torso the groin and the face approximately how many separate injuries were inflicted on the victim i counted twentyeight separate injuries and did each of these appear to be a separate application of force there were a couple that might have been the result of a single blow for example the same blow with an instrument could have hit the victim on the forearm and the head on the other hand from the size and irregular features of some of the injury sites it appeared that some bruises might have resulted from multiple blows landing in approximately the same place on the body i would have to say the man was hit at least two dozen times mills went back to her table and brought forward a large piece of cardboard on which shed taped some color photographs from the autopsy and had it entered into evidence as peoples two since the autopsy report was peoples one when they had gotten to it judge tollson had handpicked the six autopsy photos that he was going to allow the jury to see mills considered his choice a partial victory for herselfwhoever had done this to another human being barely deserved to be called one himself even without the head wound the damage to nolans body was severe doctor mills began using the photographs to illustrate your testimony can you characterize these injuries more particularly well yes barnsdale whispered as we can see in photograph a there were quite a few injuries that either raised bruises or cut the skin or both although the gunshot wound particularly the exit wound in the back of the head no doubt obliterated some of these there still remained a profusion of them particularly on the head using the laser pointer she walked him through the other five photographs do you know what caused these bruises and contusions not specifically it was my finding that there appeared to be more than one type of bruise caused by different objects some blunt and some less so doctor were you given any implement or implements in an effort to determine whether they might have caused the injuries you observed yes i was given a fireplace poker and a pair of brass knuckles from the evidence locker of the redwood city police department two more exhibits marked and presented to the doctor yes he said these are the items i compared what was your conclusion doctor several contusions particularly on the jawline appear to be the result of contact with the brass knuckles these particular knuckles have a piece or fragment missing from one edge you can clearly see the pattern injury in several locations that match this implement further in a general sense the damage inflicted at those injury sites is consistent with what one might expect from being struck with this sort of an object and what damage is that they both cut and bruise they leave a distinctive imprint were there a lot of these brass knuckle contusions distinctly there were three perhaps five i could not rule them out as having been used to cause other injuries but there was not enough detail to tell you definitively that this was the weapon used what about the poker i could only find one injury across the forearm that definitively appeared consistent with the poker or something very like it but all of the injuries to the top and side of the head were consistent with a blow from a hard cylindrical object that could have been this poker further i understand from the lab that the victims blood and tissue was removed from the poker which also supports the suggestion that this was the weapon used as to the injuries youve discussed so far were they consistent with having been inflicted with a mans fist no i dont think so the injuries ive attributed to the poker and brass knuckles were far too extensive typically to have resulted from a simple blow from the fist but that leaves doctor does it not many other bruises on mr nolans body yes it does could they have been inflicted by a mans fists well yes they could although they are very nonspecific and might have been inflicted by any blunt object including a glancing blow by the poker or brass knuckles or even by the impact of mr nolan having hit the ground or a table or anything else as a result of one of the other blows doctor could you describe the gunshot wound in any greater detail yes it was what is called a close contact wound meaning the gun was fired right up against the skin of the forehead doctor are you able to tell us the order in which the injuries were inflicted not really logically it would seem likely the gunshot wound would have to be last because it would have been immediately lethal as to the blunt force trauma it appeared that some had actually started to heal slightly and therefore might have been inflicted before some of the others which showed less signs of healing but the body heals more or less quickly at different times and at different places on the body this isnt a very reliable way to sequence injuries all i can say is that all of these injuries were perimortem meaning that they were inflicted around the time of death thank you doctor no further questions mills apparently shaken by the photos and the testimony in spite of herself had gone nearly as pale as the medical examiner she turned back to the defense table your witness washburn had the impression that mills had cut her questions short because she was getting sick beyond that hed barely heard the testimony of the witness from back where he sat and he doubted that the jurors intent on the photographs had heard too much of it either he normally didnt like to spend too much time with this more or less pro forma witness the medical examiner since typically all his testimony served to do was prove that a murder had been committed and that wasnt at issue here but this time he thought he might pry a nugget loose from this normally unpromising vein and if he was going to go to that trouble he wanted the jury to hear what the man had to say so when he got to the middle of the room he pitched his own volume down to the nearly inaudible doctor he said can you tell how old a bruise is im sorry the witness replied cupping his ear i didnt hear the question washburn barely heard the response but came back with his question just a few decibels louder than the first time barnsdale leaned forward his face scrunched in concentration can i what he asked im sorry behind washburn the gallery was getting restive tollson brought his gavel down one time firmly i want it quiet in this courtroom he brought his focus back inside the guardrail that separated the gallery from the bullpen of the court and i need you two gentlemen both to speak up is that clear yes your honor washburn straightened up and nearly shouted shaking his headthis was rank theatrics circus behaviortollson looked down at the witness doctor barnsdale looked around and up at him sir a whisper louder please the jury needs to hear you back to washburn go ahead counselor thank you your honor doctor a smile meant they were friends youve talked about these bruises on the body of the victim that weve seen now in these photographs my question is can you tell the age of a bruise as i just said only within very broad limits please humor me doctor explain in some detail how you can tell that one bruise is older than another clearing his throat barnsdale complied yes certainly bruises begin healing as soon as they are made so the degree of healing diminishing of swelling thickness and solidity of scabbing color and so on can tell you roughly how long it is since the bruise was sustained we all know that some people bruise more easily than others and its also true that the same person might bruise more easily on a different part of his body at a different time in his life or depending on his general health but all things being equal we can get some idea from the bruises themselves tollson from the bench intoned louder please washburn went on and these bruises to the victim were they all the same age so to speak no no what was the greatest difference you observed between them impossible to say impossible doctor you cant give us any information are you telling me one of these bruises could have been inflicted on mr nolan when he was five years old and another a few minutes before his death and there would be no difference a small round of laughter from the gallery well no of course not then could some of these injuries been inflicted a month before mr nolans death no a week before some hesitation i doubt that seriously but it could have been a week before i doubt it well certainly doctor some of the injuries could have been inflicted three or four days before mr nolans death thats true isnt it washburn knew he had the doctor and knew what the answer had to be well id have to say yes and doctor did you make any effort at the time specifically to note in your autopsy the age of the various bruises i didnt record a specific analysis of that for each bruise why not it seemed irrelevant at the time it certainly was irrelevant to the cause of death because none of these blows killed him isnt that right doctor mr nolan died from the gunshot wound whenever that was inflicted true yes thank you doctor no further questions next up was shondra delahassau a forensics sergeant with the police department a dark ebony woman in her early thirties with her hair in cornrows projecting competence and confidence she couldnt have been more of a contrast to dr barnsdale we got the call on a saturday afternoon after the groundskeeper who was blowing leaves off the back patio saw evidence of a fight and what looked to be splashes of blood in the living room and what happened next mills asked well the first responders to arrive were a patrol team who entered the townhouse to see if there were injured persons or suspects still on the premises they found only a dead body and left without disturbing anything once the house was cleared they waited out front for other officers my unit which is crime scene investigation got there about the same time as lieutenant spinoza who had obtained a search warrant at around fourthirty and what did you find inside first of course the blood a lot of blood in the rug and on the walls and so on did your unit take samples of this blood for analysis sergeant yes we took samples from every location for testing in the lab mills spoke to the judge your honor i believe the defense is prepared to stipulate that dna testing matched blood samples from the premises to either the defendant or ron nolan this was bad news and a buzz arose in the gallery but washburn had been only too happy to enter the stipulation after mills had told him that the lab tech who had actually done the dna testing was out on maternity leave it wasnt to his advantage anyway to have a half day of scientific evidence putting evans blood and nolans blood all over nolans home thank you sergeant mills said now back to the townhouse itself what else did you find well furniture had been knocked over in the living room and in the office we found a fireplace poker that was stained with the victims blood on the floor in the office then we discovered the victims body on the floor in the bedroom there was a ninemillimeter beretta semiautomatic on the bed what did you do next while lieutenant spinoza called the medical examiners office i supervised while members of my unit started taking photographs of the scene collecting blood hair and fiber samples and fingerprints if any were available my usual drill at a murder scene mills duly marked and had her identify almost two dozen samples with the trace evidence from nolans place when theyd finished mills pulled the gun out of a protective firearms box and gave it to the bailiff to clear demonstrating on the record that it was unloaded and safe to handle now sergeant did you personally dust the gun for fingerprints i did did you find any usable latents yes and were you able to identify whose fingerprints were found on the gun we did it held the fingerprints of mr nolan as well as those of the defendant mr scholler again a rush of comment swirled across the gallery mills let it go on for a satisfying moment before she turned to washburn and gave him the witness washburn had always believed that there were basically only two ways to defend against a murder charge the first was to present an affirmative defense case that on its own merits created either mitigation or reasonable doubt this former approach had been washburns stockintrade over the years and hed done exceedingly well with it he would listen to all the prosecutions facts and theories and then introduce his own defense case which might include selfdefense diminished capacity temporary insanity or any other of the many psychiatric defenses including ptsd in san francisco over time these became pretty much slam dunks but even in san mateo county such a strong affirmative defense would often convince a jury to convict only of a lesser charge washburn believed this was because people basically wanted to believe in the goodness of their fellow man even if they had done something truly heinous if there was a semiplausible reason that theyd been driven to it by events outside of their control jurors tended to give them a break the second way to win was in washburns experience both far more difficult and far less effective this was the reactive defense which challenged every fact and assertion made by the prosecution naturally good defense attorneys also did this automatically even when they had a strong affirmative case but debunking a carefully built prosecution was never an easy task in most cases of course this was because the defendant was guilty but beyond that it was a huge hurdle for most jurors to disbelieve government testimony and to doubt the sworn testimony of authority figures such as doctors forensics experts and the police when tollson had taken ptsd away from him washburn knew he was stuck with a reactive defense and this was what had filled him with such a sense of dread now here he was with his second witness on his first daya woman whom he normally would have dismissed without a crossexamination because she had nothing of substance that would help his caseand he was rising to question her grasping at straws just to keep up the charade that he was putting on an enthusiastic even passionate defense sergeant delahassau he began youve testified that you tested mr nolans townhome for fingerprints blood hairs and fibers isnt that so your usual drill i believe you called it yes thats right and you discovered matches with mr schollers blood and fingerprints yes what about his hair the gallery let out what seemed to washburn to be a collective chuckle yes we found samples of his hair too did you find any other hair besides mr nolans and mr schollers yes we found traces of hair from at least three other individuals can you tell if that hair was from a male or female under some circumstances dna can determine that you need a follicle and to your knowledge did anyone run dna tests on these hair samples for the first time delahassaus face clouded she threw a troubled look over to mills then came back to washburn uh no sir why not another hesitation well we had no other suspects with which to match samples but these hair samples surely indicated that someone else had been in mr nolans townhouse isnt that true well yes but they could have been years old or but bottom line sergeant you do not know if the three hair samples found in the victims home came from men or from women do you no unsure of what if anything hed just proven washburn decided hed take his small victory now and move on to his other minuscule point sergeant he asked did you recover the bullet that had killed mr nolan letting out a sigh of relief that the other line of questioning had ended delahassau reverted to her confident self yes it was embedded in the floor directly under the exit wound in his head so he was shot while he was already on the ground that appeared to be the case yes and did you run a ballistics test on the beretta no the bullet was deformed too much for that washburn brought his hand up to his mouth in an apparently genuine show of perplexity sergeant he asked with an exaggerated slowness are you telling me that you do not know for an absolute certainty that the bullet that killed mr nolan came from the weapon that had my clients fingerprints on it no sir but thank you sergeant thats all hed barely gotten the words out when mills was on her feet redirect your honor tollson waved her forward sergeant she began before shed even reached her place what was the caliber of the bullet that killed mr nolan nine millimeter and what was the caliber of the recovered weapon nine millimeter and was the recovered weapon a revolver or a semiautomatic it was a semiautomatic now sergeant when a ninemillimeter weapon is fired what happens to the casingthe brass jacket behind the actual bullet that holds the gunpowder that propels the blast it gets ejected you mean it pops out of the gun yes and did you find a casing for a ninemillimeter round in mr nolans bedroom yes it was among the sheets on the bed were you able to match that casing to the recovered beretta yes so there was one ninemillimeter bullet and no others recovered from the scene one ninemillimeter casing and no others recovered from the scene and although the bullet itself was not capable of comparison the only casing at the scene that could have contained that bullet was fired by the ninemillimeter beretta with the defendants fingerprints on it yes thank you when they all got back to their tables after a short afternoon recess washburn noticed that mills seemed to be losing her sense of humor as the day wore on but whether mills was enjoying it or not she was putting on the kind of straightforward linear case that juries tended to like her next witness was evans direct superior in the police department lieutenant lochland who alarmed at schollers absence from work had found him in his apartment drunk and covered in blood and eventually placed him under arrest lieutenant she began defendant was under your direct supervision while he worked with the police department isnt that so but washburn and evan had talked about this coming testimony on the break and the old lawyer was on his feet before shed finished her question objection relevance three fiftytwo your honor tollson turned a questioning look down to mills counselor foundational your honor she said thats fairly broad can you be more specific goes to defendants state of mind leading up to the act also foundational to the breakin at mr nolans the judge in what washburn was beginning to recognize as something of a pattern pulled his glasses off to ponder for a minute before he could put them back on and render his decision washburn said your honor if you will id like to request a sidebar if mills was getting tired or losing her chops due to low blood sugar if this was her afternoon tendencyand her body language made it appear to bewashburn wouldnt hesitate to use that against her a shorter pause this time until tollson nodded very well counsel may approach when the two attorneys had gotten in front of the bench tollson peered over it whats the problem everett he said your honor theres no possible relevance to lieutenant lochlands relationship to my client the only thing this will get the people is negative character stuff that evan was angry that he lied to his superiors when he broke into nolans place that he disobeyed orders maybe got drunk on duty theres nothing possibly relevant there and even if it is its far more prejudicial than probative and opens up a whole number of cans of worms ms whelanmiille clearly washburns attack on this point had blindsided her but she wasnt about to give up any ground without some kind of a fight the lieutenants a hostile witness your honor you think he wants to be up here testifying against another cop and one that worked for him hes not going to say anything bad about evans character at worst hell say he was mixed up and still recovering from the wounds in iraq and that will if anything incite sympathy from the jury this is all part of mr washburns case anyway how can he want to put it in through his own witnesses and keep it out with mine if it was all that sympathetic tollson said i doubt if mr washburn would object to the testimony and in that case why do you want it the judge asked when mills couldnt come up with an answer in the next ten seconds tollson stepped back in lets move on shall we hows that sound washburn inclined his head thank you your honor back at the defense table he pulled his yellow legal pad over in front of him and drew a happy face that he showed to his client under his hand at the same time mills tried to pick up with her witness lieutenant it was you who arrested defendant was it not yeah that was me can you tell the jury the specifics sure he turned to face the panel and began in a conversational tone lieutenant spinozahes the head of the homicide detailcalled me at home as a courtesy on that saturday to tell me he was worried about patrolman scholler hed been called on the ron nolan homicide and remembered that patrolman scholler had looked up that name on the police computer in the past few days spinoza wondered if id heard from him and i told him i hadnt patrolman scholler hadnt been into work on thursday or friday so when i got spinozas call i was a little worried myself i thought the best bet would be to go check out his apartment so i drove up therehe lived in one of those units along edgewood road all the blinds in the windows were pulled down so there was no seeing in i knocked and called out his name and nobody answered but i heard some movement inside like something some object falling over now im starting to think somethings wrong i get out my cell phone and call his number and the phone inside starts ringing and i started pounding on the door calling for him washburn could have objected to this narrative but again knew it was coming in and was just as happy to get through it as quickly as possible and finally i hear yeah one minute and a few seconds later patrolman scholler opens the door just like that then i take a look at him and hes all beat up so i ask him what happened but he didnt seem to understand the question so then i asked him if he knew about a guy named ron nolan that hed been killed lochland stopped sat back clasped his hands in his lap but mills wouldnt have called him up if he didnt have something she needed so she asked and did he have any reaction to that lieutenant yes maam he swore he swore what exactly did he say lieutenant washburn knew the answer to this question and came halfway out of his chair as he objected and much to the displeasure of both mills and tollson requested another sidebar when both attorneys were again in front of the judge mills started right in your honor this is a frivolous objection if weve ever heard one mr washburn knows what defendants words were upon learning about mr nolans death and the jury needs to hear them washburn shot back at her there is no need to subject the jury to vulgarity your honor the defense will stipulate that evan used language that some might find offensive in spite of the fact that even that admission might taint him in the eyes of some of the jury members oh please mills rolled her eyes the mans on trial for murder your honor hes broken into the victims house hes admitted to beating him with brass knuckles fighting him with brass knuckles washburn replied calmly the evidence supports a fight between two professional warriors not a beating this is hairsplitting of the most obvious kind your honor and in fact on reflection i wonder if mr washburn didnt help prepare lieutenant lochland in his testimony so that he would set up this objection rather than simply repeat defendants words which hed always used with me in my preparation your honor washburns face reflected his sadness that his opponent had stooped so low as to accuse him of coaching her witness although of course he had done just that if he could somehow keep evans unfortunate choice of words uttered in an alcoholic stupor out of the record it would be a significant victory i strenuously object to counsels intimation that i may have acted unethically im not saying that your honor im saying that the jury knows that defendant did all these other pretty questionable things plus he lied to his boss and his locksmith friend the fact that he used a mild swear word isnt likely to stain his reputation at this point tollson put his glasses back on and scowled down through them i agree counselor the witness can answer the question your honor washburn said allowing a witness to use vulgarity on the stand is a slippery slope that counselor i dont believewere not talking about the fword the cword or the nword are we no your honor mills said we cant know that yet your honor the witness hasnt answered yet but this last comment finally got under tollsons skin dont toy with me counselor ive made my ruling stop wasting the courts time of course your honor apologies tollson ignored him ms whelanmiille he said you may proceed so after all that mills was back at her place ten feet in front of the witness lieutenant would you please tell the jury defendants exact words when you asked if he knew a ron nolan and that he had been killed yes maam frustrated that he wasnt going to be able to keep it out lochland put the best face he could on it he turned toward the panel and spoke directly to them he said i kicked his ass and i said jesus evan hes dead and he said goddamned right mills dared a glance over to washburn and certainly knew that she risked incurring the judges wrath as she nodded directing the words as much to her opponent as to the jury goddamned right she said thank you lieutenant no further questions your witness mr washburn fresh as a teenage boy washburn all but hopped up and over to his place to begin his crossexamination lieutenant lochland after patrolman scholler reacted to the news what did he do next the decision to refer to evan by his police rank with this witness was of course intentional he kind of folded himself down to a sitting position then lay back all the way on the floor yes was he resisting arrest no sir his eyes were closed i rolled him over and put handcuffs on him and he still didnt wake up so he was asleep then asleep maybe but also drunk we tested him at the station and his blood alcohol was point two four and what lieutenant is the blood alcohol level at which a person is considered legally drunk in california point oh eight so patrolman scholler was at something like three times the legal limit for driving i dont know the math but he certainly was very drunk incoherently drunk mills jumped all over the question objection conclusion sustained washburn took a short beat came at it another way did evan respond immediately to your question about what had happened to him no at his apartment did he ever call you by name no was his speech slurred yes and did you have to repeat your questions before he answered yes now lieutenant lochland he never said he killed ron nolan did he no he did not the only thing he said was that he kicked nolans ass correct right and to repeat that colorful phrase evan scholler looked like hed gotten his ass kicked as well didnt he yes he was seriously beat up now he said something else washburn continued after he said hed kicked mr nolans ass didnt he he said goddamned right before he said that you said that ron nolan was dead correct but you have no way of knowing whether he understood you when you said that do you well no not for sure he was drunk beat up and more than a little incoherent correct yes so to repeat my question do you have any way of knowing whether he heard or understood you when you told him that ron nolan was dead he was pretty out of it i cant honestly tell you that he understood anything that was going on did patrolman scholler say anything else while you were transporting him to the police station nothing coherent just gibberish your honor now mills was on her feet truly enraged sidebar please clearly tempers all around were fairly raw by this time tollson gave the request a full thirty seconds before muttering he nodded and waved the two attorneys forward for their third sidebar of the afternoon when they got to the front tollson was waiting pointing a finger at them as though he were a schoolteacher im getting more than a little tired of this bickering counselors this is not the way we do a trial but mills fire in her eyes came right back at him id prefer we didnt have these issues either but mr washburns conduct here is unconscionable you just sustained my objection about the word incoherent and now the witness gets it in barely disguised in such a way that his answer was not conclusory as to my clients mental state your honor that was i believe the objection lieutenant lochland is certainly qualified to call gibberish incoherent but mills wasnt giving up in a restrained voice she said your honor obviously if defendant was incoherent then his earlier words dont have nearly the same power washburn had a great deal of experience in situations like this one the temptation was to begin responding directly to your opponent and this invariably infuriated judges so he kept his eyes on tollson his voice modulated and relaxed that is of course more or less my intention in pursuing this line of questioning your honor the distinction between an incoherent epithet and an incriminating answer to a question though perhaps too subtle for my opponent to grasp is hugely significant all right thats enough of that both of you im going to allow the question and the answer to stand ms whelanmiille you of course may redirect he pointed down at them once again i will not be entertaining any more sidebar requests today this witness has been up here for nearly an hour and twothirds of that time weve been up here arguing about four or five words its got to stop if you have objections raise them in the usual way and ill rule as best i can but thats the end of this quibbling nonsense understood both of you washburn nodded genially yes your honor mills stood flatfooted apparently still too angry to talk tollson brought his hard gaze to rest on her counselor clear at last she got the words out yes your honor lochland was still on the stand having established that on the saturday of his arrest evan had been a fount of incoherent and meaningless babble washburn could be forgiven for feeling that things were going his way after he passed around to the jury the booking photo defense exhibit a in which a completely disheveled evan stared blankly at the camera further establishing his incoherence washburn in his courtliest manner half turned to mills redirect mills looked up at the clock which read four fortyfive she could probably get in a question or two about whether or not schollers goddamned right had sounded coherent or not to the lieutenant but in the end she decided that this would only serve to underscore washburns thrustthat nothing evan said that day meant much of anything even goddamned right which she had worked so hard to get in it was what hed said and she had no doubt what it had meantit was tantamount to an admission that hed killed nolan and washburn knew it but whether or not the jurors would come to see it that way was anyones guess she was going to have to trust that they would use their common sense all she wanted at the moment was to put this day behind her shed get another hack at washburn tomorrow and she had the cardsevan scholler was guilty and the jury was going to see it and that was all there was to it raising her eyes to the judge she felt the urge to smile begin at the corners of her mouth she looked over to the jury to washburn back up to the judge no questions she said tollson brought down his gavel courts adjourned until ninethirty tomorrow morning fred spinoza was a far cry from being a hostile prosecution witness in fact he felt seriously abused that someone who worked for his department played on his bowling team got his help finding the address of the house he was planning to break into where he would then commit murder and had even come to his own home and played the war hero with his children every time spinoza thought about it it roiled his guts he believed that there was a special section in hell reserved for someone who could have done that to his kids never mind what evan scholler did to ron nolan resplendent in his dark blue uniform spinoza settled himself into the chair hard by the judges platform hed put in a lot of time on the witness stand in his career and rarely had he looked forward to the experience more than today now here came mary patricia whelanmiille up from her table in the packed courtroom to a space about midway between him and the jury mills and he had shared drinks on several occasions once theyd gotten to know each other over this case there had been a short time in the first weeks when he thought she might be coming on to him but though he found her quite attractive he loved leesa and had made that clear enough to mills that if she was in fact trolling she chose to back off but some chemistry he knew still sparked between them he knew that this would play well for a juryit was just another one of those intangibles that sometimes came into play during a trial a major peoples witness and an assistant da working in understated sync could bring a sense of rightness of unassailable conviction to a prosecution case mills seemed rested and confident as she nodded to the jurors then smiled at her witness as though she meant it lieutenant spinoza what is your position with the police department im the head of the homicide detail after she went over the details of his service she got down to it defendant was a patrolman was he not lieutenant yes hed been a patrolman working a regular beat before he went overseas and when he came back he went back to his former position how was it then that you came to know him spinoza shot half a grin at the jury then shrugged what was he going to do it was the truth he was on my bowling team can you tell the court please lieutenant about the first time you ran across a connection between defendant and the victim in this case ron nolan yes i was in the office on a weekend the khalil murders had just taken place so i was working overtime i happened to run across the defendant at one of the computers and i asked him what he was doing he told me he was trying to locate the address of a drug dealer did you ask him the name of that drug dealer yes he told me it was ron nolan is that against department policy well its a gray area of course police are not allowed to use computers for personal reasons he could use the computer to follow up on a narcotics tip although strictly speaking he should have referred the whole thing to vice how about using the computer to locate a romantic rival that would not only be against policy but completely illegal if he were caught doing that he could expect to be fired and probably prosecuted so defendants use of the computer in this case was illegal as it turns out yes and yet you helped him in his prep work with mills they had both acknowledged that this would be an uncomfortable moment that they needed to address headon of course i didnt know the real reason he was using the computer at that time but yes he told me he was tracking a drug dealer and i believed him so in what way did you assist him spinoza looked at the jury spoke directly to them well i knew that hed have to know how to work the system if he ever did need to find an address from a license plate i suppose you could say i viewed it as more or less a casual thing a training opportunity did defendant tell you why he wanted to find mr nolans address yes but i thought his reasoni thought he was making a joke this was an important clarification that mills had wanted him to make sure he got in since it served to underscore both evan schollers arrogance and his premeditation nevertheless what was the reason he gave you he said he wanted to hunt down mr nolan and kill him a shimmer of reaction echoed through the courtroom serious enough that tollson dropped his gavel a couple of times mills let the murmur die down and then resumed her questioning did defendant mention this killing of his rival any other times yes and where was that spinoza turned in the witness chair to face the jury again at my house after work was this a usual occurrence a patrolman coming to your home outside of work hours no it was decidedly unusual so what happened well we got ourselves some coffee and went outside and since it was something wed joked about before i asked him if hed killed his dope dealer yet and what was his answer to that he said he hadnt because mr nolan was out of town and yet you still considered this a joke maybe not a funny joke but its the way we cops often talk to each other it still never in a million years occurred to me that he was actually planning washburn was on his feet not letting him finish objection not missing a beat tollson nodded sustained confine your answers to the questions please lieutenant go ahead counsel mills nodded satisfied and apparently ready to begin the next line of questioning theyd rehearsed which was the aftermath of the murder itself the fbis involvement and schollers arrest but then suddenly she paused threw a last glance at the jury and must have seen something she liked because her next words were thank you lieutenant and then to washburn your witness spinoza knew washburn well as head of homicide in redwood city hed sparred with the veteran attorney many times before and he was particularly looking forward to it today confident that even a master like washburn wouldnt be able to put a different spin on the events about which hed just testified spinoza was settling himself in getting psyched for a crossexamination he thought hed actually enjoy when washburn lifted his head shook it and said to tollson i have no questions for this witness special agent riggio mills began with the next witness how did the fbi get involved in the khalil case marcia riggio had short cropped dark hair she wore a navyblue suit that would not have looked out of place on a man but the severe look was mitigated by a tan opennecked blouse of some soft and shimmery material as well as by a plain gold chain necklace she sat upright in the witness chair her hands folded in her lap and spoke with a formal and flat inflection many witnesses at the scene reported hearing an explosion which the arson inspectors concluded was consistent both with the damage to the bedroom and with the cause of the ensuing fire mr khalil and his wife were both naturalized citizens from iraq and so because of a possible terrorist angle local officials deemed it prudent to contact homeland security the bureau of alcohol tobaccco and firearms and the federal bureau of investigation subsequently analysis of the shrapnel from the explosion revealed that the blast was caused by a device called a fragmentation grenade probably of domestic manufacture the possession of which is against federal law effectively the fbi took jurisdiction of this case although we of course shared our findings with local police and what were your findings very little in the first few days besides the fragmentation grenade we discovered that both victims had been shot before the explosion with ninemillimeter caliber bullets which when we found them were too badly formed for comparison to a firearm we interviewed several family members of course in the wake of the attack and were beginning to process that information when my partner jacob freed and i received an envelope in the mail that contained a computer diskette with a photograph file that focused our attention in a different direction among the pictures in that file were photographs of the khalils home taken from several angles with a handwritten note that the pictures had been downloaded from a computer belonging to a mr ron nolan subsequently mr freed obtained mr nolans telephone number and left him a message that we would like to have a discussion with him on a matter that might involve national security there was no mention of the khalils or of the photograph did you in fact interview mr nolan yes what did he tell you washburn was on his feet objection hearsay tollson looked at mills counsel youve already ruled on this your honor mills said when mr nolans accusations to the fbi are repeated to mr scholler they give mr scholler yet another motive to kill him tollson looked over to washburn shes right counsel we did talk about this and its coming in objection overruled she went on in the same vein meticulous as to every detail and nuance nolans call to the fbi his theory that his romantic rival the defendant might have broken into his house his discovery of the frag grenades and mm beretta weapon in his closet the record of computer usage while hed been away then following up on nolans theory the fbis discovery a day later of the defendants fingerprints on the computer diskette finally she came to an end trying to get the timeline correct do you recall the day or date that you made the discovery about defendants fingerprints on the diskette yes both it was thursday june fourth mills waited for more of a reply until she realized that special agent riggio had answered her question and didnt need to deliver a speech about it and after you had that information did you try to contact defendant yes we did we attempted to reach him through his job as a police officer in redwood city but he had not come into work that morning had he called in sick no all right where did you try next we called him at his home but there was no answer there so we left a message on his answering machine did he ever answer that message no he did not were you planning to place defendant under arrest at that time no at that time we wanted to question him did you stake out his apartment no we had no reason to suspect that he was avoiding us we thought it likely that he would either call us or we would otherwise locate him in a day or so did you attempt to locate mr nolan during this time no he said he would call us if he got any more information beyond that we had no reason to try and contact him during this period so what did you do next we ran the fingerprints wed picked up in mr nolans townhouse and determined that he had been correct the defendant had been in his house further the defendants prints were on the beretta that was in mr nolans backpack did you find his prints on the fragmentation grenades no they have a rough surface and did not contain usable fingerprints but the beretta with defendants prints was in the backpack with the fragmentation grenades was it not yes and could you tell if that gun had been fired recently we could only say that it had not been fired after its last cleaning but we have no way to tell when it had last been cleaned mills in a rhythm kept it going was the gun loaded yes there was a full magazine and a round in the chamber mills knew she had covered a lot of ground with riggio who was in many ways the ideal witness an uninflected justthefactsmaam kind of presence but she still had a ways to go special agent riggio how did you discover that mr nolan had been killed spinoza and riggio ate up the whole morning and court didnt resume until nearly two oclock in the afternoon washburn whod remained silent throughout the lengthy direct showed little of the enthusiasm hed displayed the day before as he slowly rose from his chair and advanced to make his cross special agent riggio he began sonorously youve testified that in the immediate aftermath of the khalils shootings you interviewed several family members what did you talk to them about we had the usual preliminary interviews following this kind of event and what are these interviews comprised of developing knowledge of the relationships between the family members and the deceased as well as business personal political or any other issues that might throw light on the investigation of the crime how many of these interviews did you have mills spoke from behind him objection relevance sustained washburn couldnt entirely camouflage a disappointed grimace the khalils have widespread business interests do they not again objection irrelevant this time washburn replied not at all your honor the people while never charging mr scholler with the murder of the khalils are attempting to insinuate without proof that he was somehow involved in their deaths im wondering if special agent riggio had interviewed anyone among mr khalils vast business interests who had any connection to mr scholler all right overruled you may answer that question to riggio it was all the same unruffled she nodded yes the khalils had widespread business interests just here in this country no overseas as well in iraq according to the children yes but you didnt check that information yourself we were beginning to verify all the information wed gathered when mr nolan was murdered so washburn said the answer is no you didnt check the information about the khalils business interests in iraq isnt that so your honor mills tried again relevance washburn said itll be clear in a second your honor all right but it had better be overruled special agent riggio mr nolan worked for an american security contractor firm in iraq did he not allstrong security now mills was on her feet your honor please weve discussed this before this fishing expedition is going nowhere and the only purpose to eliciting this hearsay is to suggest a connection between mr nolan and the khalils which is unsupported by any evidence washburn knew he could probably get away with at least one outburst per trial he figured this was as good a time as any and whirled around on mills theres a whole lot more evidence of nolans involvement with the khalils murders than of my clients you just dont want the jury to hear anything that doesnt fit your theory bam bam bam mr washburn tollson exploded both of you enough any more of this and somebodys going to get a contempt charge youre to address your remarks to the bench and not to one another tollson stared them down giving equal time to both then glancing at the wall clock he said im calling a tenminute recess so everyone can cool off when washburn resumed his was once again the voice of sweet reason he produced a stack of documents received from the fbi and gave them to riggio on the stand special agent riggio using these business records did you have an opportunity to investigate the fragmentation grenades that you discovered in mr nolans apartment yes and what did you discover these particular grenades were produced in late two thousand twoif you want the stocking and serial numbers ive got them but that wont be necessary go ahead and they were shipped to iraq in the early weeks after the invasion do you know if they were delivered to mr schollers patrol no no you dont know or no they werent they were delivered as part of a consignment to allstrong security in iraq is there any evidence that mr scholler at any time had possession of these grenades or shipped them back by whatever means to the united states no special agent riggio have you any witnesses that reported seeing these grenades in mr schollers possession at any time no even though hed gotten the right answer on the last several questions washburn knew it wasnt much but it was probably all he was going to get he smiled at the witness thank you he said no further questions by the following tuesday afternoon the weather had turned a violent earlyseason storm toppled trees and flooded many of the lowlying streets around the courthouse playing enough havoc with the mornings traffic patterns that court couldnt be called into session until nearly eleven oclock and then only to adjourn almost immediately for an early lunch in the previous two trial days washburn hadnt had much to say to the witnesses mills called the other fbi agent jacob freed provided pretty much the same testimony as his partner marcia riggio washburn hammered a bit at the provenance of the frag grenades again at the lack of real investigation into the lives and motives of possible other suspects in both the khalil and nolan murders after theyd identified evan as their main person of interest but he knew that hed inflicted little if any damage to the prosecutions casethe fact and washburn hated to admit it was that the fbi and spinoza had coordinated very well and had fashioned an evidentiary chain that was pretty damn compelling in the end washburn just wanted to get freed off the stand as quickly as possible although he still took the better part of half a day likewise david saldar the locksmith came to the stand and by far the most nervous and uncomfortable witness to date gave his testimony without any surprises he was talking about an unarguable point in any eventevan scholler had done exactly what saldar was saying hed done hed lied to a friend hed used the police uniform to buttress his credibility hed let himself into a home that was not his it wasnt exactly a highwater mark for the defense but washburn couldnt do anything about that either millss final witness whod taken up most of yesterdaysmondaystime had been tara in spite of clearly conveying to the jury that she was involved with evan she not only reaffirmed the fact that nolan had told her he was concerned and worried about evans breakin but she also provided the crucial testimony of the overt threat to nolans life that evan had made at the old town traven coming from a woman who so obviously did not want to hurt the defendant taras testimony seemed to resonate with the jury in an especially powerful way and washburn try as he might couldnt get a handle on what he could crossexamine her aboutthat she hadnt believed nolans assertion about evan planting the weapons in his house that evan hadnt really meant what hed said about killing his rival neither of those opinions would be admissible since thats all they would have beenthe opinions of a woman the jury would feel who would certainly lie if lying would help her lovers defense now the prosecution had rested and washburn would get his chance to present an affirmative defense but in the absence of a client who could even deny that hed committed the crime in the absence of an alternative suspect and with the plethora of motive and opportunity weighing in against evan he knew that this might be the legal challenge of his entire career he didnt have much and what he did have was dubious at best the first order of business was to try to get the jury to the extent it was going to be possible at all into evans camp reminding himself that he only needed one juror he settled on a woman in the back row named maggie ellersby who was about the same age and pretty much had the same suburbanhousewife look as evans mother eileen more than that during jury selection shed revealed that she had two sons of her own that she was opposed to the war in iraq although she supported the troops there she might have a liberal streak which in turn might extend to perceiving evan as some kind of a victim of something and hence not completely culpable beyond that she had been married to the same man for thirty years and so might in her heart be rooting for tara and evan to put this problem behind them and have a life together all of this of course was extremely nebulous but it gave washburn hope to have a litmus juror to whom he could target his defense your honor washburn said as a fresh squall of rain tattooed the courtrooms windows the defense calls anthony onofrio mr onofrio you knew the defendant evan scholler in iraq did you not washburn wanted onofrio for a variety of reasons not the least of which because he exuded such an appealing regular guy quality this was an inherently friendly man who worked with his crew on californias roads he had some but not too much education goodlooking in a casual way he might be able to bring mrs ellersby for example along in his regard for evan scholler yes i did he was my squadron leader over the next hour washburn led onofrio over the same ground theyd covered during the ptsd hearing before jury selection mills objected to the same things shed objected to at that timethat onofrio wasnt even in the us at the time of the murder and therefore his testimony couldnt possibly be relevantbut washburn argued again that onofrios testimony was foundational to evans head injuries which so far hadnt even made it into the record even without mention of ptsd those head injuries were certainly relevant to his blackouts and these in turn washburn argued and tollson agreed could be a core issue for the defense the gallery grew hushed as onofrio began describing the firefight at masbah concluding with the observation we could have gotten out but two of our men had already been hit and evan wasnt going to leave without them so what did he do he led a couple of the other guys up to the first humvee and pulled out the driver of that vehicle then carried him back to our car then they went back for the gunner and was lieutenant scholler under fire at this time a lot of fire sir it was pretty hot coming from all over all right having established evans bravery as well as his concern for his men washburn let onofrio get to the end of the masbah story without further interruption washburn was happy to see that mrs ellersby needed to dab at her eyes with a kleenex several times during the recitation when onofrio finished evan bleeding profusely from the head and surrounded by his dead comrades several other jurors were having similar reactions washburn stood still for several seconds moved as the jurors had been by the story then he turned the witness over to the prosecution the last time mills had crossexamined onofrio during the hearing on ptsd shed hit pay dirt with questions regarding evans alcohol use in the war zone accordingly she wasted no time broaching the topic again as soon as she was in front of the witness mr onofrio did you personally witness defendant drinking alcohol in iraq but this time washburn was ready for her objection irrelevant sustained mills was halfway back to repeating her question when she stopped herself in almost a doubletake fashion your honor she said with respect mr washburn made a similar objection during our fourohtwo hearing in this matter and at that time you overruled him tollson removed his glasses leaned over the bench yes i did counselor at that time the question of defendants alcohol use or not was germane to the issues involved in that hearing here unless you can show me that defendants alcohol use or not in iraq in some way refutes mr onofrios testimony or relates directly to the crime with which defendant is charged im not going to allow it its irrelevant as mr washburn has noted mills stood flatfooted then walked back to her table checked her binder turned a page or two of it and looked back up all right then determined not to let the jury see shed been caught off balance mills smiled through clenched teeth well then thank you your honor she said ill tie this up and well come back to it later denied his use of ptsd washburns best hope was still some kind of a medical defense if the jury didnt buy the fact that evan had suffered a severe and extended blackout then he was left with no defense whatsoever except that he was lying so to that end over the past weekend washburn had spent several hours going over his next witnesss testimony he could only hope that it was going to be enough dr bromley he began what kind of doctor are you im a neurologist at stanford medical center and at the palo alto veterans center a brain doctor is that right in his midfifties though he looked ten years younger bromley dressed impeccably with a strong jaw a prominent nose fathomless eyes and a short wellkept afro he exuded a steely confidence now he allowed a breath of a smile to grace his features as he nodded thats the lay term yes doctor did you know mr scholler before his arrest yes he was a patient of mine at the veterans center after he was released from walter reed according to your understanding doctor what was his situation at walter reed he was admitted there in september of the previous year when he arrived he was still in an unconscious state from injuries sustained overseas doctors had already performed a craniectomyremoval of a section of skull to allow the brain to swelland his condition was poor they thought it highly likely he would die second prize was that he would survive but be a vegetable washburn noticed several of the jurors flinch at this brutally matteroffact account he went on and when you first saw him here in california when was that by the way midmarch nine months after he was wounded he had made frankly a nearly miraculous recovery in what sense in almost every sense imaginable theyd replaced the disk of his skull about three months before that and already his speech patterns had returned to almost normal his memory still suffered small shortterm lapses and specific words would evade him from time to time but he seemed to be improving in these areas with each test we administered his physical coordination was such that i had no problem recommending that he go back to his work as a policeman so long as his assignment was neither too strenuous nor stressful in short his was the most remarkable recovery from traumatic brain injury that ive seen in my twenty years of medical practice washburn nodded delighted that he had fastened upon bromley hed always been in the picture of course but the opportunities for evans defense that involved ptsd had always seemed somehow sexier and more compelling now knowing what was going to come out he started to entertain a small ray of hope that a straightforward medical explanation could produce approximately the same results as a ptsd defense if he could make his client any kind of a victim he knew he still had a chance doctor did you have an opportunity to examine mr scholler after he was arrested yes how soon after a couple of days and what was his condition at that time well mostly he was suffering from headaches but he was also experiencing fairly severe disorientation as well as some speech aphasia all of this is of course consistent with trauma to the brain but you have testified that the symptoms of his traumatic brain injury had all but passed by a few months before that isnt that so yes and yet these symptoms seem to have reappeared right correct and why is that because of new trauma at the time i saw him after his arrest mr scholler had sustained several new head injuries and how did he get those he told me he had been in a fight with mr nolan a fight with mr nolan washburn half turned to bring the jury along with him he particularly noted mrs ellersby canted forward in her chair rapt doctor could a mere fight produce these kinds of debilitating injuries of course any knock to the head can cause severe injuries or even death and from examining mr schollers head i found evidencebruises and broken skinof several such blows he also had a new concussion were these injuries enough to make a person pass out certainly at the time they were inflicted it could be then could it also be later yes thank you washburn risked another quick look at the jurors everyone was still with him now doctor he continued in a case like this one where there had been previous traumatic brain injury within the past year might the ramifications of a beating such as the one endured by mr scholler be more serious than in someone without that history theres no might about it so the symptoms of this kind of beating would be more serious than they would be to someone who hadnt had the earlier trauma well not to say that a single beating couldnt be severe enough to cause significant damage and even death but certainly the history of recent trauma would exacerbate any symptoms from the beating and why is that because the brain is an extremely complicated and slowhealing organ bromleybless him washburn thoughtturned to address his remarks directly to the jury its common in fact its the norm for a tbi to cause neurological and physical problems forever other scenarios particularly if they involve bleeding and clotting can take two to four years to clear up entirely and even then there may be scarring and other complications what about blackouts yes of course blackouts too although typically medical professionals dont refer to them as blackouts its not a very specific term is there a specific medical term doctor well there is syncopehe pronounced it sincopeewhich is more or less simple fainting then there are seizures both epileptic and psychogenic that is nonepileptic and finally there are alcoholic blackouts where you have anterograde amnesia during or following a drinking binge all of these would probably be called some sort of blackout by a lay person and all of them might be affected by tbi and what happens during any of these blackouts either one or both of two things temporary loss of either consciousness or memory and how long can a blackout last well again that depends in some sense lay people might call a coma a blackout and theyve been known to last a decade or more most like fainting or epileptic seizures last no more than ten minutes and suddenly with this answer from dr bromley washburn felt a sickening hollowness in his stomach so acute that he thought for a moment that he might have a period of syncope himself he had known of the weakness of this blackout information of course for the better part of the year and had gone over it again with bromley over the past weekend intent on getting this medical evidence into the record struggling to get to his next point all at once he saw this testimony now for what it was and it was smoke he could sense that it wasnt going to work his idea had been to establish that evans loss of consciousness was a possible and even common result of his tbi tying everything neatly back to iraq and the good soldier sympathy vote from mrs ellersby after the beating evan had taken on that night washburn had assumed that hed be able to supply at least a colorable argument that evans coming testimony held water and now with a great and terrible clarity he could see it just wasnt going to fly the fact that evan might have blacked out at some point was no proof that he actually had spent any or all of that time in an unconscious state in fact given his blood alcohol level at the time of his arrest it was indisputable that hed had at least flashes of consciousness during that time when hed drunk himself into oblivion washburns thought that he could slip this past the jury or that it would get lost in a wave of sympathy was just wishful thinking he had believed it might work because he needed it to work to have any hope of winning this case washburn still had bromleys testimony about much of what evan had been through because of his traumatic brain injury he might go on to suffer effects from that for the remainder of his life a few of the jurors initially might still give evan the benefit of the doubt because they took pity on his situation but bromleys testimony offered nothing at all in the way of proof that evan had been incompetent or unable to commit the murder of ron nolan and eventually this simple fact was very likely to convict his client hed been deluding himself to think otherwise he walked to his table and took a sip of water turning he came back to his place in the center of the courtroom still he hesitated mr washburn tollson asked with some concern is everything all right would you like to take a recess no your honor thank you then he executed his trademark bow thanked bromley and turned him over to mills the prosecutor got up and advanced to her place with an enthusiasm that told washburn that she hadnt missed the issue and indeed her first question honed in on it doctor with regard to these blackouts you were discussing you said they usually lasted a few minutes is that right normally yes although it can vary so you said so your testimony is that a blackout can last for a few days is that right well again the terminology of blackout isnt precise if were talking about fainting or a seizure id say no they dont last more than ten minutes usually true unconsciousness however can of course extend indefinitely though i would hesitate to call that a blackout so is there any way that you can assure the jury that defendant in fact suffered any kind of blackout at all on the night of the beating no i cant say that mills threw a plainly gloating look over to the jury then came back to bromley thank you doctor thats all was it just me evan asked or did not that go very well they were in the holding area behind the courtroom again for the recess in a gesture that washburn took to be one of sympathy the bailiff had delivered paper cups filled with fresh hot coffee for both him and his client normally this wasnt allowed since a suspect with a cup of hot coffee was a suspect who could attack people with it but today for some reasonthe change in the weather the pathetic bromley testimonythe bailiff had offered and both men had jumped at the chance washburn of course downplayed the problem shrugging he said between onofrio and bromley we got in a whole lot of what youve been through somebody on that jury is going to care you watch he sipped at the brew the bravado hed put in his answer wasnt just to buff up his own selfimage evan was going on the stand next and washburn needed him to project both relaxation and confidence while he was up there he was going to get to tell his story at last and more importantly sell it to the jury but it wasnt much of a story and both men seemed to understand that dont take this badly unruffled collected washburn leaned back against the wall and crossed one leg over the other i still think weve got a decent shot but i also think the court would look favorably on an offer to plead evan turned his head and fixed washburn with a glare weve been through that yes we have and now youre going to tell the jury that you didnt kill nolan thats right any idea who did because i dont have one it wasnt me because you dont remember doing it everett listen i cant believe i beat him with a poker then shot him in the head and have no memory of it i would remember that washburn sighed well as you say weve been all through it but we could say you went back to talk to him after the fight and he attacked you you were weak from the earlier beating and you had no choice but to grab the poker evan was holding up his hand and execute him with a pointblank shot to the head i didnt do that that is not who i am yes and that may not be the point he tipped up his coffee and swallowed theres absolutely nothing about those days that you remember you dont think ive tried you dont think i want to remember any little thing maybe you were drunk the whole time washburn rubbed his palms on his pants legs i want you to think about this carefully evan if thats what happened at least that gives the jurors something more to think about if i change my story now then im a liar before though right no if you just remembered its come back to you in the stress of the trial damn conveniently theyll see through that in a heartbeat okay suppose it happened that you were home the whole time suffering from the beating drinking to kill the pain you never left the apartment and how does that help me theyd still have to believe me no washburn shook his head they dont have to believe you one of them has to believe you its a lot better to say i didnt do it than i dont remember but i probably didnt do it theres a real difference there evan took a couple of breaths i thought it was about the evidence not what i say what the evidence says thats the problem washburn said the evidence my friend makes a very good case that you did it just at that moment the bailiff appeared and washburn punched his client on the thigh drink your coffee he said were up after the months of buildup the endless coaching and strategy sessions the arguments disagreements accords and prognostications evan schollers time on the witness stand was really quite brief washburn saw no point in having his client go over again all of the reasons he might have had to loathe the victim that had all been wellestablished by earlier witnesses there were really only a couple of lines of inquiry that washburn thought stood any chance of traction with the jury if only because they provided an alternative theory to the case and he got right to them evan he said why did you break into mr nolans home first let me say that that was wrong theres no excuse i shouldnt have done that i should have advised the homicide detail of my suspicions about mr nolan mills got to her feet your honor nonresponsive sustained tollsons glare went from washburn over to evan he spoke to the defendant mr scholler please only answer the questions that the attorneys put to you youre not here to make speeches yes your honor sorry all right mr washburn go ahead and carefully please washburn posed the question again and evan responded because i had found out about the khalil murders from the paper and then more about them from lieutenant spinoza i had gone on a mission with mr nolan when we were in baghdad together and hed used frag grenades at that time then knowing that mr khalil was of iraqi descent and knowing what mr nolan did for a living it occurred to me that he might have had something to do with those murders why didnt you simply as you say go to homicide because i might have been wrong which would have made me look stupid both to the lieutenant and to tara and i couldnt have that why was that well one i was a policeman myself two i was hoping to reconnect with tara all right so you broke into mr nolans home i did let myself in yes trying to find evidence that mr nolan had been involved in the khalil murders thats right didnt you think that was a bit farfetched not at all id seen mr nolan kill other people mills raised her voice objection your honor washburn responded mr nolan was a security officer sometimes his job was to kill people mr scholler knew him in that setting in iraq there is nothing pejorative about it tollson put his glasses back on objection overruled all right washburn continued now when you went into mr nolans home evan did you find anything which in your opinion might have been connected to the khalil murders yes evan ran through his actions and motivations in a straightforward mannerthe frag grenades touching the gun both in the backpack and in the beds headboard the computer files as washburn had coached him he kept bringing his narrative back to the jury and particularlywithout being too obviousto mrs ellersby three over from the left in the second row so you copied the photographic computer file yes presumably now you had your proof or at least some possible proof of a connection between mr nolan and the khalil murders what did you do next well i didnt want to take away any of the proof so that it would still be there when the fbi searched the house mills pushed her chair back with a resonant squeal and said under her breath give me a break tollson banged his gavel with some force if i thought youd done that on purpose ms miille id hold you in contempt right now there will be no histrionics in this courtroom you will live to regret the next outburst of any sort and im admonishing the jury to disregard your unprofessional comment then to evan go ahead mr scholler evan let out a long breath for the moment apparently and perhaps actually unable to remember where hed been in his testimony washburn took advantage of the moment im sorry your honor my client seems to have blacked out for a second oh christ mills whispered bam bam thats it ms miille youre in contempt well talk about what the sanction is going to be outside the presence of the jury his mouth set in a hard line tollson pointed to both attorneys this ends here im warning you mr washburn does your client need a minute to compose himself evan washburn asked are you all right fine all right tollson said lets have the reporter read back the last question please the question got evan back to where he was saying that he didnt want to take away any of the proof so that the fbi would find it when they searched the house so i decided to make a copy of the photo file on the computer that held what i was sure was a picture of the khalils house so i took one of the diskettes and made the copy and brought it home now wait a minute you were a policeman and you had what you considered strong evidence of a murder and yet you didnt contact homicide right i didnt and why was that because i couldnt tell them what id found without admitting i got it in an illegal search none of it would have been admissible in court so what did you do i mailed the diskette to the fbi who i heard were investigating the khalil murders and then what happened and then mr nolan came home and must have realized that somebody had been in his house in fact he must have realized it was you evan isnt that so well the way it worked out yes apparently so he turned it all around to make it look like it was me whod planted the evidence at his place and also incidentally killed the khalils washburn knew this was all inadmissible speculation but was betting that mills still reeling from the contempt citation and the reaming she had taken in front of the jury would be keeping a low profile at least for a while he pressed on and did you in fact kill the khalils no i did not were you ever charged with killing the khalils no did you at any time send fragmentation grenades or any other type of arms ammunition or ordnance from iraq to the united states no i did not at any time did anyone ever present you with any evidence that you had tried to send these items from iraq to the united states no now when you heard that mr nolan had turned the tables on you and reported to the fbi what was your reaction i was furious i wanted to confront him and fight him you did not want to kill him that never entered my mind i was mad i wanted to hit him with brass knuckles i just happened to have them with me that night and when i got there i thought i might need them mr nolan had a great deal of training in handtohand combat more than me and i wanted to level the playing field so by fighting him did you want to stop him from telling his story to the fbi no it was too late for that hed already done it this was another critical point related to evans alleged motive there would be no point in killing nolan to stop him from turning over evidence to the authorities if that had already happened which it had so let me get this straight evan on the evening of june third two thousand four tara wheatley told you that she had ended her relationship with mr nolan and wanted to pursue one with you is that correct yes and on that same night you learned that mr nolan had already supplied the fbi with evidence that supposedly connected you to the khalil murders right right washburn threw an open glance at the jury could his point be more plain but it was of course necessary to nail it down in all its particulars so there could be no misunderstanding at all in other words evan he said did you have any motive to kill ron nolan on account of your relationship with ms wheatley no i did not and did you have any motive to kill mr nolan to prevent him from talking to the fbi no hed already done that so you had no motive to kill mr nolan is that right i had no reason to kill him washburn cast one last sidelong glance at the jury box fixed on mrs ellersby for a second and was pleased to note that she was nodding soberly as if newly convinced of something evans testimony had he was sure made a strong impression on her and if on her then maybe on one or more of the others mills rose slowly from her table her brow creased her face set in an expression of deep concern she came and stood in her spot and brought her right hand to the side of her face then let it down mr scholler as youve testified on june third two thousand four you went up to mr nolans townhome with the intention of fighting him and then you did in fact engage in a fight with him am i right so far yes what did you do after that fight ended i dont remember you dont remember did you black out i dont remember so it is not your testimony that you suffered a blackout after all is it no whether i did or not i dont remember you suffered quite a beating yourself in this altercation did you not yes and yet with all the problems youve had particularly with traumatic brain injury you did not seek medical help apparently not but i dont remember washburn raised a hand at his desk your honor objection badgering if he doesnt remember anything it follows that he doesnt remember particulars this satisfied tollson and he nodded sustained mills pursed her lips and paused to phrase her question so it came at things from a slightly different angle mr scholler she said finally what is your first memory after you sustained your injuries on wednesday night at the hands of mr nolan i remember waking up in a hospital bed i think it was the saturday night so wednesday night through saturday night is a complete blank is that right thats right all right mills paused for another second or two and thenjust like thather posture changed her back straightened perceptibly a wisp of a grim smile tugged at the corners of her mouth obviously she had reached some decision as though shed done everything in her power to get to this point and now the time had come to commit irrevocably to her strategy so now mr scholler as you are sitting here in front of me and the members of this jury maybe you killed mr nolan and maybe you didnt you just dont remember is that right evan sat with the question for a long moment mr scholler she prompted him its a yes or no question can you tell me that you did not kill mr nolan evans eyes went to washburn who returned his gaze impassively coming back to face his prosecutor evan leveled his gaze at mills i dont remember he said at last at eightthirty the next morning mary patricia whelanmiille sat on the corner of her desk in her small office behind her outside the window the freak storm was into its second day and showing no signs of clearing in the parking lot just outside the cold and heavy rain slanted nearly horizontal in gusting sheets in front of mills her secretary felice brinkley sat with a notepad on a folding chair that shed set up by the door felice was a nononsense woman who wore minimal makeup and had let her hair go almost completely gray mills thought shed done this as a defense against being hit on by guyswith her finely pored skin sculpted cheeks and a hooded sensuous cast to her eyes and even with the gray hair and lack of fuss she was a strikingly attractive woman the curvaceous figure didnt hurt either thirtysix years old she was the mother of two boys and a girl all under twelve mills also believed that felice was among the smartest people shed ever met and constantly tried to persuade her to take the lsats and become a lawyer herself but felice would have none of itperhaps in itself mills had to admit a testament to her intelligence the way it was now felice was explaining for the fiftieth time she could come in early work her regular hours skip lunch and be home just about in time to be there for the kids when they got home from school her husband john worked a swing shift in maintenance for the city for the pay differential so one of them was always there for the kids thats just our priority but with the extra money and thered be a lot more of it john wouldnt have to work at all if you got in with a highticket firm which you would mills replied sure but id have to work twentyhour days and how would that make him feel not working he wants to work or if i made more money than him i dont necessarily think thats a recipe for a happy marriage but its okay for him to make more money than you he doesnt but if he did that would be okay sure but it would also be okay if i made more than him if thats just the way our lives work out but why should i go for a new job that i wouldnt like as much and would keep me away from my kids just for the money because money is what makes you safe felice she held up an admonitory finger okay and i know you dont want to think about this but what if he leaves you who john she laughed john is never going to leave me how can you be sure of that hes a man isnt he felice had heard all of this before and found it mildly amusing her poor sad driven boss who worked impossible hours and was never in a stable relationship trying to tell felice how to have a more secure and happy lifethere was something inherently funny if also somewhat pathetic about the situation all men dont leave felice said both the kids grandfathers are still around for example and married to the grandmothers it happens in fact in both of our families johns and mine its kind of a tradition she brushed her hair back from her forehead opened the notepad on her lap snapped her ballpoint a couple of times checked her watch now how about you show me this closing argument suddenly wideeyed bushwhacked by the time mills boosted herself off her desk oh god is it really eightthirty already weve got to felice raised her hand youve got to just calm down mp and tell the story thats all youve got to do slow and easy youre right mills blew a strand of her hair away from her mouth youre right yes i am felice clicked her pen again okay hit it ladies and gentlemen of the jury mills held her legal pad with her notes as a prop although she knew pretty much exactly what she was going to say at the beginning of this trial i told you that the evidence would prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant killed ron nolan with premeditation and malice aforethought id like to take a last few minutes of your time now to talk about the law and explain how the evidence has done exactly that for the next fortyfive minutes she focused on the elements of murder to help the jury wade through the verbose and sometimes arcane instructions that the judge would give them at the end of the case then she got to the core of the argument so now ive explained what murder is weve talked a little about what the legal definition of premeditation is and i hope my comments have helped you understand what precisely the law requires be proved before the defendant may be found guilty now id like to talk to you about the evidence the specifics of the testimony in this case the exhibits the reasonable inferences to be drawn from that testimony and from those exhibits that show the defendants conduct meets the definition of firstdegree murder and what is that evidence first mr nolan and defendant were rivals for the attention of the same woman tara wheatley the defense would have you believe that on the night of defendants attack on mr nolanone that he freely admits by the wayms wheatley after a sixmonth relationship with mr nolan decided to suddenly change her allegiance and affections in favor of defendant and that because of this shift defendant no longer had a motive to want to kill mr nolan i submit to you that this is simply untrue wait a minute felice said not untrue be more earthy why not does this make any sense to you mills nodded better she made a note then resumed her pacing and her argument the defense is telling you that a man who lost his girlfriend to another man who believes that that man lied and cheated and betrayed him who knows that the man has enjoyed an intimate relationship with the defendants girlfriend while he was laid up in the hospital is suddenly told by the girlfriend that she intends to come back to him and now everything is okay no bitterness no animosity no hate thats what the defense is selling i hope youre not buying first of all because your common sense tells you thats nonsense blood feuds dont end in a minute longheld hates dont vanish overnight and the defendant must have known that ms wheatley who had already changed her mind once could just as easily change it again tomorrow and prefer nolan to him but more to the point all the evidence shows that as a simple fact the defendant still did hate ron nolan after he talked to tara he armed himself with a deadly weaponand as youve heard from the evidence those brass knuckles are a deadly weaponand he went to ron nolans place for the express purpose of beating him does that sound to you like someone who had given up hard feelings someone who had forgiven his enemy someone who did not still want revenge and to inflict pain of course not thats just nonsense she stopped by the window is that enough on that felice nodded i think so you dont want to beat it to death just move along pacing again mills continued while im discussing motive let me just say that motive alone is not no felice said the weight of motive evidence will be in the jury instructions you dont have to go there with a nod mills started in again the defense would also have you believe that the second equally compelling motivethat defendant wanted to stop mr nolan from producing more evidence to connect him to the khalil slayingswas moot because mr nolan had already produced such evidence this is a spurious argument she stopped is spurious okay felice considered for a second maybe a little fancy how about specious maybe a lot fancy the paralegal rolled her eyes how about going for the bluecollar vote and using phony fake false mills snapped her fingers thats it false she went back to her formal voice this is a false argument because first defendant may well have believed that mr nolan had more evidence but more to the point none of what mr nolan had told the fbi about the khalil evidence could be used against mr scholler if mr nolan was dead if theres one thing youve learned in this trial its that we need to produce live witnesses to give testimony i suggest to you that the defendant had an even greater motive to kill mr nolan once it was clear that nolan had turned him in and was prepared to cooperate as a witness against him if the defendant did kill the khalils adding one more murder to the list to protect him from being caught wouldnt have been a big deal whoa up felice said you better be ready washburns gonna light up on that one i know but im allowed to argue and i want the jury to hear it the judge wont let it in no probably not but ill talk fast and get as much of it in as i can before they shut me down so long as you know i know okay moving on mills consulted her notes briefly so lets get down to what actually happened what the undisputed evidence proves happened arming himself with brass knuckles and admitting to tara wheatley that he was going to quote put an end to this unquote defendant drove to mr nolans house and attacked him a fight ensued and both men were injured three days later a gun bearing defendants fingerprints was found on the bed in mr nolans bedroom near to where mr nolan lay on the floor with a fatal gunshot wound to the head from the same caliber weapon exactly what happened on the night of that fight the only person in this courtroom who could tell us that claims that he has no memory of that time no memory at all and this in spite of his own doctors testimony that blackouts last no more than ten minutes that leaves a lot of conscious time for which defendant has no explanation and no memory the evidence youve heard and from his own witness does not support his testimony so with a lack of absolute certainty we are left with the task of asking ourselves what is the most reasonable explanation for the facts in evidence is it more reasonable to assume that defendant finished his fight with mr nolan and then inebriated and with a concussion drove himself to his apartment where he continued to drink for the next two days while some unidentified third party for some inexplicable reason maybe unexplained for some unexplained reason entered mr nolans home beat him with a fireplace poker and then shot him or is it more reasonable to assume that armed with his set of brass knuckles defendant got the better of mr nolan in their fight and when he had finished that exercise simply shot him in the head with a handgun he found at the scene then ladies and gentlemen and only then after he had murdered mr nolan in cold blood did he drive himself home and proceed to drink himself into an alcoholic stupor mills stopped locked eyes with felice and shook her head i hate this guy she said its not coming across her paralegal answered its very clean and objective i buy it completely not too short not for me mills glanced up at the wall clock almost showtime imagine if i actually pull off beating washburn dont get ahead of yourself just take it a sentence at a time felice stood up and gave her boss a quick hug you feel ready as ill ever be okay felice said go get em by late friday afternoon the tension was thick in the jury room ryan cannoe the foreman had just counted the fifteenth ballot and the votefrom an original of eight to four to convictnow stood at eleven to one maggie he said to mrs ellersby weve got another fortyfive minutes and then were going to have to come back after a very long weekend now im not trying to coerce any kind of a different vote from you but if youre sure you wont budge and youre never going to budge maybe we should just send out the word that were hung and leave it at that this brought a burst of invective from several of the other jurors after all the time weve put in on this no way thats bullshit the guys guilty as sin and we all know it maybe we dont all know it ellersby replied the dayin fact the whole jury experiencehad been its own trial for her especially since this morning when the last two defections from her camp had crossed over leaving her as the lone vote to acquit so thats your final decision maggie cannoe asked again you really dont think he did it not exactly that she said i think he might have done it as ive said all along i just cant be sure in my heart that its firstdegree murder if he went there to beat nolan up and he died by mistake thats seconddegree cannoe kept his patience except he didnt die from the beating no i know that things got out of hand juror sue whitson a woman of ellersbys age whod been an early voter for acquittal now joined the argument maggie id be with you except that in the end he put the gun up to the mans head and shot him how do you explain that except to say that at some time mr scholler decided to kill him and thats murder one the point cannoe added is that you believe scholler did it dont you never mind all the legal distinctions he pulled the trigger right ellersby sighed and whispered i dont see how he didnt but i dont know if they proved he did its not absolute proof maggie sue said its proof beyond a reasonable doubt and theyve done that you admit it yourself cannoe said you just said you dont see how he didnt do it i know well then well then i just keep coming back to what mr washburn said in his closing statement that they could have come up with any number of other defenses that seemed to make more sense selfdefense for example or heat of passion or simply saying no he didnt do it but instead they went with the truth which he admitted was maybe harder to believe sue reached out and put a hand on maggies arm she spoke with a surprising gentleness maybe because it wasnt in fact true maggie maybe washburns just playing on our gullibility figuring well want to believe that this young man evan whod had such a terrible time in iraq that somehow his injuries there are to blame for the fact that he cant say he didnt kill nolan if it wasnt for all the iraq stuff would you have any doubt about what really happened would his story have made any sense at all thats what i finally came to see it just doesnt i wish it did but it doesnt he came to beat him up cannoe said and wound up staying to kill him if thats not what you see maggie and you dont think you can ever say otherwise ill call for the bailiff and tell him were hung you want me to do that ellersby looked around the table at all of her intelligent wellmeaning fellow citizens none of them coldblooded none out for vengeance all of them had given nearly a month out of their lives to see that justice was done that the system worked and for her part she knew that she had been irrationally swayed by the power of washburns simple argument in closing that he was too smart and too experienced to ever allow a ridiculous defense like evans i dont remember to be the centerpiece of his case except that it was the truth thats why they had gone with that defense because it was the truth and maggie ellersbys minds eye could picture evan passed out in his apartment not from alcohol but from his brain injurynot in a blackout but in a true state of unconsciousness knocked out from the beating hed taken but there was no evidence that that was what had happened none at all and what if washburn as another one of her colleagues on the jury had pointed out early on was nothing more than a man who was paid to tell lies on behalf of his clients thats what all lawyers were right she flashed on the o j simpson case the dan white twinkie defense case in san francisco if she was the lone holdout and her vote to acquit wasnt based on any evidence she could name how would she be able to explain herself to her husband and her friends how could she live with herself maggie sue softly queezed her arm again do you want me to call the bailiff cannoe asked ellersby looked up to the ceiling said a quick prayer for evan schollers soul and brought her eyes back down to the table no she said i think we need to do one more ballot part four dismas hardys windshield wipers couldnt keep up with the downpour they thwacked as fast as they could go but this latest in a series of march squalls reduced his visibility to near zero he could barely make out the first gate until he was at it he loved his little twoseater honda convertible with the top down in the summer and fall but it wasnt made for this kind of weather the plastic back window had long since gone opaque and even with the defrost fan blasting the inside surfaces of the door windows were fogged over too he pushed the button to lower his drivers window so he could present his identification to the guard and the rain misted in over his face behind him someone honked then honked again his rearview mirror was useless he couldnt see his side mirrors either through the condensation on the windows the rain pounded down on the cloth roof he was inside a drum blinded cocooned he had to lower his window another few inches so he and the guard could see each other opening the window allowed more water in enough to soak through the fabric of his suit in seconds another blast from the impatient prick behind him hell hardy was already wet he had half a mind to jump out and confront the guy pull him out of his ride deck him dump him into the churning brown stream that ran over the roads gutters instead he squinted out to see the guard flashed his drivers license and spoke so he could be heard over the rain dismas hardy to visit one of your inmates evan scholler the guard all but invisible through the downpour spoke loudly too from his semienclosed space ill have to see your id better than that please sir sorry seething hardy handed it out waited he had time to decide that if the car behind him honked once more he would go take the driver out but then his wallet was back at the window and he heard a crisp thank you sir ahead to your right after the next gate and he rolled up his window and let the clutch out simultaneously when hed left the city a couple of hours ago the sky had been light gray but it hadnt even been drizzling so he didnt have an umbrella or a raincoat with him after he found his spot in the parking lot he turned off the motor and parked to wait out the worst of the squall regain some of his composure whoever had been behind himsome delivery guy maybedidnt follow him to this lot he thought it was probably just as well composure was an issue even before the rain hardys physical reaction to the scheduled visit to the prison had caught him offguard it had been a while since hed had a client in prison and he was out of practice he kept having to reach for a breath his palms were sweaty an unaccustomed emptiness had hollowed out his lower rib cage closing his eyes he leaned his head back and drew in a long breath through his mouth which he then exhaled with a certain deliberation he did it again and again when at last the drumming of the rain stopped he opened his eyes now suddenly it was just a light drizzle seizing the moment he opened the car door and stepped out onto the asphalt hardy had seen pictures of evan scholler in the newspapers caught some glimpses of him on the tv news as the trial had gone on so he thought hed recognize him on sight but when the guard first opened the door to the very small room to bring the inmate in hardy took a quick glance and decided that this couldnt be his man the guard must have gotten it wrong and this shackled guy must be going to see another attorney in a different room for one thing evan was younger just thirtyone now this inmate looked at least forty further in photos and on television evan was far betterlooking with a stronger chin lighter hair a better complexion smaller in the gut and bigger across the shoulders this guy here was big casually buffed physically intimidating especially wearing a flataffect expression that made his thin mouth look mean even cruel at first glance this guy looked like a stone killer but the guard checking the slip of paper in his hand said dismas hardy a nod heres your mope evan took the slur without reaction he stood at attention but relaxed in the pose seemingly uninterested in what if anything happened next he looked hardy up and down as he might a side of beef hanging in a cooler you can take the shackles off hardy said for the obvious reason guards in prison did not carry guns on their persons so in any oneonone encounter such as this delivery shackles on prisoners tended to be the norm hardy knew several attorneys who visited their clients here and most of them were happy to let the shackles stay put a shackled convict was a controllable convict and with many of these inmates you couldnt be too careful the guard hestitated for an instant then shrugged your call with practiced precision he unlocked the handcuffs from the chain that was threaded through the levis belt loops encircling evans waist the cuffs still dangled from the waist chain at his sides now though his hands free evan rubbed at his wrists the room was four feet wide by about seven feet long a heavy solid industrial gray metal desk squatted against hardys right wall and stuck out twothirds of the way across the space in a pinch it could serve as a firstline barrier in the event of a surprise attack folding chairs sat on either side of it hardy had a door with a wireglass window in it behind him and another door just like that facing him the guard whod let him in had cautioned him to stay on his side of the desk just to be safe hed also pointed out the small button low in the wall in hardys side that could be pressed in the event of any trouble evans guard said im right outside the whole time and then thats where he was closing the door behind him hardy said you want to sit down evan thanked him and sat he put his free hands on the table still looking through hardy until suddenly he focused you got a cigarette sorry i dont smoke i didnt either evan said what a joke what is not smoking watching what you eat staying in shape all that stuff outside then you wind up in here maybe he felt as though hed given too much of himself away as a cop or a soldier or at the prison or somewhere else evan had gotten good at the thousandyard stare and he reverted into it after a minute inside himself he came back to hardy so who are you he asked dismas hardy your new attorney dont take this wrong evan said but it took you long enough yeah well it was a little complicated a beat whats that first name again dismas the good thief on calvary next to jesus evan shook his head dont know him dismas i mean ive heard of jesus hardy looked him in the face if this was humor it was damn subtle and wouldnt be a bad thing but he couldnt tell he could see however that his initial impression of the mans age was offclose up he came as advertised thirtyone hard years what happened to charlie bowen evan asked he went missing last summer hes the equivalent of dead as far as the courts concerned my firm inherited his files including yours i got them about four months ago you a slow reader hardys glance came up at his new client again the guy wielded words efficiently short punches inside first a wave at humor then a cutting jab a lot going on behind unyielding eyes hardy figured he deserved the rebukefour months while he decided whether or not to take on the appeal himself must have felt a lot different to him than those same four months inside the prison had to evan but hardy was here now and thats what mattered evans trial had ended nearly two years before charlie bowen obviously hadnt gotten too far with the appeal in the fourteen or so months that hed worked on it nobody else had done anything on it for six months after bowen disappeared the four more months that hardy had taken while he made up his mind after he got the files were the least of evans real problems so hardy ignored the question it was irrelevant now he pushed his chair back from the desk crossed his legs started in a conversational tone i used to be a cop he said before that i was a marine and did a tour in vietnam sound familiar you enlist marines hardy repeated they dont draft marines how old were you twenty yeah i was twenty when i joined the guard still in college that was prenineeleven preeverything evan said different world the guard looked like easy money at the time a good way to keep in shape who knew did you go right into the police academy after school pretty much couple of months off maybe you can only drink so much beer and do nothing else before it gets old i dont know i spent ten years doing that i had a kid who died hardy wasnt fishing for sympathy he wanted evan to know a little bit about who he was why he might be taking on this case personally the young mans history struck a chord in him with his life apparently over evan was still seven years younger than hardy had been when hed awakened from his own long alcoholpowered slumber after the death of his first son michael starting over from scratch at thirtyeight hardy had resurrected himself and his life in a way he would have been unable to predictsuccess wife kids even happiness so he knew it could be done you didnt want to bet on it but the slim possibility was there maybe this kidlike hardy an excop exsoldiercould get another chance so how long he asked did you walk a beat before they recalled you three years give or take this isnt in my file hows it relate to your case perhaps unconsciously evan scratched with his right index finger at the surface of the desk i dont see how it would thats why its not in your file hardy said not in bowens anyway what about everett washburns it might be there i dont know i havent talked to him yet i wanted to meet you first see what you had to say like what like your own testimony at your trial was that washburns decision or yours i dont remember exactly i think we agreed on it together i dont understand why when you were on the stand you didnt take the chance to tell the jury yourself that you didnt kill nolan if you didnt the scratching stopped evan stared across at hardy maybe i did do it okay thatd be a good reason did you you really want to know its why im here washburn never cared one way or the other if i actually did it i mean said it didnt matter thats what makes the world go round i do care if you killed him did you i dont know he said the second office out of which everett washburn practiced law was the lower flat of a victorian building on union street in san francisco it was really more of a personal refuge than a business office everybody in redwood city knew washburn aside from his managingpartner role in his own firm he was a fixture at the broadway tobacconists down there and sometimes the constant familiarity having to be on all the time got to be a little much for the old man in san francisco he kept a secretary who came in for about ten hours every week her main job was to keep the plants watered there were a lot of plants the place he favored most in the flat was all the way in the back twelve feet in diameter octagonal in shape with windows on four of the walls and bookcases stuffed with leisure readingno law bookson the other four the room was intimate and comfortable it held his rolltop desk and slatback chair two small upholstered couches a love seat a large square coffee table of distressed wood and a couple of wing chairs all of the furniture sat on a creamcolored persian rug that had set him back twelve grand five years before this is a great room dismas hardy told him as he followed him in and stopped to admire it i could live in this room it has a certain feng shui i must admit i do love the place have a seat anywhere youd like washburn plumped himself down in the middle of one of the couches fixing hardy with an appraising stare ive heard your name come up several times over the past few years mr hardy but seeing you i think weve met before havent we hardy took one of the wing chairs yes sir and its diz please about five years ago in redwood city you put me in touch with an exclient of yours and she wound up saving one of my associates lives literally well the information she gave me it solved a murder case about ten minutes before the guy could do it again washburn pulled a look of pleased surprise i must say i dont hear that kind of story too often an actual solved murder my side of things that never happens well it did once i probably should have gotten back to you told you about it youre telling me now its good to hear when a case turns out well did i charge you for the referral to my exclient no washburn clapped his hands together so much the better although as we all know no good deed goes unpunished i know hardy said i avoid them at every opportunity and yet youve done me the courtesy to come down here to see me thats not a good deed i needed to talk to you and it was either my office or here it gave me the chance to get out into the air in the middle of the day well regardless i appreciate your flexibility and then suddenly as though hed flicked a switch washburn shifted into business mode he came forward to the very edge of the couch with his elbows on his knees his hands clasped loosely you said it was about evan scholler it is im doing the appeal ahh so youre the guy who comes in after the battle to shoot the wounded i hope not ive reviewed the transcripts so far from what i see im not inclined to go with incompetence of counsel thats magnanimous of you though in all honesty that trial wasnt one of my finer moments im afraid but what are you going to do when your client wont plead i know i could have gotten him a manslaughter and he could be out by the time hes forty now he shook his head anyway when i heard it was about scholler i thought you were coming here as a courtesy to tell me in person that id fucked it up and that was the basis of your appeal nope so what are you thinking the ptsd hardy nodded the judge shouldnt have kept it out my call is that ninth circuit judges are going to fall all over themselves spinning this thing when it gets in front of them scholler had a legitimate disability of some kind that the jury couldnt hear about and he did right oh yeah we had the experts the diagnosis was cold are you kidding me and the judge didnt let it in how could it not be relevant and admissible how indeed they both of course were familiar with the notorious liberal slant of the ninth circuit court of appeals which had made countless rulings on the admissibility of extenuating circumstances in murder cases such as childhood abuse dysfunctional parenting or exposure to violence on television if ptsd being ruled inadmissible didnt get their attention hardy would eat his bar card well hardy held out his hands palms up need i go on not to me washburn said i do think that ptsds the best play though that just might be my own selfinterest talking ive kicked myself a hundred times over some decisions i made in that case if i were doing the appeal i might go for incompetent counsel what would you have done differently well fought harder with evan to take a plea is the main thing washburn focused on an empty space in the air between them done more with the khalil murders maybe although god knows what that would have beeni spent fifty grand on my private eye and he got nothing remotely usable thenthis was my favoritei got halfway through my own chief medical witness when i realized that his testimony if anything helped the prosecution but the main thing as i say would have been a plea but he wouldnt take one adamant he didnt remember doing it and wasnt going to say he did period hardy shook his head dumb washburn shrugged i dont know maybe he thinks he probably didnt do it what do you think the old man waved that off i never go there going for levity hardy put on half a grin even for fun never nohow no way ever i cant stand a man who wont express his opinions no me neither washburn sat all the way back on the couch but the poor fucking guy you met him yet hardy nodded i went down there last week a beat i bet hed take that plea now yeah i bet he would washburn had already given hardy about twenty minutes of his time call it two hundred dollars worth although he wasnt charging him for this visit still time was money and if there was no business to be done between these two men washburn would not make any until hardy left so how else can i help you i was hoping to pick your brain a little how little six to eight hours over the next month or so washburn came forward again my professional courtesy rate is two hundred sounds reasonable hardy said i dont know how much time you have right now and i dont want to impose washburn held up a hand and looked over at the grandfather clock that stood sentinel where the windows met the bookshelves it was quarter to four im comfortable going till five he said feel free pick away a month into his new old job his second hitch as head of san franciscos homicide detail lieutenant abe glitsky walked alone down the fifthfloor hallway and turned into the small roomitself bisected by a counterthat served as the units reception area it was fivetwenty and both of the clerks stationed here had left probably gone home for the day glitsky after his initial disapproval was getting used to the idea of hourly employees putting in their time and going home while hed been deputy chief of inspectors over these past few years hed always felt it odd that even the clerical jobs were so personalyou got in early and you stayed until your boss went home because if you didnt someone else might get close to him and then you might not rise in the bureaucracy when he did or she of course in another few steps he was in his officea small room stuffed with file cabinets crammed with a large flat working desk windows high enough in the wall along the right to allow in a bit of natural light but that afforded no view of bryant street down below coming around the desk glitsky glanced up at his bulletin board of active homicidesnine of them today about average crimes committed in the past month or so on which his inspectors were still working settling into his chair he sat back and wondered anew if his request for what amounted to a voluntary demotion had been a mistake hed been on the job for more than a month now and besides some of the personnel issues that had been and continued to be a bit troubling he found that much to his surprise he somewhat missed his large official office with its bookshelves and plaques and wall decorations its brace of leather chairs for important visitors its reception area that discouraged passersby from stopping in to say hello the deputy chiefs office was that of an important man and while he had occupied it glitsky often had not felt at base like he belonged there now as head of homicide he still had what he believed to be an important job but it was mostly an invisible one could it be hed been wondering that hed grown accustomed to being in the public eye to having his opinion matter to others to being consulted by the chief and even the mayor about important civic issues he kept telling himself that he was in a period of adjustment to the new surroundings that was all change itself was never easy but two or three times already hed entertained the thought that maybe hed made yet another mistake in a recent history of poor career choices and there was no getting around it these new digs were different and they made the whole job once so familiar feel different first this office was physically separated from the inspectors room when the detail had been on the fourth floor the internal windows in the lieutenants office looked out over the crowded room that held the desks of the troops here even if his new office had internal windows which it didnt he wouldnt have been able to see the inspectors since the computer room was in the way inspectors could and did come and go they never had to pass his door and glitsky might never know theyd been around the good news was that barring emergencies glitskys own hours had stabilized as deputy chief hed considered it his duty to set an example of rigor discipline and enthusiasm and hed made it a point to be at work at seventhirty at the other end of the day department meetings press conferences and public appearances often kept him out until nine sometimes later his weekends rarely were his own either deputy chief wasnt a job it was a life and glitsky was at a juncturethe crux of it reallyhis desire in life was to be with his wife treya and their two young children rachel and zachary the last couple of years since zack had been born had been something of a strain treya worked as the secretary for san franciscos district attorney clarence jackman she was at her desk at nine and left at five there had been weeks while glitsky had been deputy chief that theyd basically only gotten to speak to each other in this building the hall of justice now having made sure that his desk was cleared glitsky was getting ready to check out for the day he went out his door closing it behind him passing through the empty computer room he entered the inspectors area and saw that fully eight of the fourteen homicide inspectors were in the room this was unusual since most of the time these people were out interviewing witnesses assessing crime scenes building cases and working out rebooking details andor charges with assistant das darrel bracco looked over and raised a hand in greetingat least one person in the unit apparently okay with the new status quo as the vibe of glitskys presence passed through the room other inspectors looked up glitsky caught a few nods from veterans who went back to their conversations and coffee was ignored by a couple of others this was the way it had been since hed come down here his people misunderstanding his reappointment to homicide wondering if in reality he was some kind of spy sent down by the brass to shake up the detail screw up their jobs glitsky hoped that this was simply the effect of change on his people and that it too would shortly pass but until it did he wasnt having a good time getting up to braccos desk he summoned a neutral tone im out the door darrel anything happening i might want to know about before i go bracco thought a minute then shook his head nothing new lieutenant he said slow day on the prairie i guess i guess so glitsky did a quick scan of the room he didnt want to seem to be checking on anyone in fact he wasnt but that didnt mean people might not think he was see you tomorrow darrel yes sir bracco said have a good one glitsky had turned and gone two steps when bracco spoke again wait a sec abe i just remembered there was something you might want to put back on your board this was the active homicide board in glitskys office usually once a name left that board it stayed off forever either because a suspect in the case had gotten arrested or because the trail had gone too cold to waste the inspectors time anymore or if the only eyewitness fell terminally ill with lead poisoning or if for any of a zillion reasons the case wasnt being actively worked anymore back on the board yeah one of my old ones bowen but its been closed since before your time we can get to it in the morning here im writing myself a note so i wont forget how bout if i just walk back in there and write it back up sheepish bracco nodded getting to his feet that would probably work too i didnt want to keep you if you were leaving how long can it take glitsky asked bowen is that right five letters shouldnt take me more than a few minutes he was already back at his door turning the key in it so whats the case hanna bowen finally ruled a suicide by hanging glitsky turned and faced his inspector what she unhang herself its more like i promised the daughter that id take another look at it she cant seem to get her arms around it that her mom killed herself i mean okay but the coroner ruled suicide and youre going to help this daughter how i know its a long shot abe but the girls still torn up you know all the classes we take that tell us to be sensitive to the victims pain and all that i figure what can it hurt and it might help her what though exactly well evidently the mother kept a diary or the daughterher name is jennajenna thinks her mom might have kept a diary and she asked me if i could try to find it and do what with it see if it gave us any reason to think her moms death might have been a homicide glitsky boosted himself back onto his desk this was your case originally yeah anything point to homicide back then when was this maybe early february and not really no except that jenna had such a hard time with accepting that her mother would do that well god knows weve seen that before darrel not that i blame her your mother goes that way you dont want to believe it maybe you honestly cant believe it but that doesnt mean it didnt happen i know i told her id look thats all no promises for this diary i dont know abe that might not be all i worked the case pretty hard when it was live there were other elements at the time well to be honest mostly one other element but it seemed worth checking out although at the time i couldnt get anything on it what was that the dad charlie he disappeared last summer thats supposedly why the wife killed herself what do you mean disappeared i mean poof gone vanished no trace jenna thinks he wouldnt have just disappeared either she thought he might have been killed by who why no idea very strong darrel so she thinks her father was killed too and that its somehow connected to her mothers suicide not suicide she doesnt buy suicide she thinks her mother was another homicide two homicides glitsky sat with it for another few seconds bracco made a face the daughter lost both parents in the same year if the diary turns up he shrugged who knows we might get something so where are you gonna start i suppose ill meet her and go through all the evidence again then maybe get to the fathers files which i never really looked into last time what files his work files he was a lawyer maybe it was something he was working on what was the reason he was killed glitsky scratched for a second at the corner of his mouth bracco had always been an enthusiastic cop but hed gotten promoted up to homicide originally because his father had been a driver to a former mayor and sometimes his lack of experience showed you realize i know darrel glitsky said that most middleaged guys who disappearim assuming this charlie bowen was middleaged fifty there you go sometimes guys like him just walk away from it all on their own theyre not murdered right i know that abe of course and the wives of those men who have been deserted by their husbands of say thirty years might they find themselves depressed in the months following the desertion even to the point of wanting to kill themselves sure did we investigate bowen as a homicide when he went missing no and that was because he was considered a missing person not a homicide not a homicide no sir okay then just to make the point i hear you bracco shrugged away his misgivings anyway ill be logging some time to the case and i thought youd want to know okay glitsky pushed himself off his desk and wrote the word bowen onto the board with the name bracco in the investigating inspectors column but darrel yes sir maybe not too much time huh over the past several years glitskys grown boysisaac jacob and oreland treyas grown girl raney had created a diaspora of their own to places as farflung as seattle milan washington dc andnot so farflungorel was living in san jose now the new family unit with two toddlers ranged in the same old upper duplex on a culdesac above lake street when glitsky got home from workdriving his own car instead of being chauffeured by his driver in his cityissued vehiclehe and treya and fiveyearold rachel had pushed zacks baby carriage for a mile or so on the footandbike path that ran behind their home at the edge of the presidios forest in their backyard in the stillwarm evening both kids swung on the new swingset glitsky and dismas hardy and hardys son vincent had built about three years before dinner was a storebought roast chicken the skin peeled off with fresh steamed spinach and a side dish of noodles for the kidssince glitskys heart attack six years ago treya wouldnt let him eat anything with cholesterol in it by eight oclock both kids were asleep in their separate rooms down the hallway off the kitchen abe and treya sipped tea sitting together in dim light on the leather love seat in the small living room they had redecorated the room for the birth of rachel and now what had been a worn and dark interior sported blond hardwood floors accented with colorful throw rugs yellow tuscan walls missionstyle furniture plantation shutters taciturn nearly to the point of muteness glitsky was happy to let treya carry the conversational ball as she told him about her day the machinations of the das office clarence jackmans dealings with the board of supervisors the mayor the chief of police it was endlessly entertaining because they both knew all the players and because the city was in many ways such a truly loony and fascinating place to live todays drama featured treyas boss on a tightrope walk between mayor kathy wests edict that declared san francisco a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants and the us attorneys response that he was going to cut off every federal law enforcement grant to the city if she did anything to hamper the justice departments crackdown on arresting and deporting these people that id like to see glitsky said whats he going to do arrest kathy if she actually does anything other than talk the talk you think she will i dont know shes talking about it treyas laugh was a low contralto talking about not just talking about it very bold très but you never know she might really do something so whats clarence going to do treya laughed again sometimes glitsky thought that her talent for laughter was what had attracted him the most about her after his first wife flo had died he had thought for a long while that he would never laugh again clarence treya said has got eight lawyer positions funded by federal money but the rest of his budget comes from the city he is going to wait hes a good waiter glitsky said one of the best she put a hand on his leg but here ive been me me me you seemi dont mean to spook youbut slightly more upbeat than youve been glitsky shrugged just getting used to the new world order i actually had a possibly productive talk with darrel bracco today i like darrel and possibly productive wow the man gushes sipping his tea glitsky gave her a sideways look maybe saved him some hours of slog thats all okay retract the gush she squeezed his leg and next you were probably going to tell me what darrel talked to you about if you were going to keep on talking i mean not that you have to no pressure this time his smile broke clear he was going to be spending half of forever looking into the case files of this lawyer who disappeared last summer because some poor heartbroken girl thinks maybe he didnt run away and desert her and her mother after all maybe he was killed instead is there any reason she thinks that not that darrel knows but the thing that makes it so sad is that her mother killed herself over it a couple of months ago and the girl just cant accept it treya took a beat and sipped her tea and people say youre not really all that fun how can that be she turned to him that heartening upbeat story was whats made you feel better about the job talking to darrel glitsky said ah the silver lining i mean first youve got to believe charlie bowen was a homicide which theres no sign of so why are you even looking charlie bowen treya said where do i know that name hes the father the missing person the lawyer i knew him abe hes the guy diz got all his files our own diz our own diz treya gave his leg another squeeze maybe darrel ought to talk to him the next morning friday may glitsky and treya drove in to work together through the largesse of clarence jackman treya had a dedicated parking spot behind the jail that she considered perhaps the jobs single greatest perk yesterdays high pressure front had scoured the sky clean and banished the marine layer halfway out to the farallones so the sun packed an unseasonable warmth though there was no breeze at all some fluke of nature had delivered a fragrant and powerful olfactory blast from the citys main flower market around the corner treya getting out on the passenger side looked over the cars hood at her husband and said this day is too beautiful do you smell that if we were truly evolved spirits no way would we go in to work today no what would we do instead whatever we wanted dance sing take the ferry to sausalito glitsky met her in front of the car and took her hand as they started toward the hall of justice if we were truly evolved he said wed probably get fired so luckily were not well maybe youre not she ceased walking effectively stopping them both and sniffed the air aggressively but im at least taking one extra minute here to enjoy this smelling the roses as it were you should try it close your eyes a second breathe it in glitsky did as instructed then opened his eyes yep roses he said and then all that other stuff when glitsky opened the door to homicides reception area he was looking at dismas hardy who was dressed for work in his suit and tie and looking at his watch two minutes late hardy said what kind of example is that to set for your team treya held me up he said we stopped in the parking lot to smell the flowers how were they really great flowerlike glitsky greeted the two clerks that sat at their desks and then swung open the door to the counter that divided the room indicating that hardy follow him in opening the door to his office glitsky asked did we have an appointment no i didnt think so but you called me last night if you remember which i bet you do i didnt get in till too late to call you back something about charlie bowen hardy took one of the chairs from against the back wall and pulled it up to sit on it glitsky got himself seated behind his desk his name got you down here first thing in the morning not really ive got a hearing downstairs at ten anyway hardy crossed a leg so youre going to tell me they found his body why do you say that lets see youre homicide you call me about a guy who went missing ten months ago call me crazy but i figure maybe hes suddenly become a homicide nope thats not it good guess though thank you you want me to make another one you could or i could just tell you okay lets go with that glitsky gave it to him in about ten sentences at the end of which hardy was frowning so your guy bracco he said wants to do what exactly find this diary which may or may not exist right and then which may or may not have anything to do with charlies wifes death glitsky shrugged his shoulders this isnt my idea diz treya just thought you might save bracco some running around if i could id be happy to but were talking like sixty large boxes of files about a third of which weve already farmed out or returned to clients right i know besides which hardy said the timings wrong if the wife died in february i had the files in my office by middecember she couldnt have dropped the diary into any of them even if she wanted to you want though ill get one of my people to go through the boxes on everything weve got left but i wouldnt get my hopes up thats what i told darrel there you go hardy said standing up great minds oh no wait that couldnt be it glitsky was picking up his telephone get the door on your way out would you hardy had taken up the habit of his nowdeceased mentor david freeman and whenever the opportunity presented itself walked the fourteen blocks between his office on sutter street and the hall of justice today his morning hearing having ended sooner than expected he was making pretty good timenot that it was a race or an opportunity for exercise or anything like thatwhen he got to mission street there a welldressed elderly woman caught his eye and moved just a bit over to get in his path she looked into his face beamed at him and said pardon me yes are you all right i think so she didnt look like it but hardy suddenly had no doubt that she was yet another in a city full of crazies then you ought to smile excuse me a day like this a handsome man like you ought to be smiling i wasnt not really no more like frowning more like the whole worlds on your shoulders sorry he stammered trying to rearrange his expression better much the woman said you watch itll help have a nice day after she disappeared into the crowd hardy stood for a long moment unable to move catching his reflection in the store window next to him he saw that the smile hed dredged up had already faded completely away stepping all the way out of the foot traffic into the archway entrance to an ancient storefront on an impulse he pulled his cell phone off his belt and punched in a number hey he said hey yourself this is a surprise is everything all right fine everythings fine i just wondered what you were doing when like now his wifes laugh tinkled through the phone like now im about to get in my car and go eat a salad someplace why because i thought for a change of pace maybe youd like to have some lunch with your husband hardy waited out the short pause then i would love to have some lunch with my husband i think thats a great idea youre not too busy ive got two hours and change where were you thinking they decided on tommys joynt hardy by cab and frannie by car since it was about midway between frannies office on arguello and hardys downtown fifteen minutes after the phone call they sat down in one of the booths hardy with a bowl of buffalo stew and a beer and frannie with a french dip and diet coke you dont come to tommys joynt and eat a salad she said biting into one of the places homemade pickles i mean its legal and all but it would be wrong its not that i dont agree with you hardy said but if you really wanted a salad we could have hey she put a hand over his were here she said this is the perfect spot right now there couldnt be a better one hardy looked around and nodded no he sighed you said it its perfect frannie cocked her head dismas are you all right youre the second person whos asked me that in the last half hour so apparently not the second one who else he told her about the lady at the corner of mission you mean out of everybody walking down the street she just stopped you and told you to smile right but first she asked me if i was okay that i looked like i was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders then after she left i realized that that was pretty much the way i felt i dont know why i wasnt consciously down or anything its an absolutely glorious day he put down his fork looked across at her anyway it hit me pretty good upside the head almost like a message from on high saying what one thing saying i ought to call you im glad you did me too he picked up his fork again put it in the stew stirred a minute i never thought id say this but i think im having some trouble with this empty nest thing she put her sandwich down and again covered his hand with hers yeah and then ive been pretty pissed off at you for not being home when i get there so i arrange not to be home when you are maybe i dont even consciously know im doing that but i think thats whats been going on its wearing me down i know its wearing me down too she brought a napkin up to her eye and dabbed at it i dont really miss them so much you know i mean i dont want them living with us anymore god knows we did enough of that i just dont seem to know what to do with myself so i fill up all my time with work and then when i come home and youre not there either hardy finally got some of the great stew into his mouth followed it with some anchor steam im thinking maybe we ought to reinstigate date night make it sacred again i think thats a great idea maybe even go wild and have two a week i would if you would deal she put her hand out over the table and hardy shook it an hour later hardy ascended the steps into the wide marbled circular foyer that marked the reception area of the law firm of freeman farrell hardy roake of which he was the managing partner he marched up to the waisthigh mahogany bullpen that demarked the territory of phyllis the firms receptionist and obeying the finger she held up waited while she placed a call to one of the other offices when she finished her business she turned to him with her usual expectant petulance i told an inspector bracco that you would be here at one oclock she said which is when you told me that you would be here i know phyllis im sorry something came up and your cell phone broke you know now that you mention ithardy held his jacket down over the holster for his phoneive been looking all over for the damn thing have you seen it maybe i left it in my office somewhere or the car i bet i left it charging in the car she shook her head with an icy disdain he waited forty minutes im sure he did did he leave a number we can get back to him of course but i wanted to be sure you were here as well you should phyllis as well you should would you like me to call him now he may not be far away its only been twenty minutes after all since he left hardy considered that for a second he had thought about driving down the peninsula and getting some unscheduled time to ambush mary patricia whelanmiille on his scholler appeal but if bracco was still close to the office he was all but certain that it would be a short meeting sure he said call him back if he can make it phyllis started punching buttons hardy made it to the door of his office when his cell phone rang on his belt stopping him in his tracks as he lifted the phone and looked at the display screen the call was from his offices main number his shoulders fell and he turned around to face her phyllis her mouth set in disapproval shook her head at him maybe you left it charging in your car or maybe not busted ill try to reach inspector bracco now she said bracco could have been the poster child for the good homicide cop he went about five foot ten a hundred and seventy pounds of muscle he wore a tailored camelhair sport coat over a pair of brown slacks a light tan dress shirt with a plain brown tie under a closecropped head of strawcolored hair gray eyes animated his square ruddy cleanshaven face now bracco sipped a cup of freshly brewed coffee and sat comfortably in a leather chair by one of the windows that looked down on sutter street this was in the more casual of the two seating areas that distinguished hardys officethe other formal more intimidating space with the persian carpet the queen anne chairs and lions claw coffee table complete with doily claimed the area more or less in front of his large cherry desk hardy went to the twin of braccos chair and sat down he began on a conciliatory note im sorry you had to wait last time you were here there was some confusion about my schedule bracco turned up a palm dismissing the apology youre doing me the favor seeing me at all i appreciate it sure but i told abe itd probably be pretty slim pickins thats what he said he also said you offered to have one of your people go through bowens files but that you didnt expect to find mrs bowens diary in them only because she would have still been writing in it i presume when the files had already been removed here to our storage glitsky said you werent even sure there actually was a diary no well jennabowens daughtershes pretty sure there was a diary although i went through the house again this morning with a comb and nothing turned up well hardy wasnt sure where he fit in this picture but he didnt want to give bracco the bums rush after his wait earlier let the man at least finish his coffee i cant speak for the files weve already finished with but if you want me to light a fire under this we can probably get through the rest of them in a couple of days ive just gotten back to the office otherwise i would have had somebody on it already is there some kind of hurry i dont know about bracco shook his head just jenna to be honest with you for the first few weeks after her moms death she was pretty much out of commission with grief now shes trying to process it close the book one way or the other if theres a diary and some clue he shrugged anyway so no theres no real hurry but i feel like a owe her another look if its that important to her and it is hardy sat back and crossed his legs so i take it you had the moms case right and you were okay with the coroners call pretty much did you see anything or talk to anybody that made you think it wasnt a suicide generally no i mean her husband had vanished a few months before shed made plans to go to italy this summer but the general feeling was that that was to try to put the desertion behind her not to party most of her friends and i talked to a lot of them described her as devastated and depressed so whats her daughters take i think pretty much the usual her mother just wouldnt have done that thats not who she was then she points to the europe trip hannathe momwas evidently pretty frugal tight as a drum jenna says she would never have bought tickets to italy and not used them she would have killed herself afterward hardy allowed a small grin i know some people like that although putting off your own suicide until after you get your moneys worth might be stretching it and thats it thats the daughters reason she thinks it wasnt suicide originally basically yes bracco drank some coffee stared out the window for a moment hardy had the impression he was trying to decide if he should say any more and thought he could help him along thats a lot of disclaimer youre throwing around originally basically do you have some doubts yourself is that why youre digging here braccos mouth pursed as he continued to wrestle with whatever it was it was their rope she slung it over a beam in the garage got up on a little stepup ladder and dropped off but noticing that his coffee was finished bracco came forward in his chair and put the cup and saucer on the low table in front of him now he looked straight across at hardy none of this worried me too much at the time you understand i had three other actives this one went to the coroner and went away in a couple of days it wasnt until jenna called me back a few days ago that i looked at it again and and her neck was broken he paused then made his point more clearly regular slipknot no hangmans noose fifteeninch fall youre thinking she should have strangled most people those same conditions thats what happens but not always did you ask strout this was the citys medical examiner whod ruled the death a suicide he says hes seen a few where the fall and the weight breaks the neck well there you go nobody who weighed as little as she did though a hundred and five pounds hardy made no response by itself this was interesting certainly but not conclusive and then bracco went on there was the other thing jenna didnt think about originally but remembers now what was that that her mother had decided that charlie didnt just disappear that hed been killed someone in her position hardy said that could easily be wishful thinking that he didnt leave her he was taken from her instead big psychological difference yeah bracco said but the main thing is that jenna says her mom was on a mission to find out who killed her dad and wouldnt have killed herself in the middle of it maybe she got to the end and found hed really run out on her i said the same thing to jenna she totally disagreed if her mom would have found that out even then if she decided to kill herself she would have left a note for jenna so at least her daughter would know the truth a short silence settled between the two men youre saying you think its not impossible somebody killed mrs bowen its not the kind of thing id try to sell to glitsky not on what ive got now you got a motive you probably wont love it try me somebodythe same personkilled the husband too and hanna got too close to finding out hardy shook his head suppressed the start of a smile a bona fide conspiracy theory youre right that would be a tough sell to glitsky thats why id like to find that diary it would be something real hardy thought that even if it existed it still would be considerably less than a smoking gun stealing a quick glance at his watch he decided hed given bracco enough time and a good listen bracco didnt wear a wedding ring and hardy wouldnt be at all surprised to find out that the daughter jenna bowen was a pretty young thing as for him it was time to get back to work he started to get up but bracco suddenly came forward anyway the reason i wanted to see you in person im just saying there might be something else in those files some reason bowen might have been killed you mean right this time hardy let his grin blossom you know how many big moving boxes were talking about here inspector something like fortyfive or fifty to go last time i checked when he disappeared charlie bowen was covering two hundred and thirtytwo active files of which weve offloaded about eighty so far he softened his tone which is not to say we wont come upon something that looks fishy somewhere down the line and if we do i promise youll hear from us from me but i think youre talking the original needle in a haystack chagrined bracco sat back and nodded yeah i can see that well he pushed himself up to his feet hardy rising himself said if you get anything specific attached to some probable cause you could always subpoena the files and have a special master go through them i could do that but i dont have any idea what im looking for well theres that hardy brightened except the diary right except the diary ill get somebody working on that before you hit the street i appreciate that bracco said extending his hand thanks again for your time hardy nodded and we find anything on the other matter youll be the first to know but as i told glitsky i wouldnt hold my breath on any of this bracco broke a small smile i never do hardy had a spy in redwood city his old law school buddy sean kelleher worked as an assistant district attorney in the same building as mary patricia whelanmiille and told hardy that she wasnt calendared for any trials and should be in or about her office for the whole day as soon as bracco had walked out of his office hardy had made the day of michael cho one of his paralegals by assigning him to start looking through the boxes of charlie bowens files for a womans diary then hed picked up the phone and called to make double sure about mary patricia told kelleher he owed him one and hightailed it down to his garage ten minutes later top down on his s hootie blaring from his cars speakers hardy cleared candlestick point and twenty minutes after that was parking in the courthouse lot twentyfive miles south if san francisco had been warm and pleasant all day redwood city in the mideighties was positively balmy as he brought the roof back up over the convertible he found himself humming out loud he felt like a different person from the stoopshouldered slug whod attracted the attention of the possiblynotcrazy elderly woman at the corner of seventh and mission that morning the lunch with frannie her receptiveness maybe the start of the next phase of their lives together after the unexpected hollow emptiness of the recent one the little dance he was doing around mary patricia whelanmiille was not frivolous he thought it so likely as to be certain that she would not consent to a regular scheduled appointment with him after all he was the man who was trying to undo all of the hard work shed put in on what was to date still one of the most successful moments of her career in fact he considered it not impossible that even his planned ambush of her would be rebuffed certainly there was no reason other than professional courtesy that she need feel compelled to see him he wasnt kidding himself he knew who he was he was the enemy when he arrived in redwood city he called kelleher who came out and walked him past the receptionist into the offices in the back he had a cup of coffee and shot the breeze a little and then asked kelleher to point him toward the lair of mary patricia whelanmiille her door was open and hardy stood for a second in the hallway trying to take her measure youngerlooking than hed expected with a very appealing profile she was sitting forward in her chair her elbows on her desk one hand playing with a loose tendril of blondish hair apparently reading her feet shoeless were tucked back under her chair it was a fridayafternoon scene similar to one hed seen a thousand times in the legal worldthe alone as opposed to lonely time every good lawyer needed to keep up on facts to study cases to stay current on changes in the law to recharge part of him hated to bother her the rest of him stepped forward and knocked softly on her door excuse me she turned to face him her expression just short of querulous yes it said he was interrupting her but she could be serene about it the petulance gave way to a mild curiosity can i help you i think so he pointed to the name on her door if youre mary patricia whelanmiille thats me thats some name tell me about it sometimes i wonder what my parents were thinking mississippi and all of new york pardon she straightened up in her chair put her hands behind her lower back and arched herself briefly getting out the kinks or showing off the merchandise nine syllables she said mary patricia whelanmiille mississippi and all of new york imagine having to ask people to say mississippi and all of new york every time they wanted to address you by name youd never talk to anybody she broke a nice smile people call me mills who are you hardy came forward and introduced himself dismas she asked dismas i dont think ive ever met a dismas youre not alone he was the good thief on calvary next to jesus also hes the patron saint of thieves and murderers good for him im proud of him ive always wanted to be patron saint of something except i understand first youve got to be dead and thats got limited appeal mills swung in around to face him so dismas how can i help you well speaking of appeal i wanted to ask you for a few minutes of your time to talk about the scholler case im doing the appeal the mildly flirtatious personality dropped off her like the calving of a glacier leaving only the cold flat ice behind i have nothing to say about that i won the case i dont think there are any legitimate appealable issues you dont think ptsd should have been let in if youve read the transcripts you know i argued against just that and prevailed that was the right call and now im sorry but im in the middle of you spoke to charlie bowen im only asking for the same courtesy charlie bowen made an appointment with me and we set ground rules ill go with ground rules hardy said same as charlies do you even know what they were it doesnt matter ill agree unseen theres a desperate offer she folded her arms over her chest look mr hardy dismas mr hardy please i dont want to be a hardass but im not going to talk to you about evan scholler he was guilty and i got him convicted and i hope he rots away in prison thats all ive got to say all right please hardy counted five of his heartbeats of course there always had been the makeanappointmentandsetgroundrules option but hed never before had a conference like that produce anything of real substance if you wanted your soda to fizz and bubble you had to shake it up but now he was looking at turning around and driving back home facing a weekend with absolutely nothing to chew on and work with the words and the idea came out of his mouth before he was aware that hed thought of them anything to keep her talking with him how about if i dont talk about that case at all she cocked her head still wary then what exactly would we be talking about charlie bowen what about him anything he might have said to you before he disappeared that stopped her she combed her hand through her hair made a face at him that could have meant anything looked down at her desk back at hardy why do you want to do that he disappeared while he was working on this appeal before i get too far with it i dont want to have the same thing happen to me she shook her head chortling dont be ridiculous hed barely started even the preliminary work i dont think hed even finished the transcripts when i talked to him so what did you talk about he wanted to review the evidence that hadnt been used at the trial to see if i had any working papers not included in the defense discovery stuff like that just to make sure the record was complete while he was going ahead housecleaning he didnt mention any personal conflicts no if i recall the meeting lasted under the hour we didnt get too close but he was going ahead with the appeal of course thats why we were talking at all he didnt seem nervous or overly concerned with his safety why would he be the bad guy was already in jail shaking her head as if to clear away that thought she went on i hate the appeals process you know that they ought to give our side an appeals process if we lose a casetry the scumbags again until we get em and put em away yeah thats mills washburn said shes a bit of a zealot but shes also only the second person in thirty years to whip me in court so shes got my respect hardy had thought it was late enough in the day that there would be a good chance hed find washburn at the broadway tobacconists and he was right now they sat in a cloud of cigar smoke in the back of the unpretentious little store except for greta the female proprietor they had the place to themselves a situationwashburn assured himthat would change in the next hour when his acolytes and his girlfriend would appear from their various offices to drink from the vast fount of my knowledge not entirely sure washburn was poking fun at himself hardy said well whatever time you and i get together here its on the clock goes without saying washburn savored his smoke drawing on it exhaling another plume he twirled the cigar around between his lips then dipped the unlit end into a small glass of amber liquid which from the bottle next to it was armagnac sure you wont join me thanks but then id just want a little nip of your nectar and im going to be driving probably wise so how can i help you today well this is odd but it came to me when i was trying to get to mills i didnt even see a draft of charlie bowens appeal brief in the file so im assuming he hadnt gotten to it id also been assuming that he was going to go with the ptsd but now im wondering if hed mentioned anything about that to you what what he was basing his appeal on especially if it wasnt ptsd washburn sat back drew on his cigar held the smoke actually he said you raise a good point another pause while he dipped the cigar again in the armagnac you know he seemed to think that it might be more fruitful to attack the competency of the local constabulary as well as the fbi hows that well the khalil murders turning the cigar between his lips washburn sat back pensive i mean here you had two murders intimately connected with the scholler casethere was no question of thatand a blatant assumption that evan had committed them with the frag grenades and so on but the da never charged him with those murders you see the issue hardy saw it plainly and it struck him as unusually powerful so the police and the fbi never questioned anyone else and on one hand washburn added why would they they had a suspect they could convict and may as well send him down for one murder as for three without the risk of losing on the other two you mean they never questioned anyone else about the khalil murders i assume they must have a few people anyway but certainly not everyone they could have he took in a huge lungful of the pungent air youre forgetting though and i wonder if mr bowen did as well that you cant base your appeal on evidence that isnt discussed in the record the court doesnt know anything that the court reporter hasnt taken down im not forgetting that hardy said but then who killed the khalils well if you believe evan ron nolan did did you believe evan washburn seemed to be considering it for the first time in a long while you know now that you mention it yes i think i do evan just didnt smuggle small arms and grenades out of iraq as souvenirs he was only over there a matter of weeks in the brief time he had there he couldnt have both found a source for these things and arranged to find a way to send them home especially when you consider he was airlifted out of there unconscious and with no warning id be surprised if he got out with his own socks much less all this hardware he studied his cigars lengthy ash no he repeated it beggars belief that just didnt happen so where did that stuff in nolans closet come from it must have been from nolan himself wouldnt you think he could move about a lot more freely and he had both more time and a lot more contacts than evan ever did hardy sat back in his chair his elbow on the armrest his hand resting over his mouth in deep thought okay he said in a faraway voice lets go with nolan killing the khalils for a minute i dont want to jump too far ahead of ourselves here can we take that as fact after a small hesitation washburn nodded i do all right then heres the milliondollar question why did he do it i dont know was there any speculation you heard washburn shook his head now troubled by this as well somehow that just never became part of the discussion did it asking himself he turned to face hardy even when everyone was taking it for granted that evan had killed them i dont remember anyone stopping to examine the why of it too closely he drew on his smoke i think there was more or less an assumption that it was something that had happened in iraq that we would never find out about maybe it was something personal or maybe he just hated iraqis in general for what they had done to him and at the same time he could frame nolan for the murders and eliminate his rival for tara it was a great opportunity to kill two birds with one stone if you happened to be a psychopath which some people thought evan was but nobody asked the hard questions apparently not even though the fbi was all over this thing it wasnt really a question does that strike you as the fbi we all know and love clearly washburn too had caught the bug his eyes were alight with possibility if nolan did in fact kill the khalils he said contemplatively then certainly anyone in the khalil familyiraq being the tribal culture that it iswould have had not just a motive but an obligation to kill him hardy lowwatt electricity running through him leaned forward elbows on his knees what do you think are the odds that the fbi never talked to any of the khalils zero and yet now that you mention it all the interviews we got were from the redwood city police and it was a pretty perfunctory job so youre telling me the fbi would have relied on the locals to talk to witnesses in a potential terrorism case i dont think so washburn nodded and nodded son of a bitch he said unmistakable glee in his voice youre talking brady hardy his mouth set tried to keep his elation lowkey youre damn right i am the reference was to what was commonly called a brady violation in brady v maryland the supreme court held that a defendant had a right to any evidence that was in the possession of the prosecution that might cast doubt on his guilt whether or not it was eventually to be used at trial the prosecution was absolutely required to turn over any background testimony evidence interviewsanythingthat could exculpate a defendant if the prosecution withheld any of this discovery and the withheld material was reasonably likely to undermine confidence in a guilty verdict then these were grounds to reverse a conviction of course evidence of such a violation was never found in the courts records the whole point was that the prosecution had withheld the evidence and the defense didnt find out about it until sometime after the trial this opened up an entirely new strategic element hardy and washburn both keenly understood the situation if in fact the fbi had interviewed witnesses in the khalil killings and did not supply either the witnesses or the testimony or both to the prosecution which the prosecution was then mandated to turn over to evans defense it was highly possible that they were looking at a brady violation the added beauty of the situation was that mills didnt even have to know about the withheld evidence the fbi was legally construed to be part of the prosecutors team and mills was responsible for turning over that evidence whether or not the fbi told her about it of course proving not only that the fbi had held back evidence but also that the withheld evidence was likely to undermine confidence in the guilty verdict against evan scholler was another problem but hardy would face that when he came to it for the moment the brady possibility if he could get it off the ground by finding an fbi witness or two that hadnt made it into the scholler record meant that he could file a writ of habeas corpus with declarations and get it in front of the court of appeals in relatively short order the court of appeals could then remand it back down to redwood city probably back to tollsons courtroom whereif they were hearing new evidenceanything might happen washburn tapped hardys knee snapping him from his reverie its still going to be a long shot proving the evidence is exculpatory he said essentially youll have to prove somebody else other than evan might well have killed nolan which i must tell you from bitter experience is a tough nut he lowered his voice it might even be contrary to fact maybe not hardy said it might be enough for the court if i prove that somebody else had a reason to the old lawyer shook his head that im afraid is wishful thinking not at all if there was another plausible suspect the jury didnt get to hear about washburn frowned and the fbi which withheld it last time and which is immune to state process is going to hand it over now how are you going to make them do that i dont know hardy said its a work in progress hardy drove back up to the city on the freeway got off on the ocean side of town at nineteenth avenue and at a couple of minutes after the official beginning of the cocktail hour walked into the front door of the bar he partly owned the little shamrock moses mcguire his brotherinlaw out of rehab now this past year or more was behind the bar at the far end by the beer taps to hardy he looked impossibly fit although maybe it was simply the fact that hed lost thirty pounds and cleaned up his appearance along with his bloodstream perennially shaggy and longhaired often bearded mcguire had cultivated more or less the look of a biker or a mountain man since his twentieswhich is to say for nearly forty years faded often tattered blue jeans and some crummy tshirt seemed as much a part of his personality as his justly fabled temper his casual disdain for convention his fondness for altered states of consciousness down at the end of the bar today passing the time with a pretty young woman he might have been a midforties banker on his day off the stillfull head of saltandpepper hair was short and neatly parted the mustache trimmed in an otherwise closely shaved face hed tucked the tails of his blue dress shirt into a pair of khakis hed had his nose broken often enough in bar fights that hardy thought hed always look a bit battered but today his eyes were clear his skin nearly devoid of the capillary etching that had been a regular feature of his face in the heavy drinking days that had comprised the majority of his adult life as a sometime bartender and partowner hardy could have gone around the bar and helped himself to whatever he wanted but occasionally you got back there and found you couldnt easily get yourself out and tonight was supposed to be the first of his new date nights with frannie and he didnt want to start it off on the wrong foot so he pulled up a stool and gave mcguire a casual nod which brought him right on down whats the word counselor hendricks over one onion thats four words and ive got cucumber hardy nodded even better and while youre pouring ive got a question for you hazel mcguire didnt miss a beat although some people think theyre more green but id call them hazel kind of a bedroom hazel mcguire grabbed a glass threw in some ice reached up behind him to the premium gin row and brought down the round dark bottle of hendricks gin after a quick free pour to an eighth of an inch below the rim he cut a fresh slice of cucumber and dropped it on top santé he said placing it on the cocktail napkin hed laid down on the bar okay whats your real question its a long one mcguire scanned the length of the bar and around the corners of the room none of which were very far away the shamrock was a small neighborhood place that had been in its same location at lincoln and ninth avenue since the grandfather clock against the wall behind hardy had stopped during the great earthquake of and nobodyd set it running again since the pretty girl had gone back to her friends by the dartboards and all of the other twenty patrons seemed comfortably settled at the bar or on the couches in back thats all right mcguire said the crowds pretty much under control on the drive up from redwood city after hed wrestled with some of the problems raised by the brady violation issues hardy had returned to the question that he still hadnt answered and that in his and washburns enthusiasm for brady theyd inadvertently let drop so after filling in his brotherinlaw on some of the backgroundwith a doctorate in philosophy from uc berkeley mcguires ability to grasp facts and concepts had always been impressive even when he was in the bag now that he was sober it was formidablehardy came out with it again so the question is why did nolan kill the khalils piece of cake mcguire said it was his job hardy drank off some of the rosescented ginhed come to love this stuff just like that his job sure hes a seal right hes a trained assassin you remember the seals in nam shit killers and now hes working for this security company in iraq allstrong right allstrong but he was a recruiter over here mose hiring people no way was he doing wet work right im sure with his background no way he wasnt if it was needed and why would it have been needed with the khalils i dont know not enough information but they were iraqi nestce pas yep well then you check it out i bet you find they have family or something over there and they were somehow getting in the way of allstrongs business so they kill the father over here mcguire nodded sending a message pretty long distance wouldnt you say the father was probably running the business from over here cut off the head the body dies this isnt brain surgery diz all this didnt come out at the trial none of it did why not well the easy answer is that everybody on the prosecution team thought my guy had been the killer and the motive was mostly personal about him and nolan but you think it was nolan im beginning to and youre thinking then that this stuff about him ought to have been in the trial precisely hmm let me think about it he walked down the bar and saw to a couple of drink orders shooting himself a club soda from the gun he came back down to hardy okay he said ive got it all figured out hit me nolan killed these khalil people and then their family killed him in retaliation howd they know he did it they put it together that it was allstrong because of what was going on in iraq whatever that was once they knew that they found out nolan was allstrongs man over here even if he wasnt the actual killer they were striking back and getting revenge howd they know where he lived diz please its cake to find people nowadays you got a computer they probably knew where hed be living before he moved in come on this doesnt sing for you no it does thats the problem whys it a problem because if it happened the way you say my clients innocent and this is bad news because because hes about three years into life in prison right now moses tipped up his club soda could be worse true hardy said but it also could damn sure be better but why didnt the prosecution look into that frannie asked between bites of her calamari i mean i can see them finally deciding it was probably your guy evan but youd think theyd at least question some of the victims family too wouldnt they if only to find out some background on them more than background frannie these were two murders just thinking it was evan shouldnt have been nearly enough they would have wanted to prove it and maybe send him to death row they were at pane e vino back on union street not far from washburns office and here it had finally chilled down enough to make them decide to eat inside they were up right in the window dusk hadnt yet progressed into dark frannies shoulderlength red hair brought out the contrasting green in her eyes which were the same color as the silken blouse she worea visual that even after all of their time together still captivated hardy dipping some of the fresh warm bread into the restaurants little dish of olive oil hardy pinched some salt from the open bowl and sprinkled it over his upcoming bite but just because we have no record that anybody from the fbi talked to them doesnt mean that it didnt happen washburn and i have developed a theory about that which is that the fbi interviewed these people and didnt pass their information on to the police or the da why wouldnt they do that well the simple answer is because they didnt have to but another answer is maybe they just didnt want to and finally washburns personal favorite and maybe my own is perhaps they were ordered not to why would that be evidently that is not a question for us mere mortals frannie chewed thoughtfully sipped at her chardonnay so what are you going to do well first thing ive already done it driving up i called wyattthis was wyatt hunt hardys private investigatorand asked him to try to find anybody in the extended khalil family that the fbi actually talked to and the beauty of it is that it doesnt even really matter too much what they said if the fbi talked to them at all about the khalil murders and didnt see fit to tell the da then weve got a real discovery issue hardy put his wine down moses you know thinks evan might even be innocent and why does my brilliant brother think that well the great thing about mose as you know is that he can build these complex theories without any reference to the facts or maybe with just one teensy little fact and which one was that in this case that nolan killed the khalils you think thats a fact hardy considered nodded close enough i dont think evan did thats for sure so based on that according to mose evan didnt kill nolan the khalils did frannies face grew dark she placed her hands carefully apart on either side of her plate and these are the people youre hoping to go talk to these same people who killed nolan we dont know they killed nolan thats just moses theory but even as he said it hardy knew where his wife was coming from and why she suddenly was so concerned he couldnt deny the sharp tickle of apprehension that washed over him as well and he realized it was not altogether ungrounded frannie was already concerned and she wasnt even aware yet that there was any question about what had happened to charlie bowen whether hed in fact actually disappeared or whether hed been the victim of foul play perhaps following the same path upon which hardy was thinking to embark he sucked in a quick breathhe didnt want frannie to worry about thatthen picked up his wineglass and took a sip i know what youre saying he told her but if these guys were a real problem on that level ive got to believe the fbi with all of its resources would have gotten some inkling of it wouldnt you think i would think that yes but then what then id think they would have arrested somebody thats what they do frannie they find bad guys and put them away except if this one time they in fact didnt why wouldnt they for the same reasons you just gave me why they didnt tell the da about these interviews youre pretty sure they had she ticked them off on her fingers they didnt have to they didnt want to or they were ordered not to hardy acknowledged the point with a small nod well he said ive got to believe theres a quantum difference between not turning over interview notes and not arresting someone they knew was a killer dismas she put her fork down and met his eyes i never actually thought id say this but you dont watch enough television on thesopranos the fbi turn mobsters all the time and leave them in place for years hoping to scoop up the big fish meanwhile all these other people are getting beat up and killed this happens in real life too everybody knows this he nodded again true it just seems a ways off on this case at least at this point when everythings speculation do me a favor would you anything my love if it moves beyond speculation take a little extra care if these people killed nolan they could kill you hardy knew that she might be right but so was hethis was a long way from being established im not a threat to the khalils he said i dont want to prove anything about what they did or didnt do i just want to know if the fbi talked to them and didnt tell the redwood city cops about it so i dont think we have to worry too much about anything happening to me oh okay she said with an edge then ill be sure not to another of the changes in frannies life after her own children had moved out was that she had turned into a baby junkie so after dinner since they would be driving right by the glitskys flat on their way home anyway she suggested that they should call their friends and see if they wanted company back a few years ago when date night had been truly sacred especially during rachels first year this postprandial visit had become a weekly ritual now while frannie and treya and even rachel passed the infant zachary back and forth with suitable enthusiasm in the living room the two men sat on the steps overlooking their swingset project in glitskys small backyard and talked quietly very quietly about charlie bowen you really think hes a homicide glitsky was nowhere near as defensive as he might have been if either bowen or his wife had disappeared on his watch rather than on marcel laniers so hardys theories were interesting and maybe even fun to talk about but they werentyetglitskys problems not exactly hardy said its just suddenly im finding myself a little more curious about what happened to the guy youre building the whole thing on a bunch of ifs you see that dont you well not all of them are ifs scholler didnt kill the khalils for example that just didnt happen that doesnt mean nolan did no thats true hardy rubbed his palms together but lets say that a homicide professional such as yourself had a hunch somebody had been killed even if there was no body and no evidence how would you go about finding out if you were right glitsky didnt hesitate id trace his last days his last hours if i could so do you know anything about bowens last days last hours in the light from the bulb over the back door glitsky turned to his friend his face partly in shadow with its hatchet nose and the whitish scar coursing through both of his lips might have been some kind of terrible tribal mask fearsome and powerful i dont know anything about bowen period diz as far as im concerned hes a missing person hardy sat musing he wasnt here to argue an animal scurried through the brush on the presidios grounds your man bracco came by my office today too hardy said on this bowen thing charlie no the wife right glitsky said he wanted this alleged diary he did but he also had a few other concerns that had just come up hardy went into it in some detail braccos discoveries that the very light hanna bowen had broken her neck in a relatively short fall without a hangmans noose that shed come to believe her husband had been murdered bracco also apparently did not think it inconceivable that charlie bowen had been murdered and that it might have had something to do with one of the cases hed been working on i told him hardy concluded that charlie had a couple of hundred cases and identifying any one of them as connected with murder was going to take a bit of doing but now glitsky said youre starting to think it might be scholler i dont know if id go that far yet i wouldnt try to take it to the bank but theres starting to be a hell of a lot of questions dont you think after a minute glitsky nodded its interesting he said ill go that far then you want me to do anything hardy shook his head i dont know what it would be abe braccos already on it even without the diary since you trained him hes probably doing that lasthoursandlastdays thing with mrs bowen maybe hell come up with something if darrel finds something that leads back to charlie diz and he starts to look like a homicide ill jump all over it thatd be good id appreciate it hardy fell into a silence again what are you thinking glitsky asked after a minute nothing yeah but its a loud nothing hardy took a breath i was just wondering if it was possible that the fbi knew who killed the khalils and didnt say anything about it because it was part of a bigger case glitsky looked over at him i missed a segue here i thought we were talking about the bowens now were talking about the fbi but its still scholler guy gets around hardy shrugged its a complicated case but part of it is how much the fbi didnt tell the da or even if they had another suspect they forgot to mention whatever it is glitsky said youll never know but you think its possible theyd deliberately withhold that kind of evidence as my father would say anythings possible if its the fbi id go a little further nothing is impossible theyd screw up a murder case on purpose not every day certainly not usually but for the right reason like what i dont know say maybe the guys a valuable snitch or hes a mole in a terrorist group glitsky snapped his fingers there you go hes giving the feebs good information on a terrorist cell i bet they wouldnt blink if he killed his girlfriend on the side say national security to these guys and anything goes you think glitsky chewed his cheek would i bet on it in this case maybe not do i think its ever happened definitely and more than once and if it happened here with the khalils hardy thought perhaps charlie bowen hadnt figured it out in time as he was preparing his appeal maybe the khalils had seen himjustifiablyas a threat a loose cannon who wouldnt hesitate to accuse them of murder if it would help get his client off and if they had or if one of them had in fact murdered ron nolan okay then heres another angle you might want to put in your pipe and smoke hardy said moses is of the opinionagain based on nothing but still hes not dumbhe thinks that nolan killed the khalils because it was his job they were iraqi and he worked for this company that does a lot of business in iraq allstrong security which is evidently but glitsky put a hand on his arm stopping him allstrong security yeah headquartered here and in i know where they are diz i know who they are unconsciously he tightened his grip on hardys arm nolan worked for allstrong how could i not have heard about that maybe because its a small detail about a trial in another county three years ago could that be it and why would it have mattered anyway but glitsky a muscle working in his jaw was inside himself putting something together he let go of hardys arm staring ahead of himself into the darkness abe talk to me slowly he began to spin it out as though to himself id bet my life its close to the same time frame something like three years ago right but ill check that what still glitsky hesitated we had a homicide here in the city of a guy whod been over in iraq working for allstrong his name if memory serves was arnold zwick somebody snapped his neck in an alley down in the mish left his wallet on him all right and this means no wait the same weekend a day or two later i think three more guys all together all muggers with sheets turn up dead on the street in the tenderloin two of em with their necks broken three broken necks thats what we said batiste thought it might be a serial killer starting out but nothing else happened no clues no suspects eventually it all just went away so what was the deal with allstrong nothing really glitsky still trying to process his memory we never found anything anyway the investigation never went anywhere but but witnesses told us zwick seemed to be rolling in cash before he got killed but we never found any of it except a couple of hundred in his wallet debra schiff thought hed embezzled it from allstrong in iraq then split they were getting paid mostly in cash back then her theory was that allstrong sent somebody back over here to find zwick make an example of him get the money back but as i say we never got a lick of proof and now youre thinking im not thinking anything yet except maybe moses might not be all wrong about nolan hardy sat elbows on his knees mulling over this new information let me ask you this abe youve got friends in the fbi right glitsky hit a onenote chuckle local cops like myself dont have what you call bosom buddies in the fbi diz but i know a few guys yeah maybe you could ask them a couple of discreet questions about this khalil case hardy shrugged and what glitsky asked makes you think theyd tell me anything at all about that especially if theyve kept something about it hidden all this time well hardy said i know the two agents who were involved in my case maybe you could just put in a good word and see if theyd talk to me i could do that sure which doesnt guarantee they will no i know that but it might help glitsky shrugged couldnt hurt unless it does and well never know either way anyway but ill put in the word at that moment the back door opened behind them frannie was standing there holding zachary with treya in the hallway behind her what are you guys plotting out here frannie asked violent overthrow of the government hardy replied its time we took control and fixed everything good idea treya said maybe abe could start the revolution with that squeak in our refrigerator door its been driving me crazy for weeks when they got home while frannie was in the bathroom getting ready for bed hardy moseyed on downstairs and picked up the telephone in the kitchen after three rings he got the answering machine for the hunt club wyatts private investigation agency wyatt his voice a whisper i just wanted to give you a headsup about the khalils you might want to keep a low profile and if you find out if and when somebody talked to the fbi go easy from there get as much detail as you can but if you meet any resistance at all dont make anybody mad at you just report back to me we dont want to raise any flags with them if youre getting the impression that the risk factors gone up around this thing that would be accurate so be careful just treat that as the word of the daycareful when he got back upstairs to the bedroom frannie was in her pajamas in the bed she put her book down whered you go off to just downstairs locking up thats all she gave him a quizzical look is everything okay fine hardy said everythings fine the questions ate away at hardy for the rest of the weekend and at seventhirty monday morning he called darrel bracco on his cell phone from home the inspector seemed glad to hear from him at such an early hour and told hardy that they still hadnt located hanna bowens diary but that yesterday hed talked to one of hannas best friends a woman named nora bonner and gotten what he called pretty strong corroboration for jennas opinion that her mother had not been suicidal bonner and hanna had gone out to dinner two days before she died and all shed been able to talk about was what she kept calling her husbands murder hanna didnt by any chance mention who she thought had killed him she thought it was something he was working on but didnt know what evidently he didnt talk about his cases at home so why did she think it was that the last couple of days he told her he thought he was onto something big that he might actually be doing some real good but he didnt say what it was he didnt want to jinx it before he had some answers so why didnt she hanna tell that to the police earlier if charlie was looking into something big because nobody was looking at charlies case thats why it wasnt a homicide remember all right hardy said let me ask you this if hanna was trying to find what charlie was doing how was she investigating it thats what im trying to find out if it were me id probably have gone to bowens secretary or maybe he was using a private eye but the problem is this is all ancient history now bowens gone most of a year whos gonna know or remember the secretary might right and she was itll be in his admin records while were looking in the files anyway then you just track her or him down hopefully still in town probably with another firm orheres a possible shortcutmaybe the daughter knew thats worth checking ill ask her bracco paused can i ask you one sure last time we talked at your office you didnt seem too enthusiastic about the odds of getting anything out of all this now youre calling me before im in at work did something happen i might want to know about hardy took a beat thats a fair question the answer is yeah although its all still pretty nebulous im working on the appeal for one of bowens cases that was hanging fire when he disappeared evan scholler some of the witnesses im hoping to talk to might have developed a motive to kill bowen youre shitting me its a long way from established but its something im looking at i talked to glitsky about it over the weekend what does he say what does abe usually say not much thats what he said this time too but im thinking if you can find some independent confirmation looking into hannas last days maybe that she had tried to contact these same people what are their names its a family the khalils hardy spelled it for him the father and mother were killed about four years ago in redwood city and everybody thought my guy scholler had done it now maybe not so these khalils killed their own parents no but they might have killed the guy scholler got sent up for if youre keeping score his name was ron nolan anyway ive got my investigator looking into this too so yeah id say its heating up but it might all fizzle and go away i should talk to these people too the khalils well hardy temporized first weve got to find out exactly who were talking about and at this point we dont have any idea its a big family and youre already well along on hannas last hours if you get something solid there youre ahead of me and then youve really got something to talk to these people about meanwhile i keep scratching and call you if i get anything real with respect sir if charlie bowens a murder its police work i couldnt agree more inspector im just trying to find grounds thatll fly for my appeal but hanna bowens murder if it was that is police work too and its way fresher bracco paused a little longer this time we ought to stay in touch thats my plan if you notice i made this phone call for example ive got no desire to work your case inspector really i just want to get my client out of jail bracco let out a little laugh god that just sounds so wrong my clients all i want to do is put em in jail at lunchtime hardy was down the peninsula again though he might have been able to get the information from his client everett washburn also knew tara wheatleys address and phone number and even where she worked hed left a message identifying himself as evans attorney and shed called right back on her break and agreed to meet him in front of her school at a quarter to noon as soon as he saw her as she walked out of the building and got close to where hed parked hardy understood a lot better what all the fuss had been about hed just read a book called silent joe by one of his favorite authors t jefferson parker where one of the underlying concepts was the idea of the woman who possessed what one of the characters called the unknown thingan attractive force so powerful that it altered the orbit of every man it encountered it wasnt mere physical beauty or sexuality though they both were part of it it was something bigger more inclusive subtler and far more dangerous whatever the unknown thing was tara wheatley had it in spades when she got to the passenger door she stopped and beamed a smile down at hardy that at another time in his life would have melted him she wore sunglasses against the bright day her hair was down the plain paleorange cotton dress she wore revealed nothingit came to below her kneesand yet stirred something that to his old bones felt primal what is it about guys and convertibles she asked im assuming youre mr hardy thats me hardy started to reach over the seat but she opened the door on her ownbare tanned legs and sandalsand plopped herself in hardy had the rogue thought that it was lucky she was teaching fifthgradersany further into adolescence and her boy students would probably riot where to hardy put the car in gear got moving can i buy you lunch someplace she shook her head ive only got one period off for lunchfortyfive minutes just away from here anywhere wherever you find shade out of the parking lot he turned right and crested a hill following the main road until it dipped into an area where the homes were surrounded with old oaks you can turn anywhere in here she said hardy did as he was told and parked at the curb on a shady street in an established neighborhood of large attractive homes set on small lots as soon as hed set the brake and turned the motor off she turned toward him in her seat her near leg tucked up under her sorry to hustle you out of the lot back there she said but people dont need to see me talking to another man outside the school im already pretty much the fallen woman i almost lost the job over it back during the trial over what having a boyfriend having two boyfriends mr hardy not exactly at the same time but close enough for some people who suburban moms mr hardy never underestimate the power some of them really never liked me i think i must have threatened them somehow though i dont know how or why that would be hardy had a pretty good idea but he said nothing anyway thank god the nuns supported me i love the work i love my kids but you didnt drive down here to talk about me what can i do for you is everything all right with evan this had been her first question to him on the phone this morning too as soon as shed heard who he was but this time the question prompted an unexpected one from him have you not seen him recently clearly the answer made her uncomfortable two weeks thats not so bad she shrugged its not good not if hes the man you love and he is but hes already been in prison for two years and in jail another year before the trial she lowered her head shook it slowly back and forth let out a deep sigh its a hard one the whole thing i can imagine i mean she went on if he stays in prison i dont know what were supposed to do he wont marry me ive offered that a hundred times i think hes starting to lose hope i dont know what he wants out of me anymore sometimes im not even sure what i want i know i wanted himi do want himbut i wanted a life with him you know not this suddenly her eyes flashed but im not giving up on us im not dont think that its justits so hard its so endless i believe you hardy said she raised her eyes and looked over at hardy do you think youre going to have any luck do you think hes ever going to get out to be completely honest with you i dont know i dont want to give you any false hopes but im starting to think we might have a prayer is that what was so urgent hardy nodded maybe hed exaggerated about needing to see her right away but here they were now and he couldnt feel bad about it he felt that things had begun to move quickly and he didnt want to lose his momentum theres a good chance that the fbi talked to the khalils and didnt let the prosecution know if thats true weve got an appealable issue well im glad but i dont know anything about that no i didnt think you did hardy hesitated for a moment i wanted to ask you a few questions about ron nolan she rubbed her hand across her forehead brushed a hair away i knew it was going to have to come to that again someday why did you know that i dont know he was such a mistake i still dont know why letting the thought hang until there was no other way to complete it i feel like the whole thing is my fault how is that if i hadnt gone and told evan about ron tipping off the fbi ron knew id do that once he told me he just played me and then evan went up to his place so you think evan did kill him well i meani dont think he was himself at the time but i guess you guess so she shrugged again then nodded i dont know what else could have happened a lot else could have happened tara nobody seems to know what happened so unless evan told you something that didnt make the trial no he didnt do that he didnt remember i believe him you might be happier if you believed that too but what im wondering is if ron ever talked to you about his work with allstrong you went together for how long september to may how long is that eight months what do you want to know about his work whatever you can tell me well he liked it it paid very well he was gone a lot back and forth to iraq sometimes even though he was under suspicion for causing the blowup at masbah i never knew about that until evan told me just before ron and i broke up but that really didnt worry ron nothing worried ron im pretty sure he went over to iraq at least three maybe four times to get paid in cash if nothing else in cash yes she adjusted herself in the seat he showed me a wrappedup brick of something like fifty thousand dollars in cash after one of his trips what did he get that for i think it was just how he got his regular pay sometimes thats what he told me how did he get that back into the country what do you mean i mean you cant enter the country with that kind of money in cash youve got to claim it at customs she shook her head no ron didnt have any problem with that he always flew by military transport out of travis he knew all the pilots and the commanders and everything it was just part of how allstrong did business tara hardy asked didnt it ever occur to you that ron brought those frag grenades over from iraq the same way and that hed killed the khalils with them of course i knew evan hadnt done that anyway but there wasnt really any proof that ron had either but then he was such a liar he lied about everything to me and to evan did you ever hear him mention anything about the khalils no not really not until they were dead anyway she looked at hardy in a pout of frustration i wish i knew what you were trying to get me to say if it would help evan id say it but i didnt know much about rons work at all im not trying to get you to say anything tara im trying to get a handle on ron nolan on what was going on around him see if that leads me anywhere on this appeal well for a handle i can help you there he said he was a warrior a warrior what did he mean by that oh we talked about that a lot i really didnt like it or agree with him but when he talked he could make it sound like it made perfect sense what did exactly that the world needed warriors and the job of the warrior was to kill and thats who he was how he defined himself as a killer a killer she nodded and im sure he was one timewell no never mind what she paused then shrugged well it was one of our first dates glitsky was on the phone at his desk talking to his closest connection in the fbi bureau chief bill schuyler with whom hed had many previous nearly amicable dealings now the tone didnt ring with cooperation and friendship bill glitsky said youre telling me both agents quit yes sir at the same time im not at liberty to disclose that abe theyre no longer with the bureau thats all i know could i talk to their superior i am their superior abe what else do you want to know i want to know where they are i just told you they quit you just also told me that you were their superior and two hours ago when we last talked you didnt know theyd left the bureau i hadnt worked with them personally in a while abe i guess they got away from me after a small pause glitsky tried again this is a murder case bill freed and riggio testified a couple of years ago down in redwood city and it would be helpful to know who they talked to wouldnt that all be in the record we were wondering if any of their reports dealing with that case happened not to get turned over to the da im sure they turned over everything they were supposed to and youre investigating a homicide in redwood city isnt that outside of your jurisdiction and who is we the redwood city case might be connected to a couple of san francisco homicides bill and we is me and the lawyer ive been working with on this stuff well whoever it is freed and riggio arent going to be available because theyve left the bureau thats correct abe anything else when you say they left the bureau bill do you mean they joined another federal agency or are you telling me a couple of thirtysomething fbi agents opened a dairy queen in texas and didnt tell you where always a pleasure to talk to you abe have a nice day in spite of schuylers best wishes glitsky wasnt in fact having a nice day he sat at his desk in the early afternoon he had gotten up five minutes earlier and turned off his overhead lights closing and locking the door behind him both of his hands were cupped on the blotter in front of him and from time to time irregularly he would drum the fingers of those hands his mouth was tight and a muscle in his jaw worked at the side of his cheek he hadnt been kidding when hed told hardy that one didnt really have bosom buddies among the agents of the federal bureau of investigation but hardys request to put the word out to agents jacob freed and marcia riggio to talk to him if he called had been so benign that glitsky never expected any sort of bureaucratic runaround he and schuyler had worked portions of several cases together and jurisdictional squabbles apart had always before gotten along reasonably well as human beings when hardy had told him on friday night that the number of questions surrounding the bowens which might or might not be connected with the scholler case was sufficient to get his attention glitsky still had had no problem reserving his judgment questions came with the territory they were what investigations were all about few people had the good taste to disappear or die in such a way as to leave all questionable issues in their lives resolved but now this unexplained and almost certainly spurious disappearance of the two fbi agents whod been instrumental in the scholler case forced glitsky up against one of the other cardinal rules of investigation there is no such thing as a coincidence it wasnt a coincidence that ron nolan worked for allstrong and so had arnold zwick three broken necks in one weekend wasnt a coincidence beyond those new and disturbing items it was one thing to have charlie bowen who was working on the appeal in the scholler case vanish without a trace there was a reasonable and plausible explanation for the suicide of his wife six months later and certainly fbi agents had been known to leave their jobs but for all of these things to come together in an apparently random set of coincidences stretched glitskys credulity far beyond its normal capacity for elasticity a relationship existed here among these parts he just didnt know what it was but he was starting to get a good idea that it probably involved at least one homicide in his jurisdiction possibly two and maybe more this made it his business but more than that the fbi and allstrong connections significantly enlarged the playing field whatever had originally happened in the scholler case and glitsky was woefully ignorant of all but the most general of those details it had appeared more or less parochialessentially two guys duking it out over a woman now suddenly hardys theories involving the khalils and whatever business they were doing in iraq and perhaps even some kind of us government involvement did not seem so incredibly farfetched and though abes opinion of the fbis methods included his belief that it would ignore the taking of a life by a snitch or a prospective witness if it suited its agenda it it did not extend to the possibility that its agents would actually sanction or commit murder sothe only conclusion he could drawthe fbi knew more about this case than they were willing to divulge they possibly knew who had killed the khalils and who had killed ron nolan and if it wasnt evan scholler this meant that the fbi had let the wrong man be sent to prison for life if one of the khalils instead had killed nolan in retaliation and then either or both of the bowens because theyd picked up that trail and the fbi knew about it he pulled over the phone on this desk lifted the receiver and punched in a number he knew by heart hello phyllis he said its abe glitsky i need to talk to diz please hardys private investigator wyatt hunt did his research primarily on his computer in the large converted warehouse by the hall of justice that he called home he had no trouble finding the details of the khalil murders on the net over the weekend he also spoke to hardy to clarify exactly what his assignment was it had evolved somewhat from fridays first phone call when hardy merely wanted to know who if anyone among the khalil family had had an interview with fbi special agents in regard to the scholler case now hunts personal priority had shifted to finding out without putting himself in danger what those interviews had been about by now on monday afternoon he knew that the extended khalil clan consisted of twentythree separate families strung out between south san francisco and san jose and then across the bay over to hayward and fremont the typical arrangement was that each family owned its own franchise of the eleven chain although four of them owned more than one store the family had been in the country since ibrahim and shatha had emigrated with their four children in before the first gulf war the eldest surviving brother abdel khalil had been the spokesman for the family in the aftermath of the murders of his parents and seemed the likeliest source of information abdel owned three stores along the el camino real between the two northern peninsula towns of millbrae and san bruno but conducted his corporate business out of a lowslung stuccoandglass building set down in a former landfill by san francisco airport hunt got out of his mini cooper and walked in the flat glaring sunshine across a treeless parking lot and into the nondescript reception area of amk inc a swarthy somewhat disheveled young man in shirtsleeves sat at the only substantial piece of furniture a cluttered desk in the middle of the room he was sorting some kind of paperwork a cup of tea steamed at the side of his desk the screen saver on his computer showed an artists rendering of a eleven store in a typical urban strip mall a radio turned low played what hunt would have called middle eastern perhaps iraqi music hunt had made the appointment this morning probably with this same young man under slightly bogus conditions saying that he was a writer who was doing an article on successful immigration stories now after he introduced himself the boy gave him a nervous smile and disappeared through a door behind him leaving hunt standing alone in front of the desk a minute later hunt was shaking hands with a goodlooking man in his midthirties with his mustache he bore a slight resemblance to saddam hussein although he was dressed in american clothesblack slacks that looked to be the bottom portion of a mans suit and a light blue dress shirt with an open neck mr hunt im abdel khalil would you like something to drink a cup of tea perhaps coffee coke coffee would be nice black please fine we can take it in my office khalil snapped his fingers twice quickly and the boy jumped bowed and disappeared hunt followed khalil to a more spacious room in the back corner of the building from the chair he was directed to in front of the standard wooden desk he had an unimpeded view of the bay and of planes landing at the airport the room itself like its counterpart outside was functional in the extreme an oversized map of the bay area was pinned to one of the walls above a low credenza a computer had its own small table at a right angle to the desk which khalil went around and sat behind hed barely gotten settled when the receptionist knocked and entered with a cup of coffee and handed it to hunt then closed the door behind him on the way out now khalil clasped his hands on the desk he spoke educated and uninflected english mr hunt hows the coffee good now how can i help you i understand youre writing an article of some kind this was always the tough part hunt placed his saucer on the tiny table next to him actually sir thats not the case and i apologize im a private investigator working with a lawyer whos doing the appeal on the evan scholler case and if youd like to kick me out of here id understand surprised but not completely unamused khalil waved that off youve barely gotten settled why would you think i wouldnt talk to you about evan scholler it could be a touchy subject and why would that be i think the assumption was that he killed your parents yes khalils face darkened that was a difficult time but i hope weve put that behind us did you say scholler was appealing his conviction hunt nodded well i wish him luck you do thats a bit of a surprise why is that if he killed your parents but he was never charged with killing my parents and frankly it didnt seem to make much sense at the time unless you bought the idea that after what happened to him over there he hated all iraqis and just picked them as a random couple to sacrifice khalil shook his head i never really saw that so who do you think killed them i think it must have been ron nolan why do you say that well the fragmentation grenades for example his work i understand brought him to and from iraq frequently where he would have access to that stuff and would have been able to bring it back here by military transport without having to bother with customs but why why what why your parents what was nolans motive khalil grimaced the memory of it all beginning to play back i believe he picked up a contract to assassinate them in iraq our family has business interests over there and i thinkwell i had heard this and when i told the fbi wait a minute please excuse me youre saying you talked to the fbi then of course and you told them that you believed ron nolan had killed your parents because of information that you got from iraq well yes and what did the fbi say they seemed to already know and didnt disagree that that was probably what happened they assured us they would look into it but then of course after what happened to mr nolan so they talked to you about the scholler trial this seemed to stump him for a minute he half turned and looked out his window his brow furrowed then came back to hunt i dont really recall that so what did they talk to you about hunt sat back lost for a beat in his own perplexity but im sorry i interrupted you so youre saying the fbi didnt think scholler killed your parents right thats probably a large part of the reason he never got charged with that everyone ive talked to in the fbi agreed that it was nolan but nolan was never nolan was dead mr hunt what was anybody going to do about that it was over a done deal even if some of my brothers and cousins wanted to kill him he was already dead so youre saying scholler did kill nolan now khalil showed genuine surprise well yes of course i dont believe anyone has any doubts about that do they well as a matter of fact yes hunt was going to say my boss does which would have led to khalils next question then who did kill nolan and hunts answerhardys answerwould have been uh you guys the khalils but suddenly that was not how this was going instead hunt scrambled okay nobody doubts scholler killed nolan and the fbi told you that nolan probably killed your parents did they know why or who put this contract out the short answer is not at first they couldnt find anything although i heard from relatives that they interrogated a lot of people over there it was all hunt could do to keep his mouth from dropping open in amazement in iraq the fbi interrogated people about your parents death all the way over in iraq of course thats where the trail led but they didnt find out who did it eventually they believed they did yes now khalil allowed a small smile and wemy familyverified that they were right your fbi they know what they are doing you know theyre extremely competent and efficient hunt sat back what did they find out well as i say eventually it became more or less obvious but first you have to know that my father ibrahim was a brilliant businessman he directed his youngest brother mahmoud in some of his widespread business dealings in iraq mahmoud was trying to supply contract workers on a reconstruction job over there a very lucrative one but the main suppliermahmouds chief competitor in factwas a kurd named kuvan krekar the fbi became satisfied that mr krekar took out the contract on my mother and father to disrupt our business over there and to a large extent he was successful in the short term when khalils small smile returned it had a chilling aspect i received word about two years ago that mr krekar had died from an improvised explosive device my country as you know is going through some very violent times but the good news is that mahmoud and his business have been thriving lately and we believe we have turned the corner over there at fivethirty hardy and hunt were sharing one of the window booths at lou the greeks a bar and in some peoples opinion restaurant located just across the street from the hall of justice the squabble over whether it was in fact a true restaurant worthy of the name derived from the uneven quality of the food they served at the place many of the regular patrons came in only to drink at the tiny bar in the front and didnt ever try to eat the constantly changing special that lous wife chui created every single day the special was the only food item on the menu and in deference to chuis chinese and lous greek ethnicities she most frequently tried to make different combinations of ingredients that included both of these two cultures rather violently disparate culinary traditions thus on any given day the lous special might be taramasalata fish roe wontons in an avgolemono broth moussaka potstickers or the oftrequested yeanling clay bowl the ingredients of which had once stumped a panel of six of the citys allstar chefs after da clarence jackman had publicly referred to it as his favorite lunch in the city because lous was semisubterraneanthe entrance off bryant descended eight steps from the street levelthe booth where hardy and hunt sat had windows high in the wall above them which at the same time were at the ground level of the alley that ran alongside the building on the outside the view out the windows which few took advantage of was of passing feet garbage cans the occasional horizontal homeless person today neither hardy nor hunt was paying attention to the ambience hardy who had spent most of the afternoon working on the first draft of his argument on the ptsd issue for evans appeal sat with his shoulders hunched over slightly as though he were brooding his hands cupped around a mug of coffee hunt sat sideways in the booth slowly revolving a pint glass of beer on the table hunt had already made his report to hardy at his office and this had prompted hardys call back to glitsky and ultimately the decision that they should all meet down here and see what they had you dont think the fact that the khalils talked to the fbi is going to be enough for you hunt asked friday that was all you wanted i remember it well hardy said those halcyon bygone days and absolutely im going to make the argument the khalils had a strong motive to kill nolan the jury should have known about that and decided for themselves whether that caused them to have a reasonable doubt about evans guilt its up to the jury not the fbi to decide whats important and whats not but for brady to work the withheld discovery has to be reasonably likely to cast doubt on the verdict and the idea that some unknown third parties had a motive to kill nolan probably isnt going to convince the court to give evan a new trial were just going to need something stronger if we want to argue that the khalils killed nolan which i just dont see diz really still possible i know but you had to have heard this guy if he didnt absolutely believe scholler killed nolan hes gotta get himself an agent well if the alternative option was either himself or one of his relatives it might sharpen his thespian skills a little bit dont you think hunt shrugged possibly but still its against my gut all right then lets go with that for a minute say whoever killed nolan it wasnt the khalils and it wasnt scholler who does that leave how bout the fbi maybe there was way more money involved and these two agents who have disappeared found it and left the country maybe hardy said without enthusiasm and a good story but i kind of doubt it me too hunt said pointing at the entrance and i hate that but here comes glitsky maybe hell know something it wasnt only glitsky bracco came in with him hardy introduced hunt aroundhe hadnt met either of the cops before lou came from behind the bar and took their orders glitskys green tea and braccos diet coke in the next few minutes of show and tell everybody got reasonably caught up the story hardy had heard from tara about the mugging incident in san franciscos tenderloin implicating nolan in those three deaths significantly upped the buzz quotient around the table bracco went last revealing to the civilians what hed already told glitskythat hed located bowens secretary deni pichaud and talked to her for an hour or more about what her boss had been working on during the last few days before he disappeared ms pichaud didnt have much to offer bowen as everyone already knew had a varied and substantial practice and according to pichaud he tended to flit from one case to another as clients called and demanded his attention she had no special memory of anything about evan scholler or his appeal when bracco finished the four men sat looking at one another for a long moment hardy finally broke into the silence so where does that leave us is shit creek already taken hunt asked glitsky who eschewed profanity gave the detective a quick bad eye but then blew on his tea sipped and said its the fbi and iraq thats all thats left hardy shook his head the fbi didnt kill nolan abe maybe scholler did bracco held up a hand i know hes your client and all but yeah but that almost doesnt matter at this point glitsky said im afraid it still does to me guys hardy put in thats why me and wyatt are here so if everybodys good with it maybe we can just leave the whole question of who killed nolan open and see where that leads us good by me glitsky said i want who did the bowens and we know that wasnt scholler so youre going with the bowens being murders hunt asked glitsky nodded until i get proven otherwise he pointed a finger across the table at his inspector which means while im thinking of it darrel feel free to put in more time on both these investigations treat em both like theyre righteous one eightysevens witnesses if you can find em evidence ditto phone and financial records the whole ball of wax bracco determination all over his face nodded got it meanwhile glitsky continued how are the fbi and iraq connected to the bowens in a rare display of humor he channeled the line from ferris bueller anyone anyone ive got a thought hardy said lets go back to nolan the fbi talked to him in person and his employer works in iraq which puts fbi and iraq in the same sentence anyway hunt picked it up all right and abdel khalil says nolan picked up the contract on his parents in iraq from a guy named kumar or something hardy who rarely forgot anything chimed in kuvan okay kuvan kuvan paid nolan forty or fifty grand to take out the khalils then the khalil family over in iraq took out kuvan the four men sat with their thoughts and drinks finally hardy cleared his throat my what a tidy little package he said glitsky turned to him what are you saying im saying that this is all a nice cleanly closed circle except for two little thingscharlie and hanna bowen and i think were all in agreement that no matter what the fbi didnt kill them right nods all around well check me if im wrong on anything here but how about if the trail leads to iraq all right but instead of kuvan paying for the hit the order came from allstrong the way it did with zwick glitsky added do we know that for sure bracco asked and even if we do what does it get us nothing with zwick as you say the fbi never got involved in that investigation hardy answered but with the khalils it gets us the fbi covering for an american company with contracts over there deflecting the blameand the retaliationon this kuvan guy just another iraqi businessman who got squeezed in the war this totally satisfies the khalilsthey get their tribal revenge and theyre happy and over here now nobodys looking at nolan anymore or at allstrong the storys completely over and the fbi did this again why glitsky asked because allstrong is connected high up in the government both over there and back here high enough that they could call off the fbi uhoh glitsky was shaking his head i know i know hardy said you hate this conspiracy stuff which doesnt mean abe that it doesnt happen i dont hate it bracco said hunt chimed in me neither in fact i kind of like it maybe im missing something glitsky said coming back at hardy so diz youre saying that the fbi went over to investigate what nolans murder no the khalil murders i thought theyd concluded that was your client no hunt corrected glitsky redwood city not the feds concluded that that was evan according to abdel the fbi thought it was nolan pretty early on so they went over to iraq why to find the source of the frag grenades hardy said if nothing else interview nolans associates maybe his boss who has it turns out in fact actually ordered the hit but again diz why well and here im extrapolating a little bit but see if it doesnt sing for you because allstrong had a profitable relationship with this guy kuvan and the khalils were getting in kuvans way this is all stuff by the way that wyatt more or less verified this afternoon with abdel so allstrong orders its guy nolan to do the hit which is ps what he basically did for a living anyway so glitsky trying to make the tumblers fall into place slowly swirled his teacup in front of him how does this get us to bowen bowen gets evans appeal hardy said just like i did he starts asking the same types of questions ive been asking except instead of sending wyatt here down to talk to abdel khalil he starts with the assumption were working with right nowthat nolan and not evan killed the khalils so that changes his equation about who would need to cover that up if it comes out and whats the answer allstrong hunt said hardy nodded ten points who needs to cover what up glitsky asked allstrong they can play fast and loose all they want in iraq and nobody asks too many questions as long as theyre fulfilling their contracts but if it comes outand it would be a huge story over herethat theyre killing naturalized american citizens on american soil to promote their business interests in iraq ive got to believe that screwed up as things are over there allstrong would at least stop getting new contracts they might even lose the ones theyve already got and thats if they dont get charged for murder first bracco slurped at the end of his diet coke how much money are we talking about for allstrong i mean their contracts over there hunt spoke up i got curious checking out some stuff on nolan and googled them over the weekend their first year in iraq when nolan was on the payroll they got about three hundred and fifty million dollars in government contracts youve got to be kidding me bracco said allstrong security i mean who are they nobodys ever heard of them theyre not exactly halliburton no but theyre trying harder said hunt thats for sure maybe theyd actually kill to get work hardy deadpanned glitsky sat back his body language saying that he was still reserving judgment okay okay so youre saying bowen went to allstrong first not the khalils with these questions thats my guess hardy said and allstrong killed him a nod or had him killed yes thats pretty drastic dont you think maybe from our perspective granted but these guys are a bunch of mercenaries theyre hired guns thats how they solve problems hardy came forward in his enthusiasm look abe allstrong had already dealt with the whole nolan thing and put it behind them the world believed it was evan scholler whod killed the khalils for his own twisted reasons someone with the government who had major juicea general a congressman i dont know somebody who was in allstrongs pocket and helping it get its contractshad either ordered or convinced the fbi to offer up kuvan privately to the remaining khalils glitsky was still shaking his head i know were not all big fbi fans here but ive got to say that i dont see them doing this ever sometimes they might get a little overzealous but theyre not going to frame an innocent iraqi and stand back while someone else kills him hardy nodded conceding the point how about if they didnt know abe how about if someone way up like the general or senator or whoever i was talking about earlier got to the director of the bureau say and vouched for allstrong meanwhile selling him a bill of goods about kuvan so your agents solve the case and then theyre ordered off it and when somebody else wants to talk about it bracco said like you this morning sir the agents dont work there anymore and allstrong stays off the hook hardy said until bowen showed up hunt added thats it hardy said and then here it was again the threat to allstrong to its very existence and a lot closer this time so they had to make bowen disappear before he could make any kind of public stink or even ask any more questions he just had to go away hardy looked around the table anybody see an egregious flaw here glitsky looked across at bracco dont worry about it darrel he always uses words like that then back to hardy do you know that bowen ever actually got in touch with allstrong i mean any actual proof no but we can find that out those phone records you were talking about hardy turned to bracco and you might want to check hannas too glitsky snapped out a curt defense of his inspector im sure darrels got some sense of the drill diz sorry hardy said to bracco i tend to get excited this may really be something lets get some evidence first glitsky said he sipped at the last of his tea put his cup down gently when he spoke his voice was heavy with discontent i really dont want to believe theres a conspiracy here and a coverup from somebody high enough up to have influence with the fbi i keep believing our guys dont do that kind of stuff with all respect are you kidding sir hunt said these are the same swell folks who brought us abu ghraib and all the other disasters over there giving up kuvan for the greater good and that means pumping more money into a hardworking godfearing company like allstrongthats a nobrainer were the good guys remember so whatever we do is right yeah glitsky said so lets hope were wrong on this one hardy thinking about evan scholler doing life without parole in prison didnt hope they were wrong he didnt see another plausible alternative and hed long since lost faith in the essential goodness of man some were good true maybe most but others particularly those drawn to war zones and to chaos would sometimes do anythinglie cheat and killfor more money and more power either or both the basic rules of civilization did not apply that hardy was now all but convinced was what had happened here the moral rot that festered in iraq and in the halls of power both here and abroad had poisoned the communal well over there what distinguished allstrong was that it had had the arrogance and irresponsibility to bring the rot and the chaos home and that hardy felt could not be allowed to stand hardy sat in his reading chair his feet up on the ottoman in the dark living room in the front of his house he wore the same black gym shorts that hed put on before hed gotten into bed six hours before when he had started awake about an hour agohed dreamt that hed been pushed from an airplane out over the pacific oceantossing off the covers he had lain still in the night until his heart slowed down listening to his wifes breathing beside him taking what comfort he could from the peaceful regularity of it finally giving up on the idea of sleeping he eased himself out of bed downstairs he looked into the refrigerator out of habit then closed it and went into the adjoining family room and watched his tropical fish swimming in their dim gurgling home hed spent most of the evening after dinner back next to his fish at his computer finding out everything he could about allstrong security hunts analysis of their financial success early in the war was accurate as far as it went but hed failed to mention that to date the companys government contracts in iraq totaled eight hundred and forty million dollars allstrong was in charge of security at sixteen of the countrys airports as well as guarding electrical grids in twentytwo administrative areas they had been in charge of the currency changeover for the entire country as well as the rebuilding of the power lines in the extremely violent anbar province the companys web site boasted of employees in iraq of whom were former american military men most of them officers the company had also become active in several other countries with more than excommando operatives in indonesia afghanistan kuwait nigeria and el salvador where it specialized in corporate as well as government logistics and security over more employees worked at a sprawling new headquarters complex near candlestick point in san francisco where the concentration was mostly on programs to guarantee the integrity of municipal water supplies and incongruously on raising catfish as a sustainable and inexpensive food source for developing countries jack allstrong the founder president and ceo had evidently relocated back to the home office in march of he lived alone in a mansion in hillsborough and presided over the business out of san francisco although the home page stressed that allstrong was ready and able to embark to trouble spots anywhere in the world at a moments notice in one of the corporations fleet of private aircraft which included two gulfstream v jets when he went to bed hardys brain had been spinning with the possibilities that allstrong presented for his scholler appeal as soon as bracco could forge the link tying allstrong to nolans involvement in the assassination of the khalils and to the deaths of the bowens hardy would have an unassailable argument that the jury in the original trial never saw crucial evidence that reasonably could have affected the verdict hed get his appeal granted on the brady violation and then probably a new trial and further he doubted that a new jury given the reversals in the case would convict evan again now hardys subconscious had rejected all of these optimistic conclusions as he sat slumped down in his living room chair he found himself scavenging for any kind of salvageable something that could tie allstrongeither the person or the companyto any crime at all if jack allstrong had personally ordered nolan to eliminate the khalils and paid him in cash which is exactly what hardy conjectured had happened he could count on there being no record of it whatsoever especially after all these years orhardy corrected himselfcharlie bowen had come up with the only evidence there might have been and perhaps had inadvertently passed it on to his wife but by now whatever that had been must be gone and similarly the murders of charlie and hanna had been carried out with professional efficiency even if bracco discovered that charlie andor hanna bowen had called or gone down to visit allstrong on the last day of their lives what would that prove would it lead to a discovery of charlies body which had probably long since become fish food or would it place an allstrong mercenary in hannas garage pulling her body down to make sure to break her neck as she dropped from her stepladder hardy knew it wouldnt and so long as allstrong didnt confess to anythingand if there was no proof hed ever done anything wrong why would hethen in the face of all the accusations in the world hed remain untouchable in fact hardy realized with the size of the operation allstrong was running by now hed undoubtedly have surrounded himself with protectionadministrative assistants senior staff his own lawyersto keep him insulated from riffraff such as hardy himself or even sergeant bracco who might come calling on him with impertinent questions hardy might never even get to talk to him at the sound of the newspaper hitting the porch he opened his eyes again the darkness outside had lessened by a degree it was going to be a long day three and a half hours into the work portion of that day hardy glared malevolently at the phone as it buzzed at his elbow he was eight pages into his brief about the brady violation he made a good case that the fbis information should have been disclosed to washburn this would have allowed him to crossexamine the nowdisappeared allegedly exfbi agents on the entire question of nolans involvement with the frag grenades hed turned off his cell phone and left strict instructions with phyllis to hold all of his calls he needed to concentrate but here was the phone buzzing at him hence the glare he put his pen down and reached for the receiver this must be an emergency he said in a mild tone is the building on fire no sir but lieutenant glitsky said i should disturb you apparently somebody tried to kill evan scholler at the prison this morning lieutenant glitsky is holding now shall i put him through that would be a good thing phyllis please he heard the click of connection is evan all right hes alive though hes cut pretty bad he was lucky the shiv hit a rib or hed be room temperature by now so hes going to live no promises but good chance evidently so what happened abe he get in a fight well finding out what really happened is always a little iffy there but by first reports its starting to look like he was a target of some kind the guy who went for him was a salvadoran gangbanger out of la named rafael calderon nobody had ever seen these two guys together before this morning so youre saying somebody ordered this im not saying anything im telling you what ive heard so far and ive heard that your man evan had been an ideal inmate no word about any enemies or what he might have done to make them so the order came from outside dont know it could have been something personal we dont know about id hesitate to conjecture but maybe youve got something you want to tell me hardy recalling his research the previous night couldnt keep the thought from jumping to the front of his mindallstrong security was developing a presence in el salvador beyond his net surfing last night hed read several lengthy magazine articles and even pieces of a couple of books delineating the relationships between us mercenaries and the salvadoran gang networks in that country and took it as gospel that the connections between them ran deep he took a minute to get glitsky up to speed then asked did they question calderon calderon wasnt as lucky as scholler are you telling me hes dead thats right did scholler kill him no scholler was on the ground bleeding when the guards heard the screaming and yelling from the assault and got there they got calderon surrounded and he went more or less insane he still had his shiv on him and he charged them they reacted with what after the hearing im sure will be called appropriate force in selfdefense hardy realized that he was gripping the phone so tightly that his knuckles were white he knew that if calderon had taken the job of assassinating scholler in prison and either botched it or got caught afterward both of which had happened in this case he could expect to be killed by his handler or by another gangconnected inmate before he could be questioned and give anything away and he knew that whoever had put out the contract would just as easily put out another one after the phone call hardy couldnt get his mind back on the draft of his brief he decided to walk down to the hall of justice to clear his mind the fine weather continued and if glitsky had already gone to lunch hardy could walk down a couple of blocks and catch a meal at any one of a number of the good new joints in soma south of market but abe was in at his desk drinking a bottled water and eating a rice cake glitsky opened his desk drawer pulled out a handful of peanuts in the shell and slid them across his desk hardy cracked a shell this is allstrong again abe calderon it might be at that it is absolutely glitsky shook his head dont get me wrong i want it to be with all my heart but i dont have enough diz if makes you feel any better i think its possible and i didnt think that a few days ago im waiting for darrel before i jump to any conclusions i made that jump when i heard about the stabbing there is no other conclusion not to be disagreeable but dont kid yourself you were all over this at least yesterday maybe before hardy chewed reflectively you want to hear how it works why its allstrong sure but the short version please okay six weeks ago hanna gets killed allstrongs now had to kill two people involved in the scholler appeal he thinks its probably all done as far as getting rid of evidence is concerned but he knows that as long as evan schollers in prison theres going to be this appeal coming up again and its attendant risks meaning people like bowen or me coming around asking him provocative questions maybe theres even more evidence someplace that he was actively involved in a domestic homicide lets hope glitsky said hardy nodded so allstrong gets another idea kill scholler youre reading my mind another peanut scholler dies the appeal is over cuts it off at the source but of course the problem is that schollers in prison not untouchable but more complicated through el salvador and backup through one of the la gangs hardy held up his hands in a voilà gesture theres your six weeks between hanna and now brilliant glitsky ate another peanut youve got it all figured out ive got bowen figured out too they dumped him out in the ocean this brought glitsky forward in his chair how do you know that i dreamed it hardy said grinning but its what happened abe youre going to find his dna in one of their airplanes i promise just as soon as i get to look in one of them sitting back glitsky folded his hands on his lap i want to believe you diz i really do ill jump on all of this with both feet as soon as i can go to a judge to give me a warrant or i get any other reason to send bracco to talk to the guy but until i do he shrugged im waiting on bracco he finds something or he doesnt usually if somethings there he does yeah but meanwhile my clients still a target glitsky glanced at the wall clock diz i think thats a reach i really do or at worst by your own math the next attack is six weeks away glitsky was half joking but the next attack felt far closer than six weeks away to hardy back in his office galvanized he told phyllis to hold his calls again and spent the next two hours working on his brief one thing he could do as a lawyer was actually file his appeal and get things shaking he too had been waiting for bracco to come up with actual evidence that either of the bowens had called allstrong but there was another and much more direct way to go about getting this information he could pick up the phone and ask it wasnt glitskys way and hardy in his enthusiasm to simply figure out what had happened had gotten hung up with that process but glitsky was trying to solve two homicides in his jurisdiction and bring a killer to justice hardy on the other hand had only one job he was working to free his client it was a crucial difference and it now had gained added urgency with the prison assault on evan this morning hardy had been hoping that once the police could somehow prove an allstrongbowen connection it would strengthen the argument in his appeal but he really didnt need that to filethe fbi and the khalils might eventually lead to allstrong and nolan but the issue was whether or not those initial interrogations should have been part of the prosecutions discovery and on this point there was little doubt easy though it might be to make an actual phone call to allstrong there was another component to the equation that hardy could ignore only at his peril these guys had proven themselves seriously proactive about people who threatened their business interests if hardys theories were correct and he was by now all but certain that they were they had killed both the bowens and made an attempt on the life of evan and all of this without leaving behind a shred of evidence that would tie them to these crimes hardy realized that as soon as he made that one simple phone call the threat level in his own life was going to go up in a hurry he would be putting himself exactly where charlie bowen had gone before he disappeared forever but he needed the information he had to know for sure he couldnt file his appeal until he knew reward risk hardy had written the allstrong office number down in his notes as a matter of course while he was doing his research last night returning from word processing where hed dropped his draft marked urgent he closed his office door went behind his desk sat down took out his notes and pulled the phone over in front of him punching the numbers with a steeled deliberation jack allstrong please ill see if hes in can i tell him whos calling i dont know how can you tell him whos calling if hes not in i beg your pardon you said youd see if mr allstrong was in but if you were going to tell him who was calling then you must know he is in isnt that right hardy hated to launch this logic assault on the poor receptionist but with the attack on evan he believed he was running out of time please tell mr allstrong that my name is dismas hardy and that its extremely important that i speak with him as soon as possible he spelled his name out for her im an attorney working on the appeal in the evan scholler matter with which im sure hes familiar please also tell him that im continuing the work begun last summer by a lawyer named charlie bowen if hes busy tell him ill be happy to wait here on the line for as long as it takes as it turned out it took less than a minute a voice with an undefinably southern accent and devoid of nervousness anger or fear came through the wire this is jack allstrong mr allstrong my name is dismas hardy and a big booming laugh yeah i already know that you made quite a first impression on our marilou i must say and normally she is some kind of a tough nut to crack she says youre working with lieutenant scholler evan yes sir evan right i always think of him as lieutenant thats what he was when he worked with us he paused god that whole quagmire with him and ron nolan just turned into a hell of a thing didnt it the messes people get themselves into and two better young men you couldnt have imagined but i dont suppose you ever had a chance to meet ron no i didnt thats a shame he was a fine man a fine soldier a loyal employee what happened to him was just nothin less than a goddamned tragedy mr hardy ill be honest with you and i know it was because of the lieutenants head wound to some extent so i dont blame him the way i might otherwise war and this ones no exception it can do horrible things to people anybodys been in one knows that for a fact you a veteran mr hardy yes sir vietnam well then you know what im talking about but at least this war the soldiers themselves the men on the ground theyre getting some respect and about goddamn time wouldnt you say yes i would hardy said but im calling because im about to file an appeal to see if i can get mr scholler out of prison and wait allstrongs voice hardened up now wait just a second here you say youre trying to get the lieutenant out of prison i thought nobody doubted that he had killed ron well the jury thought it was beyond reasonable doubt which is not now hold on we dont need to be splitting hairs here mr hardy i think ive made it clear that until he was injured and even after that lieutenant scholler had my complete respect he was a good soldier a natural leader good to his men but i dont think im comfortable with the idea that the man who killed one of my first employees and a damn good friend is going to be out walking the streets again a free man and i certainly dont think im inclined to help with this appeal of yours sir i dont believe evan scholler did kill ron nolan well thats a good one you might be in the minority with that opinion i havent talked to anybody else who thinks that not even charlie bowen allstrong didnt hesitate for an instant not him either so you talked to him couple of times at least last summer sometime was it i dont know whatever happened to him anyway one day hes here asking me all kinds of questions im thinking hes moving forward on this appeal like you are and next thing you know hes gone thats what happened hardy said he disappeared just like that apparently hardy found his temper starting to flare and decided it was time to push on allstrong see if he could get a bit of a rise did you know charlie bowens wife i dont believe so she never called you there she might have called here although i dont know why she would have but if she did she never talked to me why do you think i would know anything about her hardy laid out his conjecture as factual truth she was working on some of the files charlie was working on when he disappeared then i dont know if youve heard but six weeks ago she committed suicide for the first time allstrong hesitated then made a little kissing noise well im sorry to hear that of course over charlie walking out on her thats the general assumption i presume although there are other theories about why she killed herself not just why but whether theres some evidence that she might have been killed by someone who wanted to make it look like a suicide why would anyone do that want to kill her i mean maybe because shed found out something to do with her husbands death and in that case maybe charlie bowen wasnt a simple disappearance either maybe he was murdered too thats a lot of maybes yes it is and heres another one maybe charlies work on this appeal is what convinced somebody they needed to kill him who would that be whoever actually did kill ron nolan ahh allstrong mustered up a kind of chortle and this is what brings us around to where you dont think it was scholler who killed him thats right these are my theories about the bowens both of them i think they were both murdered and i think the person behind those murders also tried to have evan scholler killed this morning at corcoran prison but that one didnt work hardy didnt know if allstrong had already received this news from his sources within the prison and he thought it wouldnt hurt to hear it now from him and while there was no sign that this information registered as anything but another unimportant detail about hardys case by degrees the superficial warmth was leeching out of both mens tones when allstrong spoke next his easy southern geniality was entirely missing well all of this is interesting im sure but it really doesnt have shitall to do with me and im afraid as i told you im not going to be too disposed to help you get ron nolans killer out of prison so if theres anything else specific i can help you with lets hear it otherwise i got a business im trying to run here i appreciate that hardy said i thought youd be interested in finding ron nolans killer in any event though whether or not it was evan scholler youd want to know who really did it i presume and whatever you can tell me now might help me get to the truth im basing my appeal on stuff i think the fbi discovered that they didnt reveal to evans prosecutors at the time of the trial i assume youre familiar with fragmentation grenades sure well then you may know that nolan who was in your employ at the time had several of these in his home i understood that scholler put them there to frame ron no sir hardy easily came out with the next untruth since the trial thats been pretty much discredited the fbi concluded there was no way evan could have gotten these things back home whereas nolan could have just packed them in his duffel and why would he do that because he liked them to cover his tracks after he assassinated people allstrong laughed out loud although through the phone hardy picked up as much nerves as humor in it this time when he got his breath he said that accusation is really beneath contempt mr hardy ron was my recruiter out here he didnt assassinate people yes he did the fbi has made that clear enough to the khalil family who were among his victims thats the evidence im trying to get in front of the court this time around if nolan was killing people on contract then revenge becomes a motive for his own death and that might give evan an out allstrong came out with the question hardy had been leading him toward you say nolan was killing people on contract thats absurd the fbi doesnt think so so who was paying him well the fbi makes the case to the khalils that it was one of your former clients in iraq a man named kuvan krekar kuvan is dead hes been dead now a couple of years i know that he was killed by the khalils over in iraq but i dont think kuvan was paying nolan anyway for what its worth a couple of inspectors with san franciscos homicide department think the same thing i do and they wont be giving up on their investigation anytime soon they think that whoever paid nolan to kill the khalils also had a hand in the deaths of charlie and hanna bowen you got any idea who that might be none at all thats funny because all of us have the idea that its someone in your company jack allstrong security after a long pause allstrong said if that ridiculous accusation ever sees the light of day mr hardy i hope youre prepared to spend the rest of your life defending the lawsuit ill bring against you im glad i did it hardy said i had to shake something up it was kind of fun frannie sat next to him at the bar of the little shamrock her brother moses mcguire was standing across from them both behind the bar it was kind of fun frannie said to moses mimicking hardys voice with heavy irony i think its kind of fun to threaten a man whos already killed at least two people and tried for three trying to keep this information from getting out i think its kind of fun that he can put me on his kill list next so me and my family can live in fear of being murdered every day from now on i really think thats kind of fun frannies color was high her eyes shining with anger hardy put a hand over his wifes thats not going to happen frannie and you know why moses knows why dont you mose mcguire sipped his soda and lime because you told allstrong the cops were on it too killing you the way hed done the bowens wouldnt get him anything buthe held up a fingerheres the tiny flaw my smart little sister has picked up on in your strategy diz if this guy is juiced enough that he can pull strings inside the fbi and apparently he is what on gods good earth makes you think that he cant get around abe glitsky and darrel bracco he turned to frannie did i express that succinctly enough you think she bobbed her head once still furious perfectly she said guys come on hardy said hes not going to kill two cops for christs sake and who knows who else is in on the investigation thats just not going to happen he doesnt have to kill them frannie replied but what about if he has them ordered off from on high where does that leave you then me me monty call on me moses wasnt smiling either though he leaned over into his brotherinlaws face that leaves you hanging out there alone in the breeze diz okay but if that unlikely event happens which i doubt then youll have an accident like charlie bowen did frannie said no abe would never rest if frannie slammed her palm down on the bar youd already be dead you idiot in the silence that descended hardy put his hand gently over frannies again well he said then id better get this whole thing done fast shouldnt i hardy could be glib all he wanted but in fact frannie and moses werent all wrong or even mostly wrong he knew that hed possibly put himself in an elevated state of jeopardy and could live with thathe also thought hed mitigated the problem dramatically by telling allstrong that the police were already involved in this same investigation but the more he lived with it the more he found himself worrying he hadnt adequately considered that his phone call to allstrong might also have put frannie in danger that had not been his intention though it might very well be the result so date night even at their old favorite restaurant yet wah ended early frannie still very upset over hardys call to allstrong went straight up to bed hardy went to his chair in the living room and punched up darrel braccos number on his cell phone the inspector picked up and hardy told him his storyputting a press on jack allstrong in personto a considerably more enthusiastic response than frannie had given him when he finished bracco said so we know both the bowens were talking to allstrong i got that from the phone records too but so what so what is what else this tells us whats that this is close to him personally its not just some corporate thing how do you know that mostly hardy said because he came to the phone to talk to me when there was no reason he needed to hes got two hundred people under him down there i guarantee hes got several levels of bureaucracy between him and the front desk but i call him up out of thin air and mention evan scholler and the bowens and he came right away he wanted to know what i knew to see how exposed he was and im confident that i made it pretty clear why did you want to do that bracco asked warn him were coming my wife had the same question hardy said but maybe rattling his cage gets him to do something stupid something stupid to do with you maybe maybe but unlikely i made it clear to allstrong that now its not just one lone attorney and then several months later his wife also acting alone the police are part of it now if any of us disappears or has an accident the heat only goes up on him so hes got to figure another way out make this investigation go away and im trying to make it easy for him hes not going to confess to ordering a domestic murder or anything to do with the bowens true but i dont need that i just need to get my client off as far as hes concerned thats going to be all i want i want these murders bracco said of course you do hardy replied and you should but youll admit that building any kind of winnable case on the evidence we see so far after all this time is pretty long odds meanwhile allstrong knows this whole thing is driven by evan scholler thats what was behind the attack this morning in prison he already believes that if scholler goes away all his problems go away im not going to go away bracco said you wont have any choice if hes left you no evidence to work with i got the feeling this guys built his business by getting around local authorities everywhere he sets up shop now hes got political clout and the veneer of respectability were not going to take him headon so youve got a better idea bracco asked as a matter of fact hardy said i think i do as he tiptoed into his bedroom at a little after eleven oclock frannie switched on the light next to the bed hey hardy said hey she patted the bed next to her im sorry she said i was worried im still worried but i dont want to fight about it he crossed over to her and sat down put a hand on her shoulder i dont either after a minute she let out a long breath so howd it go i think ive got darrel talked into it he really wants this guy as do i what about abe i didnt get around to talking to abe he might have reservations id rather not entertain at this point in time frannie closed her eyes and sighed again its really that important charlie bowen told his wife it was the most important thing hed ever worked on it was his biggest chance to do some real good in the world in the world huh the big old world yeah he kept rubbing her back i didnt pick this fight frannie it just came and fell in my lap and now it turns out that this guys just the smiling face of evil in this world and what makes it worse is he cloaks it all in patriotism and loyalty while he deals away lives so he can make another buck it makes me puke and its all up to you its got to be you dismas hardy i think ive got the cards hardy said i can beat him and take him down and what about the people protecting him politically well with any luck them too but allstrongs enough for my purposes im just trying to do the right thing here frannie mostly for my client im not sure i believe you babe i think you want to save the world but if i did that hardy said id need personal theme music hardy didnt sleep as well as he would have liked he woke up for the first time at twosixteen to the sound of squealing tires out on the street below his bedroom wide awake he went downstairs to check that the house was locked up front and back which it was behind the kitchen he turned on the light and went to his safe under his workbench opened it and brought out his own weapon a smith wesson m p he hesitated for a moment then picked it up and slammed a full magazine into the grip racked a round into the chamber and took off the safety then quietly and methodically he went through the downstairs checking the kids rooms the family room back up through the dining and living rooms nobody there back upstairs in his bedroom the guns safety on he put it in the drawer next to his bed and lay down again the sound of a dumpster slamming shut or a garbage can being droppedsomething loud and clangingwoke him up at four thirtyeight he grabbed the gun again and made another tour of the house with the same result up for the day he realized he put on a pot of coffee and went out to get the newspaper but stopped at the front door first and looked down the street in both directions only after satisfying himself that it was clear did he go outside and grab the paper this was not turning out to be the way he had planned it about five minutes before frannies alarm was going to go off he went upstairs again and laid a hand on her shoulder gently waking her up is everything all right she asked him so far everythings fine but sometime in the middle of last night my subconscious must have decided that you were right ive been awake half the night worrying i shouldnt have put us in this situation im sorry she reached out and took his hand apology accepted so what do you want to do i dont think it would be the worst idea in the world to check into a hotel for a couple of days treat it like a vacation she sat up letting go of his hand did something else happen last night that i didnt hear about no ive just had time to think about these guys some more until its clear to allstrong that glitsky and bracco are really in on this investigation with me which i hope ought to be by today or tomorrow its like moses saidwere hanging out there all alone in the breeze frannie shuddered i think i liked it better when you were pretending there was nothing to worry about me too but i dont think thats the smart move right now i think wed be wise to lie a little low sitting with the idea for another moment frannie finally sighed a couple of days probably no more than that probably she shook her head do you have any idea how much i wish you hadnt called him pretty much yeah if its any consolation i didnt feel like i had much of a choice right she said that makes me feel much better allstrong would also know that hardy went into his office every day but hardy had convinced himself that he could minimize his risk on that score by pulling directly into his parking place in the gated and locked parking garage underneath the building and taking the inside elevator up to his office once he was inside he had a reasonable faith in his firms security system as he pulled in about to park though he noticed a brown paper lunch bag lying against the wall just in front of his space for a minute the sight of the thing froze him it was just the kind of harmlesslooking item he imagined that might in actuality be an improvised explosive device turning on his lights he illuminated the bag which looked to be nothing more than what it was setting the brake hardy opened his door and walked over to the bag touching it gingerly with his foot then leaning over to pick it up it weighed almost nothing and contained only a few napkins an apple core and a couple of baggies forcing a small nonlaugh at his paranoia hardy got back in to his car and parked then crossed to the elevator and pushed the button to call it down in his office hardy went over the final draft of his appeal which explicitly laid out his argument on the brady violation in such a way as to maximize allstrongs connection to nolan and to the khalils he attached a declaration from wyatt hunt detailing the conversation hunt had had with abdel khalil included in the narrative was tara wheatleys information about the cash nolan had brought back from iraq buttressing the idea that perhaps hed been paid to carry out a contract on the khalils of course the fbis interrogation of abdel khalil which the agency had not seen fit to share with the prosecution team was at the crux of his discussion in toto hardy believed that the appeal raised enough questions about important evidence that had not been admitted in the trial that he thought hed at least get a hearing out of it and possibly if things worked out with allstrong between now and then a new trial for evan satisfied with his work he sent one of his paralegals down to the court of appeals to file the brief and then sent registered copies of it as required to mary patricia whelanmiille down in redwood city and alsoalthough there was no mandate he do soovernight to allstrong security marked personal and confidential for jack allstrong he wanted allstrong to know what he was doing when he was doing it and how it was likely to affect him if he didnt step in and do something to stop it next calling the prison hardy learned that evan was still in the infirmary and that his condition had stabilized there was some chance that he would be able to have visitors perhaps as soon as the next day hardys cell phone went offbracco calling him it worked he said i used the old surely youd want to cooperate in a murder investigation and he opened up some time for me and im on the way down there right now have fun hardy said but be careful right bracco barked out a short nervous laugh im all over it allstrong and his attorney who introduced himself as ryan loy led bracco back through a maze of hallways into a beautifully designed mediumsized oval conference room containing an apparently custommade table with twelve matching chairs around it an enormous spray of fresh flowers claimed the center of the table at the counter under the tinted windows someone had set up a full coffee service with pastries and fruit when bracco sat down at last with his coffee and danish he had a view of the entire south bay as it shimmered in the sunshine jack allstrong had played the gracious host in his garrulous style as they moved back through the building pointing with pride to the headquarters of the other divisions that now made up much of the companys workcomputer security water safety privatization logistics consulting aquaculture loy bookish and reserved in his suit and bow tie nevertheless came across as another truly nice guy everyone they passed in the hallways was wellscrubbed nicely dressed young loy closed the door to the conference room behind them and went around the table to braccos left while allstrong sat two chairs over from him on the right bracco took out his pocket tape recorder and without comment placed it prominently on the table out in front of everyone excuse me inspectorloy had stopped in the middle of raising his cupbut i understood this was to be an informal discussion and not a formal interrogation either way bracco said with a matteroffact tone im going to need a record of it i understood that you wanted to cooperate mr allstrong doesnt have to answer any question he doesnt want to you both understand that right loy looked at allstrong who nodded bracco picked up the tape recorder and spoke into it this is homicide inspector sergeant darrel bracco badge number conjoined case numbers and talking with jack allstrong fortyone and his attorney ryan loy thirtysix its eleven fortyfive on wednesday morning may ninth and we are at the offices of allstrong security in san francisco mr allstrong did you know an attorney named charles bowen yes how well did you know him not well at all i met him two or three times here in these offices to talk about an appeal he was working on evan scholler yes how did you figure in that case that mr bowen wanted to talk to you one of my past employees ron nolan was the victim scholler was eventually convicted of killing him do you know the grounds that mr bowen planned to base his appeal on no idea but he talked to you two or three times yes is that a problem bracco shrugged was he talking to you about the same things each time you talked to him yes and what specifically was the subject of those conversations i think he may have been trying to connect nolan in some way to another couple who had been murdered a few days before nolan himself was killed i have the memory that he was trying to implicate nolan in those murders somehow which was ridiculous and i told him so do you remember specifically any questions that he asked no i couldnt really give him answers to the questions this was a long time ago and it didnt seem very important when was the last time you saw him i dont know sometime last summer and when was the last time you spoke to him on the phone i dont remember do you know that mr bowen disappeared last summer yes i believe i did hear something about that just recently certainly i stopped hearing from him were you aware that his records indicate that he called you on the morning that he disappeared loy decided he had heard enough holding up a palm he said just a minute jack whats your point here inspector mr allstrong was apparently contacted by mr bowen on the day he disappeared i was wondering if he remembers any of the substance of that last phone call allstrong reached out his own hand thats all right ryan then to bracco i dont remember any last phone call at all i didnt know until just now that this last phone call was on the day he was supposed to have disappeared as far as i know mr bowen might have just called the office on a routine housekeeping matter i wouldnt know that in any event i dont remember talking to him and while were on this inspector why didnt anybody ask these questions last summer when they might have been a little fresher in my mind the bowen case has been reopened as a possible homicide and were going into more detail than when it was a missing person loy sat up straighter as if prodded if mr allstrong is a suspect in a homicide inspector im going to advise him to stop talking to you right now mr allstrong can stop speaking to me anytime he wants and i never said he was a suspect but he does appear to be someone who might have had contact with mr bowen on the day he disappeared bracco talked straight at allstrong but this leads to my next question about mr bowens wife did you ever meet her or speak to her on the phone no are you quite certain yes well it appears she made a number of phone calls to your number do you have any explanation for that again loy said he already told you he doesnt remember speaking to her mr allstrong gets a hundred calls a day inspector he doesnt have time to speak to most of those people mr loy your client indicated he wanted to cooperate in this investigation i have a number of questions i want to ask him bracco nodded he doesnt have to answer any questions but what i need are his answers and not your suggestions as to what might or might not have happened so again mr allstrong do you have any explanation for phone calls that mrs bowen made to your phone well of course mr loy is right i get lots of phone calls i can appreciate that but the last call hanna bowen made in her life was to here and it was the day before her death i think you can understand why we are curious about two people who call allstrong security one of whom disappears and the other dies immediately after the contact it does appear an unlikely coincidence it also wasnt true but loy and allstrong didnt have to know that hardys plan was simply to have bracco show up and make it clear that the cops too were now part of the picture well okay loy said youve asked your questions mr allstrong has told you what he knows if you dont have anything further i think its time to end the interview but bracco ignored loy again mr allstrong he said if you didnt receive these calls to whom in your company might mrs bowen have spoken allstrong shrugged i could ask marilou our receptionist shes the first line of defense if mrs bowen was hysterical or nonspecific about what she wanted or who she wanted to talk to her calls would have stopped at the front desk but as ryan here says we can always ask and make sure bracco finally reached for his coffee and took a sip it had gone tepid and he made a face is something wrong inspector allstrong asked bracco reached over and turned off his tape recorder he decided hed give the shit one last stir this doesnt seem to be going anywhere gentlemen i came here under the impression that youd like to cooperate in these homicide investigations but im not picking up much of a spirit of cooperation in fact frankly you both seem pretty darn defensive for people whove got nothing to hide thats ridiculous loy said weve answered every question youve asked the plain fact is that mr allstrong doesnt know anything about the bowens other than what hes told you he runs a huge corporation with branches all over the world he doesnt have time to get involved in these small parochial matters look inspector were sorry mr bowen disappeared and about whatever happened to his wife but to imply that theres any real connection between allstrong security and these events is just an absurd flight of fancy amen to that allstrong intoned well thenbracco pushed his chair backthank you for your time at threefifteen glitsky was standing in front of a video monitor in the tiny electronics room between the two similarly minuscule interrogation rooms that fed off a narrow hallway that in turn was separated from the homicide detail by a glass wall i give up he said to debra schiff what is it that sir is the top of your head glitsky looked again he wore his graying hair short and close to his skull leaning over he squinted into the seveninch monitor could be he said i couldnt prove it isnt you see any identifiable part of your face no he turned to her this is all the camera got in there yes sir lord glitsky walked out of the electronics room took one step to his left and reentered the interrogation room hed left a minute before the room was four feet by five feet so it was really more like a closet it had no windows suspects in homicide investigations were often brought in for questioning and placed in these rooms where they could be left alone and theoretically observed as they fidgeted or talked to themselves or otherwise did things that might be both incriminating and admissible in court the problem was that the camera that was supposed to record all of this activity was cleverly hidden within the ceiling and the room was so small that the only image captured on tape ever was the top of the head of the suspect as schiff had just demonstrated to glitsky its hopeless schiff told him we cant do business like this we need a new room i thought this was the new room glitsky was right the entire homicide department had transferred to the fifth floor from the fourth only a little over a year before newly designed and supposedly state of the art but youre right its a little small too who approved the plans for this thing well nobody which is kind of the problem theres a couple of guys in robbery who moonlight doing construction here in the building we didnt bid this out schiff laughed are you kidding me we have employees that do the maintenance in the building we try to bid this out the unions going to have a fit wed be taking their jobs well then why didnt we have the people in maintenance do it because they said theres a threeyear backlog on maintenance and theyd need to charge us seventyfive thousand dollars from our budget so we got the two guys from robbery to do it perfect glitsky said so where do you propose we put it this new room i dont know abe anyplace else maybe out where the lockers are or take part of the computer room which is way too big anyway but this thing is just crazy i agree with you he tried a small joke ill try to bring it up to somebody in facilities schiff didnt laugh sooner would be better abe i hear you debra ill see what i can do really but even as he was finishing up with this unwelcome bit of housekeeping glitsky saw that one of the clerks from reception was hustling his way yo jerry he said what up ive got bureau chief bill schuyler with the fbi holding for you sir he says its important the doorbell rang in hardys hotel room theyd gotten a small suite at the rex not far from hardys office and hardy had checked in at a little before five oclock he crossed to the door and taking no chances looked through the peephole glitsky frowned at nothing in the dusky light when hardy opened the door the lieutenant focused the dark look on him when phyllis told me you were here i thought maybe she was kidding me yeah shes a great kidder that phyllis glitsky threw a quick look around obviously you think this is necessary precautionary thats all glitsky nodded his expression set and hard in any event weve got to talk and lo as if by magic here we are talking right now abe tightened his lips enough that his scar stood out in relief would you like to know the result of your illadvised encouragement to darrel bracco that he go down and have a chat with the allstrong people hardys face grew sober is he all right physically hes fine glitsky pushed on the door and hardy stepped back to let him in then followed him into the sitting room grabbing the chair behind the desk glitsky spun it around and straddled it but hes slightly ticked off at you as am i i might add and why is that hardy sat down on the love seat because he was starting to get a feeling about this bowen case or cases that he could crack them if he just had some time and now thats not going to happen ever why not because i got a call this afternoon from bill schuyler you remember bill schuyler hes the fbi bureau chief who couldnt find the agents whod testified in the scholler trial hardys eyes lit up although he tried to keep any sign of enthusiasm out of his face tell me the fbis taken over the cases lock stock and barrel citing national security issues citing theyre gonna do it and we cant stop them i think the actual line was i dont got to show you no stinkin badges but even schuyler went so far as to say that he didnt really like it but the order came from high up and there was nothing he could do about it you know what a huge concession that was from him i can imagine i bet you can so you know how me and darrel have spent the last three hours packing up all our files on either of the bowens and delivering them over to the federal building these are two now very probable homicides in my jurisdiction diz and now im off them for no reason that i can understand which accounts for your lessthanstellar mood not that you normally need anything specific but that was faster than i would have thought he held out a hand im not talking about the three hours im talking about allstrong getting someone to pull the fbis strings hes got to be seriously highly connected which is what we figured anyway so you knew this was coming hardy nodded i hoped something like this would happen this soon is a surprise but thats not a bad thing either glitskys face remained hard well im glad youre so happy about it darrel and i are feeling just a little bit used and abused but hardy shook his head i told bracco last night and ill tell you now you werent going to get allstrong on either of the bowens never those cases are old abe what evidence there might have once been is gone and since these guys are stone pros im guessing there wasnt much in the line of evidence anyway to begin with so this fbi takeover its actually very good news yeah im trying to keep my celebration pretty lowkey but just for the record whats good about it hardy sat up straight all of a sudden the whole situation which from allstrongs perspective was under control and stagnant is fluid again its a live issue hes going to have to react and keep reacting if he wants to keep it where he can control it which means hes going to have to deal with me like he dealt with bowen hardy shook his head not if i can help it abe not this time hes tried that approach and now its come back to bite him hes going to see that i hope youre right but even so if the fbi is protecting him from prosecution what difference can anything you do matter to him best case youre a nuisance hes never going down for murder if the feebs wont let anybody build a case ah but thats just it you see i dont want him for murder i want his help to try to get my client out of prison then ill just go away glitskys brow came down and hooded his eyes i hope im not hearing that all this has been about all this time is getting your damn client off hardys head snapped at glitskys rare use of a swear word if hed come to that he was far angrier than hardy had perceived abe he said quietly listen to me like it or not my clients the only leverage weve all got the bowen murders pose no threat theyre ancient history the attempt on evan at san quentin same thing that assailants dead and its never going to be anything more than a prison beef anyway so whats the only other crime we know about that hes done here on us soil putting out the hit on the khalils right which means ron nolan and whos the only guy interested in connecting him to nolan me hes going to have to come to me and then what hardy leaned forward in his chair then i play him evan came to the visiting room in a wheelchair he was going to recover completely he told hardy although he joked that he never wanted to hear those particular words again still it was a good sign that he could make a joke about anything the attack he told hardy had been completely unexpected and except for his rib professionally executed as he walked into what he thought was the empty bathroom as far as he remembered there were no witnesses hardy brought him a copy of the brief to look over and they discussed some of the finer legal points that he didnt understand at first but in the end he seemed satisfied that this was an approach that possibly had legs hardy also brought him up to date on the developments in the bowen cases the fbi takeover and they talked about who the mysterious higherup might be we may never know hardy said somebody who believes that its more important for guys like allstrong to build companies that grow and prosper than worry about if they exactly adhere to the letter of the law so they need to kill a few people look at all the jobs theyre providing the infrastructure totally worth the price right damn straight i love the national security angle like if allstrong goes under what happens exactly at the very least it hurts the war effort all the good work allstrongs doing over there thats always a good one they pull out hardy had his grin on but im also guessing that the big guy whoever he is loses a decent portion of his discretionary cash income evan drew a pained breath i dont like to think thats really happening he looked around at the prison walls but then again i dont like to think that any of this is really happening either the call came in at a little after one oclock just after hardy arrived back at his office mr hardy jack allstrong he had his hearty goodguy voice back on this morning i received a copy of the appeal that youre filing in this evan scholler case mr loy says we can probably expect an application for a writ of habeas corpus to follow he admires your work mr hardy and advises me that there is a fair chance the court will at least order a hearing into your issue i think we might have gotten off on the wrong foot in our last conversation and i wondered if you might be free to come down to my headquarters office this afternoon hardy didnt think it would hurt to play a little hard to get if you dont know anything about mr nolans connection to the khalils and last time you made it pretty clear that you didnt im not sure we have much to talk about well you seem fairly certain that scholler didnt kill ron nolan and if thats the case there might be something we can do to help i think it might be worthwhile to discuss it hardy let him hang for a few more seconds i could give you a couple of hours this afternoon but i really think this meeting should take place in my office hardy sat at his desk with his legal pad in front him hed already written a few notes to remind him of things he needed to cover in his upcoming conversation feeling mostly embarrassed at himself for believing that he might actually have the need for it hed placed his gun in the top desk drawer on his left in easy reach if in fact it came to that as phyllis let allstrong into the room he pretended to be writing looking upexcuse me a few more secondshe motioned to the straightbacked queen anne chair that hed placed in front of his desk indicating that allstrong take it while he did placing his briefcase down next to the chair phyllis closed the door on her way out scrawling some more lines hardy finally put down his pen and pushed the pad to one side it appears hardy said youve got a guardian angel someplace in washington whos taken care of making the police investigation into the bowens go away but as long as evan scholler is alive and in prison either me or someone like me is going to be digging into the connection between allstrong ron nolan and the khalils whoever tried to have evan killed has missed his chance and with him held in protective custody from now on isnt likely to get another one and as youve recently found out appellate lawyers are interchangeable and trust me mr allstrong anyone who reads my file and my notes of which there are several copies will start this inquiry right where i left off does that about sum up the situation allstrong wearing alligator cowboy boots with his light green gabardine suit sat back and crossed a leg his facial features relaxed nearly friendly it adequately elucidates your understanding certainly he said although as i said in our conversation the other day any assumption youre making that ive committed any kind of crime at all is false im sure that federal investigators will find no evidence implicating me or allstrong security in whats happened to either of the bowens im sure they wont hardy said and likewise theyll find no evidence that i ordered ron nolan to kill anybody thats not the way i do business his pro forma pitch completed he flashed a quick salesmans smile since youve arranged to have stevie wonder and ray charles assigned to the investigation hardy said id be surprised if they could find allstrong in the phone book but thats not the point what im going to uncover is the evidence the fbi already gathered that connects nolan and your company to whatever it was that happened in iraq that got the khalils murdered and if in getting to nolan your company gets mixed up in a very public scandal thats just an added bonus allstrong sat impassively what makes you think the fbi has evidence tying allstrong to these killings the agents told the khalil family what the agents found i can find i understood that the agents further told them that the contract had come from kuvan krekar isnt that so allstrong asked hardy nodded thats my understanding too well then well then what well then its obvious where the contract originated isnt it with kuvan not with me and not with allstrong that would be obvious except for one thing or rather except for two people the bowens the whole thing with nolan and kuvan and the khalils was a closed circle until charlie bowen pried it open again if the bowens were still alive i might have believed that killing the khalils was kuvans idea and kuvans contract but kuvan was already dead when charlie bowen started sniffing around and that kind of neatly eliminated the possibility that kuvan was bowens killer but somebody still needed charlie dead because he was going to find out and expose whod really put out the contract on the khalils and you know who that was jack you know because that was you allstrong let his shoulders sag for a moment back to that he said im afraid so hardy met his adversarys eyes unyielding allstrong shrugged nodded leaned down picked up his briefcase brought it up to his lap and snapped it open regrettably he said this has become a very inconvenient situation and for an irrational moment hardy thought hed miscalculated and in another half second he would be dead before he could even react to reach for his own gun which hed so stupidly stupidly placed in the closed top drawer allstrongs silenced bullet would explode with no warning at all through the expensive briefcase and blow hardy into oblivion that would put an end to hardys threat right here right now hardys left hand went to his drawer started to pull it out he wasnt going to have enough time it was over his life was over but in the moment allstrong would have taken his shot if he could instead of firing a weapon hed perhaps concealed in his briefcase he simply continued talking i have to admire your tenacity and industry in fact id like to offer you a retainer to take on some of my legal work mr loy is a fine corporate attorney but lacks the killer instinct sometimes required in my business like all our senior employees you will be paid in cash allstrong turned the briefcase around showing hardy the neatly stacked packages of onehundreddollar bills and no sign of a gun hardy quietly exhaled and brought his shaking hands together clasped now whiteknuckled on his desktop and allstrong continued this is two hundred thousand dollars mr hardy id like to offer it to you against billings for the first year if you prefer i could arrange to have this deposited in an offshore account a swiss bank account or any other place that you choose you would in fact be retained by one of our iraqi subsidiaries who do not file tax returns in the united states so whether you choose to report this to the irs as income is completely up to you i wonder how many of those are my tax dollars hardy said dont be naïve allstrong countered and dont trifle with me the bribe offer having already albeit tacitly admitted his complicity in everything that hardy had accused him of he went on id strongly advise you to consider what im offering as you yourself have noticed other alternatives though perhaps risky and more costly are still available to me hardy clucked and cracked a grin i really thought wed moved beyond that jack allstrong slowly and carefully closed up the briefcase setting it down again beside him sitting back he eyed hardy for a long moment so mr hardy do we have an understanding oh we understand each other jack but no we dont have a deal i thought id made it clear i want evan scholler out of prison i dont care how it happens but thats my price what if the fbi suddenly found evidence that did implicate nolan in the khalils deaths what if there were surveillance reports linking some members of the khalil family to terrorist organizations and wiretaps where they discussed killing ron nolan do you think that would do the job mr hardy i think it might so what you have to do jack is get me that evidence and then what and then i lose interest in you but allstrong still wasnt quite ready to give it up and what if the evidence just doesnt exist hardy inclined his head ah but we know it does remember the fbi found it before they talked to the khalil children you saw it when you decided to sell out kuvan a lengthy silence settled at last allstrong nodded once he should have never used the grenades he said quietly as though explaining a complicated process to a child that was his own decision and just tactically stupid but he didnt care hed become a liability he loved to blow things up he thought it was fun the fool thought he was invincible you want my opinion hardy said popping a peanut into his mouth in glitskys office he did nolan too not personally allstrong himself was still over in iraq back then but one of his guys took out nolan just another job why glitsky asked allstrong said it himself nolan had become a liability he used the frag grenades that could be traced back to allstrong bracco sulking stood against the wall arms crossed over his chest youre not telling me hes giving you something that can be traced back to him im talking about the frags no he wont do that they might get back to the company but old jack will be able to say that nolan stole them or something that he was acting on his own when he killed the khalils it was a freelance gig it doesnt matter anyway glitsky sat all the way back exuding frustration hes got protection remember he might as well have immunity im still having a hard time getting my arms around the fact that the feebs are part of this schuyler wouldnt go along with any of this on his own i wouldnt take it personally abe hardy said and its not on his own hes being told its national security too and he believes his bosses theres a greater good involved so everybody winds up being good guys peachy glitsky replied so what about the bowens bracco asked what about those murders collateral damage and we leave it at that does that seem right to either of you guys hardy turned to him you were never going to make the case anyway darrel never ever in a million years ask abe if he agrees for an answer glitsky shrugged hardy held up a hand im not saying im happy with that but its reality it sucks bracco said what am i supposed to tell jenna the next time she calls that fat cats like allstrong walk sorry but thats reality your parents dont count he slammed his hand hard against a metal locker this just pisses me off and he walked out the door its not over yet hardy called after him in the ensuing silence glitsky growled its not over whats that supposed to mean i mean im going to be getting this evidence in the next few weeks and the great thing about evidence is that it speaks for itself glitsky glared at him oh yeah your client good for him good for you too not just us hardy said no glitsky asked again then who else sitting up he shook his head in disgust get the door on your way out would you ive got real work i got to do hardy was in his office opening his mail having just finished reviewing the documents that he had received over the past three weeks via registered mail from the local fbi office in san francisco the fbi had done its usual efficient and thorough job and from fragments found at the khalil home had matched the grenades used in that attack to a cache of them at the allstrong warehouse at biap beyond that they had recovered a bullet from the khalil scene and matched it to the gun that had been in nolans duffel bag with the grenades downloads from nolans hard drive revealed not just the photos of the khalil house from various angles but also photos of the eventual victims that looked as though theyd been scanned in nolans bank records memorialized regular biweekly automatic deposits of ten thousand dollars and another deposit four days before the khalils were killed of twentyfive thousand there was a handwritten quarter page in nolans handwriting noting the victims names and address some indecipherable scribbling and doodling and the notation circled several times the evidence tying the khalils to a plot to kill nolan was equally impressive the wiretaps arrived accompanied by neat binders of translations from the arabic there were informant reports with names blacked out due to national security but which clearly identified some of the khalils as involved in a plot to murder nolan in retaliation for the menlo park killings hardy had to admire jack allstrongs own thoroughness as well as his caution all of this evidence would be valuable to hardy when the hearing came up for schollers appeal and none of it directly implicated either allstrong himself or his company of course during the same time period hardy had been reading in the local press about the agents involved in the fbis handling of the scholler case the debate raged in the media about whether the agents had been merely grotesquely incompetent or criminally derelict in suppressing such critical evidence in the trial of a bona fide war hero agents were being transferred suspended and demoted glitsky following it daily with hardy could barely suppress his own glee hardy had tried to point out that it was unlikely that anyone truly culpable in the affair was ever really going to be punished but glitsky exulted in the random carnage the agency was inflicting on itself now hardy reached for an envelope it had arrived addressed to him personal and confidential by regular mail with no return address but postmarked in san francisco reaching in he pulled out two sheets of faxed copies of email correspondence between rnolansbcglobalnet and jaaallstrongcom dated the day after the khalil murders it acknowledged that nolan had accomplished his most recent assignment and requested payment of the remainder of his fee into a certain bank account allstrong should advise mr krekar that the situation has been resolved as promised krekar should expect to move on the anbar contracts without competition although there was nothing remotely humorous about any of this a ghost of a smile tickled the side of hardys mouth maybe he ought to tell glitsky that bill schuyler wasnt the gullible gutless gman he needed to pretend to be if he wanted to keep his job on the other hand hardy had no proof that schuyler had had anything to do with this latest evidence any mention of his name would probably just get the man in more trouble and in fact the evidence could have come from any other fbi agent between san francisco and baghdad who had a sense of what was happening and a disgust at the role that the bureau had been forced to play in it hardy realized that without a witness or some other way to authenticate the documents what he had in his hand were just two pieces of paper worthless in a court of law he sat at his desk pulling the tight skin at his jawline as for the hundredth the thousandth time he considered the ramifications of his intentions he had made no promises to allstrong to the contrary hed made it abundantly clear that whatever information he received would be his to do with as he pleased additionally this wasnt information hed gotten from allstrong anyway he owed allstrong nothing as allstrong himself had said it was an inconvenient situation he got up and without a word to anyone walked across his office and out to the copy room where he copied the two pages coming back to his desk he put the copy in his file and began searching through his notes for the address of abdel khalil hardy and frannie were trimming the roses that bounded the fence in their backyard on a cool sunday afternoon in the second week of june talking about the arrival of their children whod both be returning home from their respective schools in the next couple of days i think they should both work hardy said i worked every summer of my life of course you did frannie said i can see you now fouryearold dismas out plowing the fields to say nothing of walking ten miles to school every day in deep snow leave out the snow part he said this was san francisco remember yeah but back when you were a baby wasnt the climate different here frannie enjoying the little joke at the expense of the elevenyear difference in their ages youre a very funny person he reached over and clipped a newly budded rose just at its base hey she turned on him its my old eyes he said backing away i was aiming for lower down on the stem yeah well keep it up and ill aim for lower down too she took a quick and playful swipe at him with her cutting tool hardy backed up another step then cocked his head looking over her shoulder well look what the cat dragged in glitsky was just emerging into the yard from the narrow walkway between their house and the neighbors he was in civilian clothes hands in the pockets of his battered leather jacket getting up to them he gave frannie half a hug and accepted her kiss on the cheek then turned to her husband you should leave your phone on i know its bad of me hardy said but its sunday i figured whatever it is can wait but maybe not maybe not after all you know anything about this about what jack allstrong hardy felt his stomach go hollow he caught his breath cleared his throat tried to swallow no what about him he got in his car this morning down in hillsborough and turned it on and it blew up him and half his house its all over the news i dont watch tv on sunday either glitsky just stood there frannie touched glitskys arm abe whats wrong i dont know fran i dont know if anythings wrong i was thinking diz might be able to tell me he kept his eyes on hardy who drew another breath then another then blew out heavily and went down to one knee epilogue on a warm latesummer day about fifteen months after jack allstrongs death an excellent jazz quartet was doing arrangements of big band material in her backyard as eileen scholler came out of her house she wended her way under the balloons and through the large crowd of wellwishers touching an arm here a back there smiling and exchanging pleasantries and congratulations with her guests at last she came to the table under one of the laden lemon trees where dismas and frannie hardy sat drinking white wine with everett washburn ah here you are way in the back do you mind if an old lady pulls up a chair i dont see any old ladies washburn said but glowing mothers of war heroes are always welcome hardy pulled out the chair and as she sat her eyes started to tear up at washburns words she smiled around the table war hero i never thought id hear anybody say that about evan again and now she indicated the overflow crowd and turned to hardy how am i ever going to repay you she asked believe me eileen he said the result was plenty payment enough after the court of appeals had ordered a new trial for evan the san mateo county district attorney declined to prosecute further the fbi it seems was reluctant to cooperate citing national security and the need to keep its own internal investigation confidential over the impassioned objection of mary patricia whelanmiille the da had been only too happy to use that as a reason to dismiss the charges seeing evan walking around a free man look at him over there laughin and scratchin they all looked to where evan stood with his arm around tara in a knot of people comprised of his father several other guys and women about his own age tony onofrio and even stan paganini i still feel like its a dream eileen said like im going to wake up and hes going to be in prison again frannie reached over and put a hand over hers thats not going to happen whats going to happen is he and tara are going to get married next month and i wouldnt be at all surprised if you become a grandmother in pretty short order after that eileen squeezed frannies hand looked briefly skyward then came back to her your mouth to gods ear she said but i almost cant bring myself to hope after all this time youll get used to it hardy said no eileen smiled across at him you dont understand i never want to get used to it i want to just be glad hes back in our lives every day and never forget how today feels and how lucky we are we really never believed wed see this and now that its here its justwell its just a miracle were living in a miracle and we cant forget that and im just so grateful suddenly she stood up walked around behind washburn leaned over and hugged hardy for a long moment then gave him a kiss on the cheek and straightened up thank you she said now i think im going to go hug my son again thats a great idea hardy said hug him for me too when shed gone off washburn sipped his wine i must confess to both of you that i feel a little awkward being here she should have been able to have this party four years ago hardy shook his head the government cheated everett they cheated him out of a fair trial i wouldnt beat myself up over it frannie leaned over yes he would she said but that doesnt change the fact that you shouldnt well in any event washburn said justice delayed is justice denied and all of that but today ive got to go with its better late than never he glanced back over in evans direction the boys paid some pretty mean dues ill give him that whatevers up next ive got to believe hes going to be able to handle it odds are good hardy said the odds are pretty damn good evan knew that he was dealing with an expert in handtohand combat and couldnt afford to hesitate as soon as nolan started to open the door he lowered his shoulder and rammed as hard as he could the impact knocked nolan backward the back of his leg caught the edge of the coffee table and he went over and down backward evan was on him a knee into his chest almost before he hit the floor and he followed with two or three nearinstantaneous metalknuckled fists to the jaw but all the alcohol he had on board wasnt to his advantage nolan came up with a vicious karate chop to evans neck that pitched him off to the side and onto his back by the fireplace while at the same time it cut off his ability to breathe nolan twisted and leapt across the distance separating them maybe five feet evan swung wildly in a huge roundhouse that nolan blocked with his arm but scored with a knee to the groin that allowed him to go inside then jab twice at nolans head with the knuckles glancing blows that nevertheless moved nolan back but not for long nolan got to his knees and actually produced a vacant smile of determination you are so fucking dead he said scrambling to his own feet still gasping for breath evan grabbed the poker by the fireplace and held it to the side for an instant and then stepped forward and slashed with it nolan jumped back out of the way and as the poker got past him twisted half around and delivered a kick to evans stomach that knocked more air out of him though it left nolan exposed to the backhand slash of the poker but between the loss of breath and his drunken state evans reflexes werent responding as they usually did nolan got his hands on the poker as it came at him and brought it over his own shoulder and he turned and leveraged himself into evans torso pulling him over his back slamming him down judostyle half against the coffee table and half onto the floor evan felt as though hed broken his back but if he simply lay there and let nolan come at him he knew that he would have no chance and that his enemy would kill him here and now so in desperation he kicked out again this time hitting nolan hard in the knee spinning him half around and down against the brick of the fireplace clattering in the tools still left against the hearth when evan tried to move to get up again though his body wouldnt obey the frantic commands of his brain pushing against his own inertia he rolled himself over and over again hoping to use the coffee table as a shield as nolan picked himself up slowly now as though sensing his advantage still struggling for breath the images of nolan straightening up doubling and blurring before his eyes evan forced himself to a knee hoping to get his hands on something he could use for a weapon the only chance was the poker on the floor midway between them with an animal growl lunging he got his hands on it just as nolans one foot came down pinning his hands to the floor while the other foot cocked and exploded at evans left ear knocking him headfirst against the wall from where now unconscious he crumpled to the ground there was no time he woke up again and with his swollen tongue tasted blood in his mouth felt its crusted residue on his dry and cracked lips through the rooms door although the room itself was dark he could see nolan fumbling in the closet where evan knew he kept the gun the pain in his head had now spread to his back his neck his legs he could not move a muscle the slightest effortopening his eyes the smallest crack a quarterinch twist of his head a twitch in his kneeand the world for his sanity and protection went black the footsteps came closer almost shuffling with a slow deliberation even in the darkness evan felt a shadow fall over him nolan had the gun in his hand then the whispered words you stupid son of a bitch evan did not move or respond in any way did not feel that he could nolan stood over him whatever damage nolan had done to him and evan realized that possibly it was severe enough to be lifethreatening the fight had not been without its own consequences for the commando from the way nolan was moving he was clearly hurt physically compromised with one arm so badly injured it took him a couple of tries to rack a round into the chamber evan had no option but to attack again and he twisted and kicked hitting nolan below his knees knocking him down evan scrambled grabbing for nolans gun hand with both of his getting ahold of it with his one free hand nolan swung in tight again and again hard jabs to the side of evans head but even to protect his head evan didnt dare release his grip on nolans gun hand to let go of the gun was to die grabbing the barrel with all of his strength grunting with the exertion he finally lifted enough to get the gun and the hand that held it off the ground and then he twisted it and twisted again and at last the gun was free and in his hand the barrel now tight against nolans forehead it was over nolan went limp the fight suddenly all out of him he held his arms out against the floor in an igiveup gesture for a full second that felt like a minute neither man moved and then in a lightning strike nolan screamed and threw a last jab in the direction of evans head and the gun went off acknowledgments in preparation for this book i spoke to many veterans of the fighting in iraq and read a lot of books about that country and the war that as this book goes to
