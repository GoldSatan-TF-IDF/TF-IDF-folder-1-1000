jeffrey archer only time will tell the first book in the clifton chronicles series alan quilter the barringtons the cliftons maisie clifton prelude this story would never have been written if i hadnt become pregnant mind you i had always planned to lose my virginity on the works outing to westonsupermare just not to that particular man arthur clifton was born in still house lane just like me even went to the same school merrywood elementary but as i was two years younger than him he didnt know i existed all the girls in my class had a crush on him and not just because he captained the school football team although arthur had never shown any interest in me while i was at school that changed soon after hed returned from the western front im not even sure he realized who i was when he asked me for a dance that saturday night at the palais but to be fair i had to look twice before i recognized him because hed grown a pencil moustache and had his hair slicked back like ronald colman he didnt look at another girl that night and after wed danced the last waltz i knew it would only be a matter of time before he asked me to marry him arthur held my hand as we walked back home and when we reached my front door he tried to kiss me i turned away after all the reverend watts had told me often enough that i had to stay pure until the day i was married and miss monday our choir mistress warned me that men only wanted one thing and once theyd got it they quickly lost interest i often wondered if miss monday spoke from experience the following saturday arthur invited me to the flicks to see lillian gish in broken blossoms and although i allowed him to put an arm around my shoulder i still didnt let him kiss me he didnt make a fuss truth is arthur was rather shy the next saturday i did allow him to kiss me but when he tried to put a hand inside my blouse i pushed him away in fact i didnt let him do that until hed proposed bought a ring and the reverend watts had read the banns a second time my brother stan told me that i was the last known virgin on our side of the river avon though i suspect most of his conquests were in his mind still i decided the time had come and when better than the works outing to westonsupermare with the man i was going to marry in a few weeks time however as soon as arthur and stan got off the charabanc they headed straight for the nearest pub but id spent the past month planning for this moment so when i got off the coach like a good girl guide i was prepared i was walking towards the pier feeling pretty fed up when i became aware someone was following me i looked around and was surprised when i saw who it was he caught up with me and asked if i was on my own yes i said aware that by now arthur would be on his third pint when he put a hand on my bum i should have slapped his face but for several reasons i didnt to start with i thought about the advantages of having sex with someone i wasnt likely to come across again and i have to admit i was flattered by his advances by the time arthur and stan would have been downing their eighth pints hed booked us into a guest house just off the seafront they seemed to have a special rate for visitors who had no plans to spend the night he started kissing me even before wed reached the first landing and once the bedroom door was closed he quickly undid the buttons of my blouse it obviously wasnt his first time in fact im pretty sure i wasnt the first girl hed had on a works outing otherwise how did he know about the special rates i must confess i hadnt expected it to be all over quite so quickly once hed climbed off me i disappeared into the bathroom while he sat on the end of the bed and lit up a fag perhaps it would be better the second time i thought but when i came back out he was nowhere to be seen i have to admit i was disappointed i might have felt more guilty about being unfaithful to arthur if he hadnt been sick all over me on the journey back to bristol the next day i told my mum what had happened without letting on who the bloke was after all she hadnt met him and was never likely to mum told me to keep my mouth shut as she didnt want to have to cancel the wedding and even if i did turn out to be pregnant no one would be any the wiser as arthur and i would be married by the time anyone noticed harry clifton i was told my father was killed in the war whenever i questioned my mother about his death she didnt say any more than that hed served with the royal gloucestershire regiment and had been killed fighting on the western front only days before the armistice was signed grandma said my dad had been a brave man and once when we were alone in the house she showed me his medals my grandpa rarely offered an opinion on anything but then he was deaf as a post so he might not have heard the question in the first place the only other man i can remember was my uncle stan who used to sit at the top of the table at breakfast time when he left of a morning i would often follow him to the city docks where he worked every day i spent at the dockyard was an adventure cargo ships coming from distant lands and unloading their wares rice sugar bananas jute and many other things id never heard of once the holds had been emptied the dockers would load them with salt apples tin even coal my least favourite because it was an obvious clue to what id been doing all day and annoyed my mother before they set off again to i knew not where i always wanted to help my uncle stan unload whatever ship had docked that morning but he just laughed saying all in good time my lad it couldnt be soon enough for me but without any warning school got in the way i was sent to merrywood elementary when i was six and i thought it was a complete waste of time what was the point of school when i could learn all i needed to at the docks i wouldnt have bothered to go back the following day if my mother hadnt dragged me to the front gates deposited me and returned at four oclock that afternoon to take me home i didnt realize mum had other plans for my future which didnt include joining uncle stan in the shipyard once mum had dropped me off each morning i would hang around in the yard until she was out of sight then slope off to the docks i made sure i was always back at the school gates when she returned to pick me up in the afternoon on the way home i would tell her everything id done at school that day i was good at making up stories but it wasnt long before she discovered that was all they were stories one or two other boys from my school also used to hang around the docks but i kept my distance from them they were older and bigger and used to thump me if i got in their way i also had to keep an eye out for mr haskins the chief ganger because if he ever found me loitering to use his favourite word he would send me off with a kick up the backside and the threat if i see you loiterin round here again my lad ill report you to the headmaster occasionally haskins decided hed seen me once too often and id be reported to the headmaster who would leather me before sending me back to my classroom my form master mr holcombe never let on if i didnt show up for his class but then he was a bit soft whenever my mum found out id been playing truant she couldnt hide her anger and would stop my halfpennyaweek pocket money but despite the occasional punch from an older boy regular leatherings from the headmaster and the loss of my pocket money i still couldnt resist the draw of the docks i made only one real friend while i loitered around the dockyard his name was old jack tar mr tar lived in an abandoned railway carriage at the end of the sheds uncle stan told me to keep away from old jack because he was a stupid dirty old tramp he didnt look that dirty to me certainly not as dirty as stan and it wasnt long before i discovered he wasnt stupid either after lunch with my uncle stan one bite of his marmite sandwich his discarded apple core and a swig of beer i would be back at school in time for a game of football the only activity i considered it worth turning up for after all when i left school i was going to captain bristol city or build a ship that would sail around the world if mr holcombe kept his mouth shut and the ganger didnt report me to the headmaster i could go for days without being found out and as long as i avoided the coal barges and was standing by the school gate at four oclock every afternoon my mother would never be any the wiser every other saturday uncle stan would take me to watch bristol city at ashton gate on sunday mornings mum used to cart me off to holy nativity church something i couldnt find a way of getting out of once the reverend watts had given the final blessing i would run all the way to the recreation ground and join my mates for a game of football before returning home in time for dinner by the time i was seven it was clear to anyone who knew anything about the game of football that i was never going to get into the school team let alone captain bristol city but that was when i discovered that god had given me one small gift and it wasnt in my feet to begin with i didnt notice that anyone who sat near me in church on a sunday morning stopped singing whenever i opened my mouth i wouldnt have given it a second thought if mum hadnt suggested i join the choir i laughed scornfully after all everyone knew the choir was only for girls and cissies i would have dismissed the idea out of hand if the reverend watts hadnt told me that choirboys were paid a penny for funerals and tuppence for weddings my first experience of bribery but even after id reluctantly agreed to take a vocal test the devil decided to place an obstacle in my path in the form of miss eleanor e monday i would never have come across miss monday if she hadnt been the choir mistress at holy nativity although she was only five feet three and looked as though a gust of wind might blow her away no one tried to take the mickey i have a feeling that even the devil would have been frightened of miss monday because the reverend watts certainly was i agreed to take a vocal test but not before my mum had handed over a months pocket money in advance the following sunday i stood in line with a group of other lads and waited to be called you will always be on time for choir practice miss monday announced fixing a gimlet eye on me i stared back defiantly you will never speak unless spoken to i somehow managed to remain silent and during the service you will concentrate at all times i reluctantly nodded and then god bless her she gave me a way out but most importantly she declared placing her hands on her hips within twelve weeks you will be expected to pass a reading and writing test so that i can be sure you are able to tackle a new anthem or an unfamiliar psalm i was pleased to have fallen at the first hurdle but as i was to discover miss eleanor e monday didnt give up easily what piece have you chosen to sing child she asked me when i reached the front of the line i havent chosen anything i told her she opened a hymn book handed it to me and sat down at the piano i smiled at the thought that i might still be able to make the second half of our sunday morning football game she began to play a familiar tune and when i saw my mother glaring at me from the front row of pews i decided id better go through with it just to keep her happy all things bright and beautiful all creatures great and small all things wise and wonderful a smile had appeared on miss mondays face long before i reached the lord god made them all whats your name child she asked harry clifton miss harry clifton you will report for choir practice on mondays wednesdays and fridays at six oclock sharp turning to the boy standing behind me she said next i promised my mum id be on time for the first choir practice even though i knew it would be my last as miss monday would soon realize i couldnt read or write and it would have been my last if it hadnt been obvious to anyone listening that my singing voice was in a different class to that of any other boy in the choir in fact the moment i opened my mouth everyone fell silent and the looks of admiration even awe that i had desperately sought on the football field were happening in church miss monday pretended not to notice after she dismissed us i didnt go home but ran all the way to the docks so i could ask mr tar what i should do about the fact that i couldnt read or write i listened carefully to the old mans advice and the next day i went back to school and took my place in mr holcombes class the schoolmaster couldnt hide his surprise when he saw me sitting in the front row and was even more surprised when i paid close attention to the morning lesson for the first time mr holcombe began by teaching me the alphabet and within days i could write out all twentysix letters if not always in the correct order my mum would have helped me when i got home in the afternoon but like the rest of my family she also couldnt read or write uncle stan could just about scrawl his signature and although he could tell the difference between a packet of willss star and wild woodbines i was fairly sure he couldnt actually read the labels despite his unhelpful mutterings i set about writing the alphabet on any piece of scrap paper i could find uncle stan didnt seem to notice that the tornup newspaper in the privy was always covered in letters once id mastered the alphabet mr holcombe introduced me to a few simple words dog cat mum and dad that was when i first asked him about my dad hoping that he might be able to tell me something about him after all he seemed to know everything but he seemed puzzled that i knew so little about my own dad a week later he wrote my first fourletter word on the blackboard book and then five house and six school by the end of the month i could write my first sentence the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog which mr holcombe pointed out contained every letter in the alphabet i checked and he turned out to be right by the end of term i could spell anthem psalm and even hymn although mr holcombe kept reminding me i still dropped my aitches whenever i spoke but then we broke up for the holidays and i began to worry i would never pass miss mondays demanding test without mr holcombes help and that might have been the case if old jack hadnt taken his place i was half an hour early for choir practice on the friday evening when i knew i would have to pass my second test if i hoped to continue as a member of the choir i sat silently in the stalls hoping miss monday would pick on someone else before she called on me i had already passed the first test with what miss monday had described as flying colours we had all been asked to recite the lords prayer this was not a problem for me because for as long as i could remember my mum knelt by my bed each night and repeated the familiar words before tucking me up however miss mondays next test was to prove far more demanding by this time the end of our second month we were expected to read a psalm out loud in front of the rest of the choir i chose psalm which i also knew off by heart having sung it so often in the past i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help i could only hope that my help cometh from the lord although i was able to turn to the correct page in the psalm book as i could now count from one to a hundred i feared miss monday would realize that i was unable to follow every verse line by line if she did she didnt let on because i remained in the choir stalls for another month while two other miscreants her word not that i knew what it meant until i asked mr holcombe the next day were dispatched back to the congregation when the time came for me to take the third and final test i was ready for it miss monday asked those of us who remained to write out the ten commandments in the correct order without referring to the book of exodus the choir mistress turned a blind eye to the fact that i placed theft ahead of murder couldnt spell adultery and certainly didnt know what it meant only after two other miscreants were summarily dismissed for lesser offences did i realize just how exceptional my voice must be on the first sunday of advent miss monday announced that she had selected three new trebles or little angels as the reverend watts was wont to describe us to join her choir the remainder having been rejected for committing such unforgivable sins as chattering during the sermon sucking a gobstopper and in the case of two boys being caught playing conkers during the nunc dimittis the following sunday i dressed up in a long blue cassock with a ruffled white collar i alone was allowed to wear a bronze medallion of the virgin mother around my neck to show that i had been selected as the treble soloist i would have proudly worn the medallion all the way back home even to school the next morning to show off to the rest of the lads if only miss monday hadnt retrieved it at the end of each service on sundays i was transported into another world but i feared this state of delirium could not last for ever when uncle stan rose in the morning he somehow managed to wake the entire household no one complained as he was the breadwinner in the family and in any case he was cheaper and more reliable than an alarm clock the first noise harry would hear was the bedroom door slamming this would be followed by his uncle tramping along the creaky wooden landing down the stairs and out of the house then another door would slam as he disappeared into the privy if anyone was still asleep the rush of water as uncle stan pulled the chain followed by two more slammed doors before he returned to the bedroom served to remind them that stan expected his breakfast to be on the table by the time he walked into the kitchen he only had a wash and a shave on saturday evenings before going off to the palais or the odeon he took a bath four times a year on quarterday no one was going to accuse stan of wasting his hardearned cash on soap maisie harrys mum would be next up leaping out of bed moments after the first slammed door there would be a bowl of porridge on the stove by the time stan came out of the privy grandma followed shortly afterwards and would join her daughter in the kitchen before stan had taken his place at the head of the table harry had to be down within five minutes of the first slammed door if he hoped to get any breakfast the last to arrive in the kitchen would be grandpa who was so deaf he often managed to sleep through stans early morning ritual this daily routine in the clifton household never varied when youve only got one outside privy one sink and one towel order becomes a necessity by the time harry was splashing his face with a trickle of cold water his mother would be serving breakfast in the kitchen two thickly sliced pieces of bread covered in lard for stan and four thin slices for the rest of the family which she would toast if there was any coal left in the sack dumped outside the front door every monday once stan had finished his porridge harry would be allowed to lick the bowl a large brown pot of tea was always brewing on the hearth which grandma would pour into a variety of mugs through a silverplated victorian tea strainer she had inherited from her mother while the other members of the family enjoyed a mug of unsweetened tea sugar was only for high days and holidays stan would open his first bottle of beer which he usually gulped down in one draught he would then rise from the table and burp loudly before picking up his lunch box which grandma had prepared while he was having his breakfast two marmite sandwiches a sausage an apple two more bottles of beer and a packet of five coffin nails once stan had left for the docks everyone began to talk at once grandma always wanted to know who had visited the tea shop where her daughter worked as a waitress what they ate what they were wearing where they sat details of meals that were cooked on a stove in a room lit by electric light bulbs that didnt leave any candle wax not to mention customers who sometimes left a thruppennybit tip which maisie had to split with the cook maisie was more concerned to find out what harry had done at school the previous day she demanded a daily report which didnt seem to interest grandma perhaps because shed never been to school come to think of it shed never been to a tea shop either grandpa rarely commented because after four years of loading and unloading an artillery field gun morning noon and night he was so deaf he had to satisfy himself with watching their lips move and nodding from time to time this could give outsiders the impression he was stupid which the rest of the family knew to their cost he wasnt the familys morning routine only varied at weekends on saturdays harry would follow his uncle out of the kitchen always remaining a pace behind him as he walked to the docks on sunday harrys mum would accompany the boy to holy nativity church where from the third row of the pews she would bask in the glory of the choirs treble soloist but today was saturday during the twentyminute walk to the docks harry never opened his mouth unless his uncle spoke whenever he did it invariably turned out to be the same conversation theyd had the previous saturday when are you goin to leave school and do a days work youngun was always uncle stans opening salvo not allowed to leave until im fourteen harry reminded him its the law a bloody stupid law if you ask me id packed up school and was workin on the docks by the time i were twelve stan would announce as if harry had never heard this profound observation before harry didnt bother to respond as he already knew what his uncles next sentence would be and whats more id signed up to join kitcheners army before my seventeenth birthday tell me about the war uncle stan said harry aware that this would keep him occupied for several hundred yards me and your dad joined the royal gloucestershire regiment on the same day stan said touching his cloth cap as if saluting a distant memory after twelve weeks basic training at taunton barracks we was shipped off to wipers to fight the boche once we got there we spent most of our time cooped up in ratinfested trenches waiting to be told by some toffeenosed officer that when the bugle sounded we was going over the top bayonets fixed rifles firing as we advanced towards the enemy lines this would be followed by a long pause after which stan would add i was one of the lucky ones got back to blighty all shipshape and bristol fashion harry could have predicted his next sentence word for word but remained silent you just dont know how lucky you are my lad i lost two brothers your uncle ray and your uncle bert and your father not only lost a brother but his father your other grandad what you never met a proper man who could down a pint of beer faster than any docker ive ever come across if stan had looked down he would have seen the boy mouthing his words but today to harrys surprise uncle stan added a sentence hed never uttered before and your dad would still be alive today if only management had listened to me harry was suddenly alert his dads death had always been the subject of whispered conversations and hushed tones but uncle stan clammed up as if he realized hed gone too far maybe next week thought harry catching his uncle up and keeping in step with him as if they were two soldiers on a parade ground so who are city playin this afternoon asked stan back on script charlton athletic harry replied theyre a load of old cobblers they trounced us last season harry reminded his uncle bloody lucky if you ask me said stan and didnt open his mouth again when they reached the entrance to the dockyard stan clocked in before heading off to the pen where he was working with a gang of other dockers none of whom could afford to be a minute late unemployment was at an alltime high and too many young men were standing outside the gates waiting to take their place harry didnt follow his uncle because he knew that if mr haskins caught him hanging around the sheds he would get a clip round the ear followed by a boot up the backside from his uncle for annoying the ganger instead he set off in the opposite direction harrys first port of call every saturday morning was old jack tar who lived in the railway carriage at the other end of the dockyard he had never told stan about his regular visits because his uncle had warned him to avoid the old man at all costs probably hasnt had a bath in years said a man who washed once a quarter and then only after harrys mother complained about the smell but curiosity had long ago got the better of harry and one morning hed crept up to the railway carriage on his hands and knees lifted himself up and peeped through a window the old man was sitting in first class reading a book old jack turned to face him and said come on in lad harry jumped down and didnt stop running until he reached his front door the following saturday harry once again crawled up to the carriage and peered inside old jack seemed to be fast asleep but then harry heard him say why dont you come in my boy im not going to bite you harry turned the heavy brass handle and tentatively pulled open the carriage door but he didnt step inside he just stared at the man seated in the centre of the carriage it was hard to tell how old he was because his face was covered in a wellgroomed saltandpepper beard which made him look like the sailor on the players please packet but he looked at harry with a warmth in his eyes that uncle stan had never managed are you old jack tar harry ventured thats what they call me the old man replied and is this where you live harry asked glancing around the carriage his eyes settling on a stack of old newspapers piled high on the opposite seat yes he replied its been my home for these past twenty years why dont you close the door and take a seat young man harry gave the offer some thought before he jumped back out of the carriage and once again ran away the following saturday harry did close the door but he kept hold of the handle ready to bolt if the old man as much as twitched a muscle they stared at each other for some time before old jack asked whats your name harry and where do you go to school i dont go to school then what are you hoping to do with your life young man join my uncle on the docks of course harry replied why would you want to do that said the old man why not harry bristled dont you think im good enough youre far too good replied old jack when i was your age he continued i wanted to join the army and nothing my old man could say or do would dissuade me for the next hour harry stood mesmerized while old jack tar reminisced about the docks the city of bristol and lands beyond the sea that he couldnt have been taught about in geography lessons the following saturday and for more saturdays than he would remember harry continued to visit old jack tar but he never once told his uncle or his mother for fear they would stop him going to see his first real friend when harry knocked on the door of the railway carriage that saturday morning old jack had clearly been waiting for him because his usual coxs orange pippin had been placed on the seat opposite harry picked it up took a bite and sat down thank you mr tar harry said as he wiped some juice from his chin he never asked where the apples came from it just added to the mystery of the great man how different he was from uncle stan who repeated the little he knew again and again whereas old jack introduced harry to new words new experiences even new worlds every week he often wondered why mr tar wasnt a schoolmaster he seemed to know even more than miss monday and almost as much as mr holcombe harry was convinced that mr holcombe knew everything because he never failed to answer any question harry put to him old jack smiled across at him but didnt speak until harry had finished his apple and thrown the core out of the window what have you learnt at school this week the old man asked that you didnt know a week ago mr holcombe told me there are other countries beyond the sea that are part of the british empire and they are all reigned over by the king hes quite right said old jack can you name any of those countries australia canada india he hesitated and america no not america said old jack that used to be the case but it isnt any more thanks to a weak prime minister and a sick king who was the king and who was the prime minister demanded harry angrily king george iii was on the throne in said old jack but to be fair he was a sick man while lord north his prime minister simply ignored what was taking place in the colonies and sadly in the end our own kith and kin took up arms against us but we must have beaten them said harry no we didnt said old jack not only did they have right on their side not that thats a prerequisite for victory what does prerequisite mean required as a precondition said old jack who then continued as if he hadnt been interrupted but they were also led by a brilliant general what was his name george washington you told me last week that washington was the capital of america was he named after the city no the city was named after him it was built on an area of marshland known as columbia through which the potomac river flows is bristol named after a man too no chuckled old jack amused by how quickly harrys inquisitive mind could switch from subject to subject bristol was originally called brigstowe which means the site of a bridge so when did it become bristol historians differ in their opinions said old jack although bristol castle was built by robert of gloucester in when he saw the opportunity to trade wool with the irish after that the city developed into a trading port since then its been a centre of shipbuilding for hundreds of years and grew even more quickly when the navy needed to expand in my dad fought in the great war said harry with pride did you for the first time old jack hesitated before answering one of harrys questions he just sat there not saying a word im sorry mr tar said harry i didnt mean to pry no no said old jack its just that i havent been asked that question for some years without another word he opened his hand to reveal a sixpence harry took the little silver coin and bit it something hed seen his uncle do thank you he said before pocketing it go and buy yourself some fish and chips from the dockside café but dont tell your uncle because hell only ask where you got the money in truth harry had never told his uncle anything about old jack hed once heard stan tell his mum the loony ought to be locked up hed asked miss monday what a loony was because he couldnt find the word in the dictionary and when she told him he realized for the first time just how stupid his uncle stan must be not necessarily stupid miss monday counselled simply illinformed and therefore prejudiced i have no doubt harry she added that youll meet many more such men during your lifetime some of them in far more exalted positions than your uncle maisie waited until she heard the front door slam and was confident that stan was on his way to work before she announced ive been offered a job as a waitress at the royal hotel no one seated round the table responded as conversations at breakfast were supposed to follow a regular pattern and not take anyone by surprise harry had a dozen questions he wanted to ask but waited for his grandma to speak first she simply busied herself with pouring another cup of tea as if she hadnt heard her daughter in the first place will someone please say something said maisie i didnt even realize you were looking for another job ventured harry i wasnt said maisie but last week a mr frampton the manager of the royal dropped into tillys for coffee he came back several times and then he offered me a job i thought you were happy at the tea shop said grandma finally joining in after all miss tilly pays well and the hours suit i am happy said harrys mum but mr framptons offering me five pounds a week and half of all the tips i could be bringing home as much as six pounds on a friday grandma sat there with her mouth wide open will you have to work nights asked harry once hed finished licking stans porridge bowl no i wont maisie said ruffling her sons hair and whats more ill get one day off a fortnight are your clothes posh enough for a grand hotel like the royal asked grandma ill be supplied with a uniform and a fresh white apron every morning the hotel even has its own laundry i dont doubt it said grandma but i can think of one problem were all going to have to learn to live with and whats that mum asked maisie you could end up earnin more than stan and hes not going to like that not one little bit then hell just have to learn to live with it wont he said grandpa offering an opinion for the first time in weeks the extra money was going to come in useful especially after what had happened at the holy nativity maisie had been about to leave the church after the service when miss monday walked purposefully down the aisle towards her can i have a private word with you mrs clifton she asked before turning and walking back down the aisle towards the vestry maisie chased after her like a child in the pied pipers wake she feared the worst what had harry been up to this time maisie followed the choir mistress into the vestry and felt her legs give way when she saw the reverend watts mr holcombe and another gentleman standing there as miss monday closed the door quietly behind her maisie began to shake uncontrollably the reverend watts placed an arm around her shoulder theres nothing for you to worry about my dear he assured her on the contrary i hope you will feel we are the bearers of glad tidings he added offering her a seat maisie sat down but still couldnt stop shaking once everyone was seated miss monday took over we wanted to talk to you about harry mrs clifton she began maisie pursed her lips what could the boy possibly have done to bring three such important people together ill not beat about the bush the choir mistress continued the music master at st bedes has approached me and asked if harry would consider entering his name for one of their choral scholarships but hes very happy at holy nativity said maisie in any case where is st bedes church ive never even heard of it st bedes is not a church said miss monday its a choir school that supplies choristers for st mary redcliffe which was famously described by queen elizabeth as the fairest and godliest church in all the land so would he have to leave his school as well as the church asked maisie in disbelief try to look upon it as an opportunity that might change his whole life mrs clifton said mr holcombe speaking for the first time but wouldnt he have to mix with posh clever boys i doubt if there will be many children at st bedes cleverer than harry said mr holcombe hes the brightest lad ive ever taught although we get the occasional boy into the grammar school none of our pupils has ever been offered the chance of a place at st bedes before theres something else you need to know before you make up your mind said the reverend watts maisie looked even more anxious harry would have to leave home during term time because st bedes is a boarding school then its out of the question said maisie i couldnt afford it that shouldnt prove a problem said miss monday if harry is offered a scholarship the school would not only waive any fees but also award him a bursary of ten pounds a term but is this one of those schools where the fathers wear suits and ties and the mothers dont work asked maisie its worse than that said miss monday trying to make light of it the masters wear long black gowns and mortarboards on their heads still said the reverend watts joining in at least there would be no more leatherings for harry theyre far more refined at st bedes they just cane the boys only maisie didnt laugh but why would he want to leave home she asked hes settled at merrywood elementary and he wont want to give up being senior chorister at holy nativity i must confess that my loss would be even greater than his said miss monday but then im sure our lord would not want me to stand in the way of such a gifted child simply because of my own selfish desires she added quietly even if i agree said maisie playing her last card that doesnt mean harry will i had a word with the boy last week admitted mr holcombe of course he was apprehensive about such a challenge but if i recall his exact words were id like to have a go sir but only if you think im good enough but he added before maisie could respond he also made it clear that he wouldnt even consider the idea unless his mother agreed harry was both terrified and excited by the thought of taking the entrance exam but just as anxious about failing and letting so many people down as he was about succeeding and having to leave home during the following term he never once missed a lesson at merrywood and when he returned home each evening he went straight up to the bedroom he shared with uncle stan where with the aid of a candle he studied for hours that until then he hadnt realized existed there were even occasions when his mother found harry sound asleep on the floor open books scattered around him every saturday morning he continued to visit old jack who seemed to know a great deal about st bedes and continued to teach harry about so many other things almost as if he knew where mr holcombe had left off on saturday afternoons much to the disgust of uncle stan harry no longer accompanied him to ashton gate to watch bristol city but returned to merrywood where mr holcombe gave him extra lessons it would be years before harry worked out that mr holcombe was also forgoing his regular visits to support the robins in order to teach him as the day of the examination drew nearer harry became even more frightened of failure than of the possibility of success on the appointed day mr holcombe accompanied his star pupil to the colston hall where the twohour examination would take place he left harry at the entrance to the building with the words dont forget to read each question twice before you even pick up your pen a piece of advice hed repeated several times during the past week harry smiled nervously and shook hands with mr holcombe as if they were old friends he entered the examination hall to find about sixty other boys standing around in small groups chattering it was clear to harry that many of them already knew each other while he didnt know anyone despite this one or two of them stopped talking and glanced at him as he made his way to the front of the hall trying to look confident abbott barrington cabot clifton deakins fry harry took his place at a desk in the front row and just moments before the clock struck ten several masters in long black gowns and mortarboards swept in and placed examination papers on the desks in front of each candidate gentlemen said a master standing at the front of the hall who had not taken part in the distribution of the papers my name is mr frobisher and i am your invigilator you have two hours in which to answer one hundred questions good luck a clock he couldnt see struck ten all around him pens dipped into inkwells and began to scratch furiously across paper but harry simply folded his arms leant on the desk and read each question slowly he was among the last to pick up his pen harry couldnt know that mr holcombe was pacing up and down on the pavement outside feeling far more nervous than his pupil or that his mother was glancing up at the clock in the foyer of the royal hotel every few minutes as she served morning coffee or that miss monday was kneeling in silent prayer before the altar at holy nativity moments after the clock had struck twelve the examination papers were gathered up and the boys were allowed to leave the hall some laughing some frowning others thoughtful when mr holcombe first saw harry his heart sank was it that bad he asked harry didnt reply until he was certain no other boy could overhear his words not at all what i expected he said what do you mean asked mr holcombe anxiously the questions were far too easy replied harry mr holcombe felt that he had never been paid a greater compliment in his life two suits madam grey one blazer navy five shirts white five stiff collars white six pairs of calflength socks grey six sets of undergarments white and one st bedes tie the shop assistant checked the list carefully i think that covers everything oh no the boy will also need a school cap he reached under the counter opened a drawer and removed a red and black cap which he placed on harrys head a perfect fit he pronounced maisie smiled at her son with considerable pride harry looked every inch a st bedes boy that will be three pounds ten shillings and six pence madam maisie tried not to look too dismayed is it possible to purchase any of these items secondhand she whispered no madam this is not a secondhand shop said the assistant who had already decided that this customer would not be allowed to open an account maisie opened her purse handed over four pound notes and waited for the change she was relieved that st bedes had paid the first terms bursary in advance especially as she still needed to buy two pairs of leather shoes black with laces two pairs of gym shoes white with laces and one pair of slippers bedroom the assistant coughed the boy will also need two pairs of pyjamas and a dressing gown yes of course said maisie hoping she had enough money left in her purse to cover the cost and am i to understand that the boy is a choral scholar asked the assistant looking more closely at his list yes he is maisie replied proudly then hell also require one cassock red two surplices white and a st bedes medallion maisie wanted to run out of the shop those items will be supplied by the school when he attends his first choir practice the assistant added before handing over her change will you be requiring anything else madam no thank you said harry who picked up the two bags grabbed his mother by the arm and led her quickly out of tc marsh tailors of distinction harry spent the saturday morning before he was due to report to st bedes with old jack are you nervous about going to a new school asked old jack no im not said harry defiantly old jack smiled im terrified he admitted so is every new bug as youll be called try to treat the whole thing as if youre starting out on an adventure to a new world where everyone begins as equals but the moment they hear me speak theyll realize im not their equal possibly but the moment they hear you sing theyll realize theyre not your equal most of them will have come from rich families with servants that will only be a consolation for the more stupid ones said old jack and some of them will have brothers at the school and even fathers and grandfathers who were there before them your father was a fine man said old jack and none of them will have a better mother of that i can assure you you knew my father said harry unable to mask his surprise knew would be an exaggeration said old jack but i observed him from afar as i have many others who have worked at the docks he was a decent courageous godfearing man but do you know how he died asked harry looking old jack in the eye hoping he would at last get an honest reply to the question that had troubled him for so long what have you been told asked old jack cautiously that he was killed in the great war but as i was born in even i can work out that that cant be possible old jack didnt speak for some time harry remained on the edge of his seat he was certainly badly wounded in the war but youre right that was not the cause of his death then how did he die asked harry if i knew id tell you replied old jack but there were so many rumours flying around at the time that i wasnt sure who to believe however there are several men and three in particular who undoubtedly know the truth about what happened that night my uncle stan must be one of them said harry but who are the other two old jack hesitated before he replied phil haskins and mr hugo mr haskins the ganger said harry he wouldnt give me the time of day and whos mr hugo hugo barrington the son of sir walter barrington the family who own the shipping line the same replied old jack fearing hed gone too far and are they also decent courageous godfearing men sir walter is among the finest men ive ever known but what about his son mr hugo not cut from the same cloth i fear said old jack without further explanation the smartly dressed boy sat next to his mother on the back seat of the tram this is our stop she said when the tram came to a halt they got off and began to walk slowly up the hill towards the school going a little slower with each step harry held on to his mother with one hand while he clutched a battered suitcase with the other neither of them spoke as they watched several hansom cabs as well as the occasional chauffeurdriven car pull up outside the front gates of the school fathers were shaking hands with their sons while furdraped mothers embraced their offspring before giving them a peck on the cheek like a bird finally having to acknowledge her fledglings were about to fly the nest harry didnt want his mother to kiss him in front of the other boys so he let go of her hand when they were still fifty yards from the gate maisie sensing his discomfort bent down and kissed him quickly on the forehead good luck harry make us all proud of you goodbye mum he said fighting back the tears maisie turned and began to walk back down the hill tears flooding down her own cheeks harry walked on recalling his uncles description of going over the top at ypres before charging towards the enemy lines never look back or youre a dead man harry wanted to look back but he knew if he did he would not stop running until he was safely on the tram he gritted his teeth and kept on walking did you have a good hols old chap one of the boys was asking a friend topping the other replied the pater took me to lords for the varsity match was lords a church harry wondered and if so what sort of match could possibly take place in a church he marched resolutely on through the school gates coming to a halt when he recognized a man standing by the front door of the school holding a clipboard and who are you young man he asked giving harry a welcoming smile harry clifton sir he replied removing his cap just as mr holcombe had instructed him to do whenever a master or a lady spoke to him clifton he said running a finger down a long list of names ah yes he placed a tick by harrys name first generation choral scholar many congratulations and welcome to st bedes im mr frobisher your housemaster and this is frobisher house if you leave your suitcase in the hall a prefect will accompany you to the refectory where ill be addressing all the new boys before supper harry had never had supper before tea was always the last meal in the clifton household before being sent to bed the moment it was dark electricity hadnt yet reached still house lane and there was rarely enough money over to spend on candles thank you sir said harry before making his way through the front door and into a large highly polished woodpanelled hall he put his case down and stared up at a painting of an old man with grey hair and bushy white sideburns dressed in a long black gown with a red hood draped around his shoulders whats your name barked a voice from behind him clifton sir said harry turning to see a tall boy wearing long trousers you dont call me sir clifton you call me fisher im a prefect not a master sorry sir said harry leave your case over there and follow me harry placed his secondhand battered suitcase next to a row of leather trunks his was the only one that didnt have a set of initials stamped on it he followed the prefect down a long corridor that was lined with photographs of old school teams and display cabinets filled with silver cups to remind the next generation of past glories when they reached the refectory fisher said you can sit anywhere you like clifton just be sure to stop talking the moment mr frobisher enters the refectory harry hesitated for some time before deciding which of the four long tables he would sit at a number of boys were already milling around in clusters talking quietly harry walked slowly to the far corner of the room and took a place at the end of the table he looked up to see several boys pouring into the hall looking just as perplexed as he felt one of them came and sat next to harry while another sat opposite him they continued chatting to each other as if he wasnt there without warning a bell rang and everyone stopped talking as mr frobisher entered the refectory he took his place behind a lectern harry hadnt noticed and tugged at the lapels of his gown welcome he began doffing his mortarboard to the assembled gathering on this the first day of your first term at st bedes in a few moments time you will experience your first school meal and i can promise you that it doesnt get any better one or two of the boys laughed nervously once you have finished supper you will be taken up to your dormitories where you will unpack at eight oclock you will hear another bell actually its the same bell just being rung at a different time harry smiled although most of the boys hadnt caught mr frobishers little joke thirty minutes later the same bell will ring again and you will then go to bed but not before youve washed and brushed your teeth you will then have thirty minutes to read before lights out after which you will go to sleep any child caught talking after lights out will be punished by the duty prefect you will not hear another bell continued mr frobisher until six thirty tomorrow morning when you will rise wash and dress in time to report back to the refectory before seven any child who is late will forgo his breakfast morning assembly will be held at eight oclock in the great hall where the headmaster will address us this will be followed by your first lesson at eight thirty there will be three sixtyminute lessons during the morning with tenminute breaks between them giving you time to change classrooms this will be followed by lunch at twelve in the afternoon there will only be two more lessons before games when you will play football harry smiled for a second time this is compulsory for everyone who is not a member of the choir harry frowned no one had told him that choristers didnt get to play football after games or choir practice you will return to frobisher house for supper which will be followed by an hour of prep before you retire to bed when once again you can read until lights out but only if the book has been approved by matron added mr frobisher this must all sound very bemusing to you harry made a mental note to look up the word in the dictionary mr holcombe had presented him with mr frobisher once again tugged at the lapels of his gown before continuing but dont worry youll soon get used to our traditions at st bedes thats all im going to say for the moment ill now leave you to enjoy your supper goodnight boys goodnight sir some boys had the courage to reply as mr frobisher left the room harry didnt move a muscle as several women in pinafores marched up and down the tables placing bowls of soup in front of each boy he watched attentively as the boy opposite him picked up a strangely shaped spoon dipped it into his soup and pushed it away from him before putting it to his mouth harry attempted to imitate the motion but only ended up spilling several drops of soup on the table and when he did manage to transfer what was left into his mouth most of it dribbled down his chin he wiped his mouth with his sleeve this didnt attract much attention but when he slurped loudly with each mouthful several of the boys stopped eating and stared at him embarrassed harry placed the spoon back on the table and left his soup to go cold the second course was a fishcake and harry didnt move until hed seen which fork the boy opposite him picked up he was surprised to notice that the boy placed his knife and fork on the plate between each mouthful while harry clung on to his as firmly as if they were pitchforks a conversation struck up between the boy opposite him and the boy next to him on the subject of riding to hounds harry didnt join in partly because the nearest hed been to sitting on a horse was a halfpenny ride on a donkey one afternoon on an outing to westonsupermare once the plates had been whisked away they were replaced with puddings or what his mum called treats because he didnt get them often yet another spoon yet another taste yet another mistake harry didnt realize that a banana wasnt like an apple so to the astonishment of all those around him he tried to eat the skin for the rest of the boys their first lesson might well be tomorrow at am but harrys was already taking place after supper had been cleared away fisher returned and as duty prefect led his charges up a wide wooden staircase to the dormitories on the first floor harry entered a room with thirty beds neatly lined up in three rows of ten each had a pillow two sheets and two blankets harry had never had two of anything this is the new bugs dorm said fisher with disdain its where youll remain until youre civilized youll find your names in alphabetical order at the foot of each bed harry was surprised to find his suitcase on the bed and wondered whod put it there the boy next to him was already unpacking im deakins he said pushing his spectacles further up his nose so he could take a closer look at harry im harry i sat next to you during exams last summer i couldnt believe you answered all the questions in just over an hour deakins blushed thats why hes a scholar said the boy on the other side of harry harry swung around are you a scholar too he asked good heavens no said the boy as he continued to unpack the only reason they let me into st bedes was because my father and grandfather were here before me im the third generation to go to the school was your father here by any chance no said harry and deakins in unison stop chattering shouted fisher and get on with unpacking your cases harry opened his suitcase and began taking his clothes out and placing them neatly in the two drawers next to his bed his mother had put a bar of frys five boys chocolate in between his shirts he hid it under the pillow a bell sounded time to get undressed declared fisher harry had never undressed in front of another boy let alone a room full of them he faced the wall took off his clothes slowly and quickly pulled on his pyjamas once hed tied the cord of his dressing gown he followed the other boys into the washroom once again he watched carefully as they washed their faces with flannels before brushing their teeth he didnt have a flannel or a toothbrush the boy from the next bed rummaged around in his wash bag and handed him a brand new toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste harry didnt want to take them until the boy said my mother always packs two of everything thank you said harry although he cleaned his teeth quickly he was still among the last to return to the dormitory he climbed into bed two clean sheets two blankets and a soft pillow he had just looked across to see that deakins was reading kennedys latin primer when the other boy said this pillow is brick hard would you like to swap with me harry asked i think youll find theyre all the same the boy said with a grin but thanks harry took his bar of chocolate from under the pillow and broke it into three pieces he handed one piece to deakins and another to the boy whod given him the toothbrush and toothpaste i see your maters far more sensible than mine he said after taking a bite another bell by the way my names giles barrington whats yours clifton harry clifton harry didnt sleep for more than a few minutes at a time and it wasnt just because his bed was so comfortable could it be possible that giles was related to one of the three men who knew the truth about how his father had died and if so was he cut from the same cloth as his father or his grandfather suddenly harry felt very lonely he unscrewed the top of the toothpaste barrington had given him and began to suck it until he fell asleep when the nowfamiliar bell rang at next morning harry climbed slowly out of bed feeling sick he followed deakins into the washroom to find giles was testing the water do you think this place has ever heard of hot water he asked harry was just about to reply when the prefect hollered no talking in the washroom hes worse than a prussian general said barrington clicking his heels harry burst out laughing who was that asked fisher glaring at the two boys me said harry immediately name clifton open your mouth again clifton and ill slipper you harry had no idea what being slippered meant but he had a feeling it wouldnt be pleasant once hed brushed his teeth he walked quickly back into the dorm and dressed without another word once hed done up his tie something else he hadnt quite mastered he caught up with barrington and deakins as they made their way down the stairs to the refectory nobody said a word as they werent sure if they were allowed to talk while they were on the staircase when they sat down for breakfast in the refectory harry slipped in between his two new friends and watched as bowls of porridge were placed in front of each boy he was relieved to find there was only one spoon in front of him so he couldnt make a mistake this time harry gulped down his porridge so quickly it was as if he was afraid uncle stan would appear and snatch it away from him he was the first to finish and without a moments thought he put his spoon down on the table picked up his bowl and began to lick it several other boys stared at him in disbelief some pointed while others sniggered he turned a bright shade of crimson and put the bowl back down he would have burst into tears if barrington hadnt picked up his own bowl and begun licking it the reverend samuel oakshott ma oxon stood feet apart at the centre of the stage he peered benignly down on his flock for that was certainly how the headmaster of st bedes viewed the pupils harry seated in the front row stared up at the frightening figure who towered above him dr oakshott was well over six feet tall and had a head of thick greying hair and long bushy sideburns that made him look even more forbidding his deep blue eyes pierced right through you and he never seemed to blink while the crisscross of lines on his forehead hinted at great wisdom he cleared his throat before addressing the boys fellow bedeans he began we are once again gathered together at the beginning of a new school year no doubt prepared to face whatever challenges should confront us for the senior boys he turned his attention to the back of the hall you dont have a moment to lose if you hope to be offered a place at the school of your first choice never settle for second best for the middle school his eyes moved to the centre of the hall this will be a time when we discover which of you is destined for greater things when you return next year will you be a prefect a monitor a house captain or a captain of sport or will you simply be among the alsorans several boys bowed their heads our next duty is to welcome the new boys and do everything in our power to make them feel at home they are being handed the baton for the first time as they begin lifes long race should the pace prove to be too demanding one or two of you may fall by the wayside he warned staring down at the front three rows st bedes is not a school for the fainthearted so be sure never to forget the words of the great cecil rhodes if you are lucky enough to have been born an englishman you have drawn first prize in the lottery of life the assembled gathering burst into spontaneous applause as the headmaster left the stage followed by a crocodile of masters whom he led down the centre aisle out of the great hall and into the morning sunshine harry his spirits raised was determined not to let the headmaster down he followed the senior boys out of the hall but the moment he stepped out into the quad his exuberance was dampened a posse of older boys were hanging around in one corner hands in pockets to indicate they were prefects there he is said one of them pointing at harry so thats what a street urchin looks like said another a third whom harry recognized as fisher the prefect who had been on duty the previous night added hes an animal and its nothing less than our duty to see that hes returned to his natural habitat as quickly as possible giles barrington ran after harry if you ignore them he said theyll soon get bored and start picking on someone else harry wasnt convinced and ran ahead to the classroom where he waited for barrington and deakins to join him a moment later mr frobisher entered the room harrys first thought was does he also think im a street urchin unworthy of a place at st bedes good morning boys said mr frobisher good morning sir replied the boys as their form master took his place in front of the blackboard your first lesson this morning he said will be history as i am keen to get to know you we will start with a simple test to discover how much you have already learnt or perhaps how little how many wives did henry the eighth have several hands shot up abbott he said looking at a chart on his desk and pointing to a boy in the front row six sir came back the immediate reply good but can anyone name them not quite as many hands were raised clifton catherine of aragon anne boleyn jane seymour then another anne i think he said before coming to a halt anne of cleves can anyone name the missing two only one hand remained in the air deakins said frobisher after checking his chart catherine howard and catherine parr anne of cleves and catherine parr both outlived henry very good deakins now lets turn the clock forward a couple of centuries who commanded our fleet at the battle of trafalgar every hand in the room shot up matthews he said nodding at a particularly insistent hand nelson sir correct and who was prime minister at the time the duke of wellington sir said matthews not sounding quite as confident no said mr frobisher it wasnt wellington although he was a contemporary of nelsons he looked around the class but only cliftons and deakinss hands were still raised deakins pitt the younger to and to correct deakins and when was the iron duke prime minister to and again in said deakins and can anyone tell me what his most famous victory was barringtons hand shot up for the first time waterloo sir he shouted before mr frobisher had time to select anyone else yes barrington and whom did wellington defeat at waterloo barrington remained silent napoleon whispered harry napoleon sir said barrington confidently correct clifton said frobisher smiling and was napoleon also a duke no sir said deakins after no one else had attempted to answer the question he founded the first french empire and appointed himself emperor mr frobisher was not surprised by deakinss response as he was an open scholar but he was impressed by cliftons knowledge after all he was a choral scholar and over the years he had learnt that gifted choristers like talented sportsmen rarely excel outside their own field clifton was already proving an exception to that rule mr frobisher would have liked to know who had taught the boy when the bell rang for the end of class mr frobisher announced your next lesson will be geography with mr henderson and he is not a master who likes to be kept waiting i recommend that during the break you find out where his classroom is and are seated in your places long before he enters the room harry stuck close to giles who seemed to know where everything was as they strolled across the quad together harry became aware that some of the boys lowered their voices when they passed and one or two even turned to stare at him thanks to countless saturday mornings spent with old jack harry held his own in the geography lesson but in maths the final class of the morning no one came close to deakins and even the master had to keep his wits about him when the three of them sat down for lunch harry could feel a hundred eyes watching his every move he pretended not to notice and simply copied everything giles did its nice to know theres something i can teach you giles said as he peeled an apple with his knife harry enjoyed his first chemistry lesson later that afternoon especially when the master allowed him to light a bunsen burner but he didnt excel at nature studies the final lesson of the day because harry was the only boy whose home didnt have a garden when the final bell sounded the rest of the class went off for games while harry reported to the chapel for his first choir practice once again he noticed everyone was staring at him but this time it was for all the right reasons but no sooner had he walked out of the chapel than he was subjected to the same sotto voce jibes from boys who were making their way back from the playing fields isnt that our little street urchin said one pity he doesnt have a toothbrush said another sleeps down at the docks at night im told said a third deakins and barrington were nowhere to be seen as harry hurried back to his house avoiding any gatherings of boys on the way during supper the gawping eyes were less obvious but only because giles had made it clear to everyone within earshot that harry was his friend but giles was unable to help when they all went up to the dormitory after prep and found fisher standing by the door clearly waiting for harry as the boys began to undress fisher announced in a loud voice im sorry about the smell gentlemen but one of your form comes from a house without a bath one or two of the boys sniggered hoping to ingratiate themselves with fisher harry ignored him not only does this guttersnipe not have a bath he doesnt even have a father my father was a good man who fought for his country in the war said harry proudly what makes you think i was talking about you clifton said fisher unless of course youre also the boy whose mother works he paused as a hotel waitress an hotel said harry correcting him fisher grabbed a slipper dont you ever answer me back clifton he said angrily bend down and touch the end of your bed harry obeyed and fisher administered six strokes with such ferocity that giles had to turn away harry crept into bed fighting to hold back the tears before fisher switched off the light he added ill look forward to seeing you all again tomorrow night when i will continue with my bedtime tale of the cliftons of still house lane wait until you hear about uncle stan the following night harry learnt for the first time that his uncle had spent eighteen months in prison for burglary this revelation was worse than being slippered he crept into bed wondering if his father could still be alive but in jail and that was the real reason no one at home ever talked about him harry hardly slept for a third night running and no amount of success in the classroom or admiration in the chapel could stop him continually thinking about the next inevitable encounter with fisher the slightest excuse a drop of water spilt on the washroom floor a pillow that wasnt straight a sock that had fallen around his ankle would ensure that harry could expect six of the best from the duty prefect a punishment that would be administered in front of the rest of the dorm but not before fisher had added another episode from the clifton chronicles by the fifth night harry had had enough and even giles and deakins could no longer console him during prep on friday evening while the other boys were turning the pages of their kennedys latin primer harry ignored caesar and the gauls and went over a plan that would ensure fisher never bothered him again by the time he climbed into bed that night after fisher had discovered a frys wrapper by his bed and slippered him once again harrys plan was in place he lay awake long after lights out and didnt stir until he was certain every boy was asleep harry had no idea what time it was when he slipped out of bed he dressed without making a sound then crept between the beds until he reached the far side of the room he pushed the window open and the rush of cold air caused the boy in the nearest bed to turn over harry climbed out on to the fire escape and slowly closed the window before making his way down to the ground he walked around the edge of the lawn taking advantage of any shadows to avoid a full moon that seemed to beam down on him like a searchlight harry was horrified to discover that the school gates were locked he crept along the wall searching for the slightest crack or indentation that would allow him to climb over the top and escape to freedom at last he spotted a missing brick and was able to lever himself up until he was straddling the wall he lowered himself down the other side clinging on by the tips of his fingers said a silent prayer then let go he landed on the ground in a heap but didnt seem to have broken anything once hed recovered he began to run down the road slowly at first but then he speeded up and didnt stop running until he reached the docks the night shift was just coming off duty and harry was relieved to find his uncle was not among them after the last docker had disappeared out of sight he walked slowly along the quayside past a line of moored ships that stretched as far as the eye could see he noticed that one of the funnels proudly displayed the letter b and thought about his friend who would be fast asleep would he ever his thoughts were interrupted when he came to a halt outside old jacks railway carriage he wondered if the old man was also fast asleep his question was answered when a voice said dont just stand there harry come inside before you freeze to death harry opened the carriage door to find old jack striking a match and trying to light a candle harry slumped into the seat opposite him have you run away asked old jack harry was so taken aback by his direct question that he didnt answer immediately yes i have he finally spluttered and no doubt youve come to tell me why youve made this momentous decision i didnt make the decision said harry it was made for me by whom his name is fisher a master or a boy my dormitory prefect said harry wincing he then told old jack everything that had happened during his first week at st bedes once again the old man took him by surprise when harry came to the end of his story jack said i blame myself why asked harry you couldnt have done more to help me yes i could said old jack i should have prepared you for a brand of snobbery that no other nation on earth can emulate i should have spent more time on the significance of the old school tie and less on geography and history i had rather hoped things just might have changed after the war to end all wars but they clearly havent at st bedes he fell into a thoughtful silence before finally asking so what are you going to do next my boy run away to sea ill take any boat that will have me said harry trying to sound enthusiastic what a good idea said old jack why not play straight into fishers hands what do you mean just that nothing will please fisher more than to be able to tell his friends that the street urchin had no guts but then what do you expect from the son of a docker whose mother is a waitress but fishers right im not in his class no harry the problem is that fisher already realizes hes not in your class and never will be are you saying i should go back to that horrible place said harry in the end only you can make that decision said old jack but if you run away every time you come up against the fishers of this world youll end up like me one of lifes alsorans to quote the headmaster but youre a great man said harry i might have been said old jack if i hadnt run away the moment i came across my fisher but i settled for the easy way out and only thought about myself but who else is there to think about your mother for a start said old jack dont forget all the sacrifices she made to give you a better start in life than she ever dreamed was possible and then theres mr holcombe who when he discovers youve run away will only blame himself and dont forget miss monday who called in favours twisted arms and spent countless hours to make sure you were good enough to win that choral scholarship and when you come to weigh up the pros and cons harry i suggest you place fisher on one side of the scales and barrington and deakins on the other because i suspect that fisher will quickly fade into insignificance while barrington and deakins will surely turn out to be close friends for the rest of your life if you run away they will be forced to listen to fisher continually reminding them that you werent the person they thought you were harry remained silent for some time finally he rose slowly to his feet thank you sir he said without another word he opened the carriage door and let himself out he walked slowly down the quayside once again staring up at the vast cargo ships all of which would soon be departing for distant ports he kept on walking until he reached the dockyard gates where he broke into a run and headed back towards the city by the time he reached the school gates they were already open and the clock on the great hall was about to chime eight times despite the telephone call mr frobisher would have to walk across to the headmasters house and report that one of his boys was missing as he looked out of his study window he caught a glimpse of harry nipping in and out between the trees as he made his way cautiously towards the house harry tentatively opened the front door as the final chime rang out and came face to face with his housemaster better hurry clifton mr frobisher said or youll miss breakfast yes sir said harry and ran down the corridor he reached the dining room just before the doors were closed and slipped into place between barrington and deakins for a moment i thought id be the only one licking my bowl this morning said barrington harry burst out laughing he didnt come across fisher that day and was surprised to find that another prefect had replaced him on dorm duty that night harry slept for the first time that week the rollsroyce drove through the gates of the manor house and up a long driveway lined with tall oaks standing like sentinels harry had counted six gardeners even before he set eyes on the house during their time at st bedes harry had picked up a little about how giles lived when he returned home for the holidays but nothing had prepared him for this when he saw the house for the first time his mouth opened and stayed open early eighteenth century would be my guess said deakins not bad said giles built by vanbrugh but ill bet you cant tell me who designed the garden ill give you a clue its later than the house ive only ever heard of one landscape gardener said harry still staring at the house capability brown thats exactly why we chose him said giles simply so that my friends would have heard of the fellow two hundred years later harry and deakins laughed as the car came to a halt in front of a threestorey mansion built from golden cotswold stone giles jumped out before the chauffeur had a chance to open the back door he ran up the steps with his two friends following less certainly in his wake the front door was opened long before giles reached the top step and a tall man elegantly dressed in a long black coat pinstripe trousers and a black tie gave a slight bow as the young master shot past him happy birthday mr giles he said thank you jenkins come on chaps shouted giles as he disappeared into the house the butler held open the door to allow harry and deakins to follow as soon as harry stepped into the hall he found himself transfixed by the portrait of an old man who appeared to be staring directly down at him giles had inherited the mans beaklike nose fierce blue eyes and square jaw harry looked around at the other portraits that adorned the walls the only oil paintings hed seen before were in books the mona lisa the laughing cavalier and night watch he was looking at a landscape by an artist called constable when a woman swept into the hall wearing what harry could only have described as a ball gown happy birthday my darling she said thank you mater said giles as she bent down to kiss him it was the first time harry had ever seen his friend look embarrassed these are my two best friends harry and deakins as harry shook hands with a woman who wasnt much taller than he was she gave him such a warm smile that he immediately felt at ease why dont we all go through to the drawing room she suggested and have some tea she led the boys across the hall and into a large room that overlooked the front lawn when harry entered he didnt want to sit down but to look at the paintings that hung on every wall however mrs barrington was already ushering him towards the sofa he sank down into the plush cushions and couldnt stop himself staring out of the bay window on to a finely cut lawn that was large enough to play a game of cricket on beyond the lawn harry could see a lake where contented mallards swam aimlessly around clearly not worried about where their next meal would be coming from deakins sat himself down on the sofa next to harry neither of them spoke as another man this one dressed in a short black jacket entered the room followed by a young woman in a smart blue uniform not unlike the one his mother wore at the hotel the maid carried a large silver tray which she placed on an oval table in front of mrs barrington indian or china mrs barrington asked looking at harry harry wasnt sure what she meant well all have indian thank you mother said giles harry thought giles must have taught him everything there was to know about etiquette as practised in polite society but mrs barrington had suddenly raised the bar to a new level once the underbutler had poured three cups of tea the maid placed them in front of the boys along with a side plate harry stared at a mountain of sandwiches not daring to touch giles took one and put it on his plate his mother frowned how many times have i told you giles always to wait until your guests decide what they would like before you help yourself harry wanted to tell mrs barrington that giles always took the lead just so that he would know what to do and more important what not to do deakins selected a sandwich and put it on his plate harry did the same giles waited patiently until deakins had picked up his sandwich and taken a bite i do hope you like smoked salmon said mrs barrington spiffing said giles before his friends had a chance to admit that they had never tasted smoked salmon before we only get fish paste sandwiches at school he added so tell me how youre all getting on at school said mrs barrington room for improvement is how i think the frob describes my efforts said giles as he took another sandwich but deakins is top of everything except for english said deakins speaking for the first time harry pipped me in that subject by a couple of per cent and did you pip anyone in anything giles asked his mother he came second in maths mrs barrington said harry coming to giless rescue he has a natural gift for figures just like his grandfather said mrs barrington thats a nice picture of you above the fireplace mrs barrington said deakins she smiled its not me deakins its my dear mother deakins bowed his head before mrs barrington quickly added but what a charming compliment she was considered a great beauty in her day who painted it asked harry coming to deakinss rescue lászló replied mrs barrington why do you ask because i was wondering if the portrait of the gentleman in the hall might be by the same artist how very observant of you harry said mrs barrington the painting you saw in the hall is of my father and was indeed also painted by lászló what does your father do asked harry harry never stops asking questions said giles one just has to get used to it mrs barrington smiled he imports wines to this country in particular sherries from spain just like harveys said deakins his mouth full of cucumber sandwich just like harveys repeated mrs barrington giles grinned do have another sandwich harry said mrs barrington noticing that his eyes were fixed on the plate thank you said harry unable to choose between smoked salmon cucumber or egg and tomato he settled for salmon wondering what it would taste like and how about you deakins thank you mrs barrington he said and took another cucumber sandwich i cant go on calling you deakins said giless mother it makes you sound like one of the servants do tell me your christian name deakins bowed his head again i prefer to be called deakins he said its al said giles such a nice name said mrs barrington although i expect your mother calls you alan no she doesnt said deakins his head still bowed the other two boys looked surprised by this revelation but said nothing my names algernon he finally spluttered giles burst out laughing mrs barrington paid no attention to her sons outburst your mother must be an admirer of oscar wilde she said yes she is said deakins but i wish shed called me jack or even ernest i wouldnt let it worry you said mrs barrington after all giles suffers from a similar indignity mother you promised you wouldnt you must get him to tell you his middle name she said ignoring the protest when giles didnt respond harry and deakins looked at mrs barrington hopefully marmaduke she declared with a sigh like his father and grandfather before him if either of you tell anyone about this when we get back to school giles said looking at his two friends i swear ill kill you and i mean kill you both boys laughed do you have a middle name harry asked mrs barrington harry was about to reply when the drawingroom door flew open and a man who couldnt have been mistaken for a servant strode into the room carrying a large parcel harry looked up at a man who could only have been mr hugo giles leapt up and ran towards his father who handed him the parcel and said happy birthday my boy thank you papa said giles and immediately began to untie the ribbon before you open your present giles said his mother perhaps you should first introduce your guests to papa sorry papa these are my two best friends deakins and harry said giles placing the gift on the table harry noticed that giless father had the same athletic build and restless energy hed assumed was uniquely his sons pleased to meet you deakins said mr barrington shaking him by the hand he then turned to harry good afternoon clifton he added before sitting down in the empty chair next to his wife harry was puzzled that mr barrington didnt shake hands with him and how did he know his name was clifton once the underbutler had served mr barrington with a cup of tea giles removed the wrapping from his present and let out a yelp of delight when he saw the roberts radio he pushed the plug into a wall socket and began to tune the radio to different stations the boys applauded and laughed with each new sound that was emitted from the large wooden box giles tells me that he came second in mathematics this term said mrs barrington turning to her husband which doesnt make up for him being bottom in almost every other subject he retorted giles tried not to look embarrassed as he continued to search for another station on his radio but you should have seen the goal he scored against avonhurst said harry were all expecting him to captain the eleven next year goals arent going to get him into eton said mr barrington not looking at harry its time the boy buckled down and worked harder no one spoke for some time until mrs barrington broke the silence are you the clifton who sings in the choir at st mary redcliffe she asked harrys the treble soloist said giles in fact hes a choral scholar harry became aware that giless father was now staring at him i thought i recognized you said mrs barrington giless grandfather and i attended a performance of the messiah at st marys when the choir of st bedes joined forces with bristol grammar school your i know that my redeemer liveth was quite magnificent harry thank you mrs barrington said harry blushing are you hoping to go on to bristol grammar school after you leave st bedes clifton asked mr barrington clifton again thought harry only if i win a scholarship sir he replied but why is that important asked mrs barrington surely you will be offered a place like any other boy because my mother wouldnt be able to afford the fees mrs barrington shes a waitress at the royal hotel but wouldnt your father hes dead said harry he was killed in the war he watched carefully to see how mr barrington would react but like a good poker player he gave nothing away im sorry said mrs barrington i didnt realize the door opened behind harry and the underbutler entered carrying a twotier birthday cake on a silver tray which he placed on the centre of the table after giles had succeeded in blowing out all twelve candles with one puff everyone applauded and whens your birthday clifton asked mr barrington it was last month sir harry replied mr barrington looked away the underbutler removed the candles before handing the young master a large cake knife giles cut deep into the cake and placed five uneven slices on the tea plates the maid had laid out on the table deakins devoured the lumps of icing that had fallen on to his plate before taking a bite of the cake harry followed mrs barringtons lead he picked up the small silver fork by the side of his plate using it to remove a tiny piece of his cake before placing it back on the plate only mr barrington didnt touch his cake suddenly without warning he rose from his place and left without another word giless mother made no attempt to conceal her surprise at her husbands behaviour but she said nothing harry never took his eyes off mr hugo as he left the room while deakins having finished his cake turned his attention back to the smoked salmon sandwiches clearly oblivious to what was going on around him once the door was closed mrs barrington continued to chat as if nothing unusual had happened im sure youll win a scholarship to bristol grammar harry especially considering everything giles has told me about you youre obviously a very clever boy as well as a gifted singer giles does have a tendency to exaggerate mrs barrington said harry i can assure you only deakins is certain of winning a scholarship but doesnt bgs offer grants for music scholars she asked not for trebles said harry they wont take the risk im not sure i understand said mrs barrington nothing can take away the years of choral training youve been put through true but sadly no one can predict what will happen when your voice breaks some trebles end up as basses or baritones and the really lucky ones become tenors but theres no way of telling in advance why not asked deakins taking an interest for the first time there are plenty of treble soloists who cant even get a place in their local choir once their voice has broken ask master ernest lough every household in england has heard him sing oh for the wings of a dove but after his voice broke no one ever heard from him again youre just going to have to work harder said deakins between mouthfuls dont forget the grammar school awards twelve scholarships every year and i can only win one of them he added matteroffactly but thats the problem said harry if im going to work any harder ill have to give up the choir and without my bursary id have to leave st bedes so youre between a rock and a hard place said deakins harry had never heard the expression before and decided to ask deakins later what it meant well one things for certain said mrs barrington giles isnt likely to win a scholarship to any school maybe not said harry but bristol grammar isnt likely to turn down a lefthanded batsman of his calibre then well have to hope that eton feels the same way said mrs barrington because thats where his father wants him to go i dont want to go to eton said giles putting down his fork i want to go to bgs and be with my friends im sure youll make a lot of new friends at eton said his mother and it would be a great disappointment to your father if you didnt follow in his footsteps the underbutler coughed mrs barrington looked out of the window to see a car drawing up at the bottom of the steps i think the time has come for you all to return to school she said i certainly dont want to be responsible for anyone being late for prep harry looked longingly at the large plate of sandwiches and the halffinished birthday cake but reluctantly rose from his place and began to walk towards the door he glanced back once and could have sworn he saw deakins put a sandwich in his pocket he took one last look out of the window and was surprised to notice for the first time a gangly young girl with long pigtails who was curled up in the corner reading a book thats my frightful sister emma said giles she never stops reading just ignore her harry smiled at emma but she didnt look up deakins didnt give her a second look mrs barrington accompanied the three boys to the front door where she shook hands with harry and deakins i do hope youll both come again soon she said youre such a good influence on giles thank you very much for having us to tea mrs barrington harry said deakins just nodded both boys looked away when she hugged her son and gave him a kiss as the chauffeur drove down the long driveway towards the gates harry looked out of the back window at the house he didnt notice emma staring out of the window at the disappearing car the school tuck shop was open between four and six every tuesday and thursday afternoon harry rarely visited the emporium as it was known by the boys since he only had two shillings pocket money a term and he knew his mother wouldnt appreciate any little extras appearing on his endofterm account however on deakinss birthday harry made an exception to this rule as he intended to purchase a onepenny bar of fudge for his friend despite harrys rare visits to the tuck shop a bar of frys five boys chocolate could be found on his desk every tuesday and thursday evening although there was a school rule that no boy could spend more than sixpence a week in the tuck shop giles would also leave a packet of liquorice allsorts for deakins making it clear to his friends that he expected nothing in return when harry arrived at the tuck shop that tuesday he joined a long queue of boys waiting to be served his mouth watered as he stared at the neatly stacked rows of chocolate fudge jelly babies liquorice and the latest craze smiths potato crisps hed considered buying a packet for himself but after a recent introduction to mr wilkins micawber he had been left in no doubt about the value of sixpence as harry ogled the emporiums treasures he heard giless voice and noticed that he was a few places ahead of him in the queue he was just about to hail his friend when he saw giles remove a bar of chocolate from a shelf and slip it into his trouser pocket a few moments later a packet of chewing gum followed when giles reached the front of the queue he placed on the counter a box of liquorice allsorts d and a bag of crisps d which mr swivals the master in charge of the shop entered neatly in his ledger against the name of barrington the two other items remained in giless pocket unaccounted for harry was horrified and before giles could turn round he slipped out of the shop not wanting his friend to spot him harry walked slowly around the school block trying to work out why giles would want to steal anything when he could so obviously afford to pay he assumed there had to be some simple explanation although he couldnt imagine what it might be harry went up to his study just before prep to find the pilfered bar of chocolate on his desk and deakins tucking into a box of liquorice allsorts he found it difficult to concentrate on the causes of the industrial revolution while he tried to decide what if anything he should do about his discovery by the end of prep hed made his decision he placed the unopened bar of chocolate in the top drawer of his desk having decided he would return it to the tuck shop on thursday without telling giles harry didnt sleep that night and after breakfast he took deakins to one side and explained why he hadnt been able to give him a birthday present deakins couldnt hide his disbelief my dads been having the same problem in his shop said deakins its called shoplifting the daily mail is blaming it on the depression i dont think giless family will have been affected much by the depression said harry with some feeling deakins nodded thoughtfully perhaps you should tell the frob sneak on my best friend said harry never but if giles is caught he could be expelled said deakins the least you can do is warn him youve found out what hes up to ill think about it said harry but in the meantime im going to return anything giles gives me to the tuck shop without letting him know deakins leant over could you take my stuff back as well he whispered i never go to the tuck shop so i wouldnt know what to do harry agreed to take on the responsibility and after that he went to the tuck shop twice a week and placed giless unwanted gifts back on the shelves he had concluded that deakins was right and that he would have to confront his friend before he was caught but decided to put it off until the end of term good shot barrington said mr frobisher as the ball crossed the boundary a ripple of applause broke out around the ground mark my words headmaster barrington will play for eton against harrow at lords not if giles has anything to do with it harry whispered to deakins what are you doing for the summer hols harry asked deakins seemingly oblivious to all that was going on around him i dont have any plans to visit tuscany this year if thats what youre asking harry replied with a grin i dont think giles really wants to go either said deakins after all the italians have never understood cricket well id be happy to change places with him said harry it doesnt bother me that michelangelo da vinci and caravaggio were never introduced to the finer subtleties of leg break bowling not to mention all that pasta hell be expected to wade through so where are you going asked deakins a week on the riviera of the west said harry with bravado the grand pier at westonsupermare is usually the high spot followed by fish and chips at coffins cafe care to join me cant spare the time said deakins who clearly thought harry was being serious and whys that asked harry playing along too much work to do you intend to go on working during the holidays asked harry in disbelief work is a holiday for me said deakins i enjoy it every bit as much as giles does his cricket and you do your singing but where do you work in the municipal library clot they have everything i need can i join you asked harry sounding just as serious i need all the help i can get if im to have any chance of winning a scholarship to bgs only if you agree to remain silent at all times said deakins harry would have laughed but he knew his friend didnt consider work a laughing matter but i desperately need some help with my latin grammar said harry i still dont understand the consecutive clause let alone subjunctives and if i dont manage a pass mark in the latin paper its curtains even if i do well in every other subject id be willing to help you with your latin said deakins if you do me a favour in return name it said harry though i cant believe youre hoping to perform a solo at this years carol service good shot barrington said mr frobisher again harry joined in the applause thats his third halfcentury this season headmaster added mr frobisher dont be frivolous harry said deakins the truth is my dad needs someone to take over the morning paper round during the summer holidays and ive suggested you the pay is a shilling a week and as long as you can report to the shop by six oclock every morning the positions yours six oclock said harry scornfully when youve got an uncle who wakes up the whole house at five thats the least of your problems then youd be willing to take on the job yes of course said harry but why dont you want it a bob a week is not to be sniffed at dont remind me said deakins but i cant ride a bicycle oh hell said harry i dont even have a bicycle i didnt say i didnt have a bicycle sighed deakins i said i couldnt ride one clifton said mr frobisher as the cricketers walked off the ground for tea id like to see you in my study after prep harry had always liked mr frobisher who was one of the few masters who treated him as an equal he also didnt appear to have any favourites while some of the other beaks left him in no doubt that a dockers son should never have been allowed to enter the hallowed portals of st bedes however good his voice was when the bell rang at the end of prep harry put down his pen and walked across the corridor to mr frobishers study he had no idea why his housemaster wanted to see him and hadnt given the matter a great deal of thought harry knocked on the study door come said the voice of a man who never wasted words harry opened the door and was surprised not to be greeted with the usual frob smile mr frobisher stared up at harry as he came to a halt in front of his desk it has been brought to my attention clifton that you have been stealing from the tuck shop harrys mind went blank as he tried to think of a response that wouldnt condemn giles you were seen by a prefect removing goods from the shelves continued frobisher in the same uncompromising tone and then slipping out of the shop before you reached the front of the queue harry wanted to say not removing sir returning but all he managed was i have never taken anything from the tuck shop sir despite the fact that he was telling the truth he could still feel his cheeks reddening then how do you explain your twice weekly visits to the emporium when there isnt a single entry against your name in mr swivalss ledger mr frobisher waited patiently but harry knew if he told the truth giles would surely be expelled and this bar of chocolate and packet of liquorice allsorts were found in the top drawer of your desk not long after the tuck shop had closed harry looked down at the sweets but still said nothing im waiting for an explanation clifton said mr frobisher after another long pause he added i am of course aware that you have far less pocket money than any other boy in your class but that is no excuse for stealing i have never stolen anything in my life said harry it was mr frobishers turn to look dismayed he rose from behind his desk if that is the case clifton and i want to believe you you will report back to me after choir practice with a full explanation of how you came to be in possession of tuck you clearly didnt pay for should you fail to satisfy me we will both be paying a visit to the headmaster and i have no doubt what his recommendation will be harry left the room the moment he closed the door behind him he felt sick he made his way back to his study hoping giles wouldnt be there when he opened the door the first thing he saw was another bar of chocolate on his desk giles looked up are you feeling all right he asked when he saw harrys flushed face harry didnt reply he placed the bar of chocolate in a drawer and left for choir practice without saying a word to either of his friends giless eyes never left him and once the door was closed he turned to deakins and asked casually whats his problem deakins went on writing as if he hadnt heard the question didnt you hear me cloth ears said giles whys harry in a sulk all i know is that he had an appointment to see the frob why asked giles sounding more interested ive no idea said deakins who didnt stop writing giles stood up and strolled across the room to deakinss side what arent you telling me he demanded grabbing him by the ear deakins dropped his pen nervously touched the bridge of his glasses and pushed them further up his nose before he eventually squeaked hes in some sort of trouble what sort of trouble asked giles twisting the ear i think he might even be expelled whimpered deakins giles let go of his ear and burst out laughing harry expelled he scoffed the popes more likely to be defrocked he would have returned to his desk if he hadnt noticed beads of sweat appearing on deakinss forehead what for he asked more quietly the frob thinks hes been stealing from the tuck shop said deakins if deakins had looked up he would have seen that giles had turned ashen white a moment later he heard the door close he picked up his pen and tried to concentrate but for the first time in his life he didnt finish his prep when harry came out of choir practice an hour later he spotted fisher leaning on the wall unable to mask a smile that was when he realized who must have reported him he ignored fisher and strolled back to his house as if he didnt have a care in the world whereas in fact he felt like a man mounting the gallows knowing that unless he ditched his closest friend a stay of execution would not be possible he hesitated before knocking on his housemasters door the come was far gentler than it had been earlier that afternoon but when harry entered the room he was greeted with the same uncompromising stare he bowed his head i owe you a sincere apology clifton said frobisher rising from behind his desk i now realize that you were not the culprit harrys heart was still beating fast but his anxiety was now for giles thank you sir he said his head still bowed he had so many questions he would have liked to ask the frob but he knew none of them would be answered mr frobisher stepped out from behind his desk and shook hands with harry something hed never done before youd better hurry clifton if you hope to get any supper when harry came out of the frobs study he walked slowly towards the dining room fisher was standing by the door a surprised look on his face harry walked straight past him and took his place on the end of the bench next to deakins the seat opposite him was empty giles didnt show up for supper and his bed wasnt slept in that night if st bedes hadnt lost their annual fixture against avonhurst by thirtyone runs harry suspected that not many boys or even masters would have noticed he was missing but unfortunately for giles it was a home match so everyone had an opinion on why the schools opening batsman had not taken his guard at the crease not least fisher who was telling anyone who cared to listen that the wrong man had been rusticated harry hadnt been looking forward to the holidays not just because he wondered if hed ever see giles again but also because it meant returning to no still house lane and once again having to share a room with his uncle stan who more often than not returned home drunk after spending the evening going over old exam papers harry would climb into bed around ten he quickly fell asleep only to be woken sometime after midnight by his uncle who was often so drunk he couldnt find his own bed the sound of stan trying to pee into a chamberpot and not always hitting the target was something that would remain etched in harrys mind for the rest of his life once stan had collapsed on to his bed he rarely bothered to get undressed harry would try to fall asleep a second time often to be woken a few minutes later by loud drunken snores he longed to be back at st bedes sharing a dormitory with twentynine other boys harry still hoped that in an unguarded moment stan might let slip some more details about his fathers death but most of the time he was too incoherent to answer even the simplest question on one of the rare occasions when he was sober enough to speak he told harry to bugger off and warned him that if he raised the subject again hed thrash him the only good thing about sharing a room with stan was that there was never any chance of his being late for his paper round harrys days at still house lane fell into a wellordered routine up at five one slice of toast for breakfast he no longer licked his uncles bowl report to mr deakins at the newsagents by six stack the papers in the correct order then deliver them the whole exercise took about two hours allowing him to be back home in time for a cup of tea with mum before she went off to work at around eight thirty harry would set off for the library where he would meet up with deakins who was always sitting on the top step waiting for someone to open the doors in the afternoon harry would report for choir practice at st mary redcliffe as part of his obligation to st bedes he never considered it an obligation because he enjoyed singing so much in fact hed more than once whispered please god when my voice breaks let me be a tenor and ill never ask for anything else after he returned home for tea in the evening harry would work at the kitchen table for a couple of hours before going to bed dreading his uncles return every bit as much as he had fishers in his first week at st bedes at least fisher had departed for colstons grammar school so harry assumed their paths would never cross again harry was looking forward to his final year at st bedes although he wasnt in any doubt just how much his life would change if he and his two friends ended up going their separate ways giles to he knew not where deakins to bristol grammar while if he failed to win a scholarship to bgs he might well have to return to merrywood elementary and then at the age of fourteen leave school and look for a job he tried not to think about the consequences of failure despite stan never missing an opportunity to remind him he could always find work at the docks the boy should never have been allowed to go to that stuckup school in the first place he regularly told maisie once shed placed his bowl of porridge in front of him its given him ideas above his station he added as if harry wasnt there a view that harry felt fisher would have happily agreed with but then hed long ago come to the conclusion that uncle stan and fisher had a lot in common but surely harry should be given the chance to better himself countered maisie why said stan if the docks was good enough for me and his old man why arent they good enough for him he demanded with a finality that brooked no argument perhaps the boys cleverer than both of us suggested maisie this silenced stan for a moment but after another spoonful of porridge he declared depends on what you mean by clever after all theres clever and then theres clever he took another spoonful but added nothing more to this profound observation harry would cut his slice of toast into four pieces as he listened to his uncle play the same record again and again every morning he never spoke up for himself as clearly stan had already made up his mind on the subject of harrys future and nothing was going to budge him what stan didnt realize was that his constant jibes only inspired harry to work even harder cant hang around here all day would be stans final comment especially if he felt he was losing the argument some of us have a job to do he added as he rose from the table no one bothered to argue and another thing he said as he opened the kitchen door none of youve noticed the boys gone soft he doesnt even lick my porridge bowl no longer god knows what theyve been teachin him at that school the door slammed behind him take no notice of your uncle said harrys mother hes just jealous he doesnt like the fact that were all so proud of you and even hell have to change his tune when you win that scholarship just like your friend deakins but thats the problem mum said harry im not like deakins and im beginning to wonder if its all worth it the rest of the family stared at harry in silent disbelief until grandpa piped up for the first time in days i wish id been given the chance to go to bristol grammar school whys that grandpa shouted harry because if i had we wouldnt have had to live with your uncle stan all these years harry enjoyed his morning paper round and not just because it got him out of the house as the weeks went by he came to know several of mr deakinss regulars some of whom had heard him sing at st marys and would wave when he delivered their paper while others offered him a cup of tea even an apple mr deakins had warned him that there were two dogs he should avoid on the round within a fortnight both of them were wagging their tails when he got off his bicycle harry was delighted to discover that mr holcombe was one of mr deakinss regular customers and they often had a word when he dropped off his copy of the times each morning his first teacher left harry in no doubt that he didnt want to see him back at merrywood and added that if he needed any extra tuition he was free most evenings when harry returned to the newsagents after his round mr deakins would always slip a penny bar of frys chocolate into his satchel before sending him on his way it reminded him of giles he often wondered what had become of his friend neither he nor deakins had heard from giles since the day mr frobisher had asked to see harry after prep then before he left the shop to go home he always paused in front of the display cabinet to admire a watch he knew hed never be able to afford he didnt even bother to ask mr deakins how much it cost there were only two regular breaks in harrys weekly routine he would always try to spend saturday morning with old jack taking with him copies of all the previous weeks times and on sunday evenings once hed fulfilled his duties at st marys he would rush across the city so he could be at holy nativity in time for evensong a frail miss monday would beam with pride during the treble solo she only hoped she would live long enough to see harry go up to cambridge she had plans to tell him about the choir at kings college but not until hed won a place at bristol grammar is mr frobisher going to make you a prefect asked old jack even before harry had sunk into his usual seat on the opposite side of the carriage ive no idea replied harry mind you the frob always says he added tugging his lapels clifton in life you get what you deserve no more and certainly no less old jack chuckled and just stopped himself saying not a bad imitation of the frob he satisfied himself with then my bet is youre about to become a prefect id rather win a scholarship to bgs said harry suddenly sounding older than his years and what about your friends barrington and deakins old jack asked trying to lighten the mood are they also destined for higher things theyll never make deakins a prefect said harry he cant even take care of himself let alone anyone else in any case hes hoping to be the library monitor and as no one else wants the job mr frobisher shouldnt lose too much sleep over that appointment and barrington im not sure hell be coming back next term said harry wistfully even if he does im fairly certain they wont make him a prefect dont underestimate his father said old jack that man will undoubtedly have found a way to ensure that his son returns on the first day of term and i wouldnt put money on his not being a prefect lets hope youre right said harry and if i am i presume he will then follow his father to eton not if he has any say in it giles would prefer to go to bgs with deakins and me if he doesnt get into eton theyre unlikely to offer him a place at the grammar school their entrance exam is one of the hardest in the country he told me hes got a plan it had better be a good one if he hopes to fool his father as well as the examiners harry didnt comment hows your mother asked old jack changing the subject as it was clear that the boy didnt want to go any further down that path shes just been promoted shes now in charge of all the waitresses in the palm court room and reports directly to mr frampton the hotel manager you must be very proud of her said old jack yes i am sir and whats more im going to prove it what do you have in mind harry let him in to his secret the old man listened attentively and nodded his approval from time to time he could see one small problem but it wasnt insurmountable when harry returned to the shop having completed his last paper round before going back to school mr deakins gave him a shilling bonus youre the best paper boy ive ever had he said thank you sir said harry pocketing the money mr deakins can i ask you a question yes of course harry harry walked over to the cabinet where two watches were displayed side by side on the top shelf how much is that one he asked pointing to the ingersoll mr deakins smiled hed been waiting for harry to ask that question for some weeks and had his answer well prepared six shillings he said harry couldnt believe it hed been sure that such a magnificent object would cost more than double that but despite his having put aside half his earnings each week even with mr deakinss bonus he was still a shilling short you do realize harry that its a ladys watch said mr deakins yes i do sir said harry i was hoping to give it to my mother then you can have it for five shillings harry couldnt believe his luck thank you sir he said as he handed over four shillings one sixpence one thruppence and three pennies leaving him with empty pockets mr deakins took the watch out of the display cabinet discreetly removed the sixteenshilling price tag and then placed it in a smart box harry left the shop whistling mr deakins smiled and placed the tenshilling note in the till delighted that hed fulfilled his part of the bargain the bell went time to get undressed said the duty prefect in the new boys dorm on the first evening of term they all looked so small and helpless harry thought one or two of them were clearly fighting back tears while others were looking around uncertain what they should do next one boy was facing the wall shaking harry walked quickly across to him whats your name harry asked gently stevenson well im clifton welcome to st bedes and im tewkesbury said a boy standing on the other side of stevensons bed welcome to st bedes tewkesbury thank you clifton actually my father and grandfather were here before they went on to eton i dont doubt it said harry and ill bet they captained eton against harrow at lords he added immediately regretting his words no my father was a wet bob said tewkesbury unperturbed not a dry bob a wet bob said harry he captained oxford against cambridge in the boat race stevenson burst into tears whats the matter asked harry sitting down on the bed beside him my dads a tram driver everyone else stopped unpacking and stared at stevenson is that right said harry then id better let you into a secret he added loud enough to be sure that every boy in the dormitory could hear his words im the son of a dock worker i wouldnt be surprised to discover that youre the new choral scholar no said stevenson im an open scholar many congratulations said harry shaking him by the hand you follow in a long and noble tradition thank you but i have a problem the boy whispered and whats that stevenson i dont have any toothpaste dont worry about that old chap said tewkesbury my mother always packs a spare one harry smiled as the bell rang again everyone into bed he said firmly as he walked across the dormitory towards the door he heard a voice whisper thank you for the toothpaste think nothing of it old chap now said harry as he flicked off the light i dont want to hear another word from any of you until the bell goes at six thirty tomorrow morning he waited for a few moments before he heard someone whispering i meant it not another word he smiled as he walked down the staircase to join deakins and barrington in the senior prefects study harry had been surprised by two things when he arrived back at st bedes on the first day of term no sooner had he walked through the front door than mr frobisher took him to one side congratulations clifton he said softly it wont be announced until assembly tomorrow morning but youre to be the new school captain it should have been giles said harry without thinking barrington will be captain of games and harry had leapt in the air the moment he heard the news that his friend would be returning to st bedes old jack had been right when he said mr hugo would find a way to make sure his son was back for the first day of term when giles walked into the front hall a few moments later the two boys shook hands and harry never once referred to the subject that must have been on both their minds what are the new bugs like giles asked as harry entered the study one of them reminds me of you said harry tewkesbury no doubt you know him no but papa was at eton at the same time as his father i told him i was the son of a docker said harry as he slumped into the only comfortable chair in the room did you now said giles and did he tell you hes the son of a cabinet minister harry said nothing are there any others i should keep an eye out for asked giles stevenson said harry hes a cross between deakins and me then wed better lock the fireescape door before he makes a dash for it harry often thought about where he might be now if old jack hadnt talked him into returning to st bedes that night whats our first lesson tomorrow asked harry checking his timetable latin said deakins which is why im guiding giles through the first punic war to bc said giles i bet youre enjoying that said harry yes i am said giles and i just cant wait for the sequel the second punic war to bc said harry it always amazes me how the greeks and romans seemed to know exactly when christ would be born said giles ho ho ho said harry deakins didnt laugh but said and finally we will have to consider the third punic war to bc do we really need to know about all three of them said giles st mary redcliffe was packed with town and gown whod come to celebrate an advent service of eight readings and eight carols the choir made their entrance through the nave and advanced slowly down the aisle singing o come all ye faithful then took their places in the choir stalls the headmaster read the first lesson this was followed by o little town of bethlehem the service sheet indicated that the soloist for the third verse would be master harry clifton how silently how silently the wondrous gift is given while god harrys mother sat proudly in the third row while the old lady sitting next to her wanted to tell everyone in the congregation that they were listening to her grandson the man seated on the other side of maisie couldnt hear a word but you would never have known that from the contented smile on his face uncle stan was nowhere to be seen the captain of games read the second lesson and when giles returned to his place harry noticed that he was seated next to a distinguishedlooking man with a head of silver hair who he assumed must be sir walter barrington giles had once told him that his grandfather lived in an even larger house than his but harry didnt think that could be possible on the other side of giles sat his mother and father mrs barrington smiled across at him but mr barrington didnt once look in his direction when the organ struck up the prelude for we three kings the congregation rose and sang lustily the next lesson was read by mr frobisher after which came what miss monday anticipated would be the highlight of the service the thousandstrong congregation didnt stir while harry sang silent night with a clarity and confidence that caused even the headmaster to smile the library monitor read the next lesson harry had already coached him through st marks words several times deakins had tried to get out of the chore as he described it to giles but mr frobisher had insisted the fourth lesson was always read by the librarian deakins wasnt giles but he wasnt bad harry winked at him as he shuffled back to his seat next to his parents the choir then rose to sing in dulci jubilo while the congregation remained seated harry considered the carol to be among the most demanding in their repertoire because of its unconventional harmonies mr holcombe closed his eyes so that he could hear the senior choral scholar more clearly harry was singing now let all hearts be singing when he thought he heard a slight almost imperceptible crack in the voice he assumed harry must have a cold miss monday knew better shed heard those early signs so many times before she prayed that she was mistaken but knew her prayer would not be answered harry would get through the rest of the service with only a handful of people realizing what had happened and he would even be able to carry on for a few more weeks possibly months but by easter another child would be singing rejoice that the lord has arisen an old man whod turned up only moments after the service had begun was among those who werent in any doubt what had happened old jack left just before the bishop gave his final blessing he knew harry wouldnt be able to visit him until the following saturday which would give him enough time to work out how to answer the inevitable question might i have a private word with you clifton said mr frobisher as the bell sounded for the end of prep perhaps youd join me in my study harry would never forget the last time hed heard those words when harry closed the study door his housemaster beckoned him towards a seat by the fire something he had never done before i just wanted to assure you harry another first that the fact you are no longer able to sing in the choir will not affect your bursary we at st bedes are well aware that the contribution you have made to school life stretches far beyond the chapel thank you sir said harry however we must now consider your future the music master tells me that it will be some time before your voice fully recovers which im afraid means that we must be realistic about your chances of being offered a choral scholarship to bristol grammar school there is no chance said harry calmly i have to agree with you said frobisher im relieved to find you understand the situation but he continued i would be happy to enter your name for an open scholarship to bgs however he added before harry had time to respond in the circumstances you might consider that youd have a better chance of being offered a bursary at say colstons school or kings college gloucester both of which have far less demanding entrance examinations no thank you sir said harry my first choice remains bristol grammar hed said the same thing to old jack just as firmly the previous saturday when his mentor had mumbled something about not burning your boats so be it said mr frobisher who had not expected any other response but had still felt it was nothing less than his duty to come up with an alternative now lets turn this setback to our advantage how do you suggest i do that sir well now that youve been released from daily choir practice you will have more time to prepare for your entrance exam yes sir but i still have my responsibilities as and i will do everything in my power to ensure that your duties as school captain are less onerous in future thank you sir by the way harry said frobisher as he rose from his chair ive just read your essay on jane austen and i was fascinated by your suggestion that if miss austen had been able to go to university she might never have written a novel and even if she had her work probably wouldnt have been so insightful sometimes its an advantage to be disadvantaged said harry that doesnt sound like jane austen said mr frobisher it isnt replied harry but it was said by someone else who didnt go to university he added without explanation maisie glanced at her new watch and smiled ill have to leave now harry if im not going to be late for work of course mum said harry leaping up from the table ill walk with you to the tram stop harry have you thought about what youll do if you dont win that scholarship said his mother finally asking a question shed been avoiding for weeks constantly said harry as he opened the door for her but i wont be given much choice in the matter ill just have to go back to merrywood and when i turn fourteen ill leave and look for a job do you feel ready to face the examiners my boy asked old jack as ready as im ever likely to be replied harry by the way i took your advice and checked over the examination papers for the past ten years you were right theres a definite pattern with some of the same questions coming up at regular intervals good and hows your latin coming on we cant afford to fail that however well we do in your other papers harry smiled when old jack said we thanks to deakins i managed per cent in mocks last week even if i did have hannibal crossing the andes only about six thousand miles out chuckled old jack so what do you think will be your biggest problem the forty boys from st bedes who are also taking the exam not to mention the two hundred and fifty from other schools forget them said old jack if you do what youre capable of they wont be a problem harry remained silent so hows your voice coming along asked old jack who always changed the subject whenever harry fell silent nothing new to report said harry it could be weeks before i know if im a tenor a baritone or a bass and even then theres no guarantee ill be any good one things for certain bgs arent going to offer me a choral scholarship while im like a horse with a broken leg snap out of it said old jack its not that bad its worse said harry if i was a horse theyd shoot me and put me out of my misery old jack laughed so when are the exams he asked even though he knew the answer thursday week we start with general knowledge at nine oclock and there are five other papers during the day ending with english at four its good that you finish with your favourite subject said jack lets hope so said harry but pray theres a question on dickens because there hasnt been one for the past three years which is why ive been reading his books after lights out wellington wrote in his memoirs said old jack that the worst moment of any campaign is waiting for the sun to rise on the morning of battle i agree with the iron duke which means i wont be getting much sleep for the next couple of weeks all the more reason not to come and see me next saturday harry you ought to be making better use of your time in any case if i remember correctly its your birthday how did you know that i confess that i didnt read it on the court page of the times but as it fell on the same day last year i took a gamble and bought a small gift for you he picked up a parcel wrapped in a page from one of last weeks newspapers and handed it to harry thank you sir said harry as he untied the string he removed the newspaper opened the small dark blue box and stared in disbelief at the mans ingersoll watch hed last seen in the display cabinet at mr deakinss shop thank you harry repeated as he strapped the watch on his wrist he couldnt take his eyes off it for some time and could only wonder how old jack could possibly afford six shillings harry was wide awake long before the sun rose on the morning of the exams he skipped breakfast in favour of going over some old general knowledge papers checking capitals against countries from germany to brazil dates of prime ministers from walpole to lloyd george and of monarchs from king alfred to george v an hour later he felt ready to face the examiner once again he was seated in the front row between barrington and deakins was this the last time he wondered when the clock on the tower struck ten several masters marched down the rows of desks handing out the general knowledge paper to forty nervous boys well thirtynine nervous boys and deakins harry read through the questions slowly when he reached number he allowed a smile to cross his face he picked up his pen dipped the nib in the inkwell and began to write forty minutes later he was back at question he glanced at his watch he still had another ten minutes in which to doublecheck his answers he stopped for a moment at question and reconsidered his original answer was it oliver cromwell or thomas cromwell who was sent to the tower of london for treason he recalled the fate of cardinal wolsey and selected the man whod taken his place as lord chancellor when the clock began to strike again harry had reached question he quickly looked over his last eight answers before his paper was snatched away the ink still drying on his final answer charles lindbergh during the twentyminute break harry giles and deakins walked slowly around the cricket field where giles had scored a century only a week before amo amas amat said deakins as he painstakingly took them through their conjugations without once referring to kennedys latin primer amamus amatis amant repeated harry as they made their way back towards the examination hall when harry handed in his latin paper an hour later he felt confident hed scored more than the required per cent and even giles looked pleased with himself as the three of them strolled across to the refectory harry put an arm around deakinss shoulder and said thanks old chum after harry had read through the geography paper later that morning he silently thanked his secret weapon old jack had passed on so much knowledge over the years without ever making him feel that hed been in a classroom harry didnt pick up a knife or fork during lunch giles managed half a pork pie while deakins didnt stop eating history was the first paper that afternoon and didnt cause him any anxiety henry viii elizabeth raleigh drake napoleon nelson and wellington all marched on to the battlefield and harry marched them back off again the mathematics paper was far easier than he had expected and giles even thought he might have scored another century during the final break harry returned to his study and glanced over an essay hed written on david copperfield confident that he would excel in his favourite subject he walked slowly back to the examination hall repeating mr holcombes favourite word again and again concentrate he stared down at the final paper of the day to find that this year belonged to thomas hardy and lewis carroll hed read the mayor of casterbridge and alices adventures in wonderland but the mad hatter michael henchard and the cheshire cat were not as familiar to him as peggotty dr chillip and barkis his pen scratched slowly across the page and when the clock chimed on the hour he wasnt sure if hed done enough he walked out of the hall and into the afternoon sunshine feeling a little depressed although it was clear from the looks on the faces of his rivals that no one thought it had been an easy paper that made him wonder if he was still in with a chance there followed what mr holcombe had often described as the worst part of any exam those days of endless waiting before the results were formally posted on the school notice board a time when boys end up doing something they will later regret almost as if they want to be rusticated rather than learn their fate one boy was caught drinking cider behind the bicycle shed another smoking a woodbine in the lavatory while a third was seen leaving the local cinema after lights out giles was out for a duck the following saturday his first of the season while deakins returned to the library harry went on long walks going over every answer in his head again and again it didnt improve matters on sunday afternoon giles had a long net on monday deakins reluctantly handed over his responsibilities to the new library monitor and on tuesday harry read far from the madding crowd and cursed out loud on wednesday night giles and harry talked into the small hours while deakins slept soundly long before the clock on the tower struck ten that thursday morning forty boys were already roaming around the quad hands in pockets heads bowed as they waited for the headmaster to make his appearance although every one of them knew that dr oakshott wouldnt be a minute early or a minute late by five to ten most eyes were staring across the quad waiting for the door of the headmasters house to open the rest were looking up at the clock on the great hall willing the minute hand to move a little faster as the first chime sounded the reverend samuel oakshott opened his front door and stepped out on to the path he was carrying a sheet of paper in one hand and four tintacks in the other not a man who left anything to chance when he reached the end of the path he opened the little wicket gate and walked across the quad at his usual pace oblivious to all around him the boys quickly stood aside creating a corridor so the headmasters progress would not be impeded he came to a halt in front of the notice board as the tenth chime rang out he posted the exam results on the board and departed without a word forty boys rushed forward forming a scrum around the notice board no one was surprised that deakins headed the list with per cent and had been awarded the peloquin scholarship to bristol grammar school giles leapt in the air making no attempt to disguise his relief when he saw per cent by his name they both turned to look for their friend harry was standing alone far from the madding crowd maisie clifton when arthur and me got married the occasion couldnt have been described as pushing the boat out but then neither the tancocks nor the cliftons ever did have two brass farthings to rub together the biggest expense turned out to be the choir half a crown and worth every penny id always wanted to be a member of miss mondays choir and although she told me my voice was good enough i wasnt considered on account of the fact i couldnt read or write the reception if you could call it that was held at arthurs parents terraced house in still house lane a barrel of beer some peanut butter sandwiches and a dozen pork pies my brother stan even brought his own fish and chips and to top it all we had to leave early to catch the last bus to westonsupermare for our honeymoon arthur booked us into a seafront guest house on the friday evening and as it rained for most of the weekend we rarely left the bedroom it felt strange that the second time i had sex was also in westonsupermare i was shocked when i saw arthur naked for the first time a deep red roughly stitched scar stretched tight across his stomach damn the germans he never said hed been wounded during the war i wasnt surprised that arthur became aroused the moment i pulled off my slip but i must admit id expected him to take his boots off before we made love we checked out of the guest house on sunday afternoon and caught the last bus back to bristol as arthur had to report to the dockyard by six oclock on monday morning after the wedding arthur moved into our house just until we could afford a place of our own he told my father which usually meant until one of our parents passed away in any case both our families had lived on still house lane for as long as anyone could remember arthur was delighted when i told him i was in the family way because he wanted at least six babies my worry was whether the first would be his but as only my mum and i knew the truth there was no reason for arthur to be suspicious eight months later i gave birth to a boy and thank god there was nothing to suggest that he wasnt arthurs we christened him harold which pleased my father because it meant his name would survive for another generation from then on i took it for granted that like mum and gran i would be stuck at home having a baby every other year after all arthur came from a family of eight and i was the fourth of five but harry turned out to be my only child arthur usually came straight home after work of an evening so he could spend some time with the baby before i put him to bed when he didnt turn up that friday night i assumed hed gone off to the pub with my brother but when stan staggered in just after midnight blind drunk and flashing a wad of fivers arthur was nowhere to be seen in fact stan gave me one of the fivers which made me wonder if hed robbed a bank but when i asked him where arthur was he clammed up i didnt go to bed that night just sat on the bottom step of the stairs waiting for my husband to come home arthur had never stayed out all night from the day we was married although stan had sobered up by the time he came down to the kitchen the following morning he didnt say a word during breakfast when i asked him again where arthur was he claimed he hadnt seen him since theyd clocked off work the previous evening its not difficult to tell when stans lying because he wont look you in the eye i was about to press him further when i heard a loud banging on the front door my first thought was that it must be arthur so i rushed to answer it when i opened the door two policemen burst into the house ran into the kitchen grabbed stan handcuffed him and told him he was being arrested for burglary now i knew where the wad of fivers had come from i didnt steal anything protested stan mr barrington gave me the money a likely story tancock said the first copper but its the gods honest truth officer he was saying as they dragged him off to the nick this time i knew stan wasnt lying i left harry with my mum and ran all the way to the dockyard hoping to find that arthur had reported for the morning shift and would be able to tell me why stan had been arrested i tried not to think about the possibility that arthur might also be locked up the man on the gate told me he hadnt seen arthur all morning but after he checked the rota he looked puzzled because arthur hadnt clocked off the night before all he had to say was dont blame me i wasnt on the gate last night it was only later that i wondered why hed used the word blame i went into the dockyard and asked some of arthurs mates but they all parroted the same line havent seen him since he clocked off last night then they quickly walked away i was about to go off to the nick to see if arthur had been arrested as well when i saw an old man going past head bowed i chased after him quite expecting him to tell me to bugger off or claim he didnt know what i was talking about but when i approached he stopped took off his cap and said good morning i was surprised by his good manners which gave me the confidence to ask him if hed seen arthur that morning no he replied i last saw him yesterday afternoon when he was on the late shift with your brother perhaps you should ask him i cant i said hes been arrested and taken off to the nick what have they charged him with asked old jack looking puzzled i dont know i replied old jack shook his head i cant help you mrs clifton he said but there are at least two people who know the whole story he nodded towards the large redbrick building that arthur always called management i shivered when i saw a policeman coming out of the front door of the building and when i looked back old jack had disappeared i thought about going into management or barrington house to give it its proper name but decided against it after all what would i say if i came face to face with arthurs boss in the end i began to walk aimlessly back home trying to make sense of things i watched hugo barrington when he gave his evidence the same selfconfidence the same arrogance the same halftruths spouted convincingly to the jury just as hed whispered them to me in the privacy of the bedroom when he stepped down from the witness box i knew stan didnt have a snowballs chance in hell of getting off in the judges summingup he described my brother as a common thief who had taken advantage of his position to rob his employer he ended by saying he had no choice but to send him down for three years i had sat through every day of the trial hoping to pick up some snippet of information that might give me a clue as to what had happened to arthur that day but by the time the judge finally declared court adjourned i was none the wiser although i was in no doubt that my brother wasnt telling the whole story it would be some time before i found out why the only other person who attended the court every day was old jack tar but we didnt speak in fact i might never have seen him again if it hadnt been for harry it was some time before i was able to accept that arthur would never be coming home stan had only been away for a few days before i discovered the true meaning of the words eke out with one of the two breadwinners in the family banged up and the other god knows where we soon found ourselves quite literally on the breadline luckily there was an unwritten code that operated in still house lane if someone was away on holiday the neighbours did whatever they could to help support his family the reverend watts dropped in regularly and even returned some of the coins wed put in his collection plate over the years miss monday appeared irregularly and dispensed far more than good advice always leaving with an empty basket but nothing could compensate me for the loss of a husband an innocent brother locked up in jail and a son who no longer had a father harry had recently taken his first step but i was already fearful of hearing his first word would he even remember who used to sit at the head of the table and ask why he was no longer there it was grandpa who came up with a solution as to what we should say if harry started to ask questions we all made a pact to stick to the same story after all harry was hardly likely to come across old jack but at that time the tancock familys most pressing problem was how to keep the wolf from our door or more important the rent collector and the bailiff once id spent stans five pounds pawned my mums silverplated tea strainer my engagement ring and finally my wedding ring i feared it couldnt be long before we were evicted but that was delayed for a few weeks by another knock on the door this time it wasnt the police but a man called mr sparks who told me he was arthurs trade union representative and that hed come to see if id had any compensation from the company once id settled mr sparks down in the kitchen and poured him a cup of tea i told him not a brass farthing they say he left without giving notice so they arent responsible for his actions and i still dont know what really happened that day neither do i said mr sparks theyve all clammed up not just the management but the workers as well i cant get a word out of them more than my lifes worth one of them told me but your husbands subs were fully paid up he added so youre entitled to union compensation i just stood there with no idea what he was going on about mr sparks took a document out of his briefcase placed it on the kitchen table and turned to the back page sign here he said placing a forefinger on the dotted line after i had put an x where he was pointing he took an envelope out of his pocket im sorry its so little he said as he handed it to me i didnt open the envelope until he had finished his cup of tea and left seven pounds nine shillings and sixpence turned out to be the value theyd put on arthurs life i sat alone at the kitchen table and i think that was the moment i knew id never see my husband again that afternoon i went back to the pawn shop and redeemed my wedding ring from mr cohen it was the least i could do in memory of arthur the following morning i cleared the rent arrears as well as the slate at the butcher the baker and yes the candlestick maker there was just enough left over to buy some secondhand clothes from the church jumble sale mostly for harry but it was less than a month before the chalk was once again scratching across the slate at the butcher the baker and the candlestick maker and it wasnt long after that i had to return to the pawn shop and hand my wedding ring back to mr cohen when the rent collector came knocking on the door of number and never received a reply i suppose none of the family should have been surprised that the next caller would be the bailiff that was when i decided the time had come for me to look for a job maisies attempts to find a job didnt turn out to be easy not least because the government had recently issued a directive to all employers advising them to take on men who had served in the armed forces before considering any other candidates this was in keeping with lloyd georges promise that britains soldiers would return home to a land fit for heroes although women over thirty had been given the vote at the last election after their sterling service in munitions factories during the war they were pushed to the back of the queue when it came to peacetime jobs maisie decided that her best chance of finding employment was to apply for jobs men wouldnt consider either because they felt they were too demeaning or the pay was derisory with that in mind maisie stood in line outside wd ho wills the citys largest employer when she reached the front of the queue she asked the supervisor is it true youre looking for packers in the cigarette factory yes but youre too young luv he told her im twentytwo youre too young he repeated come back in two or three years time maisie was back at still house lane in time to share a bowl of chicken broth and a slice of last weeks bread with harry and her mum the next day she joined an even longer queue outside harveys the wine merchants when she reached the front three hours later she was told by a man wearing a starched white collar and a thin black tie that they were only taking on applicants with experience so how do i get experience maisie asked trying not to sound desperate by joining our apprentice scheme then ill join she told the starched collar how old are you twentytwo youre too old maisie repeated every word of the sixtysecond interview to her mother over a thinner bowl of broth from the same pot along with a crust of bread from the same loaf you could always try the docks her mother suggested what do you have in mind mum should i sign up to be a stevedore maisies mum didnt laugh but then maisie couldnt remember the last time she had theyve always got work for cleaners she said and god knows that lot owe you maisie was up and dressed long before the sun had risen the following morning and as there wasnt enough breakfast to go round she set out hungry on the long walk to the docks when she arrived maisie told the man on the gate she was looking for a cleaning job report to mrs nettles he said nodding in the direction of the large redbrick building shed so nearly entered once before shes in charge of hirin and firin cleaners he clearly didnt remember her from her previous visit maisie walked uneasily towards the building but came to a halt a few paces before she reached the front door she stood and watched as a succession of smartly dressed men wearing hats and coats and carrying umbrellas made their way through the double doors maisie remained rooted to the spot shivering in the cold morning air as she tried to find enough courage to follow them inside she was just about to turn away when she spotted an older woman in overalls entering another door at the side of the building maisie chased after her what do you want asked the woman suspiciously once maisie had caught up with her im lookin for a job good she said we could do with some young uns report to mrs nettles she added pointing towards a narrow door that might have been mistaken for a broom cupboard maisie walked boldly up to it and knocked come on in said a tired voice maisie opened the door to find a woman of about her mothers age sitting on the only chair surrounded by buckets mops and several large bars of soap i was told to report to you if i was lookin for a job you was told right thats if youre willing to work all the hours god gives for damn all pay what are the hours and whats the pay asked maisie you start at three in the morning and you have to be off the premises by seven before their nibs turns up when they expect to find their offices spick and span or you can start at seven of an evening and work through till midnight whichever suits you pays the same whatever you decide sixpence an hour ill do both shifts said maisie good the woman said selecting a bucket and mop ill see you back here at seven this evenin when ill show you the ropes my names vera nettles whats yours maisie clifton mrs nettles dropped the bucket on the floor and propped the mop back up against the wall she walked across to the door and opened it theres no work for you here mrs clifton she said over the next month maisie tried to get a job in a shoe shop but the manager didnt feel he could employ someone with holes in her shoes a milliners where the interview was terminated the moment they discovered she couldnt add up and a flower shop which wouldnt consider taking on anyone who didnt have their own garden grandpas allotment didnt count in desperation she applied for a job as a barmaid in a local pub but the landlord said sorry luv but your tits arent big enough the following sunday at holy nativity maisie knelt and asked god to give her a helping hand that hand turned out to be miss mondays who told maisie she had a friend who owned a tea shop on broad street and was looking for a waitress but i dont have any experience said maisie that may well prove to be an advantage said miss monday miss tilly is most particular and prefers to train her staff in her own way perhaps shell think im too old or too young you are neither too old nor too young said miss monday and be assured i wouldnt recommend you if i didnt think you were up to it but i must warn you maisie that miss tilly is a stickler for timekeeping be at the tea shop before eight oclock tomorrow if youre late that will not only be the first impression you make but also the last maisie was standing outside tillys tea shop at six oclock the following morning and didnt budge for the next two hours at five minutes to eight a plump middleaged smartly dressed woman with her hair arranged in a neat bun and a pair of halfmoon spectacles propped on the end of her nose turned the closed sign on the door to open to allow a frozen maisie to step inside youve got the job mrs clifton were her new bosss first words harry was left in the care of his grandmother whenever maisie went to work although she was only paid nine pence an hour she was allowed to keep half her tips so that at the end of a good week she could take home as much as three pounds there was also an unexpected bonus once the open sign had been turned back to closed at six oclock in the evening miss tilly would allow maisie to take home any food that was left over the word stale was never allowed to cross a customers lips after six months miss tilly was so pleased with maisies progress that she put her in charge of her own station of eight tables and after another six months several regulars would insist that maisie served them miss tilly solved the problem by increasing maisies allocation of tables to twelve and raising her pay to a shilling an hour with two pay packets coming in each week maisie was once again able to wear both her engagement ring and her wedding ring and the silverplated tea strainer was back in its place if maisie was honest about it stan being released from prison for good behaviour after only eighteen months turned out to be a bit of a mixed blessing harry now aged three and a half had to move back into his mothers room and maisie tried not to think about just how peaceful it had been while stan was away maisie was surprised when stan got his old job back at the docks as if nothing had happened this only convinced her that he knew far more about arthurs disappearance than he let on however much she pressed him on one occasion when she became a little too persistent he belted her one although the following morning miss tilly pretended not to notice the black eye one or two of the customers did so maisie never raised the subject with her brother again but whenever harry asked him about his father stan stuck to the family line and said your old man was killed in the war i was standin by his side when the bullet hit him maisie spent as much of her spare time with harry as she could she assumed that once he was old enough to attend merrywood elementary school her life would become a lot easier but taking harry to school in the morning meant the added expense of a tram ride to make sure she was not late for work she would then take a break in the afternoon so she could pick him up from school once maisie had given him his tea she would leave him in the care of his grandma and return to work harry had only been at school for a few days when maisie noticed some cane marks on his backside while she was giving him his weekly bath who did that she demanded the headmaster why cant tell you mum when maisie saw six new red stripes even before the previous ones had faded she questioned harry again but still he didnt let on the third time the marks appeared she put on her coat and set off for merrywood elementary with the intention of giving his teacher a piece of her mind mr holcombe wasnt at all what maisie had expected to start with he couldnt have been much older than she was and he stood up when she entered the room not at all like the teachers she remembered from her days at merrywood why is my son being caned by the headmaster she demanded even before mr holcombe had a chance to offer her a seat because he keeps playing truant mrs clifton he disappears soon after morning assembly and gets back in time for football in the afternoon so where is he spending the day at the docks would be my guess said mr holcombe perhaps you might be able to tell me why because his uncle works there and hes always telling harry that school is a waste of time because sooner or later hell end up joining him at barringtons i hope not said mr holcombe why do you say that asked maisie it was good enough for his father that may well be but it wont be good enough for harry what do you mean maisie asked indignantly harry is bright mrs clifton very bright if only i could persuade him to attend class more regularly theres no saying what he might achieve maisie suddenly wondered if she would ever find out which of the two men was harrys father some clever children dont discover how bright they are until after theyve left school continued mr holcombe and then spend the rest of their lives regretting the wasted years i want to make sure harry does not fall into that category what would you like me to do asked maisie finally sitting down encourage him to stay at school and not slope off to the docks every day tell him how proud youd be if he did well in class and not only on the football field which just in case you didnt realize mrs clifton isnt his forte his forte i do apologize but even harry must have worked out by now that hes never going to make the school xi let alone play for bristol city ill do anything i can to help promised maisie thank you mrs clifton said mr holcombe as maisie rose to leave if you felt able to encourage him ive no doubt it will be far more effective in the long term than the headmasters cane from that day maisie began to take a far greater interest in what harry got up to at school she enjoyed listening to his stories about mr holcombe and what hed taught him that day and as the stripes didnt reappear she assumed he must have stopped playing truant and then one night just before going to bed she checked on the sleeping child and found that the stripes were back redder and deeper than before she didnt need to go and see mr holcombe because he called in at the tea shop the following day he managed to come to my class for a whole month said mr holcombe and then he disappeared again but i dont know what more i can do said maisie helplessly ive already stopped his pocket money and told him not to expect another penny from me unless he stays at school the truth is his uncle stan has far more influence over him than i do mores the pity said mr holcombe but i may have found a solution to our problem mrs clifton however it has no chance of succeeding without your full cooperation maisie assumed that although she was only twentysix she would never marry again after all widows with a child in tow were not much of a catch when there were so many single women available the fact that she always wore her engagement and wedding rings probably cut down the number of propositions she received at the tea shop although one or two still tried it on she didnt include dear old mr craddick who just liked to hold her hand mr atkins was one of miss tillys regulars and he liked to sit at one of the tables where maisie was serving he dropped in most mornings always ordering a black coffee and a piece of fruit cake to maisies surprise after hed paid his bill one morning he invited her to the cinema greta garbo in flesh and the devil he said trying to make it sound more tempting this wasnt the first time one of the customers had asked maisie out but it was the first time someone young and goodlooking had shown any interest in the past her stock response had succeeded in putting off the most persistent of suitors how kind of you mr atkins but i like to spend any spare time i have with my son surely you could make an exception for just one evening he said not giving up quite as easily as the others maisie glanced quickly at his left hand no sign of a wedding ring or even more damning a pale circle revealing that one had been removed she heard herself saying how kind of you mr atkins and agreed to meet him on thursday evening after shed put harry to bed call me eddie he said leaving a sixpenny tip maisie was impressed when eddie turned up in a flatnose morris to drive her to the cinema and to her surprise all he got up to while they sat together in the back row was to watch the film she wouldnt have complained if he had put an arm around her shoulder in fact she was considering how far she would let him go on their first date after the curtain came down the organ lit up and they all rose to sing the national anthem care for a drink asked eddie as they made their way out of the cinema i ought to be getting home before the trams pack up for the night you dont have to worry about the last tram maisie when youre with eddie atkins all right then just a quick one she said as he guided her across the road to the red bull so what do you do eddie maisie asked as he placed a half pint of orange squash on the table in front of her im in the entertainment business he said without going into any detail instead he switched the subject back to maisie i dont have to ask what you do after a second orange juice he looked at his watch and said ive got an early start tomorrow so id better get you home on the way back to still house lane maisie chatted about harry and how she was hoping he would join the choir at holy nativity eddie seemed genuinely interested and when he brought the car to a halt outside no she waited for him to kiss her but he just jumped out opened the car door for her and accompanied maisie to her front door maisie sat at the kitchen table and told her mother everything that had happened or not happened that night all grandma had to say was whats his game when maisie saw mr holcombe walk into holy nativity accompanied by a smartly dressed man she assumed that harry must be in trouble again she was surprised because there hadnt been any red marks for over a year she braced herself as mr holcombe headed towards her but the moment he saw maisie he simply gave her a shy smile before he and his companion slipped into the third pew on the other side of the aisle from time to time maisie glanced across to look at them but she didnt recognize the other man who was considerably older than mr holcombe she wondered if he might be the headmaster of merrywood elementary when the choir rose to sing the first anthem miss monday glanced in the direction of the two men before nodding to the organist to show that she was ready maisie felt that harry excelled himself that morning but she was surprised when a few minutes later he rose to sing a second solo and even more surprised when he performed a third everyone knew that miss monday never did anything unless there was a reason but it still wasnt clear to maisie what that reason might be after the reverend watts had blessed his flock at the end of the service maisie remained in her place and waited for harry to appear hoping hed be able to tell her why hed been asked to sing three solos as she chatted anxiously to her mother her eyes never left mr holcombe who was introducing the older man to miss monday and the reverend watts a moment later the reverend watts led the two men into the vestry miss monday marched down the aisle towards maisie a resolute look on her face which every parishioner knew meant she was on a mission can i have a private word with you mrs clifton she asked she didnt give maisie a chance to reply but simply turned and walked back down the aisle towards the vestry eddie atkins hadnt shown his face in tillys for over a month but then one morning he reappeared and took his usual seat at one of maisies tables when she came over to serve him he gave her a huge smile as if hed never been away good morning mr atkins maisie said as she opened her notepad what can i get for you my usual said eddie its been so long mr atkins said maisie youll have to remind me im sorry i havent been in touch maisie said eddie but i had to go to america at rather short notice and i only got back last night she wanted to believe him maisie had already admitted to her mother that she was a little disappointed she hadnt heard from eddie after hed taken her to the cinema shed enjoyed his company and felt the evening had gone rather well another man had started visiting the tea shop regularly and like eddie he would only sit at one of maisies tables although she couldnt help noticing that he was showing considerable interest in her she didnt give him any encouragement because not only was he middleaged but he was also wearing a wedding ring he had a detached air about him like a solicitor who is studying a client and whenever he spoke to her he sounded a little pompous maisie could hear her mother asking whats his game but perhaps shed misunderstood his intentions because he never once tried to strike up a conversation with her even maisie couldnt resist a grin when a week later both of her suitors dropped in for a coffee on the same morning and both asked if they could meet up with her later eddie was first and he got straight to the point why dont i pick you up after work this evening maisie theres something im rather keen to show you maisie wanted to tell him she already had a date just to make him realize she wasnt available whenever it suited him but when she returned to his table a few minutes later with his bill she found herself saying ill see you after work then eddie she still had a smile on her face when the other customer said i wonder if i might have a word with you mrs clifton maisie wondered how he knew her name wouldnt you prefer to speak to the manageress mr frampton he replied no thank you its you i was hoping to speak to might i suggest we meet at the royal hotel during your afternoon break it shouldnt take more than fifteen minutes of your time talk about buses never turning up when you need one maisie said to miss tilly and then two arrive at once miss tilly told maisie she thought she recognized mr frampton but couldnt place him when maisie presented mr frampton with his bill she emphasized that she could only spare fifteen minutes because she had to be on time to pick up her son from school at four oclock he nodded as if that was something else he was aware of was it really in harrys best interests to apply for a scholarship to st bedes maisie wasnt sure who to discuss the problem with stan was bound to be against the idea and wasnt likely to consider the other side of the argument miss tilly was too close a friend of miss mondays to give a dispassionate view and the reverend watts had already advised her to seek the lords guidance which hadnt proved particularly reliable in the past mr frobisher had seemed such a nice man but hed made it clear that only she could make the final decision mr holcombe hadnt left her in any doubt how he felt maisie didnt give mr frampton another thought until shed finished serving her last customer she then exchanged a pinafore for her old coat miss tilly watched through the window as maisie set off in the direction of the royal hotel she felt a little anxious but wasnt sure why although maisie had never been in the royal before she knew it had the reputation of being one of the bestrun hotels in the west country and the chance to see it from the inside was one of the reasons shed agreed to see mr frampton she stood on the opposite pavement and watched as customers pushed their way through the revolving doors shed never seen anything quite like them and only when she felt confident shed got the hang of how they worked did she cross the road and step inside she pushed a little too hard and found herself propelled into the foyer more quickly than shed anticipated maisie looked around and spotted mr frampton sitting alone in a quiet alcove in the corner of the foyer she walked across to join him he immediately rose from his place shook hands with her and waited until she had taken the seat opposite him can i order you a coffee mrs clifton he asked and before she could reply he added i should warn you its not in the same class as tillys no thank you mr frampton said maisie whose only interest was to find out why he wanted to see her mr frampton took his time lighting a cigarette then inhaled deeply mrs clifton he began as he placed the cigarette on the ashtray you cannot have failed to notice that i have recently become a regular customer at tillys maisie nodded i have to confess that my only reason for visiting the café was you maisie had her wellprepared amorous suitor line ready for just as soon as he stopped talking in all the years ive been in the hotel trade he continued ive never seen anyone do their job more efficiently than you i only wish that every waitress in this hotel was of your calibre ive been well trained said maisie so have the other four waitresses in that tea shop but none of them has your flair im flattered mr frampton but why are you telling i am the general manager of this hotel he said and id like you to take charge of our coffee room which is known as the palm court as you can see he waved a hand expansively we have about a hundred covers but less than a third of the places are regularly occupied thats not exactly a worthwhile return on the companys investment no doubt that would change if you were to take over i believe i can make it worth your while maisie didnt interrupt him i cant see why your hours should differ greatly from those of your current employment id be willing to pay you five pounds a week and all the tips earned by the waitresses in the palm court would be split fiftyfifty with you if you were able to build up the clientele that could prove very remunerative and then i but i couldnt think of leaving miss tilly interrupted maisie shes been so good to me over the past six years i fully appreciate your feelings mrs clifton indeed i would have been disappointed if that had not been your immediate response loyalty is a trait i greatly admire however you must not only consider your own future but also your sons should he take up the offer of a choral scholarship to st bedes maisie was speechless when maisie finished work that evening she found eddie sitting in his car outside the tea shop waiting for her she noticed that he didnt jump out to open the passenger door this time so where are you taking me she asked as she climbed in beside him its a surprise said eddie as he pressed the starter but i dont think youll be disappointed he pushed the gear lever into first and headed towards a part of the city that maisie hadnt visited before a few minutes later he drove into a side alley and came to a halt outside a large oak door below a neon sign that announced in glowing red letters eddies nightclub this is yours asked maisie every square inch said eddie proudly come inside and see for yourself he leapt out of the car opened the front door and led maisie inside this used to be a granary he explained as he took her down a narrow wooden staircase but now that ships can no longer sail this far up the river the companys had to move so i was able to pick up their lease for a very reasonable price maisie entered a large dimly lit room it was some time before her eyes had adjusted well enough to take it all in there were half a dozen men sitting on high leather stools drinking at the bar and almost as many waitresses fluttering around them the wall behind the bar consisted of a vast mirror giving the impression the room was far larger than it actually was at the centre was a dance floor surrounded by plush velvet banquettes that would just about seat two people at the far end was a small stage with a piano double bass a set of drums and several music stands eddie took a seat at the bar looking around the room he said this is why ive been spending so much time in america speakeasies like this are springing up all over new york and chicago and theyre making a fortune he lit a cigar and i promise you there wont be anything else like this in bristol thats for sure thats for sure maisie repeated as she joined him at the bar but didnt attempt to climb up on to one of the high stools whats your poison doll said eddie in what he imagined to be an american accent i dont drink maisie reminded him thats one of the reasons i chose you chose me sure youd be the ideal person to take charge of the cocktail waitresses not only would i pay you six pounds a week but if the place takes off the tips alone would be more than you could ever hope to earn at tillys and would i be expected to dress like that asked maisie pointing to one of the waitresses who was wearing an offtheshoulder red blouse and a tightfitting black skirt that barely covered her knees it amused maisie that they were the same colours as the st bedes uniform why not youre a greatlookin broad and the punters will pay good money to be served by someone like you youll get the odd proposition of course but i feel sure you can handle that whats the point of a dance floor if its a menonly club another idea i picked up from the states said eddie if you want to dance with one of the cocktail waitresses itll cost you and what else does that cost include thats up to them said eddie with a shrug of the shoulders so long as it doesnt take place on the premises nothing to do with me he added laughing a little too loudly maisie didnt laugh so what do you think he asked i think id better be getting home said maisie i didnt have time to let harry know id be late whatever you say honey said eddie he draped an arm around her shoulder and led her out of the bar and back up the stairs as he drove her to still house lane he told maisie about his plans for the future ive already got my eye on a second site he said excitedly so the skys the limit the skys the limit maisie repeated as they drew up outside no maisie jumped out of the car and walked quickly to the front door so will you need a few days to think it over said eddie chasing after her no thank you eddie said maisie without hesitation ive already made up my mind she added taking a key out of her handbag eddie grinned and put an arm around her i didnt think it would be a difficult decision for you to make maisie removed the arm smiled sweetly and said its kind of you to consider me honey but i think ill stick to serving coffee she opened her front door before adding but thanks for asking anything you say doll but if you change your mind my door is always open maisie closed the door behind her maisie finally settled on the one person she felt she could seek advice from she decided to turn up at the docks unannounced and hope hed be around when she knocked on his door she didnt tell either stan or harry who she was visiting one of them would try to stop her while the other would feel shed betrayed a confidence maisie waited until her day off and once she had dropped harry at school she took a tram to the dockyard she had chosen her time carefully late morning when he was still likely to be in his office while stan would be fully occupied loading or unloading cargo at the other end of the dock maisie told the man on the gate that shed come to apply for a job as a cleaner he pointed indifferently towards the redbrick building and still didnt remember her as she walked towards barrington house maisie looked up at the windows on the fifth floor and wondered which office was his she recalled her encounter with mrs nettles and the way she had been shown the door the moment she mentioned her name now maisie not only had a job she enjoyed and where she was respected but shed had two other offers in the past few days she didnt give mrs nettles another thought as she walked straight past the building and continued along the quayside maisie didnt slacken her pace until she could see his home she found it hard to believe that anyone could possibly live in a railway carriage and began to wonder if shed made a dreadful mistake had harrys stories of a dining room a bedroom and even a library been exaggerated you cant stop now youve come this far maisie clifton she told herself and knocked boldly on the carriage door come in mrs clifton said a gentle voice maisie opened the door to find an old man sitting in a comfortable seat with books and other possessions scattered around him she was surprised how clean the carriage was and realized that despite stans claims it was she and not old jack who lived in third class stan had perpetuated a myth that had been ignored when viewed through the eyes of an unprejudiced child old jack immediately rose from his place and beckoned her towards the seat opposite youll have come to see me about young harry no doubt yes mr tar she replied let me guess he said you cant make up your mind whether he should go to st bedes or remain at merrywood elementary how could you possibly know that asked maisie because ive been considering the same problem for the past month said old jack so what do you think he should do i think that despite the many difficulties he will undoubtedly face at st bedes if he doesnt take this opportunity he could well spend the rest of his life regretting it perhaps he wont win a scholarship and the decision will be taken out of our hands the decision was taken out of our hands said old jack the moment mr frobisher heard young harry sing but i have a feeling that wasnt the only reason you came to see me maisie was beginning to understand why harry admired this man so much youre quite right mr tar i need your advice on another matter your son calls me jack except when hes cross with me then he calls me old jack maisie smiled ive been worried that even if he did win a scholarship i wasnt earning enough for harry to have all the little extras that the other boys at a school like st bedes take for granted but fortunately ive just been offered another job which would mean more money and youre worried about how miss tilly will react when you tell her youre thinking of leaving you know miss tilly no but harry has spoken of her many times shes clearly from the same mould as miss monday and let me assure you thats a limited edition theres no need for you to concern yourself i dont understand said maisie allow me to explain said old jack miss monday has already invested a great deal of her time and expertise in making sure that harry not only wins a scholarship to st bedes but far more important goes on to prove himself worthy of it my bet is that she will have discussed every possible eventuality with her closest friend who just happens to be miss tilly so when you tell her about the new job you may well find it doesnt come as a complete surprise thank you jack said maisie how lucky harry is to have you as a friend the father he never knew she said softly that is the nicest compliment ive received for a good many years said old jack im only sorry that he lost his father in such tragic circumstances do you know how my husband died yes i do replied old jack aware that he should never had raised the subject he quickly added but only because harry told me what did he tell you asked maisie anxiously that his father was killed in the war but you know thats not true said maisie yes i do said old jack and i suspect harry also knows his father couldnt have died in the war then why doesnt he say so he probably thinks theres something you dont want to tell him but i dont know the truth myself admitted maisie old jack didnt comment maisie walked slowly home one question answered another still unresolved even so she wasnt in any doubt that old jack could be added to the list of people who knew the truth about what had happened to her husband old jack turned out to be right about miss tilly because when maisie told her about mr framptons offer she couldnt have been more supportive and understanding well all miss you she said and frankly the royal is lucky to have you how can i begin to thank you for all youve done for me over the years said maisie its harry who should be thanking you said miss tilly and i suspect it will only be a matter of time before he realizes that maisie started her new job a month later and it didnt take her long to discover why the palm court was never more than a third full the waitresses regarded their work simply as a job unlike miss tilly who considered it to be a vocation they never bothered to remember the customers names or their favourite tables worse the coffee was often cold by the time it was served and the cakes were left to go stale until someone bought them maisie wasnt surprised they didnt get any tips they didnt deserve them after another month she began to realize just how much miss tilly had taught her after three months maisie had replaced five of the seven waitresses without having to recruit anyone from tillys she had also ordered smart new uniforms for all her staff along with new plates cups and saucers and even more important changed her coffee supplier and her cakemaker that was something she was willing to steal from miss tilly youre costing me a lot of money maisie said mr frampton when another stack of bills landed on his desk try not to forget what i said about return on investment give me another six months mr frampton and youll see the results although maisie worked night and day she always found time to drop harry off at school in the morning and pick him up in the afternoon but she warned mr frampton that there would be one day when she wouldnt be on time for work when she told him why he gave her the whole day off just before they left the house maisie checked herself in the mirror she was dressed in her sunday best but not going to church she smiled down at her son who looked so smart in his new red and black school uniform even so she felt a little selfconscious as they waited at the tram stop two to park street she told the clippie when the no pulled away she was unable to hide her pride when she noticed him taking a closer look at harry it only convinced maisie that she had made the right decision when they reached their stop harry refused to let his mum carry his suitcase maisie held on to his hand as they walked slowly up the hill towards the school not sure which one of them was more nervous she couldnt take her eyes off the hansom cabs and chauffeurdriven cars that were dropping off other boys for their first day of term she only hoped that harry would be able to find at least one friend among them after all some of the nannies were better dressed than she was harry began to slow down as they got nearer the school gates maisie could sense his discomfort or was it just fear of the unknown ill leave you now she said and bent down to kiss him good luck harry make us all proud of you goodbye mum as she watched him walk away maisie noticed that someone else appeared to be taking an interest in harry clifton maisie would never forget the first time she had to turn away a customer im sure there will be a table available in a few minutes sir she prided herself on the fact that once a customer had paid the bill her staff could clear the table replace the cloth and have it relaid and ready for the next guest within five minutes the palm court quickly became so popular that maisie had to keep a couple of tables permanently reserved just in case one of her regulars turned up unexpectedly she was a little embarrassed that some of her old customers from tillys had begun to migrate to the palm court not least dear old mr craddick who remembered harry from his paper round she considered it an even greater compliment when miss tilly herself began to drop in for a morning coffee just checking on the opposition she said by the way maisie this coffee is superb so it should be maisie replied its yours eddie atkins also came in from time to time and if the size of his cigars not to mention his waistline was anything to go by the sky must still have been the limit although he was friendly he never asked maisie out but he did regularly remind her that his door was always open not that maisie didnt have a string of admirers she occasionally allowed to take her out in the evening maybe to dinner at a fashionable restaurant sometimes a visit to the old vic or the cinema especially if a greta garbo film was playing but when they parted at the end of the evening she allowed none of them more than a peck on the cheek before returning home at least not until she met patrick casey who proved that the charm of the irish was not just a cliche when patrick first walked into the palm court hers wasnt the only head that turned to take a closer look he was a shade over six foot with wavy dark hair and the build of an athlete that would have been enough for most women but it was the smile that captivated maisie as she suspected it had many others patrick told her he was in finance but then eddie had said he was in the entertainment business his work brought him to bristol once or twice a month when maisie would allow him to take her to dinner the theatre or the cinema and occasionally she even broke her golden rule and didnt take the last tram back to still house lane she wouldnt have been surprised to discover that patrick had a wife and half a dozen offspring back at home in cork although he swore hand on heart that he was a bachelor whenever mr holcombe dropped into the palm court maisie would guide him to a table in the far corner of the room that was partly obscured by a large pillar and was shunned by her regulars but its privacy allowed her to bring him up to date on how harry was getting on today he seemed more interested in the future than the past and asked have you decided what harry will do once he leaves st bedes i havent given it much thought maisie admitted after all its not for some time its soon enough said mr holcombe and i cant believe youll want him to return to merrywood elementary no i dont said maisie firmly but what choice is there harry says hed like to go to bristol grammar school but if he fails to win a scholarship hes worried that you wont be able to afford the fees that wont be a problem maisie assured him with my present pay combined with the tips no one need know his mother is a waitress some waitress said mr holcombe looking around the packed room im only surprised you havent opened your own place maisie laughed and didnt give it another thought until she had an unexpected visit from miss tilly maisie attended matins at st mary redcliffe every sunday so she could hear her son sing miss monday had warned her that it wouldnt be much longer before harrys voice broke and she mustnt assume that a few weeks later hed be singing tenor solos maisie tried to concentrate on the canons sermon that sunday morning but found her mind drifting she glanced across the aisle to see mr and mrs barrington sitting with their son giles and two young girls who she assumed must be their daughters but whose names she didnt know maisie had been surprised when harry told her that giles barrington was his closest friend nothing more than a coincidence of the alphabet had put them together in the first place hed said she hoped it would never become necessary for her to tell him that giles might be more than just a good friend maisie often wished she could do more to help harry with his efforts to win a scholarship to bristol grammar school although miss tilly had taught her how to read a menu add and subtract and even write a few simple words just the thought of what harry must be putting himself through filled her with trepidation miss monday boosted maisies confidence by continually reminding her that harry would never have got this far if she hadnt been willing to make so many sacrifices and in any case she added youre every bit as clever as harry you just havent been given the same opportunities mr holcombe kept her informed on what he described as the timing and as the date of the examination drew nearer maisie became just as nervous as the candidate she realized the truth of one of old jacks remarks that often the onlooker suffers even more than the participant the palm court room was now packed every day but it didnt stop maisie from initiating even more changes in a decade the press were describing as the frivolous thirties in the morning she had started offering her customers a variety of biscuits to go with their coffee and in the afternoon her tea menu was proving just as popular especially after harry told her that mrs barrington had given him the choice of indian or china tea however mr frampton vetoed the suggestion that smoked salmon sandwiches should appear on the menu every sunday maisie would kneel on her little cushion her one prayer was to the point please god make sure harry wins a scholarship if he does ill never ask you for anything again with a week to go to the exams maisie found she couldnt sleep and lay awake wondering how harry was coping so many customers wanted to pass on their best wishes to him some because they had heard him singing in the church choir others because hed delivered their morning papers or simply because their own children had been were or would at some time in the future be going though the same experience it seemed to maisie that half of bristol was taking the exam on the morning of the examination maisie placed several regulars at the wrong table gave mr craddick coffee instead of his usual hot chocolate and even presented two customers with someone elses bill no one complained harry told her he thought hed done quite well but he couldnt be certain if hed done well enough he mentioned someone called thomas hardy but maisie wasnt sure if he was a friend or one of the masters when the longcase clock in the palm court room struck ten on that thursday morning maisie knew the headmaster would be posting the exam results on the school notice board but it was another twentytwo minutes before mr holcombe walked into the room and headed straight for his usual table behind the pillar maisie could not tell how harry had done from the expression on the schoolmasters face she quickly crossed the room to join him and for the first time in four years sat down in the seat opposite a customer although collapsed might be a more accurate description harry has passed with distinction said mr holcombe but im afraid he just missed out on a scholarship what does that mean maisie asked trying to stop her hands from trembling the top twelve candidates had marks of per cent or above and were all awarded open scholarships in fact harrys friend deakins came top with per cent harry achieved a very commendable per cent and came seventeenth out of three hundred mr frobisher told me his english paper let him down he should have read hardy instead of dickens said a woman whod never read a book harry will still be offered a place at bgs said mr holcombe but he wont receive the annual hundred pounds a year scholars grant maisie rose from her place then ill just have to work three shifts instead of two wont i because hes not going back to merrywood elementary mr holcombe i can tell you that over the next few days maisie was surprised by how many regulars offered their congratulations on harrys magnificent achievement she also discovered that one or two of her customers had children who had failed to pass the exam in one case by a single percentage point they would have to settle for their second choice it made maisie all the more determined that nothing would stop harry reporting to bristol grammar school on the first day of term one strange thing she noticed during the next week was that her tips doubled dear old mr craddick slipped her a fivepound note saying for harry may he prove worthy of his mother when the thin white envelope dropped through the letterbox in still house lane an event in itself harry opened the letter and read it to his mother clifton h had been offered a place in the a stream for the michaelmas term starting on september th when he came to the last paragraph which asked mrs clifton to write and confirm whether the candidate wished to accept or reject the offer he looked nervously at her you must write back straight away accepting the offer she said harry threw his arms around her and whispered i only wish my father was alive perhaps he is thought maisie a few days later a second letter landed on the doormat this one detailed a long list of items that had to be purchased before the first day of term maisie noticed that harry seemed to require two of everything in some cases three or more and in one case six socks grey calf length plus garters pity you cant borrow a pair of my suspenders she said harry blushed a third letter invited new pupils to select three extracurricular activities from a list ranging from the car club to the combined cadet force some of which involved an added charge of five pounds per activity harry chose the choir for which there was no extra charge as well as the theatre club and the arts appreciation society the latter included a proviso that any visits to galleries outside bristol would incur an extra cost maisie wished there were a few more mr craddicks around but she never allowed harry to suspect there was any reason for concern even though mr holcombe reminded her that her boy would be at bristol grammar school for the next five years the first member of the family not to leave school before the age of fourteen she told him maisie braced herself for another visit to tc marsh tailors of distinction by the time harry was fully kitted out and ready for the first day of term maisie had once again begun to walk to and from work saving five pence a week on tram fares or as she told her mother a pound a year enough to pay for a new suit for harry parents maisie had learnt over the years may be considered an unfortunate necessity by their offspring but more often than not they are also an embarrassment on her first speech day at st bedes maisie had been the only mother not wearing a hat after that she had bought one from a secondhand shop and however out of fashion it would become it was going to have to last until harry left bristol grammar school harry had agreed that she should accompany him to school on the first day of term but maisie had already decided that he was old enough to catch a tram home in the evening her main anxiety was not about how harry would get to and from school but what to do with him in the evenings now he was a day boy and would no longer be sleeping at school during term she had no doubt that if he went back to sharing a room with his uncle stan it could only end in tears she tried to put the problem out of her mind as she prepared for harrys first day in his new school hat in place best and only overcoat recently cleaned sensible black shoes with the only pair of silk stockings she possessed maisie felt ready to face the other parents when she came down the stairs harry was already waiting for her by the door he looked so smart in his new uniform of claret and black that she would have liked to parade him up and down still house lane so the neighbours would know that someone from the street was going to bristol grammar school as they had on his first day at st bedes they caught the tram but harry asked maisie if they could get off one stop before university road she was no longer allowed to hold his hand although she did straighten his cap and tie more than once when maisie first saw the noisy gathering of young men crowded around the school gates she said id better be off or ill be late for work which puzzled harry because he knew mr frampton had given her the day off she gave her son a quick hug but kept a wary eye on him as he made his way up the hill the first person to greet him was giles barrington maisie was surprised to see him as harry had told her he would probably be going to eton they shook hands like a couple of grown men who had just closed an important deal maisie could see mr and mrs barrington standing at the back of the crowd was he making sure he avoided her a few minutes later mr and mrs deakins joined them accompanied by the peloquin memorial scholar more handshakes lefthanded in mr deakinss case as the parents began to take leave of their children maisie watched mr barrington as he shook hands first with his son and then with deakins but turned away when harry offered his hand mrs barrington looked embarrassed and maisie wondered if she might later ask why hugo had ignored giless closest friend if she did maisie felt certain he would not tell her the real reason maisie feared it couldnt be long before harry asked why mr barrington always snubbed him as long as only three people knew the truth she couldnt think of any reason why harry would ever find out miss tilly had become such a regular at the palm court that she even had her own table she would usually arrive around four oclock and order a cup of tea earl grey and a cucumber sandwich she always declined to take anything from the large assortment of cream cakes jam tarts and chocolate éclairs but would occasionally allow herself a buttered scone when she popped by just before five one evening unusually late for her maisie was relieved that her usual table was free i wonder if i might sit somewhere a little more discreet today maisie i need to have a quiet word with you of course miss tilly said maisie and led her to mr holcombes preferred table behind the pillar at the far end of the room im off in ten minutes maisie told her ill join you then when her deputy susan arrived to take over maisie explained that she would be joining miss tilly for a few minutes but didnt expect to be served is the old duck unhappy about something susan asked that old duck taught me everything i know said maisie with a grin when five oclock struck maisie walked across the room and took the seat opposite miss tilly she rarely sat down with a customer and on the few occasions she did she had never felt at ease would you care for some tea maisie no thank you miss tilly i quite understand ill try not to keep you too long but before i tell you my real purpose for wanting to see you may i ask how harry is getting on i wish hed stop growing said maisie i seem to be letting down his trousers every few weeks at this rate his long trousers will be short trousers before the end of the year miss tilly laughed what about his work his endofterm report said maisie paused trying to recall the exact words a most satisfactory start very promising he came top in english somewhat ironic said miss tilly if i remember correctly that was the subject that let him down in the entrance exam maisie nodded and tried not to think about the financial consequences of harry not having read enough thomas hardy you must be very proud of him said miss tilly and when i went to st marys on sunday i was delighted to see that hes back in the choir yes but he now has to be satisfied with a place in the back row with the other baritones his days as a soloist are over but hes joined the theatre club and because there are no girls at bgs hes playing ursula in the school play much ado about nothing said miss tilly still i mustnt waste any more of your time so ill come to the reason i wanted to see you she took a sip of tea as if she wanted to compose herself before she spoke again and then it all came out in a rush ill be sixty next month my dear and for some time i have been considering retiring it had never crossed maisies mind that miss tilly wouldnt go on for ever miss monday and i have been thinking about moving down to cornwall we have our eye on a little cottage by the sea you mustnt leave bristol maisie wanted to say i love you both and if you go who will i turn to for advice matters came to a head last month continued miss tilly when a local businessman made me an offer for the tea shop it seems he wants to add it to his growing empire and although i dont care for the idea of tillys being part of a chain his offer was far too tempting to turn down out of hand maisie only had one question but she didnt interrupt while miss tilly was in full flow since then ive been giving the matter a great deal of thought and i decided that if you were able to come up with the same amount he has offered i would rather you took over the business than i hand it over to a stranger how much did he offer five hundred pounds maisie sighed im flattered you even thought of me she said at last but the truth is i dont have five hundred pennies to my name let alone five hundred pounds i was afraid you might say that said miss tilly but if you could find a backer i feel sure they would consider the business a good investment after all i made a profit of one hundred and twelve pounds and ten shillings last year which didnt include my salary i would have let you have it for less than five hundred pounds but weve found a delightful little cottage in st mawes and the owners wont consider a penny less than three hundred miss monday and i could just about survive on our savings for a year or two but as neither of us has a pension to fall back on the extra two hundred pounds will make all the difference maisie was just about to tell miss tilly how sorry she was but it was out of the question when patrick casey strolled into the room and sat down at his usual table it wasnt until after theyd made love that maisie told patrick about miss tillys offer he sat up in bed lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply raising that amount of capital shouldnt prove too difficult after all its hardly brunel trying to raise the money to build clifton suspension bridge no but it is mrs clifton trying to raise five hundred pounds when she hasnt got two halfpennies to rub together true but youd be able to show a cash flow and a proven income stream not to mention the tea shops goodwill mind you ill need to look at the books for the past five years and make sure youve been told the whole story miss tilly would never try to deceive anyone youll also have to check that there isnt a rent review due in the near future patrick said ignoring her protestations and doublecheck that her accountant hasnt come up with penalty clauses the moment you start making a profit miss tilly wouldnt do something like that said maisie youre so trusting maisie what you have to remember is this wont be in the hands of miss tilly but a lawyer who feels hes got to earn his fee and an accountant looking for a payday in case you dont retain him youve clearly never met miss tilly your faith in the old lady is touching maisie but my job is to protect people like you and a hundred and twelve pounds ten shillings profit a year wouldnt be enough for you to live on remembering youll be expected to make regular repayments to your investor miss tilly assured me that the profit didnt include her salary that might well be the case but you dont know what that salary is youll need at least another two hundred and fifty pounds a year if youre to survive otherwise not only will you be out of pocket but harry will be out of the grammar school i cant wait for you to meet miss tilly and what about tips at the royal you get per cent of all the tips which comes to at least another two hundred pounds a year which at the moment isnt taxed although ive no doubt some future government will catch on to that perhaps i should tell miss tilly that its too great a risk after all as you keep reminding me i have a guaranteed income at the royal with no risks attached true but if miss tilly is half as good as you say she is this could be an opportunity that might not arise again make your mind up patrick said maisie trying not to sound exasperated i will the moment ive seen the books you will the moment you meet miss tilly maisie said because then youll understand the real meaning of goodwill i cant wait to meet this paragon of virtue does that mean youll represent me yes he said stubbing out his cigarette and how much will you be charging this penniless widow mr casey turn the light out are you sure this is a risk worth taking asked mr frampton when you have so much to lose my financial adviser thinks so replied maisie hes assured me that not only do all the figures add up but once ive paid off the loan i should be showing a profit within five years but those are the years harry will be at bristol grammar im well aware of that mr frampton but mr casey has secured a substantial salary for me as part of the bargain and after ive split the tips with my staff i should be earning roughly the same amount im currently taking home more important in five years time ill own a real asset and from then on all the profits will be mine she said trying to recall patricks exact words its clear to me that youve made up your mind said mr frampton but let me warn you maisie theres a great deal of difference between being an employee when you know youll be taking home a wage packet every week and being an employer when it will be your responsibility to put your money into several wage packets every friday night frankly maisie you are the best at what you do but are you really sure you want to switch from being a player to joining the management mr casey will be there to advise me caseys a capable fellow ill give you that but he also has to look after more important clients right across the country it will be you who has to run the business from day to day if anything were to go wrong he wont always be around to hold your hand but i may not be given an opportunity like this again in my lifetime another of patricks pronouncements so be it maisie said frampton and dont be in any doubt how much well all miss you at the royal the only reason youre not irreplaceable is because you trained your deputy so well susan wont let you down mr frampton im sure she wont but shell never be maisie clifton let me be the first to wish you every success in your new venture and if things dont work out as planned there will always be a job for you here at the royal mr frampton rose from behind his desk and shook hands with maisie just as hed done six years before a month later maisie signed six documents in the presence of mr prendergast the manager of the national provincial bank on corn street but not until patrick had taken her through each page line by line now happy to admit how wrong hed been to doubt miss tilly if everyone behaved as honourably as she did he told her hed be out of a job maisie handed miss tilly a cheque for on march th receiving a huge hug and a tea shop in return a week later miss tilly and miss monday left for cornwall when maisie opened her doors for business the following day she retained the name tillys patrick had advised her never to underestimate the goodwill of tillys name above the door founded in and that she should not even think of changing it until miss tilly was of blessed memory and perhaps not even then regulars dont like change especially sudden ones so dont rush them into anything maisie did however spot a few changes that could be made without offending any of the regulars she felt a new set of tablecloths wouldnt go amiss and the chairs and even the tables were beginning to look well quaint and hadnt miss tilly noticed the carpet was wearing a bit thin pace yourself patrick warned her on one of his monthly visits remember that its far easier to spend money than to earn it and dont be surprised if a few of the old biddies disappear and you dont make quite as much as youd anticipated in the first few months patrick turned out to be right the number of covers dropped in the first month and then again in the second proving just how popular miss tilly had been had they fallen again in the third patrick would have been advising maisie about cash flow and overdraft limits but it bottomed another of patricks expressions and even began to climb the following month though not sharply at the end of her first year maisie had broken even but she hadnt made enough to pay back any of the banks loan dont fret my dear miss tilly told her on one of her rare visits to bristol it was years before i made a profit maisie didnt have years the second year began well with some of her regulars from the palm court returning to their old stamping ground eddie atkins had put on so much weight and his cigars were so much larger that maisie could only assume the entertainment business was thriving mr craddick appeared at eleven oclock every morning dressed in a raincoat umbrella in hand whatever the weather mr holcombe dropped in from time to time always wanting updates on how harry was getting on and she never allowed him to pay the bill patricks first stop whenever he returned to bristol was always tillys during her second year maisie had to replace one supplier who didnt seem to know the difference between fresh and stale and one waitress who wasnt convinced that the customer was always right several young women applied for the job as it was becoming more acceptable for women to go to work maisie settled on a young lady called karen who had a mop of curly fair hair big blue eyes and what the fashion magazines were describing as an hourglass figure maisie had a feeling that karen might attract some new customers who were a little younger than most of her regulars selecting a new cake supplier proved a more difficult task and although several companies tendered for the contract maisie was very demanding however when bob burrows of burrows bakery founded turned up on her doorstep and told her that tillys would be his first customer she put him on a months trial bob turned out to be hardworking and reliable and even more important his goods were always so fresh and tempting that her customers would often say well perhaps just one more his cream buns and fruit scones were particularly popular but it was his chocolate brownies the new fad that seemed to disappear from the cakestand long before midday although maisie regularly pressed him bob kept telling her that he just couldnt make any more one morning after bob had dropped off his wares maisie thought he looked a little forlorn so she sat him down and poured him a cup of coffee he confessed to her that he was suffering from the same cashflow problems shed experienced in her first year but he was confident things would soon look up as hed recently been taken on by two new shops although he stressed how much he owed to maisie for giving him his first break as the weeks passed these morning coffee breaks became something of a ritual even so maisie couldnt have been more surprised when bob asked her out on a date as she considered theirs to be a professional relationship he had bought tickets for glamorous night a new musical that was playing at the hippodrome which maisie had hoped patrick might take her to she thanked bob but said she didnt want to spoil their relationship she would have liked to add that there were already two men in her life a fifteenyearold who was worrying about his acne and an irishman who only visited bristol once a month and didnt seem to realize she was in love with him bob didnt take no for an answer and a month later maisie was even more embarrassed when he presented her with a marcasite brooch she kissed him on the cheek and wondered how hed found out it was her birthday that evening she placed the brooch in a drawer and might have forgotten all about it if other gifts hadnt followed at regular intervals patrick seemed amused by his rivals persistence and over dinner one night he reminded maisie that she was a goodlooking woman with prospects maisie didnt laugh its got to stop she said then why dont you find another supplier because good ones are a lot harder to find than lovers in any case bobs reliable his cakes are the best in town and his prices are lower than any of his competitors and hes in love with you said patrick dont tease patrick its got to stop ill tell you something far more important thats got to stop said patrick bending down and opening his briefcase may i remind you said maisie that were meant to be having a romantic candlelit dinner together not talking business im afraid this cant wait he said placing a sheaf of papers on the table these are your accounts for the past three months and they dont make happy reading but i thought you said things have been looking up so they have youve even managed to keep your outgoings within the limit recommended by the bank but inexplicably your income has dropped during the same period hows that possible said maisie we did a record number of covers last month thats why i decided to check carefully through all your bills and receipts for the past month they just dont add up ive come to the sad conclusion maisie that one of your waitresses must have her hand in the till its common enough in the catering trade it usually turns out to be the barman or the head waiter but once it starts theres no way of stopping it until you find the person responsible and sack them if you dont identify the culprit fairly soon youre going to have another year without showing a profit and you wont be able to pay back one penny of the bank loan let alone start reducing your overdraft what do you advise youll have to keep a closer eye on all your staff in future until one of them gives herself away how will i know which one it is there are several signs to look out for said patrick someone whos living beyond their means perhaps wearing a new coat or an expensive piece of jewellery or taking a holiday they wouldnt normally be able to afford shell probably tell you shes got a new boyfriend but oh hell said maisie i think i know who it might be who karen shes only been with me a few months and recently shes been going up to london on her weekends off last monday she turned up at work wearing a new scarf and a pair of leather gloves that made me feel quite envious dont jump to any conclusions said patrick but keep a close eye on her either shes pocketing the tips or shes got her hands in the till or both and one thing i can promise you it wont stop in most cases the thief becomes more and more confident until theyre finally caught you need to stop it and stop it quickly before she puts you out of business maisie hated having to spy on her staff after all shed chosen most of the younger ones herself while the older ones had been at tillys for years she kept an especially close eye on karen but there werent any obvious signs that she was stealing but then as patrick had warned her thieves are more cunning than honest people and there was no way maisie could keep an eye on her all the time and then the problem solved itself karen handed in her notice announcing that she was engaged and would be joining her fiance in london at the end of the month maisie thought her engagement ring was quite exquisite although she could only wonder whod paid for it but she dismissed the thought relieved she would now have one less problem to worry about but when patrick returned to bristol a few weeks later he warned maisie that her monthly income had dropped again so it couldnt have been karen is it time to call in the police maisie asked not yet the last thing you need are any false accusations or rumours that will only cause illfeeling among your staff the police may well flush out the thief but before they do you could lose some of your best staff who wont like being under suspicion and you can also be sure that some of the customers will find out and you dont need that how much longer can i afford to go on like this lets give it another month if we havent found out who it is by then youll have to call in the police he gave her a huge smile now lets stop talking business and try to remember that were meant to be celebrating your birthday that was two months ago she said and if it hadnt been for bob you wouldnt even have known patrick opened his briefcase once again but this time he produced a royal blue box with swans familiar logo on it he passed it across to maisie who took her time opening it to find a pair of black leather gloves and a woollen scarf in the traditional burberry pattern so youre the one whos been robbing me blind said maisie as she threw her arms around him patrick didnt respond whats the matter asked maisie i have another piece of news maisie looked into his eyes and wondered what else could possibly be going wrong at tillys ive been promoted im to be the new deputy manager of our head office in dublin ill be tied to my desk most of the time so somebody else will be taking my place over here i will still be able to visit you but not that often maisie lay in his arms and cried all night she had thought she wouldnt want to get married again until the man she loved was no longer available she turned up late for work the following morning to find bob waiting on the doorstep once shed opened the front door he began to unload the morning delivery from his van ill be with you in a moment said maisie as she disappeared into the staff washroom shed said her last goodbyes to patrick as he boarded a train at temple meads when shed burst into tears again she must have looked a sight and didnt want the regulars to think anything was wrong never bring your personal problems to work miss tilly had often reminded her staff the customers have enough problems of their own without having to worry about yours maisie looked in the mirror her makeup was a mess damn she said out loud when she realized shed left her handbag on the counter as she walked back into the shop to retrieve it she suddenly felt sick bob was standing with his back to her one hand in the till she watched as he stuffed a handful of notes and coins into a trouser pocket closed the till quietly and then went back to his van to pick up another tray of cakes maisie knew exactly what patrick would have advised she walked into the café and stood by the till as bob strolled back through the door he was not carrying a tray but a small red leather box he gave her a huge smile and fell on one knee you will leave the premises right now bob burrows maisie said in a tone that surprised even her if i ever see you anywhere near my tea shop again i will call the police she expected a stream of explanations or expletives but bob simply stood up put the money hed stolen back on the counter and left without a word maisie collapsed on to the nearest chair just as the first member of staff arrived good morning mrs clifton nice weather for the time of year whenever a thin brown envelope dropped through the letterbox at no maisie assumed it was from bristol grammar school and would probably be another bill for harrys tuition fees plus any extras as the bristol municipal charities liked to describe them she always called into the bank on the way home to deposit the days takings in the business account and her share of the tips in a separate account described as harrys hoping that at the end of each quarter she would have enough to cover the next bill from bgs maisie ripped open the envelope and although she couldnt read every word of the letter recognized the signature and above it the figures s it was going to be a closerun thing but after mr holcombe had read harrys latest report to her she had to agree with him it was proving to be a good investment mind you mr holcombe had warned her the outgoings arent going to be any less when the time comes for him to leave school why not maisie asked he shouldnt find it hard to get a job after all that education and then he can start paying his own bills mr holcombe shook his head sadly as if one of his less attentive pupils had failed to grasp a point im rather hoping that when he leaves bristol hell want to go up to oxford and read english and how long will that take asked maisie three possibly four years he should have read an awful lot of english by then certainly enough to get a job maisie laughed perhaps hell end up a schoolmaster like you hes not like me said mr holcombe if i had to guess hell end up as a writer can you make a living as a writer certainly if youre successful but if that doesnt work out you could be right he might end up a schoolmaster like me id like that maisie said missing the irony she placed the envelope in her bag when she called into the bank after work that afternoon she would have to make sure there was at least s in harrys account before she could consider writing out a cheque for the full amount only the bank makes money when youre overdrawn patrick had told her the school had occasionally given her two or three weeks grace in the past but patrick had explained that like the tea shop they would also have to balance their books at the end of each term maisie didnt have long to wait for her tram and once she had taken her seat her thoughts returned to patrick she would never admit to anyone even her mother how much she missed him her thoughts were interrupted by a fire engine overtaking the tram some of the passengers stared out of the window to follow its progress once it was out of sight maisie turned her attention to tillys since shed sacked bob burrows the bank manager had reported that the tea shop had begun to make a steady profit each month and might even break miss tillys record of s by the end of the year which would allow maisie to start paying back some of the loan there might even be enough left over to buy a new pair of shoes for harry maisie got off the tram at the end of victoria street as she made her way across bedminster bridge she checked her watch his first present and once again thought about her son seven thirtytwo she would have more than enough time to open the tea shop and be ready to serve her first customer by eight it always pleased her to find a little queue waiting on the pavement as she turned the closed sign to open just before she reached the high street another fire engine shot past and she could now see a plume of black smoke rising high into the sky but it wasnt until she turned into broad street that her heart began to beat faster the three fire engines and a police car were parked in a semicircle outside tillys maisie began to run no no it cant be tillys she shouted and then she spotted several members of her staff standing in a group on the other side of the road one of them was crying maisie was only a few yards from where the front door used to be when a policeman stepped in her path and prevented her from going any further but im the owner she protested as she stared in disbelief at the smoking embers of what had once been the most popular tea shop in the city her eyes watered and she began to cough as the thick black smoke enveloped her she stared at the charred remains of the once gleaming counter while a layer of ash covered the floor where the chairs and tables with their spotless white tablecloths had stood when shed locked up the previous evening im very sorry madam said the policeman but for your own safety i must ask you to join your staff on the other side of the road maisie turned her back on tillys and reluctantly began to cross the road before she reached the other side she saw him standing on the edge of the crowd the moment their eyes met he turned and walked away detective inspector blakemore opened his notebook and looked across the table at the suspect can you tell me where you were at around three oclock this morning mrs clifton i was at home in bed maisie replied is there anyone who can verify that if by that detective inspector you mean was anyone in bed with me at the time the answer is no why do you ask the policeman made a note which gave him a little more time to think then he said im trying to find out if anyone else was involved involved in what asked maisie arson he replied watching her carefully but who would want to burn down tillys maisie demanded i was rather hoping you might be able to assist me on that point said blakemore he paused hoping mrs clifton would add something that she would later regret but she said nothing detective inspector blakemore couldnt make up his mind if mrs clifton was a very cool customer or simply naive he knew one person who would be able to answer that question mr frampton rose from behind his desk shook hands with maisie and motioned her towards a chair i was so sorry to hear about the fire at tillys he said thank god no one was hurt maisie hadnt been thanking god a lot lately i do hope the building and contents were comprehensively insured he added oh yes said maisie thanks to mr casey it was well covered but unfortunately the insurance company is refusing to pay out a penny until the police can confirm that i was not involved i cant believe the police think youre a suspect said frampton with my financial problems said maisie who can blame them it will only be a matter of time before they work out thats a ridiculous suggestion i dont have any time said maisie which is why ive come to see you ive got to find a job and when we last met in this room i recall you saying that if i ever wanted to come back to the royal and i meant it interrupted mr frampton but i cant give you your old position back because susans doing an excellent job and ive recently taken on three of tillys staff so i dont have any vacancies in the palm court the only position i have available at the moment is hardly worthy ill consider anything mr frampton said maisie and i mean anything some of our customers have been telling us that they would like something to eat after the hotel restaurant has closed for the night said mr frampton ive been considering introducing a limited service of coffee and sandwiches after ten oclock which would be available until the breakfast room opens at six am i could only offer you three pounds a week to begin with although of course all the tips would be yours naturally id understand if you felt ill take it when would you be able to start tonight when the next brown envelope landed on the mat at no maisie stuffed it in her bag unopened and wondered how long it would be before she received a second perhaps a third and then finally a thick white envelope containing a letter not from the bursar but the headmaster requesting that mrs clifton withdraw her son from the school at the end of term she dreaded the moment when harry would have to read that letter to her in september harry was expecting to enter the sixth form and he couldnt hide the excitement in his eyes whenever he talked about going up to oxford and reading english at the feet of alan quilter one of the most prominent scholars of the day maisie couldnt bear the thought of having to tell him that would no longer be possible her first few nights at the royal had been very quiet and things didnt get much busier during the following month she hated being idle and when the cleaning staff arrived at five in the morning they would often discover there was nothing for them to do in the palm court room even on her busiest night maisie didnt have more than half a dozen customers and several of those had been turfed out of the hotel bar just after midnight and seemed more interested in propositioning her than in ordering coffee and a ham sandwich most of her customers were commercial travellers who only booked in for one night so her chances of building up a regular clientele didnt look promising and the tips were certainly not going to take care of the brown envelope that remained unopened in her handbag maisie knew that if harry was to remain at bristol grammar school and have the slightest chance of going up to oxford there was only one person she could turn to for help she would beg if necessary what makes you think mr hugo would be willing to help asked old jack leaning back in his seat hes never shown any sign of caring about harry in the past on the contrary because if theres one person on earth who ought to feel some responsibility for harrys future its that man maisie immediately regretted her words old jack was silent for a moment before he asked is there something youre not telling me maisie no she replied a little too quickly she hated lying especially to old jack but she was determined that this was one secret she would take to her grave have you given any thought to when and where you will confront mr hugo i know exactly what im going to do he rarely leaves his office before six in the evening and by then most of the other staff in the building have already left for the night i know his office is on the fifth floor i know its the third door on the left i know but do you know about miss potts interrupted old jack even if you did manage to get past reception and somehow made it to the fifth floor unnoticed theres no way of avoiding her miss potts ive never heard of her shes been mr hugos private secretary for the past fifteen years i can tell you from personal experience you dont need a guard dog if youve got miss potts as a secretary then ill just have to wait until she goes home miss potts never goes home before the boss and shes always behind her desk thirty minutes before he arrives in the morning but ill have even less chance of getting into the manor house said maisie where they have a guard dog too hes called jenkins then youll have to find a time and place when mr hugo will be on his own cant escape and cant rely on miss potts or jenkins to come to his rescue is there such a time and place asked maisie oh yes said old jack but youll have to get your timing right maisie waited until it was dark before she slipped out of old jacks railway carriage she tiptoed across the gravel path eased open the back door climbed in and shut it behind her resigned to a long wait she settled herself down on the comfortable leather seat she had a clear view of the building through a side window maisie waited patiently for each light to go out old jack had warned her that his would be among the last she used the time to go over the questions she planned to ask him questions shed rehearsed for several days before trying them out on old jack that afternoon hed made several suggestions which shed happily agreed to just after six a rollsroyce drew up and parked outside the front of the building a chauffeur got out and stationed himself alongside a few moments later sir walter barrington the chairman of the company marched out of the front door climbed into the back of the car and was whisked away more and more lights went out until finally only one was still aglow like a single star on the top of a christmas tree suddenly maisie heard feet crunching across the gravel she slipped off the seat and crouched down on the floor she could hear two men deep in conversation heading towards her her plan didnt include two men and she was about to leap out of the other side and try to disappear into the night when they came to a halt but despite that said a voice she recognized id be obliged if my involvement could remain strictly between the two of us of course sir you can rely on me said another voice shed heard before although she couldnt remember where lets keep in touch old fellow said the first voice i have no doubt ill be calling on the banks services again maisie heard one set of footsteps moving away she froze when the car door opened he got in took his place behind the wheel and pulled the door closed doesnt have a chauffeur prefers to drive the bugatti himself fancies himself behind the wheel all priceless pieces of information supplied by old jack he switched on the ignition and the vehicle shuddered into life he revved the engine several times before crunching the gear lever into first the man on the gate saluted as mr barrington drove out on to the main road and headed towards the city just as he did every night on his way back to the manor house dont let him know youre in the back until hes reached the city centre old jack had advised he wont risk stopping there because hell be afraid someone might see you together and recognize him but once he reaches the outskirts of the city he wont hesitate to chuck you out youll have ten to fifteen minutes at most thats all ill need maisie had told him maisie waited until hed driven past the cathedral and across college green which was always busy at that time of night but just as she was about to sit up and tap him on the shoulder the car began to slow down and then came to a halt the door opened he got out the door closed maisie peered between the front seats and was horrified to see that he had parked outside the royal hotel a dozen thoughts flashed through her mind should she jump out before it was too late why was he visiting the royal was it a coincidence that it was on her day off how long did he plan to be there she decided to stay put fearing she would be spotted if she got out in such a public place besides this could well be her last chance to confront him face to face before the bill had to be paid the answer to one of her questions turned out to be twenty minutes but long before he got back into the drivers seat and drove off maisie was in a cold sweat she had no idea her heart could beat that fast she waited until he had gone about half a mile before she sat up and tapped him on the shoulder he looked shocked as he turned round which was followed by a look of recognition and then realization what do you want he demanded recovering slightly i have a feeling you know exactly what i want said maisie my only interest is harry and making sure his school fees are paid for the next two years give me one good reason why i should pay your sons school fees because hes your son maisie replied calmly and what makes you so sure of that i watched you when you first saw him at st bedes said maisie and every sunday at st marys when he sang in the choir i saw the look in your eyes then and i saw it again when you refused to shake hands with him on the first day of term thats not proof said barrington sounding a little more confident its nothing more than a womans intuition then perhaps the time has come to let another woman know what you get up to on a works outing what makes you think shed believe you nothing more than a womans intuition said maisie this silenced him and gave her the confidence to continue mrs barrington might also be interested to know why you went to so much trouble to have my brother arrested the day after arthur disappeared a coincidence nothing more and is it also just a coincidence that my husband has never been seen since i had nothing to do with cliftons death shouted barrington as he swerved across the road narrowly missing an oncoming vehicle maisie sat bolt upright stunned by what shed heard so it was you who was responsible for my husbands death you have no proof of that he said defiantly i dont need any more proof but in spite of all the damage youve done to my family over the years ill still give you an easy way out you take care of harrys education while hes still at bristol grammar school and i wont bother you again it was some time before barrington responded he eventually said ill need a few days to work out the best way to handle the payments the companys charitable trust could easily take care of such a small amount said maisie after all your father is chairman of the governors this time he didnt have a ready response was he wondering how shed come across that piece of information he wasnt the first person to underestimate old jack maisie opened her handbag pulled out the thin brown envelope and placed it on the seat beside him the car swung into an unlit alley barrington jumped out and opened the back door maisie stepped out feeling that the confrontation couldnt have gone much better as her feet touched the ground he grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her violently now you listen to me maisie clifton and listen carefully he said a look of fury in his eyes if you ever threaten me again ill not only see that your brother is sacked but ill make sure he never works in this city again and if youre ever foolish enough to even hint to my wife that im that boys father ill have you arrested and it wont be a prison youll end up in but a mental asylum he let go of her clenched a fist and then punched her full in the face she collapsed on to the ground and curled up into a ball expecting him to kick her again and again when nothing happened she looked up to see him standing over her he was tearing the thin brown envelope into little pieces and scattering them like confetti over a bride without another word he jumped back into the car and sped away when the white envelope came through the letterbox maisie knew she was beaten she would have to tell harry the truth when he got back from school that afternoon but first she had to drop into the bank deposit her meagre tips from the previous evening and tell mr prendergast there would be no more bills from bgs as her son would be leaving at the end of term she decided to walk to the bank and save a penny on the tram fare on the way she thought about all the people shed let down would miss tilly and miss monday ever forgive her several of her staff particularly some of the older ones hadnt been able to find another job then there were her parents who had always watched over harry so that she could go to work old jack who couldnt have done more to help her son and most of all harry himself who in the words of mr holcombe was about to be crowned with the laurels of victory when she reached the bank she joined the longest queue as she was in no hurry to be served good morning mrs clifton said the teller cheerfully when she eventually reached the front of the line good morning maisie replied before placing four shillings and sixpence on the counter the teller checked the amount carefully then placed the coins in different trays below the counter he next wrote out a slip to confirm the sum mrs clifton had deposited and handed it to her maisie stood to one side to allow the next customer to take her place while she put the slip in her bag mrs clifton said the teller yes she said looking back up the manager was hoping to have a word with you i quite understand she said maisie didnt need him to tell her there wasnt enough money in her account to cover the latest invoice from the school in fact it would be a relief to let mr prendergast know there would be no further bills for extracurricular activities the young man led her silently across the banking hall and down a long corridor when he reached the managers office he knocked gently on the door opened it and said mrs clifton sir ah yes said mr prendergast i do need to have a word with you mrs clifton please come in where had she heard that voice before mrs clifton he continued once she was seated i am sorry to have to inform you that we have been unable to honour your most recent cheque for thirtyseven pounds ten shillings made payable to bristol municipal charities were you to present it again i fear there are still insufficient funds in your account to cover the full amount unless of course you anticipate depositing any further funds in the near future no said maisie taking the white envelope from her bag and placing it on the desk in front of him perhaps you would be kind enough to let the bmc know that given time i will pay off any other expenses that have arisen during harrys last term im very sorry mrs clifton said mr prendergast i only wish i could help in some way he picked up the white envelope may i open this he asked yes of course said maisie who until that moment had tried to avoid finding out just how much she still owed the school mr prendergast picked up a thin silver paperknife from his desk and slit open the envelope he extracted a cheque from the bristol and west of england insurance company to the value of six hundred pounds made payable to mrs maisie clifton hugo barrington i wouldnt even have remembered her name if she hadnt later accused me of killing her husband it all began when my father insisted i accompany the workers on their annual outing to westonsupermare good for their morale to see the chairmans son taking an interest he said i wasnt convinced and quite frankly considered the whole exercise a waste of time but once my father has made up his mind about anything there is no point arguing and it would have been a waste of time if maisie such a common name hadnt come along for the ride even i was surprised to find how eager she was to jump into bed with the bosss son i assumed that once we were back in bristol id never hear from her again perhaps i wouldnt have if she hadnt married arthur clifton i was sitting at my desk going over the tender for the maple leaf checking and rechecking the figures hoping to find some way the company might save a little money but however hard i tried the bottom line didnt make good reading it didnt help that it had been my decision to tender for the contract my opposite number at myson had driven a hard bargain and after several delays i hadnt budgeted for we were running five months behind schedule with penalty clauses that would be triggered should we fail to complete the build by december th what had originally looked like a dream contract that would show a handsome profit was turning into a nightmare where we would wake up on december th with heavy losses my father had been against barringtons taking on the contract in the first place and had made his views clear we should stick to what were good at he repeated from the chair at every board meeting for the past hundred years barringtons shipping line has transported goods to and from the far corners of the earth leaving our rivals in belfast liverpool and newcastle to build ships i knew i wouldnt be able to sway him so i spent my time trying to persuade the younger members of the board that we had missed out on several opportunities in recent years while others had snapped up lucrative contracts that could easily have come our way i finally convinced them by a slim majority to dip a toe in the water and sign up with myson to build them a cargo vessel to add to their fastgrowing fleet if we do a good job and deliver the maple leaf on time i told the board more contracts are sure to follow lets hope we dont live to regret it was my fathers only comment after hed lost the vote at the board meeting i was already regretting it although the barrington line was predicting record profits for it was beginning to look as if its new subsidiary barrington shipbuilding would be the only red entry on the annual balance sheet some members of the board were already distancing themselves from the decision while reminding everyone that they had voted with my father i had only recently been appointed managing director of the company and i could just imagine what was being said behind my back chip off the old block clearly wasnt on anyones lips one director had already resigned and couldnt have made his views more clear when he departed warning my father the boy lacks judgement be careful he doesnt end up bankrupting the company but i hadnt given up i remained convinced that as long as we finished the job on time we could still break even and possibly make a small profit so much depended on what happened during the next few weeks id already given the order to work round the clock in three eighthour shifts and promised the workforce handsome bonuses if they managed to complete the contract on time after all there were enough men hanging around outside the gates desperate for work i was just about to tell my secretary i was going home when he burst into my office unannounced he was a short squat man with heavy shoulders and bulging muscles the build of a stevedore my first thought was to wonder how he had managed to get past miss potts who followed in his wake looking unusually flustered i couldnt stop him she said stating the obvious shall i call the watchman i looked into the mans eyes and said no miss potts remained by the door while we sized each other up like a mongoose and a snake each wondering who would strike first then the man reluctantly removed his cap and started jabbering it was some time before i could understand what he was saying my best mates goin to die arthur cliftons goin to die unless you do somethin about it i told him to calm down and explain what the problem was when my works manager came charging into the room im sorry youve been troubled by tancock sir he said once hed caught his breath but i can assure you its all under control nothin for you to worry about what is all under control i asked tancock here claims that his mate clifton was workin inside the hull when the shift changed and the new shift somehow managed to seal him inside come and see for yourself shouted tancock you can hear him tappin could that be possible haskins i asked anythings possible sir but its more likely cliftons buggered off for the day and is already in the pub then why hasnt he signed off at the gate demanded tancock nothing unusual in that sir said haskins not looking at him signin ons what matters not signin off if you dont come and see for yourself said tancock youll go to your grave with his blood on your hands this outburst silenced even haskins miss potts im going down to number one dock i said i shouldnt be too long the squat little man ran out of my office without another word haskins join me in my car i said we can discuss what ought to be done on the way nothin needs to be done sir he insisted its all stuff and nonsense it wasnt until we were alone in the car that i put it bluntly to my ganger is there any chance that clifton really might be sealed up in the hull no chance sir said haskins firmly im only sorry to be wastin your time but the man seems pretty certain i said like hes always certain about whatll win the three thirty at chepstow i didnt laugh cliftons shift ended at six haskins continued taking on a more serious tone he mustve known that the welders would be moving in and would expect to finish the job before the next shift reported for duty at two in the mornin what was clifton doing down in the hull in the first place making the final checks before the welders got to work is it possible he didnt realize his shift had ended you can hear the endofshift horn in the middle of bristol said haskins as we drove past tancock who was running like a man possessed even if you were deep inside the hull i suppose its just possible he might not have heard it if he was in the double bottom but ive never come across a docker who didnt know what time his shift ends as long as he has a watch i said looking to see if haskins was wearing one he wasnt if clifton really is still down there do we have the equipment to get him out weve got enough acetylene torches to burn through the hull and remove a complete section problem is itd take hours and if cliftons down there there wouldnt be much chance of him still bein alive by the time we reached him on top of that it would take the men another fortnight perhaps longer to replace the whole section and as you keep remindin me guv youve got everyone on bonuses to save time not waste it the night shift was well into its second hour by the time i brought my car to a halt by the side of the ship there must have been over a hundred men on board working flat out hammering welding and sealing in the rivets as i climbed the gangway i could see tancock running towards the ship when he caught up with me a few moments later he had to bend double his hands on his thighs while he recovered so what do you expect me to do tancock i asked once hed caught his breath stop them all workin guv just for a few minutes then youll hear him tappin i nodded my approval haskins shrugged his shoulders clearly unable to believe i would even consider giving such an order it took him several minutes to get everyone to down tools and for the workers to fall silent every man on the ship as well as the dockside stood still and listened intently but other than the occasional squawk from a passing gull or a smokers cough i heard nothing like i said sir its been a waste of everyones time said haskins by now clifton will be suppin his third pint at the pig and whistle someone dropped a hammer and the sound echoed around the docks then for a moment just a moment i thought i heard a different sound regular and soft thats him shouted tancock and then as suddenly as it had started the noise stopped did anyone else hear anything i shouted i didnt hear nothin said haskins looking around at the men almost daring them to defy him some of them stared back at him while one or two picked up their hammers menacingly as if they were waiting for someone to lead them over the top i felt like a captain who was being given one last chance to quell a mutiny either way i couldnt win if i told the men to go back to work the rumours would spread until every man in the dockyard believed i was personally responsible for cliftons death it would be weeks months possibly even years before i could recover my authority but if i gave the order to break open the hull any hope of making a profit on the contract would be scuppered and with it my chances of ever becoming chairman of the board i just stood there hoping the continued silence would convince the men that tancock was wrong as each second of silence passed my confidence grew it seems no one heard nothin sir haskins said a few moments later can i have your permission to put the men back to work they didnt move a muscle just continued to glare defiantly at me haskins stared back at them and one or two eventually lowered their eyes i turned to the ganger and gave the order to get back to work in the moments silence that followed i could have sworn i heard a tap i glanced at tancock but then the sound was drowned out by a thousand other noises as the men went resentfully back to work tancock why dont you bugger off down the pub and see if your mates there said haskins and when you find him give him a tickin off for wastin everybodys time and if he isnt i said call by his house and ask his wife if shes seen him i realized my mistake the moment id spoken and quickly added that is assuming he has a wife yes guv he does said tancock shes my sister if you still cant find him report back to me itll be too late by then said tancock as he turned and walked off his shoulders slumped ill be in my office should you need me haskins i said before walking down the gangway i drove back to barrington house hoping never to see tancock again i returned to my desk but was unable to concentrate on the letters miss potts had left for me to sign i could still hear that tapping in my head repeating itself again and again like a popular melody that plays continually in your mind and even stops you from sleeping i knew that if clifton didnt report for work the next morning i would never be rid of it during the next hour i began to feel more confident that tancock must have found his mate and would now be regretting making such a fool of himself it was one of the rare occasions when miss potts left the office before me and i was just locking the top drawer of my desk before going home when i heard footsteps running up the stairs it could only be one man i looked up and the man id hoped never to see again was standing in the doorway pentup fury blazing in his eyes you killed my best mate you bastard he said shaking a fist you may as well have murdered him with your bare hands now steady on tancock old chap i said for all we know clifton may still be alive hes gone to his grave just so you could finish your bloody job on time no man will ever sail on that ship once they find out the truth men die in shipbuilding accidents every day i said lamely tancock took a pace towards me he was so angry that for a moment i thought he was going to hit me but he just stood there feet apart fists clenched glaring at me when ive told the police what i know youll have to admit you couldve saved his life with a single word but because you were only interested in how much money you would make im going to make sure that no man on these docks will ever work for you again i knew if the police did become involved half of bristol would think clifton was still inside that hull and the union would demand it was opened up if that happened i wasnt in any doubt what theyd find i rose slowly from my chair and walked across to the safe on the far side of the room i entered the code turned the key pulled open the door and extracted a thick white envelope before returning to my desk i picked up a silver letter opener slit open the envelope and took out a fivepound note i even wondered whether tancock had ever seen one before i placed it on the blotting pad in front of him and watched his piggy eyes grow larger by the second nothing is going to bring back your friend i said placing a second note on top of the first his eyes never left the money and anyway who knows he might just have done a bunk for a few days that wouldnt be considered unusual in his line of work i placed a third note on top of the second and when he comes back your mates will never let you forget it a fourth note was followed by a fifth and you wouldnt want to be charged with wasting the polices time would you thats a serious offence for which you can go to jail two more notes and of course youd also lose your job he looked up at me his anger visibly turning to fear three more notes i could hardly be expected to employ a man who was accusing me of murder i placed the last two notes on top of the pile the envelope was empty tancock turned away i took out my wallet and added one more fivepound note three pounds and ten shillings to the pile s in all his eyes returned to the notes theres plenty more where that came from i said hoping i sounded convincing tancock walked slowly towards my desk and without looking at me gathered up the notes stuffed them into his pocket and left without a word i went to the window and watched as he walked out of the building and headed slowly for the dock gate i left the safe wide open scattered some of its contents on the floor dropped the empty envelope on my desk and left my office without locking up i was the last person to leave the building detective inspector blakemore sir said miss potts then stood aside to allow the policeman to enter the managing directors office hugo barrington studied the inspector carefully as he entered the room he couldnt have been much more than the regulation minimum height of five feet nine inches and he was a few pounds overweight but still looked fit he was carrying a raincoat that had probably been bought when he was still a constable and wore a brown felt hat of a more recent vintage indicating that he hadnt been an inspector all that long the two men shook hands and once he was seated blakemore took a notebook and pen out of an inside jacket pocket as you know sir i am following up enquiries concerning an alleged theft that took place on these premises last night barrington didnt like the word alleged could i begin by asking when you first discovered that the money was missing yes of course inspector said barrington trying to sound as helpful as possible i arrived at the docks around seven oclock this morning and drove straight to the sheds to check how the night shift had got on is that something you do every morning no only from time to time said hugo puzzled by the question and how long did you spend there twenty perhaps thirty minutes then i came up to my office so you would have been in your office at around seven twenty seven thirty at the latest yes that sounds about right and was your secretary already here by then yes she was i rarely manage to get in before her shes a formidable lady he added with a smile quite said the detective inspector so it was miss potts who told you the safe had been broken into yes she said that when she came in this morning shed found the safe door open and some of its contents scattered on the floor so she immediately rang the police she didnt ring you first sir no inspector i would have been in my car on the way to work at that time so you say your secretary arrived before you this morning and did you leave before her last night sir i dont recall said barrington but it would be most unusual for me to leave after her yes miss potts has confirmed that said the detective inspector but she also said he glanced down at his notebook i left before mr barrington last night as a problem had arisen which needed his attention blakemore looked up are you able to tell me what that problem was sir when you run a company as large as this said hugo problems arise all the time so you dont remember what particular problem arose yesterday evening no inspector i do not when you arrived in your office this morning and found the safe door open what was the first thing you did i checked to see what was missing and what did you discover all my cash had been taken how can you be sure it had all been taken because i found this open envelope on my desk hugo said handing it over and how much should there have been in the envelope sir sixtyeight pounds and ten shillings you seem very certain of that yes i am said hugo why should that surprise you its simply that miss potts told me there was only sixty pounds in the safe all in fivepound notes perhaps you could tell me sir where the other eight pounds and ten shillings came from hugo didnt answer immediately i do sometimes keep a little loose change in my desk drawer inspector he said finally thats quite a large sum to describe as a little loose change however allow me to return to the safe for a moment when you entered your office this morning the first thing you noticed was that the safe door was open that is correct inspector do you have a key for the safe yes of course are you the only person who knows the code and is in possession of a key sir no miss potts also has access to the safe can you confirm that the safe was locked when you went home last night yes it always is then we must assume that the burglary was carried out by a professional what makes you say that inspector asked barrington but if he was a professional said blakemore ignoring the question what puzzles me is why he left the safe door open im not sure im following you inspector ill explain sir professional burglars tend to leave everything just as they found it so that their crime wont be found out immediately it allows them more time to dispose of the stolen goods more time repeated hugo a professional would have closed the safe door and taken the envelope with him making it more likely that it would be some time before you discovered anything was missing in my experience some people dont open their safes for days even weeks only an amateur would have left your office in such disarray then perhaps it was an amateur then how did he manage to open the safe sir maybe he somehow got hold of miss pottss key and the code as well but miss potts assures me that she takes her safe key home every night as i understand you do sir hugo said nothing may i be allowed to look inside the safe yes of course what is that asked the inspector pointing to a tin box on the bottom shelf of the safe its my coin collection inspector a hobby of mine would you be kind enough to open it sir is that really necessary asked hugo impatiently yes im afraid it is sir hugo reluctantly opened the box to reveal a hoard of gold coins he had collected over many years now heres another mystery said the inspector our thief takes sixty pounds from the safe and eight pounds ten shillings from your desk drawer but leaves behind a box of gold coins that must be worth considerably more and then theres the problem of the envelope the envelope said hugo yes sir the envelope you say contained the money but i found it on my desk this morning i dont doubt that sir but you will notice that it has been slit neatly open probably with my letter opener said hugo holding it up triumphantly quite possibly sir but in my experience burglars have a tendency to rip open envelopes not slit them neatly with a letter opener as if they already knew what was inside but miss potts told me that youd found the thief said hugo trying not to sound exasperated no sir we have found the money but im not convinced that weve found the guilty party but you found some of the money in his possession yes we did sir then what more do you want to be certain weve got the right man and who is the man youve charged i didnt say id charged him sir said the inspector as he turned a page in his notebook a mr stanley tancock who turns out to be one of your stevedores name ring a bell sir cant say it does said hugo but if he works in the yard he would certainly have known where my office was i am in no doubt sir that tancock knew where your office was because he says he came to see you around seven yesterday evening to tell you that his brotherinlaw a mr arthur clifton was trapped in the hull of a ship being built in the yard and if you didnt give the order to get him out he would die ah yes i remember now i did go over to the yard yesterday afternoon as my ganger will confirm but it turned out to be a false alarm and a waste of everyones time clearly he just wanted to find out where the safe was so he could come back later and rob me he admits that he came back to your office a second time said blakemore turning another page of his notes when he claims you offered him sixtyeight pounds and ten shillings if he would keep his mouth shut about clifton ive never heard such an outrageous suggestion then let us consider the alternative for a moment sir let us suppose that tancock did come back to your office with the intention of robbing you some time between seven oclock and seven thirty yesterday evening having somehow managed to get into the building unobserved he reaches the fifth floor makes his way to your office and with either your key or miss pottss unlocks the safe enters the code removes the envelope slits it neatly open and takes out the money but doesnt bother with a box of gold coins he leaves the safe door open spreads some of its contents on the floor and places the neatly opened envelope on your desk and then like the scarlet pimpernel disappears into thin air it neednt have been between seven and seven thirty in the evening said hugo defiantly it could have been any time before eight this morning i think not sir said blakemore you see tancock has an alibi between eight and eleven oclock last night no doubt this socalled alibi is some mate of his said barrington thirtyone of them at the last count said the detective inspector it seems that having stolen your money he turned up at the pig and whistle public house at around eight oclock and not only were the drinks on him but he also cleared his slate he paid the landlord with a new fivepound note which i have in my possession the detective removed his wallet took out the note and placed it on barringtons desk the landlord also added that tancock left the pub at around eleven and was so drunk that two of his friends had to accompany him to his home in still house lane where we found him this morning i am bound to say sir that if it was tancock who robbed you we have a master criminal on our hands and id be proud to be the man who puts him behind bars which i suspect is exactly what you had in mind sir he added looking directly at barrington when you gave him the money and why on earth would i do that said hugo trying to keep his voice even because if stanley tancock was arrested and sent to jail no one would take his story about arthur clifton seriously incidentally clifton hasnt been seen since yesterday afternoon so i shall be recommending to my superiors that the hull be opened up without further delay so that we can discover if it was a false alarm and tancock was wasting everyones time hugo barrington checked in the mirror and straightened his bow tie he hadnt told his father about the arthur clifton incident or the visit from detective inspector blakemore the less the old man knew the better all hed said was that some money had been stolen from his office and one of the stevedores had been arrested once hed put on his dinner jacket hugo sat on the end of the bed and waited for his wife to finish dressing he hated being late but he knew that no amount of badgering would make elizabeth move any faster hed checked on giles and his baby sister emma who were both fast asleep hugo had wanted two sons an heir and a spare emma was an inconvenience which meant hed have to try again his father had been a second child and lost his older brother fighting the boers in south africa hugos older brother had been killed at ypres along with half his regiment so in time hugo could expect to succeed his father as chairman of the company and when his father died to inherit the title and the family fortune so he and elizabeth would have to try again not that making love to his wife was a pleasure any more in fact he couldnt remember if it ever had been recently hed been looking for distractions elsewhere yours is a marriage made in heaven his mother used to say his father was more practical he had felt that bringing together his elder son and the only daughter of lord harvey was more of a merger than a marriage when hugos brother was killed on the western front his fiancée was passed on to hugo no longer a merger more of a takeover hugo wasnt surprised to discover on his wedding night that elizabeth was a virgin his second virgin in fact elizabeth finally emerged from the dressing room apologizing as she always did for keeping him waiting the journey from the manor house to barrington hall was only a couple of miles and all the land in between the two houses belonged to the family by the time hugo and elizabeth entered his parents drawing room at a few minutes past eight lord harvey was already on his second sherry hugo glanced around the room at the other guests there was only one couple he didnt recognize his father immediately took him across and introduced him to colonel danvers the recently appointed chief constable of the county hugo decided not to mention his meeting that morning with detective inspector blakemore to the colonel but just before they sat down for dinner he took his father on one side to bring him up to date on the theft never once mentioning the name of arthur clifton over a dinner of game soup succulent lamb and green beans followed by crème brûlée the conversation ranged from the prince of waless visit to cardiff and his less than helpful remarks about sympathizing with the mine workers to lloyd georges latest import tariffs and the effect they would have on the shipping industry and george bernard shaws heartbreak house which had recently opened to mixed reviews at the old vic theatre before returning to the prince of wales and the vexed question of how to find him a suitable wife when the servants had cleared the table after dessert the ladies retired to the drawing room to enjoy coffee while the butler offered the gentlemen brandy or port shipped by me and imported by you said sir walter raising a glass to lord harvey while the butler circled the table offering cigars to the guests once lord harveys romeo y julieta had been lit to his satisfaction he turned to his soninlaw and said your father tells me that some blighter broke into your office and stole a large amount of cash yes thats correct hugo replied but im pleased to say theyve caught the thief sadly he turned out to be one of our stevedores is that right danvers asked sir walter youve caught the man i did hear something about it responded the chief constable but i wasnt told that anybody had been charged yet why not demanded lord harvey because the man is saying that i gave him the money hugo interjected in fact when the detective inspector questioned me this morning i began to wonder which one of us was the criminal and which the injured party im sorry to hear you feel that way said colonel danvers may i ask who the officer in charge of the investigation was detective inspector blakemore said hugo before adding i got the impression he might have a grudge against our family when you employ as many people as we do said sir walter placing his glass back on the table theres bound to be the odd person who bears a grudge i must admit said danvers that blakemores not known for his tact but ill look into the matter and if i feel hes overstepped the mark ill assign someone else to the case schooldays are the happiest days of your life claimed rc sherriff but that had not been hugo barringtons experience although he had a feeling that giles would as his father put it make a better fist of things hugo tried to forget what had happened on his first day at school some twentyfour years ago hed been driven to st bedes in a hansom carriage accompanied by his father mother and elder brother nicholas who had just been appointed school captain hugo had burst into tears when another new bug had innocently asked is it true your grandfather was a docker sir walter was proud his father had pulled himself up by his bootstraps but with eightyearolds first impressions stick grandpa was a docker grandpa was a docker cry baby cry baby chanted the rest of the dorm today his son giles would be driven to st bedes in sir walter barringtons rollsroyce hugo had wanted to take his son to school in his own car but his father wouldnt hear of it three generations of barringtons have been educated at st bedes and eton my heir must arrive in style hugo didnt point out to his father that giles hadnt as yet been offered a place at eton and that it was even possible the boy might have ideas of his own as to where he would like to be educated heaven forbid he could hear his father saying ideas smack of rebellion and rebellions must be put down giles hadnt spoken since theyd left the house although his mother hadnt stopped fussing over her only son for the past hour emma had started to sob when she was told she couldnt accompany them while grace another girl he wouldnt bother to try again just clung on to nannys hand and waved from the top step as they drove away hugo had other things than the familys female line on his mind as the car manoeuvred its way slowly through the country lanes towards the city was he about to see harry clifton for the first time would he recognize him as the other son hed wanted but would never have or would he be left in no doubt the moment he saw the boy that he couldnt be his kinsman hugo would have to be careful to avoid cliftons mother would he even recognize her hed recently discovered that she was working as a waitress in the palm court room at the royal hotel which he used to frequent whenever he had business meetings in the city now he would have to confine himself to the occasional visit in the evening and then only if he was certain shed left for the day maisies brother stan tancock had been released from prison after serving eighteen months of his threeyear sentence hugo never did find out what had happened to detective inspector blakemore but he never saw the man again following his fathers dinner party a young detective sergeant gave evidence at tancocks trial and he clearly wasnt in any doubt who the guilty party was once tancock was safely behind bars speculation about what had happened to arthur clifton quickly dried up in a business where death is commonplace arthur clifton became just another statistic however when lady harvey launched the maple leaf six months later hugo couldnt help thinking that davy joness locker would have been a more appropriate name for the vessel when the final figures were presented to the board barringtons ended up showing a loss of on the project hugo didnt suggest that they tender for any more shipbuilding contracts in the future and sir walter never referred to the subject again in the years that followed barringtons returned to its traditional business as a shipping line and continued to go from strength to strength after stan had been carted off to the local prison hugo had assumed that would be the last he heard of him but shortly before tancock was due to be released the deputy governor of hmp bristol rang miss potts and asked for an appointment when they met the deputy governor pleaded with barrington to give tancock his old job back otherwise he would have little hope of ever being employed again at first hugo was delighted to hear this piece of news but after giving the matter some thought changed his mind and dispatched phil haskins his chief ganger to visit tancock in prison and tell him he could have his job back on one condition he was never to mention the name of arthur clifton again if he did he could collect his cards and look for work elsewhere tancock had accepted the offer gratefully and as the years passed it became clear that he had kept his side of the bargain the rollsroyce drew up outside the front gate of st bedes and the chauffeur leapt out to open the back door several pairs of eyes turned to look in their direction some with admiration others with envy giles clearly didnt enjoy the attention and quickly walked away disowning the chauffeur as well as his parents his mother chased after him bent down and pulled his socks up before giving his fingernails one last inspection hugo spent his time looking into the faces of countless children wondering if he would instantly recognize someone hed never seen before and then he saw a boy walking up the hill unaccompanied by a mother or father he looked past the boy to see a woman watching him a woman he could never forget both of them must have been wondering if he had one son or two reporting for their first day at st bedes when giles caught chicken pox and had to spend a few days in the sanatorium his father realized this might be his chance to prove that harry clifton wasnt his son he didnt tell elizabeth he was going to visit giles while he was in the san as he didnt want her around when he asked matron a seemingly innocuous question once hed dealt with the morning post hugo told miss potts that he would be popping into st bedes to see his son and she shouldnt expect him back for at least a couple of hours he drove into the city and parked outside frobisher house he remembered only too well where the san was as hed had to visit it regularly when he was at st bedes giles was sitting up in bed having his temperature taken when his father strode into the room the boys face lit up the moment he saw him matron was standing by the bed checking her patients temperature down to ninetynine well have you back in time for the first lesson on monday morning young man she declared as she shook the thermometer ill leave you now mr barrington so you can spend a little time with your son thank you matron said hugo i wonder if i might have a word with you before i leave of course mr barrington youll find me in my office you dont look too bad to me giles said hugo once matron had left the room im fine papa in fact i was rather hoping matron would let me out on saturday morning so i can play football ill have a word with her before i go thank you papa so hows the work coming along not bad said giles but thats only because i share a study with the two brightest boys in my class and who are they asked his father dreading the reply theres deakins hes the cleverest boy in the school in fact the other boys wont even talk to him because they think hes a swot but my best friend is harry clifton hes very clever too but not as clever as deakins youve probably heard him singing in the choir i know youll like him but isnt clifton the son of a stevedore hugo said yes and just like grandpa he doesnt hide the fact but how did you know that papa i think clifton used to work for the company hugo said immediately regretting his words it must have been before your time papa said giles because his father was killed in the war who told you that said hugo harrys mother shes a waitress at the royal hotel we went to tea there on his birthday hugo would have liked to have asked when cliftons birthday was but feared it might be one question too many instead he said your mother sends her love i think she and emma plan to visit you later this week yuk thats all i need said giles chicken pox and a visit from my dreadful sister shes not that bad said his father laughing shes worse said giles and grace doesnt look as if shes going to be any better do they have to come on holiday with us papa yes of course they do i was wondering if harry clifton could join us in tuscany this summer hes never been abroad no said hugo a little too firmly holidays are strictly for the family not to be shared with strangers but hes not a stranger said giles hes my best friend no hugo repeated and thats an end of the matter giles looked disappointed so what would you like for your birthday my boy hugo asked quickly changing the subject the latest radio said giles without hesitation its called a roberts reliable are you allowed to have radios at school yes said giles but you can only play them at weekends if youre caught listening after lights out or during the week they get confiscated ill see what i can do will you be coming home on your birthday yes but only for tea i have to be back at school in time for prep then ill try and drop in said hugo ill be off now i want a word with matron before i leave dont forget to ask her if shell let me out on saturday morning giles reminded him as his father left the room to carry out the real purpose of his visit im so glad you were able to drop by mr barrington it will perk giles up no end said matron as he walked into her office but as you can see hes almost fully recovered yes and hes hoping youll let him out on saturday morning so he can play in a football match im sure that will be possible said matron but you said there was something else you wanted to talk about yes matron as you know giles is colourblind i just wanted to ask if it was causing him any difficulties not that im aware of said matron if it is it certainly doesnt stop him hitting a red ball across a green field until it reaches a white boundary barrington laughed before he delivered his next wellprepared line when i was at st bedes i used to be teased because i was the only boy who suffered from colourblindness let me assure you said matron no one teases giles and in any case his best friend is also colourblind hugo drove back to his office thinking that something had to be done before the situation got out of control he decided to have another word with colonel danvers once he was back behind his desk he told miss potts he didnt want to be disturbed he waited until shed closed the door before he picked up the telephone a few moments later the chief constable was on the line its hugo barrington colonel how are you my boy asked the chief constable im well sir i was wondering if you could advise me on a private matter fire away old fellow im looking for a new head of security and i wondered if you might be able to point me in the right direction as a matter of fact i do know a man who might fit the bill but im not sure if hes still available ill find out and give you a call back the chief constable was as good as his word and phoned back the following morning the man i had in mind has a parttime job at the moment but hes looking for something more permanent what can you tell me about him asked hugo he was being groomed for higher things in the force but he had to leave when he was badly injured trying to apprehend a robber during a raid on the midland bank you probably remember the story it even hit the national press in my opinion hed be the ideal candidate to head your security team and frankly youd be lucky to get him if youre still interested i could drop you a line with his details barrington rang derek mitchell from his home as he didnt want miss potts to find out what he was up to he agreed to meet the former policeman at the royal hotel at six oclock on monday evening after mrs clifton would have left for the day and the palm court would be empty hugo arrived a few minutes early and headed straight for a table at the far end of the room that he wouldnt normally have considered he took a seat behind the pillar where he knew his meeting with mitchell would not be seen or overheard while he waited he went over a list of questions in his mind that needed answering if he was going to put his trust in a complete stranger at three minutes to six a tall wellbuilt man of military bearing pushed his way through the revolving doors his dark navy blazer grey flannels short hair and highly polished shoes all suggested a life of discipline hugo stood and raised a hand as if he was summoning a waiter mitchell walked slowly across the room making no attempt to disguise a slight limp an injury which according to danvers was the reason mitchell had been invalided out of the police service hugo recalled the last occasion hed come face to face with a police officer but this time he would be asking the questions good evening sir good evening mitchell said hugo as they shook hands once mitchell had sat down hugo took a closer look at his broken nose and cauliflower ears and also recalled from colonel danverss notes that he used to play in the second row for bristol let me say from the outset mitchell said hugo not wasting any time that what i want to discuss with you is of a highly confidential nature and must be kept strictly between the two of us mitchell nodded it is so confidential in fact that even colonel danvers has no idea of the real reason i needed to see you as i am certainly not looking for someone to head up my security operation mitchells face remained inscrutable as he waited to hear what hugo had in mind i am looking for someone to act as a private detective his sole purpose will be to report to me each month on the activities of a woman who lives in this city and in fact works in this hotel i understand sir i want to know everything she gets up to whether professional or personal however insignificant it might seem she must never i repeat never become aware of your interest in her so before i reveal her name do you consider yourself capable of carrying out such an assignment these things are never easy said mitchell but theyre not impossible as a young detective sergeant i worked on an undercover operation which resulted in a particularly loathsome individual ending up behind bars for sixteen years if he were to walk into this hotel now im confident he wouldnt recognize me hugo smiled for the first time before i go any further he continued i need to know if you would be willing to take on such an assignment that would depend on several things sir such as would it be a fulltime position because i currently have a night security job working for a bank hand in your notice tomorrow said hugo i dont want you to be working for anyone else and what are the hours at your discretion and my salary i will pay you eight pounds a week a month in advance and will also cover any legitimate expenses mitchell nodded may i suggest you make any payments in cash sir so that nothing can be traced back to you that seems sensible said hugo whod already made that decision and would you want the monthly reports to be in writing or in person in person i want as little committed to paper as possible then we should always meet at a different location and never on the same day of the week that way it would be unlikely that anyone would come across us more than once i have no problem with that said hugo when would you want me to start sir you started half an hour ago said barrington he removed a slip of paper and an envelope containing from an inside pocket and handed them to mitchell mitchell studied the name and address written on the piece of paper for a few moments before handing it back to his new boss ill also need your private number sir and details of when and where you can be contacted at my office any evening between five and six said hugo you must never contact me at home unless its an emergency he added as he took out a pen just tell me the numbers sir dont write them down were you thinking of attending master giless birthday party asked miss potts hugo looked at his diary giles th birthday pm manor house was written in bold letters at the top of the page do i have time to pick up a present on the way home miss potts left the room and returned a moment later carrying a large parcel wrapped in shiny red paper and tied with a ribbon whats inside asked hugo the latest roberts radio the one he asked for when you visited him in the san last month thank you miss potts said hugo he checked his watch id better leave now if im going to be in time to see him cut the cake miss potts placed a thick file in his briefcase and before he could ask she said your background notes for tomorrow mornings board meeting you can go over them after master giles has returned to st bedes that way there will be no need for you to come back this evening thank you miss potts said hugo you think of everything as he drove through the city on his way home hugo couldnt help noticing how many more cars there seemed to be on the highway than there had been a year ago pedestrians were becoming more wary of casually crossing the road since the government had increased the speed limit to miles per hour a horse reared up as hugo shot past a hansom cab he wondered how much longer they could hope to survive now that the city council had authorized its first taxi cab once he had driven out of the city hugo sped up not wanting to be late for his sons party how quickly the boy was growing he was already taller than his mother would he end up taller than his father when giles left st bedes and took up his place at eton in a years time hugo felt confident that his friendship with the clifton boy would soon be forgotten although he realized there were other difficulties that needed to be addressed before then he slowed down as he passed through the gates of his estate he always enjoyed the long drive through the avenue of oaks up to the manor house jenkins was standing on the top step as hugo got out of the car he held open the front door and said mrs barrington is in the drawing room sir with master giles and two of his school friends as he walked into the hall emma came running down the stairs and threw her arms around her father whats in the parcel she demanded a birthday present for your brother yes but what is it youll have to wait and see young lady said her father with a smile before he handed his briefcase to the butler would you put that in my study jenkins he said as emma grabbed him by the hand and began to tug him towards the drawing room hugos smile evaporated the moment he opened the door and saw who was sitting on the sofa giles leapt up and ran towards his father who handed him the parcel and said happy birthday my boy thank you papa he said before introducing his friends hugo shook deakinss hand but when harry offered his he just said good afternoon clifton and sat down in his favourite chair hugo watched with interest as giles undid the ribbon on his parcel and they both saw the present for the first time even his sons unbridled delight with his new radio didnt bring a smile to hugos lips he had a question that he needed to ask clifton but it mustnt appear as if the boys reply was of any significance he remained silent while the three boys took turns tuning into the two stations and listening intently to the strange voices and music that came out of the speaker this was regularly followed by laughter or applause mrs barrington chatted to harry about a recent concert of the messiah shed attended adding how much shed enjoyed his rendition of i know that my redeemer liveth thank you mrs barrington said harry are you hoping to go on to bristol grammar school after you leave st bedes clifton asked hugo spotting an opening only if i win a scholarship sir he replied but why is that important asked mrs barrington surely you will be offered a place like any other boy because my mother wouldnt be able to afford the fees mrs barrington shes a waitress at the royal hotel but wouldnt your father hes dead said harry he was killed in the war im sorry said mrs barrington i didnt realize at that moment the door opened and the underbutler entered the room carrying a large cake on a silver tray after giles had succeeded in blowing out all twelve candles with one puff everyone applauded and whens your birthday clifton asked hugo it was last month sir harry replied after giles had cut the cake hugo stood up and left the room without another word he went straight to his study but found he couldnt concentrate on his papers for the next days board meeting cliftons reply meant he would have to seek advice from a lawyer who specialized in the law of heredity after an hour or so he heard voices in the hall then the front door closing and the sound of a car driving away a few minutes later there was a knock on his study door and elizabeth walked in what made you leave us so abruptly she asked and why didnt you come and say goodbye when you must have known giles and his guests were leaving i have a very tricky board meeting tomorrow morning he said without looking up thats no reason not to say goodbye to your son especially on his birthday ive got a lot on my mind he said still looking down at his notes surely nothing is so important that you need to be rude to guests you were more offhand with harry clifton than you would be with one of the servants hugo looked up for the first time thats possibly because i consider clifton inferior to our servants elizabeth looked shocked did you know that his father was a dock labourer and his mother is a waitress im not sure thats the sort of boy giles should be mixing with giles clearly thinks otherwise and whatever his background harrys a charming boy i cant understand why youre so against him you didnt treat deakins that way and his fathers a newsagent hes also an open scholar and harry is the schools prize choral scholar as every churchgoing citizen in bristol knows next time you come across him i hope youll be a little more civil without another word elizabeth left the room closing the door firmly behind her sir walter barrington remained in his place at the head of the boardroom table as his son entered the room im becoming increasingly concerned about the governments proposed legislation on import tariffs said hugo as he took a seat on the right of his father and the effect it might have on our balance sheet thats why we have a lawyer on the board said sir walter so that he can advise us on such matters but ive calculated that it could cost us twenty thousand pounds a year if it becomes law dont you think we ought to seek a second opinion i suppose i could have a word with sir james amhurst when im next in london im travelling up to london on tuesday for the association of british ship owners annual dinner said hugo as hes the industrys legal adviser perhaps i should have a word with him only if youre convinced its necessary said sir walter and dont forget that amhurst charges by the hour even at dinner the association of british ship owners dinner was held at the grosvenor house and was attended by over a thousand members and their guests hugo had earlier phoned the associations secretary and asked if he could be seated next to sir james amhurst the secretary raised an eyebrow but agreed to rearrange the guests on the top table after all old joshua barrington had been a founder member of the association after the bishop of newcastle had said grace hugo made no attempt to interrupt the eminent silk while he was deep in conversation with the man on his right however when the lawyer finally turned his attention to the stranger theyd put on his left hugo didnt waste any time in getting to the point my father sir walter barrington he began capturing his quarrys attention is rather concerned about the import tariff bill that is going through the house of commons and the effects it might have on the industry he wonders if he could consult you on the subject when hes next in london by all means dear boy said sir james just ask his secretary to give my clerk a call and ill make sure im free when hes next in town thank you sir said hugo on a lighter note i wondered if youd ever read anything by agatha christie cant say i have said sir james is she any good im much enjoying her latest book where theres a will said hugo but im not sure if the plot would stand up in a court of law whats the lady suggesting asked amhurst as a sliver of overcooked beef served on a cold plate was placed in front of him according to miss christie the eldest son of an hereditary knight automatically inherits his fathers title even if the child is illegitimate ah now that is indeed an interesting legal conundrum said sir james in fact the law lords have quite recently reviewed such a case benson v carstairs if i remember correctly its often referred to by the press as the bastards amendment and what conclusion did their lordships come to asked hugo trying not to sound too interested if no loophole could be found in the original will they came out in favour of the first born even if the young man in question was illegitimate another answer hugo hadnt wanted to hear however sir james continued their lordships decided to cover their backsides and added a codicil that each case should be treated on its own merits and then only after it had been reviewed by the garter king of arms typical of the law lords he added before picking up his knife and fork and attacking the beef too frightened to set a precedent but quite happy to pass the buck when sir james returned his attention to the man on his right hugo thought about the implications of harry clifton discovering that he might have the right to inherit not only the barrington shipping line but also the family estate having to admit he had sired an illegitimate son would be bad enough but the idea of harry clifton inheriting the family title after his death and becoming sir harry did not bear thinking about he would be willing to do anything in his power to make sure that wouldnt be the outcome hugo barrington was having breakfast when he read the letter from the headmaster of st bedes outlining the details of an appeal the school was launching to raise a thousand pounds to build a new cricket pavilion for the first xi he opened his cheque book and had written the figures when he was distracted by the sound of a car coming to a halt on the gravel outside hugo walked across to the window to see who could possibly be visiting him so early on a saturday morning he was puzzled when he saw his son step out of the back of a taxi carrying a suitcase as hed been looking forward to watching him open the batting for the school that afternoon in the final match of the season against avonhurst jenkins appeared just in time to open the front door as giles reached the top step good morning master giles he said as if hed been expecting him hugo walked quickly out of the breakfast room to find his son standing in the hall head bowed suitcase by his side what are you doing at home he asked isnt there another week to go before the end of term ive been rusticated said giles simply rusticated repeated his father and what have you done to merit that may i ask giles looked up at jenkins who stood silently by the front door ill take master giless suitcase up to his bedroom the butler said before picking up the bag and proceeding slowly up the stairs follow me said hugo once the butler was out of sight neither of them spoke again until hugo had closed the study door behind him what have you done to cause the school to take such a drastic measure demanded his father as he sank back into his chair i was caught stealing from the tuck shop said giles who had been left standing in the middle of the room is there some simple explanation a misunderstanding perhaps no there isnt sir said giles fighting back tears do you have anything to say in your defence no sir giles hesitated except except what i always gave the sweets away papa i never kept them for myself to clifton no doubt and to deakins as well said giles was it clifton who put you up to it in the first place no it was not responded giles firmly in fact once he found out what id been up to harry always took the sweets i gave him and deakins back to the tuck shop he even took the blame when mr frobisher accused him of stealing them a long silence followed before his father said so youve been rusticated not actually expelled giles nodded do you think they will allow you to go back next term i doubt it said giles what makes you so sure of that because ive never seen the headmaster so angry not half as angry as your mother will be when she finds out please dont tell her papa pleaded giles bursting into tears and how do you expect me to explain to her why youre home a week early and might not even be returning to st bedes next term giles made no attempt to respond but continued to sob quietly and heaven knows what your grandparents will say his father added when i have to tell them why you wont be going to eton after all another long silence followed go to your room and dont even think about coming back down until i say so yes sir said giles he turned to leave and whatever you do dont discuss this with anyone especially not in front of the servants yes papa said giles who ran out of the room nearly colliding with jenkins as he shot past him on the stairs hugo leant forward in his chair trying to think if there might be some way to turn the situation around before he had to face an inevitable call from the headmaster he placed his elbows on the desk and his head in his hands but it was some time before his eyes focused on the cheque a smile crossed his lips as he added an extra nought before signing it mitchell was seated in the far corner of the waiting room reading the bristol evening post when hugo walked across and sat down beside him it was so draughty that hugo kept his hands in his pockets the subject said mitchell still looking at his newspaper is trying to raise five hundred pounds for a business venture what sort of business venture could she possibly be interested in tillys tea shop replied mitchell it seems the subject worked there before she moved to the palm court room at the royal miss tilly has recently had an offer of five hundred pounds for the business from a mr edward atkins miss tilly doesnt care for atkins and has made it clear to the subject that if she were able to raise the same amount she would prefer her to take over the business where could she possibly hope to get hold of that much money perhaps from someone who wished to have financial control over her which might at a later date prove advantageous hugo remained silent mitchells eyes never left his paper has she approached anyone to try and raise the money hugo eventually asked shes currently taking advice from a mr patrick casey who represents dillon and co a finance company based in dublin they specialize in raising loans for private clients how do i get in touch with casey i wouldnt advise that said mitchell why not he visits bristol about once a month and always stays at the royal we wouldnt have to meet at the royal he has struck up a close personal relationship with the subject whenever hes in town he takes her to dinner or the theatre and recently shes been seen returning with him to the hotel where they spend the night together in room fascinating said hugo anything else it may also interest you to know that the subject banks with the national provincial corn street the manager is a mr prendergast her current account is showing a balance of twelve pounds and nine shillings hugo would like to have asked how mitchell had come across that particular piece of information but satisfied himself with saying excellent the moment you come up with anything else however insignificant ring me he took a bulky envelope from his overcoat pocket and slipped it across to mitchell the train now arriving at platform nine is the seven twentytwo from taunton mitchell pocketed the envelope folded his newspaper and walked out of the waiting room hed never once looked at his employer hugo had been unable to hide his anger when he discovered the real reason giles had failed to be offered a place at eton hed phoned the headmaster who refused to take his calls his prospective housemaster who sympathized but offered no hope of redemption and even the provost who said hed call back but didnt although elizabeth and the girls had no idea what had caused hugo to so regularly lose his temper of late and for no apparent reason they continued to bear the brunt of giless misdemeanours with equanimity hugo reluctantly accompanied giles to bristol grammar school on his first day of term although he wouldnt allow either emma or grace to join them despite emma bursting into tears and sulking when hugo brought the car to a halt in college street the first person he saw standing outside the school gates was harry clifton even before he pulled on the brake giles had leapt out and run across to greet his friend hugo avoided mingling with the other parents whom elizabeth seemed quite happy to chat to and when he inadvertently came across clifton he made a point of not shaking hands with him on the journey back to the manor house elizabeth asked her husband why he treated giless best friend with such disdain hugo reminded his wife that their son should have gone to eton where he would have mixed with other gentlemen and not with the sons of local tradesmen and in cliftons case far worse elizabeth retreated into the comparative safety of silence as she had so often done recently local tea shop burnt to the ground arson suspected hollered the paperboy standing on the corner of the broad hugo threw on the brakes leapt out of his car and handed the lad a hapenny he began reading the front page as he walked back to his car tillys tea shop a bristol landmark much frequented by local citizens was razed to the ground in the early hours of the morning police have arrested a local man in his early thirties and charged him with arson miss tilly who now lives in cornwall hugo smiled when he saw the photograph of maisie clifton and her staff standing on the pavement grimly surveying the burntout remains of tillys the gods were clearly on his side he climbed back into his car placed the newspaper on the passenger seat and continued on his journey to bristol zoo he would need to make an early appointment to see mr prendergast mitchell had advised him that if he hoped to keep the fact that he was the subjects backer confidential any meetings with prendergast should be held in barringtons offices and preferably after miss potts had gone home for the night hugo didnt attempt to explain to mitchell that he wasnt sure if miss potts did go home at night he was looking forward to the meeting with prendergast when he would administer the last rites but there was someone else he needed to see before he could do that mitchell was feeding rosie when he arrived hugo walked slowly across leant on the railing and pretended to take an interest in the indian elephant that bristol zoo had recently acquired from uttar pradesh and was already attracting a large number of visitors mitchell tossed up a lump of bread which rosie caught in her trunk and transferred to her mouth in one fluid movement the subject has returned to work at the royal hotel said mitchell as if he was addressing the elephant shes doing the late shift in the palm court from ten at night until six the following morning shes paid three pounds a week plus whatever she can make in tips which as there are so few customers at that time of night doesnt add up to much he threw another crust at the elephant and continued a bob burrows has been arrested and charged with arson burrows was her patisserie supplier before the subject sacked him hes made a full confession even admitting that he had planned to propose to the subject and had purchased an engagement ring but shed spurned him or at least thats his story a smile crossed hugos lips and whos in charge of the case he asked a detective inspector blakemore said mitchell hugos smile was replaced by a frown although blakemore initially thought the subject might be an accomplice of burrows continued mitchell he has since informed the bristol and west of england insurance company that she is no longer a suspect thats a pity said hugo the frown still in place not necessarily said mitchell the insurance company will be issuing mrs clifton with a cheque for six hundred pounds in full and final settlement of her claim hugo smiled i wonder if shes told her son said hugo almost to himself if mitchell heard the comment he ignored it the only other piece of information that might be of some interest to you he continued is that mr patrick casey booked into the royal hotel on friday night and took the subject to the plimsoll line for dinner they returned to the hotel afterwards when she accompanied him to his room no and didnt leave until just after seven oclock the following morning a long silence followed always the sign that mitchell had come to the end of his monthly report hugo removed an envelope from an inside pocket and slipped it to mitchell who didnt acknowledge the transaction as he threw his last piece of bread to a contented rosie mr prendergast to see you said miss potts standing aside to allow the banker to enter the managing directors office its good of you to come all this way said hugo im sure youll appreciate why i didnt want to discuss such a highly confidential matter at the bank i quite understand said prendergast who had opened his gladstone bag and extracted a thick file even before hed sat down he passed a single sheet of paper across the desk to mr barrington hugo checked the bottom line before settling back in his chair just to recap if i may said prendergast you put up a capital sum of five hundred pounds which allowed mrs clifton to purchase the business known as tillys a tea shop on broad street the agreed contract was for the full amount plus compound interest at five per cent per annum to be paid back to the principal within a period of five years although tillys managed to declare a small trading profit in mrs cliftons first year and again in her second there was never a large enough surplus for her either to pay the interest or to return any part of the capital sum so at the time of the fire mrs clifton owed you shillings to this sum i must add bank charges of making a grand total of shillings this of course will be well covered by the insurance payout which means that while your investment is secure mrs clifton will be left with virtually nothing how unfortunate said hugo may i ask why the final sum doesnt appear to include any charge for services rendered by mr casey he added after studying the figures more closely because mr casey has informed the bank that he will not be submitting any bills for his services hugo frowned at least that is one piece of good news for the poor woman indeed none the less i fear she will no longer be able to cover her sons fees at bristol grammar school for next term how sad said hugo so will the boy have to be removed im sorry to say thats the inevitable conclusion said mr prendergast it is a great shame because she dotes on the child and i believe she would sacrifice almost anything to keep him there a great shame repeated hugo as he closed the file and rose from his chair i wont keep you any longer mr prendergast he added i have an appointment in the city in about half an hour perhaps i can give you a lift that is most kind of you mr barrington but it wont be necessary i drove myself over here what do you drive hugo asked as he picked up his briefcase and headed towards the door a morris oxford said prendergast quickly stuffing some papers back into his gladstone bag and following hugo out of the office the peoples car said hugo im told that like you mr prendergast its very reliable both men laughed as they walked down the stairs together sad business mrs clifton said hugo as they stepped out of the building but then im not altogether sure i approve of women getting involved in business its not the natural way of things i quite agree said prendergast as the two men came to a halt by barringtons car mind you he added you could not have done more for the poor woman its kind of you to say so prendergast said hugo but despite that id be obliged if my involvement could remain strictly between the two of us of course sir said prendergast as the two men shook hands you can rely on me lets keep in touch old fellow said hugo as he climbed into his car i have no doubt ill be calling on the banks services again prendergast smiled as hugo drove towards the city his thoughts returned to maisie clifton he had dealt her a blow from which she was unlikely to recover but he now intended to deliver the knockout punch he drove into bristol wondering where she was at that moment probably sitting her son down to explain to him why he would have to leave bgs at the end of the summer term had she even for one fleeting moment imagined that harry might be able to continue his studies as if nothing had happened hugo decided that he wouldnt raise the subject with giles until the boy told him the sad news that his friend harry would not be returning to bgs to join him in the sixth form even the thought of his own son having to go to bristol grammar school still made him pulse with anger but he had never let elizabeth or his father know the real reason giles had failed to get a place at eton once hed driven past the cathedral he continued across college green before turning into the entrance of the royal hotel he was a few minutes early for his appointment but he was confident the manager would not keep him waiting he pushed his way through the revolving doors and strolled across the lobby not needing to be told where mr framptons office was the managers secretary leapt up the moment hugo entered the room ill let mr frampton know youre here she said almost running into the adjoining office the manager appeared a moment later what a pleasure to see you mr barrington he said ushering him into his office i do hope you and mrs barrington are both well hugo nodded and took a seat opposite the hotel manager but didnt shake hands when you asked to see me i took the liberty of checking over the arrangements for your companys annual dinner said frampton just over three hundred guests will be attending i understand i have no interest how many guests are attending said hugo that isnt the reason i came to see you frampton i wish to discuss a private matter that i find most distasteful im very sorry to hear that said frampton sitting bolt upright one of our nonexecutive directors was staying at the hotel on thursday night and the following day he made a most serious allegation that i feel it is my duty to bring to your attention yes of course said frampton rubbing his sweating palms on his trousers the last thing we would want to do is annoy one of our most valued customers im glad to hear it said hugo the gentleman in question checked into the hotel after the restaurant had closed and went into the palm court in the hope of being provided with some light refreshment a service i myself instituted said frampton allowing himself a strained smile he gave his order to a young lady who appeared to be in charge continued hugo ignoring the comment yes that would be our mrs clifton ive no idea who it was said hugo however as she was serving him with a cup of coffee and some sandwiches another gentleman entered the palm court made an order and asked if it could be sent up to his room the only thing my friend recalls about the man was that he had a slight irish accent my friend then signed his bill and retired for the night he rose early the following morning as he wished to have breakfast and go over his papers before the board meeting when he came out of his room he observed the same woman still dressed in her hotel uniform leaving room she then walked to the end of the corridor climbed through the window and out on to the fire escape im absolutely appalled sir i the board member concerned has requested that whenever he comes to bristol in the future he should be booked into another hotel now i dont wish to appear prudish frampton but the royal has always been somewhere ive been happy to bring my wife and children be assured mr barrington the person concerned will be dismissed immediately and not supplied with a reference may i add how grateful i am that you have brought this matter to my attention hugo rose from his place of course i wouldnt want any reference made to me or the company should you feel it necessary to dismiss the lady in question you can be assured of my discretion said frampton hugo smiled for the first time on a happier note may i say how much were all looking forward to the annual dinner which no doubt will be up to your usual high standard next year well be celebrating the companys centenary so i feel sure my father will want to push the boat out both men laughed a little too loudly you can rely on us mr barrington said frampton as he followed his client out of the office and one more thing frampton said hugo as they walked across the foyer id rather you didnt say anything to sir walter about this my father can be a little oldfashioned when it comes to such matters so i think its best kept between ourselves i couldnt agree more mr barrington said frampton you can be assured i shall deal with the matter personally as hugo pushed his way back through the revolving doors he couldnt help wondering just how many hours mitchell must have spent at the royal before he was able to supply him with such a priceless piece of information he jumped back into his car switched on the engine and continued on his journey home he was still thinking about maisie clifton when he felt a tap on his shoulder he experienced a moment of blind panic as he turned around and saw who was sitting on the back seat he even wondered if somehow shed found out about his meeting with frampton what do you want he demanded not slowing down for fear that someone might see them together as he listened to her demands he could only wonder how she was so well informed once shed finished he readily agreed to her terms knowing that it would be the easiest way of getting her out of the car mrs clifton placed a thin brown envelope on the passenger seat next to him ill wait to hear from you she said hugo put the envelope in an inside pocket he only slowed down when he came to an unlit alley but didnt stop until he was certain no one else could see them he leapt out of the car and opened the back door when he saw the look on her face it was clear she felt shed more than achieved her purpose hugo allowed her a moment of triumph before he grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her as if he was trying to remove an obstinate apple from a tree once hed left her in no doubt what would happen if she ever bothered him again he punched her in the face with all his strength she collapsed to the ground curled up into a ball and didnt stop shaking hugo thought about kicking her in the stomach but didnt want to risk being witnessed by a passerby he drove away without giving her another thought old jack tar on a balmy thursday afternoon in the northern transvaal i killed eleven men and a grateful nation awarded me the victoria cross for service above and beyond the call of duty i havent had a peaceful nights sleep since if id killed one englishman in my homeland a judge would have sentenced me to hang by the neck until i was dead instead i have been sentenced to life imprisonment because i still see the faces of those eleven wretched young men every day like an image on a coin that never fades ive often considered suicide but that would be the cowards way out in the citation gazetted in the times it was stated that my actions had been responsible for saving the lives of two officers five noncommissioned officers and seventeen private soldiers of the royal gloucesters one of those officers lieutenant walter barrington has made it possible for me to serve my sentence with some dignity within weeks of the action i was shipped back to england and a few months later i was honourably discharged following what would now be described as a mental breakdown after six months in an army hospital i was released back into the world i changed my name avoided my home town of wells in somerset and set off for bristol unlike the prodigal son i refused to travel a few miles into the next county where i would have been able to enjoy the tranquillity of my fathers home during the day i would roam the streets of bristol rummaging around in dustbins for scraps while at night my bedroom was a park my resting place a bench my blanket a newspaper my morning call the first bird to announce a new dawn when it was too cold or wet i retreated to the waiting room of a local railway station where i slept below the bench and rose before the first train shunted in the next morning as the nights became longer i signed up as a nonpaying guest of the salvation army on little george street where kind ladies supplied me with thick bread and thin soup before i fell asleep on a horsehair mattress below a single blanket luxury as the years passed i hoped that my former companionsinarms and brother officers would assume i was dead i had no desire for them to find out that this was the prison id chosen to carry out my life sentence in and it might have stayed thus had a rollsroyce not screeched to a halt in the middle of the road the back door swung open and out leapt a man i hadnt seen for years captain tarrant he cried as he advanced towards me i looked away hoping hed think hed made a mistake but i remembered only too well that walter barrington was not a man who suffered from selfdoubt he grabbed me by the shoulders and stared at me for some time before he said how can this be possible old fellow the more i tried to convince him i did not need his help the more determined he became to be my saviour i finally gave in but not before he had agreed to my terms and conditions at first he begged me to join him and his wife at the manor house but id survived too long without a roof over my head to regard such comfort as anything other than a burden he even offered me a seat on the board of the shipping company that bore his name what use could i possibly be to you i asked your very presence jack would be an inspiration to us all i thanked him but explained that i had not yet completed my sentence for the murder of eleven men still he didnt give in i finally agreed to take the job of night watchman at the docks with three pounds a week pay and accommodation provided an abandoned pullman railway carriage now became my prison cell i suppose i might have continued my life sentence until the day i died had i not come into contact with master harry clifton harry would claim years later that i had shaped his whole life in truth it was he who saved mine the first time i came across young harry he couldnt have been more than four or five come on in lad i called to him when i spotted him crawling towards the carriage on his hands and knees but he immediately leapt up and ran away the following saturday he got as far as looking in through the window i tried again why dont you come in my boy im not going to bite you i said trying to reassure him this time he took up my offer and opened the door but after exchanging a few words he ran away again was i that frightening a figure the next saturday he not only opened the door but stood feet apart in the doorway staring at me defiantly we chatted for over an hour about everything from bristol city fc to why snakes shed their skins and who built clifton suspension bridge before he said ill have to be off now mr tar my mums expecting me home for tea this time he walked away but looked back several times after that harry came to visit me every saturday until he went to merrywood elementary school when he started turning up most mornings it took me some time to convince the boy that he should stay at school and learn to read and write frankly i wouldnt have managed even that without the help of miss monday mr holcombe and harrys spirited mother it took a formidable team to get harry clifton to realize his potential and i knew we had succeeded when once again he could only find the time to visit me on saturday mornings because he was preparing to enter for a choral scholarship to st bedes once harry had started at his new school i didnt expect to see him again until the christmas holidays but to my surprise i found him standing outside my door just before eleven oclock on the first friday night of term he told me hed left st bedes because a prefect was bullying him damned if i can recall the cads name and he was going to run away to sea if he had i suspect the boy would have ended up an admiral but happily he listened to my advice and was back at school in time for breakfast the following morning because he always used to come to the docks with stan tancock it was some time before i realized harry was arthur cliftons boy he once asked me if id known his father and i told him yes and that he was a good and decent man with a fine war record he then asked me if i knew how he died i said i didnt the only time i ever lied to the boy it was not for me to ignore the wishes of his mother i was standing on the dockside when the shift changed no one ever gave me a second glance almost as if i wasnt there and i knew that some of them thought i wasnt all there i did nothing to dispel this as it allowed me to serve my sentence in anonymity arthur clifton had been a good ganger one of the best and he took his job seriously unlike his best mate stan tancock whose first port of call on the way home was always the pig and whistle that was on the nights he managed to get home i watched clifton as he disappeared inside the hull of the maple leaf to make some final checks before the welders moved in to seal the double bottom it was the raucous sound of the shift horn that must have distracted everyone one shift coming off another coming on and the welders needed to get started promptly if they were going to finish the job by the end of their shift and earn their bonus no one gave a second thought to whether clifton had climbed back out of the double bottom myself included we all assumed that he must have heard the blast on the horn and was among the hundreds of dockers trooping through the gates making their way home unlike his brotherinlaw clifton rarely stopped for a pint at the pig and whistle preferring to go straight to still house lane and be with his wife and child in those days i didnt know his wife or child and perhaps i never would have if arthur clifton had returned home that night the second shift was working flat out when i heard tancock shouting at the top of his voice i saw him pointing to the ships hull but haskins the chief ganger simply brushed him aside as if he were a tiresome wasp once tancock realized he was getting nowhere with haskins he charged down the gangway and began to run along the quayside in the direction of barrington house when haskins realized where tancock was headed he chased after him and had nearly caught up with him by the time he barged through the swing doors into the shipping lines headquarters to my surprise a few minutes later tancock came running back out of the building and i was even more surprised when haskins and the managing director followed close behind i couldnt imagine what would have convinced mr hugo to leave his office after such a brief conversation with stan tancock i found out the reason soon enough because the moment mr hugo arrived on the dock he gave orders for the entire shift to lay down their tools stop working and remain silent as if it were remembrance sunday and indeed a minute later haskins ordered them all back to work that was when it first occurred to me that arthur clifton might still be inside the double bottom but surely no man could be so callous as to walk away if hed thought even for a moment that someone might be trapped alive in a steel grave of their own making when the welders went back to work mr hugo spoke to tancock again before tancock trooped off through the dockyard gates and out of sight i looked back to see if haskins was pursuing him again but he was clearly more interested in pushing his men to their limits to recover lost time like a galley master driving his slaves a moment later mr hugo walked down the gangway climbed back into his car and drove off to barrington house the next time i looked out of my carriage window i saw tancock running back through the gates and once again charging towards barrington house this time he didnt reappear for at least half an hour and when he did he was no longer redcheeked and pulsating with rage but appeared far calmer i decided he must have found clifton and was simply letting mr hugo know i looked up at mr hugos office and saw him standing by the window watching tancock as he left the yard he didnt move away from the window until he was out of sight a few minutes later mr hugo came out of the building walked across to his car and drove away i wouldnt have given the matter another thought if arthur clifton had clocked in for the morning shift but he didnt nor did he ever again the following morning a detective inspector blakemore paid me a visit in my carriage you can often judge the character of a person by the way he treats his fellow men blakemore was one of those rare people who could see beyond his nose you say that you saw stanley tancock leaving barrington house between seven and seven thirty yesterday evening yes i did i told him did he appear to be in a hurry or anxious or attempting to slip away unnoticed on the contrary i said i remember thinking at the time he looked remarkably carefree given the circumstances given the circumstances repeated blakemore only an hour or so earlier hed been protesting that his mate arthur clifton was trapped in the double bottom of the maple leaf and they were doing nothing to help him blakemore wrote down my words in his notebook do you have any idea where tancock went after that no i replied when i last saw him he was walking out of the gates with an arm around one of his mates thank you sir said the detective inspector thats been most helpful it had been a long time since anyone had called me sir would you be willing at your own convenience to come down to the station and make a written statement id prefer not to inspector i told him for personal reasons but id be quite happy to write out a statement that you could collect at any time that suits you thats good of you sir the detective inspector opened his briefcase dug out a police statement sheet and handed it to me he then raised his hat and said thank you sir ill be in touch but i never saw him again six weeks later stan tancock was sentenced to three years imprisonment for theft with mr hugo acting as the prosecutions principal witness i attended every day of the trial and there wasnt any doubt in my mind which one of them was the guilty party try not to forget that you saved my life ive spent the last twentysix years trying to forget old jack reminded him but you were also responsible for saving the lives of twentyfour of your fellow west countrymen you remain a hero in this city and you seem to be totally unaware of the fact so im bound to ask jack how much longer you intend to go on torturing yourself until i can no longer see the eleven men i killed as clearly as i can see you now but you were doing no more than your duty protested sir walter thats how i saw it at the time admitted jack so what changed if i could answer that question replied jack we wouldnt be having this conversation but youre still capable of doing so much for your fellow men take that young friend of yours for example you tell me he keeps playing truant but if he was to discover that you are captain jack tarrant of the royal gloucestershire regiment winner of the victoria cross dont you think he might listen to you with even more respect he might also run away again replied jack in any case i have other plans for young harry clifton clifton clifton said sir walter why is that name familiar harrys father was trapped in the double bottom of the maple leaf and no one came to his thats not what i heard said sir walter his tone changing i was told that clifton left his wife because she was not to put too fine a point on it a loose woman then you were misled said jack because i can tell you that mrs clifton is a delightful and intelligent woman and any man who was lucky enough to be married to her would never want to leave her sir walter looked genuinely shocked and it was some time before he spoke again surely you dont believe that cock and bull story about clifton being trapped in the double bottom he asked quietly im afraid i do walter you see i witnessed the whole episode then why didnt you say something about it at the time i did when i was interviewed by detective inspector blakemore the following day i told him everything id seen and at his request i made a written statement then why wasnt your statement produced in evidence at tancocks trial asked sir walter because i never saw blakemore again and when i turned up at the police station i was told he was no longer in charge of the case and his replacement refused to see me i had blakemore taken off the case said sir walter the damn man was as good as accusing hugo of giving the money to tancock so there wouldnt be an investigation into the clifton affair old jack remained silent lets not talk of this any more said sir walter i know my son is far from perfect but i refuse to believe or perhaps you dont want to believe said old jack jack whose side are you on on the side of justice as you used to be when we first met and i still am said sir walter but he fell silent for some time before adding i want you to make me a promise jack if you ever find out anything about hugo that you believe would harm the familys reputation you wont hesitate to tell me you have my word on it and you have my word old friend that i would not hesitate to hand hugo over to the police if i thought for one moment that he had broken the law lets hope nothing else arises that would make that necessary said old jack i agree old friend lets talk of more palatable things is there anything you are in need of at the moment i could still do you have any old clothes that are surplus to requirements sir walter raised an eyebrow dare i ask no you darent said old jack but i have to visit a particular gentleman and ill need to be appropriately dressed old jack had grown so thin over the years that sir walters clothes hung off him like flax on a distaff and like sir andrew aguecheek he was several inches taller than his old friend so he had to let down the turnups on the trousers and even then they barely reached his ankles but he felt that the tweed suit checked shirt and striped tie would serve its purpose for this particular meeting as jack walked out of the dockyard for the first time in years a few familiar faces turned to give the smartly dressed stranger a second look when the school bell rang at four oclock old jack stepped back into the shadows while the noisy boisterous nippers poured out through the gates of merrywood elementary as if they were escaping from prison mrs clifton had been waiting there for the past ten minutes and when harry saw his mum he reluctantly allowed her to take him by the hand a damn finelooking woman old jack thought as he watched the two of them walking away harry as always jumping up and down endlessly chattering displaying as much energy as stephensons rocket old jack waited until they were out of sight before he crossed the road and walked into the school yard if hed been dressed in his old clothes he would have been stopped by someone in authority long before he reached the front door he looked up and down the corridor and spotted a master coming towards him im sorry to trouble you said old jack but im looking for mr holcombe third door on the left old fellow the man said pointing down the corridor when old jack came to a halt outside mr holcombes classroom he gave a gentle tap on the door come in old jack opened the door to find a young man his long black gown covered in chalk dust seated at a table in front of rows of empty desks marking exercise books im sorry to disturb you said old jack im looking for mr holcombe then you need look no further said the schoolmaster putting down his pen my name is tar he said as he stepped forward but my friends call me jack holcombes face lit up i do believe youre the man harry clifton goes off to visit most mornings i fear i am admitted old jack i apologize no need said holcombe i only wish i had the same influence over him that you do thats why i came to see you mr holcombe im convinced that harrys an exceptional child and should be given every chance to make the best of his talents i couldnt agree with you more said holcombe and i suspect he has one talent even you dont know about and what might that be he has the voice of an angel harrys no angel said old jack with a grin i quite agree but it may turn out to be our best chance of breaking down his defences what do you have in mind asked old jack theres a possibility he might just be tempted to join the choir at holy nativity so if you were able to convince him to come to school more often i know i can teach him to read and write whys that so important for a church choir its compulsory at holy nativity and miss monday the choir mistress refuses to make any exceptions to the rule then ill just have to make sure the boy attends your lessons wont i said old jack you could do more than that on the days he doesnt come to school you could teach him yourself but im not qualified to teach anyone harry clifton is not impressed by qualifications and we both know that he listens to you perhaps we could work as a team but if harry were to find out what we were up to neither of us would ever see him again how well you know him said the schoolmaster with a sigh well just have to make sure he doesnt find out that may prove something of a challenge said old jack but im willing to give it a try thank you sir said mr holcombe the schoolmaster paused before adding i wonder if i might be allowed to shake hands with you old jack looked surprised as the schoolmaster thrust out his hand old jack shook it warmly and may i say it has been an honour to meet you captain tarrant old jack looked horrified how could you possibly my father has a picture of you that still hangs on the wall in our front room but why asked old jack you saved his life sir harrys visits to old jack became less frequent during the next few weeks until the only time they met was on a saturday morning old jack knew that mr holcombe must have succeeded in his plan when harry asked him if he would come to holy nativity the following sunday to hear him sing on sunday morning old jack rose early used sir walters private cloakroom on the fifth floor of barrington house to have a shower a recent invention and even trimmed his beard before putting on the other suit sir walter had given him arriving at holy nativity just before the service began he slipped into the back row and took a seat at the end of the pew he spotted mrs clifton in the third row sitting between what could only have been her mother and father as for miss monday he could have picked her out in a congregation of a thousand mr holcombe had not been exaggerating about the quality of harrys voice it was as good as anything he could remember from his days at wells cathedral as soon as the boy opened his mouth to sing lead me lord old jack was left in no doubt that his protégé had an exceptional gift once the reverend watts had given his final blessing old jack slipped back out of the church and quickly made his way to the docks he would have to wait until the following saturday before he could tell the boy how much hed enjoyed his singing as he walked back old jack recalled sir walters reproach you could do so much more for harry if you would only give up this selfdenial he thought carefully about sir walters words but he wasnt yet ready to remove the shackles of guilt he did however know a man who could change harrys life a man who had been with him on that dreadful day a man he hadnt spoken to for more than twentyfive years a man who taught at a school that supplied st mary redcliffe with choristers unfortunately merrywood elementary was not a natural recruiting ground for its annual choral scholarship so the man would have to be guided in the right direction old jacks only fear was that lieutenant frobisher might not remember him old jack waited until hugo had left barrington house but it was another half an hour before the lights finally went out in miss pottss room jack stepped out of the railway carriage and began to walk slowly towards barrington house aware that he had only half an hour before the cleaning ladies came on duty he slipped into the unlit building and climbed the stairs to the fifth floor after twentyfive years of sir walter turning a blind eye like a cat he could find his way to the door marked managing director in the dark he sat down at hugos desk he switched on the light if anyone noticed it was on they would simply assume miss potts was working late he thumbed through the telephone directory until he came to the sts andrews bartholomews beatrices bedes he picked up a telephone for the first time in his life not quite sure what to do next a voice came on the line number please tem said jack his forefinger resting just below the number thank you sir as he waited old jack became more nervous by the minute what would he say if someone else came on the line hed just put the phone down he took a piece of paper out of his pocket unfolded it and laid it out on the desk in front of him next he heard a ringing tone followed by a click then a mans voice frobisher house is that noel frobisher he asked recalling the tradition that each house at st bedes was named after the housemaster of the day he looked down at his script each line had been carefully prepared and endlessly rehearsed speaking said frobisher clearly surprised to hear a voice he didnt recognize addressing him by his christian name a long silence followed is there anyone there frobisher asked sounding a little irritated yes its captain jack tarrant there was an even longer silence before frobisher eventually said good evening sir forgive me for calling at this late hour old fellow but i need to seek your advice not at all sir its a great privilege to speak to you after all these years kind of you to say so said old jack ill try not to waste too much of your time but i need to know if st bedes still supplies st mary redcliffe with trebles for its choir we do indeed sir despite so many changes in this modern world thats one tradition that remains constant and in my day said old jack the school awarded a choral scholarship each year to a treble who showed exceptional talent we still do sir in fact we will be considering applications for the position in the next few weeks from any school in the county yes from any school that can produce a treble of outstanding quality but they must also have a solid academic grounding well if thats the case said old jack i would like to submit a candidate for your consideration of course sir which school is the boy attending at the moment merrywood elementary another long silence followed i have to admit that it would be the first time weve had an applicant from that particular school do you by any chance know the name of its music master it doesnt have a music master said old jack but you should get in touch with the boys teacher mr holcombe who will introduce you to his choir mistress may i ask the boys name said frobisher harry clifton if you want to hear him sing i recommend you attend matins at holy nativity church this sunday will you be there sir no said old jack how do i get in touch with you once ive heard the boy sing asked frobisher you dont said old jack firmly and put the phone down as he folded up his script and placed it back in his pocket he could have sworn he heard footsteps crunching across the gravel outside he quickly switched off the light slipped out of mr hugos office and into the corridor he heard a door open and voices on the stairs the last thing he needed was to be found on the fifth floor which was strictly out of bounds to anyone other than the companys executives and miss potts he wouldnt want to embarrass sir walter he began to walk quickly down the stairs hed reached the third floor when he saw mrs nettles heading towards him a mop in one hand a bucket in the other a woman he didnt recognize by her side good evening mrs nettles said old jack and what a fine evening it is to be doing my rounds evenin old jack she replied as she ambled past him once he had turned the corner he stopped and listened attentively thats old jack he heard mrs nettles say the socalled night watchman hes completely crackers but quite harmless so if you come across him just ignore him old jack chuckled as her voice faded with each step she took as he strolled back towards the railway carriage he wondered how long it would be before harry came to seek his advice on whether he should enter his name for a choral scholarship to st bedes harry knocked on the carriage door strolled in and took the seat opposite old jack in first class during term time at st bedes harry had only been able to see old jack regularly on saturday mornings jack had returned the compliment by attending matins at st mary redcliffe where from the back pew he enjoyed watching mr frobisher and mr holcombe beam with pride at his protégé in the school holidays old jack could never be sure exactly when harry was going to turn up because he treated the railway carriage like a second home whenever he returned to st bedes at the beginning of a new term old jack missed the boys company he was touched when mrs clifton described him as the father harry never had in truth harry was the son hed always wanted finished your paper round early said old jack rubbing his eyes and blinking when harry strolled into the carriage that saturday morning no you just dozed off old man said harry passing him a copy of the previous days times and youre getting cheekier by the day young man old jack said with a grin so hows the paper round working out good i think im going to be able to save enough money to buy my mum a watch a sensible present considering your mothers new job but can you afford it ive already saved four shillings said harry i reckon ill have about six by the end of the holidays have you chosen the watch you want yes its in mr deakinss display cabinet but it wont be there for much longer said harry grinning deakins a name old jack could never forget how much is it he asked no idea said harry im not going to ask mr deakins until the day before i go back to school old jack wasnt sure how to tell the boy that six shillings wasnt going to be enough to buy a watch so he changed the subject i hope the paper round isnt stopping you from studying im sure i dont have to remind you that the exams are getting closer by the day youre worse than the frob said harry but youll be pleased to learn that im spending two hours every morning in the library with deakins and another two most afternoons most afternoons well giles and i do occasionally go to the flicks and as gloucestershire are playing yorkshire at the county ground next week it will be a chance to see herbert sutcliffe batting youll miss giles when he goes to eton said old jack hes still working on his father to let him join me and deakins at bgs deakins and me said old jack and be warned if mr hugo has made up his mind it will take more than giles to shift him mr barrington doesnt like me said harry taking old jack by surprise what makes you say that he treats me differently from the other boys at st bedes its as if im not good enough to be a friend of his son youre going to have to face that problem all your life harry said old jack the english are the biggest snobs on earth and most of the time without reason the lesser the talent the bigger the snob in my experience its the only way the socalled upper classes can hope to survive be warned my boy they dont care for upstarts like you who barge into their club without an invitation but you dont treat me like that said harry thats because im not upper class said old jack laughing perhaps not but my mum says youre first class said harry so thats what i want to be it didnt help that old jack couldnt tell harry the real reason mr hugo was always so offhand he sometimes wished he hadnt been in the wrong place at the wrong time and witnessed what had really happened the day the boys father died have you fallen asleep again old man said harry because i cant hang around chatting to you all day i promised my mum id meet her at clarks in the broad because she wants to buy me a new pair of shoes not that i can see whats wrong with the pair ive got special lady your mum said old jack thats why im buying her a watch said harry the bell above the door rang as he entered the shop old jack hoped that enough time had passed to ensure that private deakins wouldnt remember him good morning sir how can i help you old jack couldnt fail to recognize mr deakins immediately he smiled and walked across to the display cabinet and studied the two watches on the top shelf i just need to know the price of this ingersoll the ladys or the gentlemans model sir asked mr deakins coming out from behind the counter the ladys said old jack deakins unlocked the cabinet with his one hand deftly removed the watch from its stand checked the label and said sixteen shillings sir good said old jack and placed a tenbob note on the counter mr deakins looked even more puzzled when harry clifton asks you how much the watch is mr deakins please tell him its six shillings because thats how much he will have saved by the time he stops working for you and i know hes hoping to buy it as a present for his mother you must be old jack said deakins hell be so touched that you but you wont ever tell him said old jack looking mr deakins in the eye i want him to believe that the price of the watch is six shillings i understand said mr deakins placing the watch back on the stand and how much is the mans watch one pound would you allow me to put down another ten bob as a deposit and then give you half a crown a week for the next month until ive paid off the full amount that is quite acceptable sir but wouldnt you like to try it on first no thank you said old jack its not for me im going to give it to harry when he wins a scholarship to bristol grammar school i had the same thought said mr deakins should my son algy be fortunate enough to win one then youd better order another one pretty quickly said old jack because harry tells me your sons a racing certainty mr deakins laughed and took a closer look at old jack have we met before sir i dont think so said old jack and left the shop without another word if muhammad wont come to the mountain old jack smiled to himself as he rose to greet mr holcombe and offered him a seat would you care to join me in the buffet car for a cup of tea old jack asked mrs clifton was kind enough to supply me with a quite excellent packet of earl grey no thank you sir said holcombe ive only just had breakfast so the boy just missed out on a scholarship said old jack assuming that was what the schoolmaster had come to see him about failed is how harry looks upon it said holcombe despite coming seventeenth out of three hundred and being offered a place in the schools a stream this september but will he be able to accept the offer it will place an extra financial burden on his mother as long as there are no unexpected bombshells she should be able to get harry through the next five years even so harry wont be able to afford the little extras most of the other boys will take for granted possibly but i have managed to cover some of his sundry expenses from the schools list so hell be able to consider at least two of the three extracurricular activities hes keen to sign up for let me guess said old jack the choir the theatre club and art appreciation said holcombe miss monday and miss tilly are taking responsibility for any trips the choir might make im covering the theatre club and so i get art appreciation said old jack his new passion i can still hold my own with harry when it comes to rembrandt and vermeer even this new chap matisse now hes trying to get me interested in a spaniard called picasso but i cant see it myself ive never heard of him admitted holcombe and i doubt if you ever will said old jack but dont tell harry i said so he picked up a small tin box opened it and took out three notes and almost all the coins he possessed no no said holcombe that isnt the reason i came to see you in fact i plan to visit mr craddick later this afternoon and im confident hell i think youll find that i take precedence over mr craddick said old jack handing across the money thats very generous of you money well spent said old jack even if it is the widows mite at least my father would approve he added as an afterthought your father repeated holcombe hes the resident canon at wells cathedral i had no idea said holcombe so at least youre able to visit him from time to time sadly not i fear i am a modern prodigal son said old jack not wishing to go any further down that road he said so tell me young man why did you want to see me i cant remember the last occasion anyone called me young man just be grateful that anyone still does said old jack holcombe laughed ive got a couple of tickets for the school play julius caesar as harry is performing i thought you might like to join me for the opening night i knew he was auditioning said old jack what part did he get hes playing cinna said holcombe then well know him by his gait holcombe bowed low does that mean youll join me i fear not said old jack raising a hand its extremely kind of you to think of me holcombe but im not yet ready for a live performance even as just a member of the audience old jack was disappointed to miss harrys performance in the school play and had to be satisfied with being told the boys version of how he had performed the following year when holcombe suggested that perhaps old jack should attend because harrys roles were getting bigger he nearly gave in but it wasnt until harry played puck a year later that he finally allowed the dream a reality although he was still fearful of large crowds old jack had decided that he would slip into the back of the school hall where no one would see him or even worse recognize him it was while he was trimming his beard in the fifthfloor washroom of barrington house that he noticed the screaming headline in a copy of the local rag that someone had left behind tillys tea shop burnt to the ground arson suspected when he saw the photograph below it he felt sick mrs clifton was standing on the pavement surrounded by her staff surveying the burntout remains of the shop turn to page for full story old jack obeyed the instruction but there was no page he quickly left the washroom hoping to find the missing page on miss pottss desk he wasnt surprised to find that her desk was clear and her wastepaper basket had been emptied he tentatively opened the door to the managing directors office looked inside and spotted the missing page laid out on mr hugos desk he sat down in the highbacked leather chair and began to read jacks immediate reaction once hed finished was to wonder if harry would have to leave school the report noted that unless the insurance company paid the full amount on her premium mrs clifton would be facing bankruptcy the reporter went on to say that a spokesman for the bristol and west of england had made it clear that the company wouldnt be paying out a brass farthing until the police had eliminated all suspects from their enquiries what else could possibly go wrong for the poor woman old jack wondered the reporter had been careful not to refer to maisie by name but old jack wasnt in any doubt why her photograph was so prominently displayed on the front page he continued to read the article when he discovered that detective inspector blakemore was in charge of the case he felt a little more hopeful it wouldnt take that particular gentleman long to work out that mrs clifton built things up she didnt burn them down as old jack placed the newspaper back on mr hugos desk he noticed a letter for the first time he would have ignored it none of his business if he hadnt seen the name mrs clifton in the first paragraph he began to read the letter and found it hard to believe it was hugo barrington who had put up the five hundred pounds that had made it possible for mrs clifton to purchase tillys why would he want to help maisie he wondered was it possible he felt some remorse about the death of her husband or did he feel ashamed that he had sent an innocent man to prison for a crime he had not committed certainly he had given tancock his old job back the moment he was released old jack began to wonder if he should perhaps give hugo the benefit of the doubt he recalled sir walters words hes not all bad you know he read the letter once again it was from mr prendergast the manager of the national provincial bank who wrote that he had been pressing the insurance company to fulfil its contractual obligations and recompense mrs clifton for the full value of the policy which was mrs clifton prendergast pointed out was the innocent party and detective inspector blakemore had recently informed the bank that she no longer played any part in his enquiries in the final paragraph of his letter prendergast suggested that he and barrington should meet in the near future to resolve the matter so that mrs clifton could receive the full amount she was entitled to old jack looked up when the little clock on the desk chimed seven times he switched off the light ran into the corridor and down the stairs he didnt want to be late for harrys performance when old jack got home later that night he picked up a copy of the times harry had left for him earlier in the week he never bothered with the personal ads on the front page as he didnt need a new bowler hat a pair of suspenders or a first edition of wuthering heights he turned the page to find a photo of king edward viii enjoying a yachting holiday in the mediterranean standing by his side was an american woman called mrs simpson the report was couched in ambiguous terms but even the thunderer was finding it hard to support the young king in his desire to marry a divorced woman it made old jack sad because he admired edward especially after his visit to the welsh miners when he had so clearly been affected by their plight but as his old nanny used to say therell be tears before bedtime old jack then spent some considerable time reading a report on the tariff reform bill which had just passed its second reading in the house despite the firebrand winston churchill declaring that it was neither fish nor fowl and no one would benefit from it including the government when it came to an election he couldnt wait to hear sir walters unexpurgated views on that particular subject he turned a page to learn that the british broadcasting corporation had made its first television broadcast from alexandra palace this was a concept he couldnt begin to comprehend how could a picture be beamed into your home he didnt even have a radio and had absolutely no desire to own a television he moved on to the sports pages to find a photograph of an elegantly dressed fred perry under the headline three times wimbledon champion tipped to win the american open the tennis correspondent went on to suggest that some of the foreign competitors might be wearing shorts at forest hills something else jack couldnt come to terms with as he did whenever he read the times old jack saved the obituaries till last hed reached that age when men younger than himself were dying and not just in wars when he turned the page the colour drained from his face and he experienced an overwhelming sadness he took his time reading the obituary of the reverend thomas alexander tarrant resident canon of wells cathedral described in the headline as a godly man when old jack had finished reading his fathers obituary he felt ashamed seven pounds four shillings repeated old jack but i thought you got a cheque for six hundred pounds from the bristol and west of england insurance company in full and final settlement if i recall the exact words i did said maisie but by the time id paid back the original loan the compound interest on that loan as well as bank charges i ended up with seven pounds and four shillings im so naive said old jack and to think that for a moment just a moment i actually thought barrington was trying to be helpful youre not half as naive as me said maisie because if i had thought even for one moment that man was involved i would never have taken a penny of his money and because i did ive lost everything even my job at the hotel but why asked old jack mr frampton always said you were irreplaceable well it seems im not any more when i asked him why hed sacked me he refused to give a reason other than to say hed received a complaint about me from an unimpeachable source it cant be a coincidence that i was sacked the day after that unimpeachable source dropped into the royal hotel for a chat with the manager did you see barrington going into the hotel asked old jack no i didnt but i saw him coming out dont forget i was hiding in the back of his car waiting for him of course said old jack so what happened when you confronted him about harry while we were in the car said maisie he virtually admitted to being responsible for arthurs death he finally came clean after all these years said old jack in disbelief not exactly said maisie more a slip of the tongue but when i left the envelope with the invoice for next terms fees on the front seat of his car he put it in his pocket and said hed see what he could do to help and you fell for it hook line and sinker admitted maisie because when he stopped the car he even got out to open the back door for me but the moment i stepped out he knocked me to the ground tore up the bill and drove off is that how you got the black eye maisie nodded and he also warned me hed have me committed to a mental asylum if i even thought about contacting his wife thats nothing more than a bluff said old jack because even he couldnt get away with that you may be right said maisie but its not a risk im willing to take and if you did tell mrs barrington that her husband was responsible for arthurs death said old jack all hed have to do is let her know youre stan tancocks sister and shed dismiss it out of hand possibly said maisie but she wouldnt dismiss it out of hand if i told her her husband might be harrys father old jack was stunned into silence as he tried to take in the implications of maisies words im not only naive he eventually managed but im also bone stupid hugo barrington wont care if his wife does or doesnt believe he was involved in your husbands death his greatest fear is harry ever finding out that he might be his father but i would never tell harry said maisie the last thing id want is for him to spend the rest of his life wondering who his father is that is precisely what barrington is banking on and now hes broken you hell be hellbent on destroying harry but why asked maisie harrys never done him any harm of course he hasnt but if harry were able to prove that he is hugo barringtons eldest son he might just be in line to inherit not only the title but everything that goes with it and at the same time giles would end up with nothing it was maisies turn to be speechless so now weve discovered the real reason barrington is so keen to have harry thrown out of the grammar school perhaps the time has come for me to pay a visit to sir walter and tell him some unpalatable truths about his son no please dont do that begged maisie why not it might be our one chance of keeping harry at bgs possibly but it would also guarantee that my brother stan would get the sack and god knows what else barrington is capable of old jack didnt reply for some time then he said if you wont allow me to tell sir walter the truth ill have to start crawling around in the sewer that hugo barrington currently occupies you want what asked miss potts not sure shed heard him correctly a private meeting with mr hugo said old jack and am i permitted to enquire what the purpose of this meeting might be she said making no attempt to hide the sarcasm in her voice his sons future wait here for a moment ill see if mr barrington is willing to see you miss potts knocked gently on the managing directors door and disappeared inside she returned a moment later with a surprised look on her face mr barrington will see you now she said holding open the door old jack couldnt resist a smile as he strolled past her hugo barrington looked up from behind his desk he didnt offer the old man a seat and made no attempt to shake hands with him what possible interest can you have in giless future asked barrington none admitted old jack its your other son whose future im interested in what the hell are you talking about said barrington a little too loudly if you didnt know who i was talking about you wouldnt have agreed to see me replied old jack contemptuously the colour drained from barringtons face old jack even wondered if he was going to faint what do you want from me he finally said all your life youve been a trader said old jack i am in possession of something youll want to trade and what could that possibly be the day after arthur clifton mysteriously disappeared and stan tancock was arrested for a crime he didnt commit i was asked by detective inspector blakemore to make a statement of everything id witnessed that evening because you had blakemore taken off the case that statement remains in my possession i have a feeling it would make very interesting reading if it were to fall into the wrong hands i think youll find thats blackmail said barrington spitting out the words for which you can go to prison for a very long time some might consider it nothing more than a matter of civic duty for such a document to enter the public domain and who do you imagine would be interested in the ravings of an old man certainly not the press once my lawyers have explained the libel laws to them and as the police closed the file some years ago i cant see the chief constable going to the trouble and expense of reopening it on the word of an old man who might be considered at best eccentric and at worst mad so im bound to ask who else do you have in mind to share your preposterous allegations with your father said old jack bluffing but then barrington didnt know about his promise to maisie barrington slumped back in his chair only too aware of the influence old jack had with his father even if he had never understood why how much do you expect me to pay for this document three hundred pounds thats daylight robbery its no more and no less than the amount required to cover the fees and any little extras that will allow harry clifton to remain at bristol grammar school for the next two years why dont i just pay his fees at the beginning of each term as i do for my own son because you would stop paying one of your sons fees the moment you got your hands on my statement youll have to take cash said barrington taking a key from his pocket no thank you said old jack i remember only too well what happened to stan tancock after youd handed him your thirty pieces of silver and i have no desire to spend the next three years in prison for a crime i didnt commit then ill have to call the bank if im to write out a cheque for such a large amount be my guest said old jack gesturing towards the phone on barringtons desk barrington hesitated for a moment before picking up the handset he waited for a voice to come on the line tem he said another wait before another voice said yes is that you prendergast no sir said the voice good youre just the man i need to speak to barrington replied ill be sending a mr tar around to see you in the next hour with a cheque for three hundred pounds made payable to bristol municipal charities would you see that its processed immediately and make sure you phone me straight back if you want me to ring you back just say yes thats right and ill call in a couple of minutes the voice said yes thats right said barrington and put the phone down he opened the drawer of his desk took out a cheque book and wrote the words pay bristol municipal charities and on a separate line three hundred pounds he then signed the cheque and passed it to old jack who studied it carefully and nodded ill just put it in an envelope said barrington he pressed the buzzer under his desk old jack glanced at miss potts as she entered the room yes sir mr tar is leaving to go to the bank said barrington placing the cheque in the envelope he sealed it and addressed it to mr prendergast adding the word private in bold letters then handed it to old jack thank you said jack ill deliver the document to you personally as soon as i get back barrington nodded just as the phone on his desk began to ring he waited for old jack to leave the room before he picked it up old jack decided to take the tram into bristol feeling that the expense was justified on such a special occasion when he walked into the bank twenty minutes later he told the young man on the reception that he had a letter for mr prendergast the receptionist didnt seem particularly impressed until old jack added its from mr hugo barrington the young man immediately deserted his post led old jack across the banking hall and down a long corridor to the managers office he knocked on the door opened it and announced this gentleman has a letter from mr barrington sir mr prendergast leapt up from behind his desk shook hands with the old man and ushered him to a seat on the other side of the desk old jack handed the envelope to prendergast with the words mr barrington asked me to give this to you personally yes of course said prendergast who immediately recognized the familiar hand of one of his most valued customers he slit open the envelope and extracted a cheque he looked at it for a moment before saying there must be some mistake theres no mistake said old jack mr barrington would like the full amount to be paid to bristol municipal charities at your earliest convenience as he instructed you over the phone only half an hour ago but i havent spoken to mr barrington this morning said prendergast passing the cheque back to old jack old jack stared in disbelief at a blank cheque it only took him a few moments to realize that barrington must have switched the cheques when miss potts entered the room the true genius of his action was to address the envelope to mr prendergast and mark it private thus ensuring it wouldnt be opened until it had been handed to the manager but the one mystery jack couldnt fathom was who had been on the other end of the phone old jack hurried out of the office without saying another word to prendergast he crossed the banking hall and ran out into the street he only had to wait a few minutes for a tram to the docks he couldnt have been away for much more than an hour by the time he walked back through the gates and into the dockyard a man he didnt recognize was striding towards him he had a military air about him and old jack wondered if the limp had been caused by an injury hed suffered in the great war old jack hurried past him and on down the quayside he was relieved to see that the carriage door was closed and when he opened it he was even more pleased to find that everything was just as hed left it he sank to his knees and lifted the corner of the carpet but the police statement was no longer there detective inspector blakemore would have described the theft as the work of a professional old jack took his place in the fifth row of the congregation hoping no one would recognize him the cathedral was so packed that people who had been unable to find a seat in the side chapels stood in the aisles and were crammed in at the back the bishop of bath and wells brought tears to old jacks eyes when he talked about his fathers unquestioning faith in god and how since the premature death of his wife the canon had devoted himself to serving the community the proof of which proclaimed the bishop raising his arms to acknowledge the vast congregation can be seen by the number of those present who have come to honour him from so many walks of life and to pay their respects and although the man knew no vanity he could not hide a certain pride in his only son jack whose selfless courage bravery and willingness to sacrifice his own life in south africa during the boer war saved so many of his comrades and led to him being awarded the victoria cross he paused looked down into the fifth row and said and how delighted i am to see him in the congregation today several people began looking around for a man they had never seen before jack bowed his head in shame at the end of the service many members of the congregation came up to tell captain tarrant how much they had admired his father the words dedication selflessness generosity and love fell from everyones lips jack felt proud of being his fathers son while at the same time ashamed that he had excluded him from his life in the same way as he had the rest of his fellow men as he was leaving he thought he recognized an elderly gentleman standing by the great gates clearly waiting to speak to him the man stepped forward and raised his hat captain tarrant he enquired with a voice that suggested authority jack returned the compliment yes sir my name is edwin trent i had the privilege of being your fathers solicitor and id like to think one of his oldest and closest friends jack shook him warmly by the hand i remember you well sir you taught me a love of trollope and an appreciation of the finer points of spin bowling its kind of you to remember trent chuckled i wonder if i might accompany you on your way back to the station of course sir as you know said trent as they began walking towards the town your father was resident canon of this cathedral for the past nine years youll also know that he cared nothing for worldly goods and shared even the little he had with those less fortunate than himself if he were to be canonized he would surely be the patron saint of vagabonds old jack smiled he recalled going to school one morning without breakfast because three tramps were sleeping in the hallway and to quote his mother they had eaten them out of house and home so when his will comes to be read continued trent it will show that just as he entered this world with nothing he has also left it with nothing other than a thousand friends that is which he would have considered a veritable fortune before he died he entrusted me with one small task should you attend his funeral namely that of handing you the last letter he ever wrote he extracted an envelope from an inside pocket of his overcoat and handed it to old jack raised his hat once more and said i have carried out his request and am proud to have met his son once again i am obliged sir i only wish that i hadnt made it necessary for him to have to write in the first place jack raised his hat and the two men parted old jack decided that he would not read his fathers letter until he was on the train and had begun the journey back to bristol as the engine shunted out of the station billowing clouds of grey smoke jack settled back in a thirdclass compartment as a child he remembered asking his father why he always travelled third class to which he had replied because there isnt a fourth class it was ironic that for the past thirty years jack had been living in first class he took his time unsealing the envelope and even after he had extracted the letter he left it folded while he continued to think about his father no son could have asked for a better mentor or friend when he looked back on his life all his actions judgements and decisions were nothing more than pale imitations of his fathers when he finally unfolded the letter another flood of memories came rushing back the moment he saw the familiar bold copperplate hand in jetblack ink he began to read the close wells cathedral wells somerset th august my beloved son if you were kind enough to attend my funeral you must now be reading this letter allow me to begin by thanking you for being among the congregation old jack raised his head and looked out at the passing countryside he felt guilty once again for treating his father in such an inconsiderate and thoughtless manner and now it was too late to ask for his forgiveness his eyes returned to the letter when you were awarded the victoria cross i was the proudest father in england and your citation still hangs above my desk to this very day but then as the years passed my happiness turned to sorrow and i asked our lord what i had done that i should be so punished by losing not only your dear mother but also you my only child i accept that you must have had some noble purpose for turning your head and your heart against this world but i wish you had shared your reason for so doing with me but should you read this letter perhaps you might grant me one last wish old jack removed the handkerchief from his top pocket and wiped his eyes before he was able to continue reading god gave you the remarkable gift of leadership and the ability to inspire your fellow men so i beg you not to go to your grave knowing that when the time comes for you to face your maker you will as in the parable matthew v have to confess that you buried the one talent he gave you rather use that gift for the benefit of your fellow men so that when your time comes as it surely must and those same men attend your funeral the victoria cross will not be the only thing they remember when they hear the name jack tarrant your loving father are you all right my luv asked a lady who had moved from the other side of the carriage to sit next to old jack yes thank you he said the tears streaming down his face its just that i was released from prison today giles barrington i was thrilled when i saw harry walk through the school gates on the first day of term id spent the summer hols at our villa in tuscany so i wasnt in bristol when tillys was burnt to the ground and didnt find out about it until i returned to england the weekend before term began i had wanted harry to join us in italy but my father wouldnt hear of it ive never met anyone who didnt like harry with the exception of my father who wont even allow his name to be mentioned in the house i once asked mama if she could explain why he felt so strongly but she didnt seem to know any more than i did i didnt press the point with my old man as ive never exactly covered myself in glory in his eyes i nearly got myself expelled from my prep school for stealing heaven knows how he managed to fix that and after that i let him down by failing to get into eton i told papa when i came out of the exam that i couldnt have tried harder which was the truth well half the truth i would have got away with it if my coconspirator had only kept his mouth shut at least it taught me a simple lesson if you make a deal with a fool dont be surprised when they act foolishly my coconspirator was the earl of bridports son percy he was facing an even greater dilemma than i was because seven generations of bridports had been educated at eton and it was looking as if young percy was going to ruin that rather fine batting average eton has been known to bend the rules when it comes to members of the aristocracy and will occasionally allow a stupid boy to darken its doors which is why i selected percy for my little subterfuge in the first place it was after i overheard the frob saying to another beak if bridport was any brighter hed be a halfwit that i knew i didnt need to look any further for my accomplice percy was as desperate to be offered a place at eton as i was to be rejected so i saw this as no more than an opportunity for both of us to achieve our purpose i didnt discuss my plan with harry or deakins harry would undoubtedly have disapproved hes such a morally upright fellow and deakins wouldnt have been able to understand why anyone would want to fail an exam on the day before the examination was due to take place my father drove me to eton in his swish new bugatti which could do a hundred miles an hour and once we hit the a he proved it we spent the night at the swann arms the same hotel in which he had stayed over twenty years before when he took the entrance exam over dinner papa didnt leave me in any doubt how keen he was that i should go to eton and i nearly had a change of heart at the last moment but i had given my word to percy bridport and felt i couldnt let him down percy and i had shaken hands on the deal back at st bedes agreeing that when we entered the examination hall we would give the recorder the others name i rather enjoyed being addressed as my lord by all and sundry even if it was only for a few hours the examination papers were not as demanding as the ones id sat a fortnight earlier for bristol grammar and i felt id done more than enough to ensure that percy would be returning to eton in september however they were difficult enough for me to feel confident that his lordship would not let me down once wed handed in our papers and reverted to our true personas i went off to tea with my pa in windsor when he asked me how it had gone i told him id done the best i possibly could he seemed satisfied by this and even began to relax which only made me feel more guilty i didnt enjoy the journey back to bristol and felt even worse when i got home and my mother asked me the same question ten days later i received an im sorry to have to inform you letter from eton i had only managed per cent percy scored per cent and was offered a place for the michaelmas term which delighted his father and was met with incredulity by the frob everything would have worked out just fine if percy hadnt told a friend how hed managed to get into eton the friend told another friend who told another friend who told percys father the earl of bridport mc being an honourable man immediately informed the headmaster of eton this resulted in percy being expelled before hed even set foot in the place if it hadnt been for a personal intervention by the frob i might have suffered the same fate at bristol grammar my father tried to convince the headmaster of eton that it was simply a clerical error and that as id actually scored per cent in the exam i should be reinstated in bridports place this piece of logic was rejected by return of post as eton wasnt in need of a new cricket pavilion i duly reported to bristol grammar school on the first day of term during my first year i restored my reputation somewhat by scoring three centuries for the colts and ended the season being awarded my colours harry played ursula in much ado about nothing and deakins was deakins so no one was surprised when he won the first form prize during my second year i became more aware of the financial constraints harrys mother must be experiencing when i noticed that he was wearing his shoes with the laces undone and he admitted they were pinching because they were so tight so when tillys was burnt to the ground only weeks before we were expected to enter the sixth form i was not altogether surprised to learn that harry thought he might not be able to stay on at the school i thought about asking my father if he might be able to help but mama told me i would be wasting my time thats why i was so delighted when i saw him walking through the school gates on the first day of term he told me that his mother had begun a new job at the royal hotel working nights and it was proving to be far more lucrative than she had originally thought possible during the next summer hols i would once again have liked to invite harry to join the family in tuscany but i knew my father would not consider the idea but as the arts appreciation society of which harry was now secretary was planning a trip to rome we agreed to meet up there even if it did mean i would have to visit the villa borghese although we were living in a little bubble of our own down in the west country it would have been impossible not to be aware of what was taking place on the continent the rise of the nazis in germany and the fascists in italy didnt seem to be affecting the average englishman who was still enjoying a pint of cider and a cheese sandwich at his local on a saturday before watching or in my case playing cricket on the village green in the afternoon for years this blissful state of affairs had been able to continue because another war with germany didnt bear thinking about our fathers had fought in the war to end all wars but now the unmentionable seemed to be on everyones lips harry told me in no uncertain terms that if war was declared he wouldnt be going to university but would join up immediately just as his father and uncle had done some twenty years before my father had missed out as he put it because unfortunately he was colourblind and those in authority thought hed serve the war effort better by remaining at his post playing an important role in the docks though ive never been quite sure exactly what that important role was in our final year at bgs both harry and i decided to enter our names for oxford deakins had already been offered an open scholarship to balliol college i wanted to go to the house but was informed most politely by the entrance tutor that christ church rarely took grammar school boys so i settled for brasenose which had once been described by bertie wooster as a college where brains are neither here nor there as brasenose was also the college with the most cricket blues and i had scored three centuries in my final year as captain of bgs one of them at lords for a public schools xi i felt i must be in with a chance in fact my form master dr paget told me that when i went for my interview they would probably throw a cricket ball at me as i entered the room if i caught it i would be offered a place if i caught it onehanded a scholarship this turned out to be apocryphal however im bound to admit that during drinks with the college principal he asked me more questions about hutton than horace there were other highs and lows during my last two years at school jesse owens winning four gold medals at the olympic games in berlin right under hitlers nose was a definite high while the abdication of edward viii because he wished to marry an american divorcee was an undoubted low the nation seemed to be divided on whether the king should have abdicated as were harry and i i failed to understand how a man born to be king could be willing to sacrifice the throne to marry a divorced woman harry was far more sympathetic to the kings plight saying that we couldnt begin to understand what the poor man was going through until we fell in love ourselves i dismissed this as codswallop until that trip to rome that was to change both our lives if giles imagined hed worked hard during his final days at st bedes in those last two years at bristol grammar school both he and harry became acquainted with hours only deakins was familiar with dr paget their sixthform master told them in no uncertain terms that if they hoped to be offered a place at oxford or cambridge they would have to forget any other activities as they would need to spend every waking moment preparing for the entrance exams giles was hoping to captain the schools first xi in his final year while harry was keen to land the lead in the school play dr paget raised an eyebrow when he heard this even though romeo and juliet was the set text for oxford that year just be sure you dont sign up for anything else he said firmly harry reluctantly resigned from the choir which gave him two more free evenings a week to study however there was one activity no pupil could exempt himself from every tuesday and thursday at four oclock all the boys had to be standing to attention on the parade ground fully kitted out and ready for inspection as members of the combined cadet force cant allow the hitler youth to imagine that if germany is foolish enough to declare war on us a second time we wont be ready for them bellowed the rsm every time exregimental sergeant major roberts delivered these words it sent a shiver through the ranks of schoolboys who realized as each day passed that it was becoming more and more likely they would be serving on the front line as junior officers in some foreign field rather than going up to university as undergraduates harry took the rsms words to heart and was quickly promoted to cadet officer giles took them less seriously knowing that if he was called up he could like his father take the easy way out and remind them of his colourblindness to avoid coming face to face with the enemy deakins showed little interest in the whole process declaring with a certainty that brooked no argument you dont need to know how to strip a bren gun when youre in the intelligence corps by the time the long summer nights began to draw to a close they were all ready for a holiday before they would return for their final year at the end of which they would have to face the examiners once again within a week of term ending all three of them had left for their summer break giles to join his family at their villa in tuscany harry to rome with the schools arts appreciation society while deakins entombed himself in bristol central library avoiding contact with any other human beings despite the fact that hed already been offered a place at oxford over the years giles had come to accept that if he wanted to see harry during the holidays he had to make sure his father didnt find out what he was up to otherwise the bestlaid schemes of mice and but in order to achieve this he often had to get his sister emma to join in the subterfuge and she never failed to extract her pound of flesh before agreeing to become his accomplice if you take the lead over dinner tonight ill follow up said giles once hed outlined his latest scheme to her sounds like the natural order of things said emma scornfully after the first course had been served emma innocently asked her mother if she could possibly take her to the villa borghese the following day as it had been recommended as a must by her art mistress she was well aware that mama had already made other plans im so sorry darling she said but your father and i are going to lunch with the hendersons in arezzo tomorrow youre most welcome to join us theres nothing to stop giles taking you into rome interjected his father from the other end of the table do i have to said giles who had just been about to make the same suggestion yes you do replied his father firmly but whats the point pa by the time we get there well have to turn round and come back its hardly worth it not if you were to spend the night at the plaza hotel ill call them first thing in the morning and book a couple of rooms are you sure theyre grown up enough for that asked mrs barrington sounding a little anxious giles will be eighteen in a few weeks its time he grew up and took some responsibility giles bowed his head as if he had given in meekly the following morning a taxi drove him and emma to the local station just in time to catch the early morning train to rome be sure to take care of your sister were his fathers last words before they left the villa i will promised giles as the car drove off several men rose to offer emma their seat as she entered the carriage while giles was left standing for the entire journey on arrival in rome they took a taxi to the via del corso and once theyd booked into their hotel they continued on to the villa borghese giles was struck by how many young men not much older than himself were in uniform while almost every pillar and lamppost they passed displayed a poster of mussolini once the taxi had dropped them off they made their way up through the gardens passing more men in uniform and even more posters of il duce before they finally reached the palatial villa borghese harry had written to tell giles they would be setting out on their official tour at ten oclock he checked his watch a few minutes past eleven with luck the tour would be nearly over he bought two tickets handed one to emma bounded up the steps to the galleria and went in search of the school party emma took her time admiring the bernini statues that dominated the first four rooms but then she wasnt in a hurry giles went from gallery to gallery until he spotted a group of young men dressed in dark claret jackets and black flannel trousers who were crowded around a small portrait of an elderly man dressed in a cream silk cassock with a white mitre on his head there they are he said but emma was nowhere to be seen not giving his sister another thought he headed over to the attentive group the moment he saw her he quite forgot the reason he had come to rome caravaggio was commissioned to paint this portrait of pope paul v in she said with a slight accent you will notice that it was not finished and that is because the artist had to flee from rome why miss demanded a young boy in the front row who was clearly determined to take deakinss place at some time in the future because he became involved in a drunken brawl during which he ended up killing a man did they arrest him asked the same boy no said the tour guide caravaggio always managed to move on to the next city before the forces of justice could catch up with him but in the end the holy father decided to grant him a pardon why demanded the same boy because he wanted caravaggio to carry out several more commissions for him some of them are among the seventeen works that can still be seen in rome today at that moment harry spotted giles gazing in awe in the direction of the painting he left the group and walked across to join him how long have you been standing there he asked long enough to fall in love said giles his eyes still fixed on the tour guide harry laughed when he realized it wasnt the painting giles was staring at but the elegant selfassured young woman who was addressing the boys i think shes a bit out of your age group said harry and i suspect even your price range im willing to take that risk said giles as the guide led her little group into the next room giles followed obediently and positioned himself so he had a clear view of her while the rest of the group studied a statue of paolina borghese by canova arguably the greatest sculptor of all time she said giles wasnt going to disagree with her well that brings us to the end of our tour she announced but if you have any more questions i will be here for a few more minutes so dont hesitate to ask giles didnt hesitate harry watched in amusement as his friend strode up to the young italian woman and began chatting to her as if they were old friends even the little boy from the front row didnt dare to interrupt him giles rejoined harry a few minutes later a large grin plastered across his face shes agreed to have dinner with me tonight i dont believe you said harry but a problem has arisen he added ignoring his friends doubting thomas look more than one i suspect which can be overcome with your assistance you need a chaperone to accompany you suggested harry just in case things get out of hand no you ass i want you to take care of my sister while caterina introduces me to romes nightlife not a hope said harry i didnt come all the way to rome just to act as your babysitter but youre my best friend pleaded giles if you wont help me who else can i turn to why dont you try paolina borghese i doubt if she has any plans for tonight all you have to do is take her out for dinner and make sure shes in bed by ten forgive me for mentioning it giles but i thought youd come to rome to have dinner with me ill give you a thousand lira if you take her off my hands and we can still have breakfast at my hotel in the morning im not that easily bribed and said giles playing his trump card ill also give you my recording of caruso singing la boheme harry turned to find a young girl standing by his side by the way said giles this is my sister emma hello said harry turning back to giles he said youve got yourself a deal harry joined giles for breakfast at the palace hotel the following morning when his friend greeted him with the same immodest smile he always wore just after hed scored a century so how was caterina harry asked not wanting to hear his reply beyond my wildest dreams harry was about to question him more closely when a waiter appeared by his side cappuccino per favore then he asked so how far did she let you go all the way said giles harrys mouth fell open but no words came out did you did i what did you harry tried again yes see her naked yes of course the whole body naturally said giles as a cup of coffee was placed in front of harry the bottom half as well as the top everything said giles and i mean everything did you touch her breasts i licked her nipples actually said giles taking a sip of coffee you did what you heard me said giles but did you i mean did you yes i did how many times i lost count said giles she was insatiable seven perhaps eight she just wouldnt let me get to sleep id still be there now if she hadnt had to be at the vatican museum at ten this morning to lecture the next bunch of brats but what if she gets pregnant said harry dont be so naive harry try to remember shes an italian after another sip of coffee he asked so how did my sister behave herself the food was excellent and you owe me your caruso recording that bad well we cant all be winners neither of them had noticed emma enter the room until she was standing by their side harry leapt up and offered her his seat sorry to leave you he said but i have to be at the vatican museum by ten give caterina my love shouted giles as harry almost ran out of the breakfast room giles waited until harry was out of sight before he asked his sister so how did last night go could have been worse she said picking up a croissant a bit serious isnt he you should meet deakins emma laughed well at least the food was good but dont forget i now own your gramophone giles later described it as the most memorable night of his life for all the wrong reasons the annual play is one of the major events in the bristol grammar school calendar not least because the city boasts a fine theatre tradition and was to prove a vintage year the school like so many others in the country performed one of shakespeares set texts for the year the choice had been between romeo and juliet and a midsummer nights dream dr paget chose the tragedy rather than the comedy not least because he had a romeo and he didnt have a bottom for the first time in the schools history the young ladies of red maids on the other side of the city were invited to audition for the girls parts but not before several discussions had taken place with miss webb the headmistress who had insisted on a set of ground rules that would have impressed a mother superior the play was to be performed on three consecutive evenings in the last week of term as always the saturday night was sold out first because former pupils and the parents of the cast wished to attend the closing night giles was standing anxiously in the foyer checking his watch every few moments as he waited impatiently for his parents and younger sister to arrive he hoped that harry would give another fine performance and his father would finally come round to accepting him the critic from the bristol evening world had described harrys performance as mature beyond his years but he had saved the highest praise for juliet reporting that he had not seen the death scene performed more movingly even at stratford giles shook hands with mr frobisher as he walked into the foyer his old housemaster introduced his guest a mr holcombe before they went through to the great hall to take their seats a murmur rippled around the audience when captain tarrant walked down the centre aisle and took his place in the front row his recent appointment as a governor of the school had been met with universal approval as he leant across to have a word with the chairman of the governors he spotted maisie clifton sitting just a few rows behind he gave her a warm smile but didnt recognize the man she was sitting with the next surprise came when he studied the cast list the headmaster and mrs barton were among the last members of the audience to enter the great hall they took their places in the front row alongside sir walter barrington and captain tarrant giles was becoming more nervous with each passing minute he was beginning to wonder if his parents would turn up before the curtain rose im so sorry giles said his mother when they finally appeared its my fault i lost track of time she added as she and grace hurried into the hall his father followed a yard behind and raised his eyebrows when he saw his son giles didnt hand him a programme as he wanted it to be a surprise although he had shared the news with his mother who like him hoped her husband would finally treat harry as if he were a friend of the family and not an outsider the curtain rose only moments after the barringtons had taken their seats and a hush of anticipation descended on the packed audience when harry made his first entrance giles glanced in his fathers direction as there didnt appear to be any immediate reaction he began to relax for the first time that evening but this happy state of affairs only lasted until the ballroom scene when romeo and hugo saw juliet for the first time some people in the seats near the barringtons became irritated by a restless man who was spoiling their enjoyment of the play with his loud whispering and demands to see a programme they became even more annoyed after romeo said is she not capulets daughter at which point hugo barrington stood up and barged along the row not caring whose feet he trod on he then marched down the centre aisle pushed his way through the swing doors and disappeared into the night it was some time before romeo fully regained his composure sir walter tried to give the impression he hadnt noticed what was going on behind him and although captain tarrant frowned his eyes never left the stage had he turned round he would have seen mrs clifton was ignoring barringtons unscripted exit as she concentrated on every word the two young lovers had to say during the interval giles went in search of his father but couldnt find him he checked the car park but there was no sign of the bugatti when he returned to the foyer he saw his grandfather bending down and whispering in his mothers ear has hugo gone completely mad asked sir walter no hes sane enough said elizabeth making no attempt to hide her anger then what in heavens name does he think hes up to i have no idea could it possibly have something to do with the clifton boy she would have replied if jack tarrant hadnt walked across to join them your daughter has a remarkable talent elizabeth he said after kissing her hand as well as the advantage of inheriting your beauty and youre an old flatterer jack she said before adding i dont think youve met my son giles good evening sir said giles its a great honour to meet you may i congratulate you on your recent appointment thank you young man said tarrant and how do you feel about your friends performance remarkable but did you know good evening mrs barrington good evening headmaster i must be joining a long queue of those who wish to add their giles watched as captain tarrant slipped away to join harrys mother and wondered how they knew each other how lovely to see you captain tarrant and you mrs clifton and how glamorous youre looking tonight if cary grant had known that such beauty existed in bristol he would never have deserted us for hollywood he then lowered his voice did you have any idea that emma barrington was playing juliet no harry didnt mention it to me said maisie but then why should he lets hope that the affection they are displaying for one another on stage is nothing more than good acting because if its how they really feel about each other we may have an even bigger problem on our hands he looked around to make sure no one was eavesdropping on their conversation i presume you still havent said anything to harry not a word said maisie and from barringtons illmannered behaviour it seems he was also taken by surprise good evening captain tarrant said miss monday touching jacks arm miss tilly was by her side how good of you to come all the way down from london to see your protégé my dear miss monday said tarrant harrys every bit as much your protégé and hell be so pleased that you travelled all the way up from cornwall to see his performance miss monday beamed as a bell sounded to indicate the audience should return to their seats once everyone had settled back in their places the curtain rose for the second half although one seat in the sixth row remained conspicuously empty the death scene brought tears to the eyes of some who had never shed a tear in public while miss monday hadnt wept that much since harrys voice had broken the moment the final curtain fell the audience rose as one harry and emma were greeted by a storm of applause as they walked to the front of the stage holding hands and grown men who rarely showed their feelings cheered when they turned to bow to each other mrs barrington smiled and blushed good heavens they werent acting she said loud enough for giles to hear the same thought had also crossed the minds of maisie clifton and jack tarrant long before the actors took their final bow mrs barrington giles and grace went backstage to find romeo and juliet still holding hands as people queued up to lavish praise on them you were great said giles slapping his friend on the back i was all right said harry but emma was magnificent so when did all this happen he whispered it began in rome admitted harry with an impish grin and to think i sacrificed my caruso recording not to mention my gramophone to bring you two together as well as paying for our first dinner date wheres papa asked emma looking around grace was about to tell her sister what had happened when captain tarrant appeared congratulations my boy he said you were quite splendid thank you sir said harry but i dont think youve met the real star of the show no but let me assure you young lady if i was forty years younger id see off any of my rivals you dont have any rivals for my affection said emma harry never stops telling me how much youve done for him thats a twoway street said jack as harry spotted his mother and threw his arms around her im so proud of you said maisie thank you mum but let me introduce you to emma barrington he said placing an arm around emmas waist now i know why your son is so goodlooking said emma as she shook harrys mother by the hand may i introduce my mother she added it was a meeting maisie had thought about for many years but this was not a scenario that had ever crossed her mind she was apprehensive as she shook hands with elizabeth barrington but was greeted with such a friendly smile that it quickly became clear she was unaware of any possible connection between them and this is mr atkins said maisie introducing the man who had been sitting beside her during the performance harry had never come across mr atkins before looking at his mothers fur coat he wondered if atkins was the reason he now had three pairs of shoes he was about to speak to mr atkins when he was interrupted by dr paget who was keen to introduce him to professor henry wyld harry recognized the name at once i hear that youre hoping to come up to oxford to read english said wyld only if i can be taught by you sir i see that romeos charm has not been left behind on the stage and this is emma barrington sir oxfords merton professor of english language and literature gave a slight bow you were quite magnificent young lady thank you sir said emma i am also hoping to be taught by you she added ive applied to somerville for next year jack tarrant glanced at mrs clifton and couldnt miss the unmasked horror in her eyes grandfather said giles as the chairman of the governors joined them i dont think you know my friend harry clifton sir walter shook harry warmly by the hand before throwing his arms around his granddaughter you two made an old man proud he said it was becoming painfully clear to jack and maisie that the two starcrossed lovers had no idea of the problems they had set in motion sir walter ordered his chauffeur to drive mrs barrington and the children back to the manor house despite emmas triumph her mother made no attempt to hide her feelings as the car made its way towards chew valley as they drove through the gates and up to the house giles noticed that some lights were still on in the drawing room once the chauffeur had dropped them off elizabeth told giles emma and grace to go to bed in a tone of voice none of them had heard for many years while she headed for the drawing room giles and emma reluctantly climbed the wide staircase but sat down on the top step the moment their mother was out of sight while grace obediently went to her room giles even wondered if his mother had left the door open on purpose when elizabeth entered the room her husband didnt bother to stand up she noticed a half empty bottle of whisky and a tumbler on the table by his side no doubt you have some explanation for your unforgivable behaviour i dont have to explain anything i do to you emma somehow managed to rise above your appalling behaviour tonight barrington poured himself another tumbler of whisky and took a gulp i have arranged for emma to be removed from red maids immediately next term she will be enrolled at a school far enough away to ensure she never sees that boy again on the stairs emma burst into tears giles wrapped an arm around her what can harry clifton possibly have done to make you behave in such a shameful way its none of your business of course its my business said elizabeth trying to remain calm we are discussing our daughter and your sons closest friend if emma has fallen in love with harry and i suspect she has i cant think of a nicer or more decent young man for her to lose her heart to harry clifton is the son of a whore thats why her husband left her and i repeat emma will never be allowed to come in contact with the little bastard again im going to bed before i lose my temper said elizabeth dont even think of joining me in your present state i wasnt thinking of joining you in any state said barrington pouring himself another whisky you havent given me any pleasure in the bedroom for as long as i can remember emma leapt up and ran to her room locking the door behind her giles didnt move you are obviously drunk said elizabeth well discuss this in the morning when youre sober there will be nothing to discuss in the morning slurred barrington as his wife left the room a moment later his head fell back on the cushion and he began to snore when jenkins pulled back the shutters in the drawing room just before eight the following morning he showed no surprise when he found his master slumped in an armchair sound asleep and still wearing his dinner jacket the morning sunlight caused barrington to stir he blinked and peered at the butler before he checked his watch there will be a car coming to pick up miss emma in about an hours time jenkins so be sure shes packed and ready miss emma is not here sir what then where is she demanded barrington as he tried to stand up but wobbled unsteadily for a moment before falling back into the chair i have no idea sir she and mrs barrington left the house just after midnight where do you think theyve gone asked harry once giles had described what happened after he had arrived back at the manor house ive no idea said giles i was asleep when they left the house all i could get out of jenkins was that a taxi had taken them to the station just after midnight and you say your father was drunk when you returned home last night as a skunk and he hadnt sobered up by the time i came down for breakfast this morning he was shouting and screaming at anyone who crossed his path he even tried to blame me for everything that was when i decided to go and stay with my grandparents do you think your grandfather might know where they are i dont think so although he didnt seem that surprised when i told him what had happened grandma said i could stay with them for as long as i wanted to they cant be in bristol said harry if the taxi took them to the station they could be anywhere by now said giles neither of them spoke again for some time until harry suggested your villa in tuscany perhaps unlikely said giles thats the first place papa would think of so they wouldnt be safe there for long so it has to be somewhere your father would think twice about before going after them both boys fell silent again until harry said i can think of someone who might know where they are and whos that old jack said harry who still couldnt quite bring himself to call him captain tarrant i know hes become a friend of your mothers and she certainly trusts him do you know where he might be at the moment anyone who reads the times knows that said harry scornfully giles punched his friend on the arm so where is he clever clogs hell be at his office in london soho square if i remember correctly ive always wanted an excuse to spend a day in london said giles its just a pity ive left all my money back at the house not a problem said harry im flush that atkins fellow gave me a fiver although he did say i was to spend it on books dont worry said giles i can think of an alternative plan like what asked harry looking hopeful we can just sit around and wait for emma to write to you it was harrys turn to punch his friend ok he said but wed better get going before anyone finds out what were up to im not in the habit of travelling third class said giles as the train pulled out of temple meads well youd better get used to it while im paying said harry so tell me harry whats your friend captain tarrant up to i know the government has appointed him director of the citizens displacement unit which sounds pretty impressive but im not sure what he actually does what it says said harry hes responsible for finding accommodation for refugees in particular those families who are escaping the tyranny of nazi germany he says hes carrying on his fathers work class act your friend captain tarrant you dont know the half of it said harry tickets please the two boys spent most of the journey trying to work out where emma and mrs barrington could possibly be but by the time the train pulled into paddington station they still hadnt come to any firm conclusions they took the tube to leicester square emerged into the sunlight and went in search of soho square as they made their way through the west end giles became so distracted by the bright neon lights and shop windows full of goods hed never seen before that harry occasionally had to remind him why theyd actually come to london when they reached soho square neither of them could have missed the steady flow of bedraggled men women and children heads bowed shuffling in and out of a vast building on the far side of the square the two young men dressed in blazers grey flannels and ties looked strangely incongruous as they entered the building and followed the arrows directing them to the third floor several of the refugees stood to one side to allow them to pass assuming they must be there on official business giles and harry joined the long queue outside the directors office and might have been there for the rest of the day if a secretary had not come out and spotted them she walked straight up to harry and asked if he had come to see captain tarrant yes said harry hes an old friend i know said the woman i recognized you immediately how asked harry he has a photograph of you on his desk she said follow me captain tarrant will be delighted to see you old jacks face lit up when the two boys he should stop thinking of them as boys they were now young men walked into his office its good to see you both he said jumping up from behind his desk to greet them so who are you running away from this time he added with a smile my father said giles quietly old jack crossed the room closed the door and sat the two young men down on an uncomfortable sofa he drew up a chair and listened carefully as they told him everything that had happened since theyd seen him at the play the previous evening i saw your father leave the theatre of course said old jack but it would never have crossed my mind he could treat your mother and sister quite so appallingly do you have any idea where they might be sir asked giles no but if i had to guess id say they were staying with your grandfather no sir i spent the morning with grandpa and even he doesnt know where they are i didnt say which grandfather said jack lord harvey said harry that would be my bet said jack theyd feel safe with him and confident that barrington would think twice before going after them but grandpa has at least three homes that im aware of said giles so i wouldnt know where to begin looking how stupid of me said harry i know exactly where he is you do said giles where at his country estate in scotland you sound very certain said jack only because last week he dropped emma a line to explain why he wouldnt be able to attend the school play it seems he always spends december and january in scotland but im damned if i can remember the address mulgelrie castle near mulgelrie highlands said giles most impressive said jack not really sir its just years of mama making me write thankyou letters to all my relations on boxing day but as ive never been to scotland i havent got a clue where it is old jack got up and removed a large atlas from the bookshelf behind his desk he looked up mulgelrie in the index flicked over several pages and then laid it on the desk in front of him running a finger from london to scotland he said youll have to take the overnight sleeper to edinburgh and then change to a local train for mulgelrie i dont think weve got enough money left for that said harry checking his wallet then ill have to issue you both with rail warrants wont i said jack he opened his desk drawer pulled out a large buffcoloured pad and tore off two forms he filled them in signed and stamped them after all he added you are clearly stateless refugees in search of a home thank you sir said giles one last word of advice said old jack as he rose from behind his desk hugo barrington is not a man who likes to be crossed and while im fairly confident he wont do anything to annoy lord harvey that doesnt necessarily apply to you harry so be on your guard until youre safely inside mulgelrie castle should you at any time come across a man with a limp he added be wary of him he works for giless father hes clever and resourceful but more important he has no allegiance to anyone except his paymaster giles and harry were directed to another thirdclass carriage but they were both so tired that despite the frequent opening and closing of carriage doors during the night the clattering of the wheels over points and the regular blast of the trains whistle they slept soundly giles woke with a start as the train pulled into newcastle a few minutes before six he looked out of the window to be greeted by a dull grey day and the sight of lines of soldiers waiting to board the train a sergeant saluted a second lieutenant who didnt look much older than giles and asked permission to board the train sir the young man returned his salute and replied in a softer voice carry on sergeant and the soldiers began to file on to the train the everpresent threat of war and the question of whether he and harry would be in uniform before they had the chance to go up to oxford was never far from giless mind his uncle nicholas whom hed never met an officer just like the young man on the platform had led a platoon of soldiers and been cut down at ypres giles wondered what would be the names of the battlefields that would be commemorated with poppies every year if there was to be another great war to end all wars his thoughts were interrupted when he noticed a passing reflection in the carriage window he swung round but the figure was no longer there had captain tarrants warning caused him to overreact or was it just a coincidence giles looked across at harry who was still sound asleep but then he probably hadnt slept for the past two nights as the train shunted into berwickontweed giles noticed the same man walking past their compartment just a glance and he was gone no longer a coincidence was he checking to see which station they got off at harry finally woke blinked and stretched his arms im starving he said giles leant over and whispered i think theres someone on this train whos following us what makes you say that asked harry suddenly wide awake ive seen the same man pass our carriage once too often tickets please giles and harry handed their warrants to the ticket collector how long does this train stop at each station he asked once the man had clipped them now that all depends on whether were runnin on time or not he replied a little wearily but never less than four minutes is the company regulation what is the next station asked giles dunbar we should be there in about thirty minutes but youve both got warrants for mulgelrie he added before moving on to the next compartment what was all that about asked harry im trying to find out if were being followed said giles and the next part of my plan will involve you what role will i be playing this time said harry sitting on the edge of his seat certainly not romeo said giles when the train stops at dunbar i want you to get off while i watch if anyone follows you once youre on the platform walk quickly towards the ticket barrier then turn back go into the waiting room and buy a cup of tea dont forget youve only got four minutes to be back on board before the train sets off again and whatever you do dont look back or hell know were on to him but if there is someone following us surely hell be more interested in you than me i dont think so said giles and certainly not if captain tarrant is right because i have a feeling your friend knows more than hes willing to admit that doesnt exactly fill me with confidence said harry half an hour later the train shuddered to a halt in dunbar harry opened the carriage door stepped out on to the platform and headed for the exit giles caught no more than a glimpse of the man as he hurried after harry got you giles said then leant back and closed his eyes confident that once the man realized harry had only got off to buy a cup of tea he would look in his direction just to make sure he hadnt also left the carriage giles opened his eyes again when harry returned to the compartment holding a bar of chocolate well said harry did you spot anyone sure did said giles in fact hes just getting back on the train what does he look like asked harry trying not to sound anxious i only caught a glimpse of him said giles but id say hes around forty a little over six foot smartly dressed with very short hair the one thing you cant miss is his limp so now we know what were up against sherlock what next first watson its important to remember that we have several things going for us i cant think of one said harry well for a start we know were being followed but he doesnt know we know we also know where were going which he clearly doesnt were also fit and less than half his age and with that limp he wont be able to move all that quickly youre rather good at this said harry i do have a builtin advantage said giles i am my fathers son by the time the train pulled into edinburgh waverley giles had gone over his plan with harry a dozen times they stepped out of the carriage and walked slowly down the platform towards the barrier dont even think about looking back said giles as he produced his rail warrant then headed towards a line of taxis the royal hotel said giles to the cabbie and can you let me know if another taxi follows us he added before joining harry in the back right you are said the cabbie as he eased off the rank and joined the traffic how do you know theres a royal hotel in edinburgh asked harry theres a royal hotel in every city said giles a few minutes later the cabbie said i cannae be sure but the next cab off the rank isnt far behind us good said giles how much is the fare to the royal two shillings sir ill give you four if you can lose him the driver immediately put his foot down on the accelerator causing both of his passengers to be thrown back into their seats giles recovered quickly and looked through the back window to see the taxi behind them had also speeded up they had gained sixty or seventy yards but giles realized that advantage wouldnt last for long cabbie take the next turning on the left and then slow down for a moment after we jump out i want you to continue on to the royal and dont stop until you reach the hotel an outstretched arm appeared harry placed two florins into the palm when i jump out said giles just follow me and then do exactly as i do harry nodded the taxi swung round the corner and slowed down for a moment just as giles opened the door he leapt out on to the pavement toppled over quickly picked himself up then dashed into the nearest shop throwing himself on the floor harry followed only seconds later slammed the door behind him and was lying by his friends side just as the second cab shot around the corner can i help you sir asked a sales assistant hands on hips looking down at the two young men lying prostrate on the ground you already have said giles rising to his feet and giving her a warm smile he brushed himself down said thank you and left the shop without another word when harry stood up he came face to face with a slimwaisted mannequin wearing only a corset he turned bright red ran out of the shop and joined giles on the pavement i dont expect the man with the limp will be booking into the royal for the night said giles so wed better get moving agreed said harry as giles flagged down another cab waverley station he said before climbing into the back where did you learn how to do all that asked harry in admiration as they headed back in the direction of the station you know harry you should read a little less joseph conrad and a little more john buchan if you want to know how to travel in scotland while being pursued by a fiendish foe the journey to mulgelrie was considerably slower and far less exciting than the one to edinburgh had been and there was certainly no sign of any man with a limp when the engine finally dragged its four carriages and two passengers into the little station the sun had already disappeared behind the highest mountain the station master was standing by the exit waiting to check their tickets when they got off the last train that day any hope of getting a taxi giles asked as they handed over their warrants no sir replied the station master jock goes home for tea around six oclock and hell nae be back for another hour giles thought twice about explaining the logic of jocks actions to the station master before he asked then perhaps youd be kind enough to tell us how we can get to mulgelrie castle youll have to walk said the station master helpfully and which direction might it be asked giles trying not to sound exasperated its about three miles up yonder the man said pointing up the hill you cannae miss it up yonder turned out to be the only accurate piece of information the station master had offered because after the two of them had been walking for over an hour it was pitch black and there was still no sign of any castle giles was beginning to wonder if they were going to have to spend their first night in the highlands sleeping in a field with only a flock of sheep to keep them company when harry shouted there it is giles stared through the misty gloom and although he still couldnt quite make out the outline of a castle his spirits were lifted by flickering lights coming from several windows they trudged on until they reached a massive pair of wroughtiron gates which had not been locked as they made their way up the long driveway giles could hear barking but he couldnt see any dogs after about another mile they came to a bridge spanning a moat and on the far side a heavy oak door that didnt look as if it welcomed strangers leave the talking to me said giles as they staggered across the bridge and came to a halt outside the door giles banged three times with the side of his fist and within moments the door was pulled open to reveal a giant of a man dressed in a kilt with a dark lovat jacket white shirt and white bow tie the head steward looked down on the weary bedraggled objects that stood in front of him good evening mr giles he said although giles had never set eyes on the man before his lordship has been expecting you for some time and wondered if you would care to join him for dinner lord harvey handed the telegram to giles and chuckled sent by our mutual friend captain tarrant he only turned out to be wrong about what time youd arrive we had to walk all the way from the station protested giles between mouthfuls yes i did consider sending the car to meet you off the last train said lord harvey but theres nothing like a bracing highland walk to work up a good appetite harry smiled hed hardly spoken since theyd come down for dinner and as emma had been placed at the far end of the table he had to satisfy himself with the occasional wistful gaze wondering if theyd ever be left alone together the first course was a thick highland broth which harry finished a little too quickly but when giles was served a second helping he also allowed his bowl to be refilled harry would have asked for a third helping if everyone else hadnt continued making polite conversation while they waited for him and giles to finish so that the main course could be served theres no need for either of you to be anxious about anyone wondering where you are said lord harvey because ive already sent telegrams to sir walter and to mrs clifton to assure them you are both safe and well i didnt bother to get in touch with your father giles he added without further comment giles glanced across the table to see his mother purse her lips moments later the dining room doors swung open and several liveried servants entered and whisked away the soup bowls three more servants followed carrying silver salvers on which rested what looked to harry like six small chickens i do hope you like grouse mr clifton said lord harvey the first person ever to call him mr as a bird was placed in front of him i shot these myself harry couldnt think of an appropriate response he watched as giles picked up his knife and fork and began to slice tiny pieces off the bird bringing back memories of their first meal together at st bedes by the time the plates were cleared harry had only managed about three morsels and wondered how old he would have to be before he could say no thank you id prefer another bowl of soup things improved a little when a large plate of different fruits some of which harry had never seen before was placed in the centre of the table he would have liked to ask his host their names and the countries they originated from but memories of his first banana came to mind when he had definitely slipped he satisfied himself with following giless lead watching carefully to see which had to be peeled which had to be cut and which you could simply take a bite out of when hed finished a servant appeared and placed a bowl of water by the side of his plate he was just about to pick it up and drink it when he saw lady harvey place her fingers in hers and moments later a servant passed her a linen napkin so she could dry her hands harry dipped his fingers in the water and like magic a napkin immediately appeared after dinner the ladies retired to the drawing room harry wanted to join them so he could at last catch up with emma and tell her everything that had happened since shed poisoned herself but no sooner had she left the room than lord harvey sat back down a sign for the underbutler to offer his lordship a cigar while another servant poured him a large glass of cognac once hed taken a sip he nodded and glasses were placed in front of giles and harry the butler closed the humidor before filling their glasses with brandy well said lord harvey after two or three luxuriant puffs am i to understand that you are both hoping to go up to oxford harrys a safe bet said giles but ill need to score a couple of centuries during the summer and preferably one at lords if the examiners are going to overlook my more obvious deficiencies giles is being modest sir said harry he has just as good a chance of being offered a place as i do after all hes not only the captain of cricket hes also school captain well if you are successful i can assure you that youll experience three of the happiest years of your life thats assuming herr hitler isnt foolish enough to insist on a replay of the last war in the vain hope that hell be able to reverse the result the three of them raised their glasses and harry took his first sip of brandy he didnt like the taste and was wondering if it would be thought discourteous if he didnt finish it when lord harvey came to his rescue perhaps its time for us to join the ladies he said draining his glass he put his cigar in an ashtray rose from his place and marched out of the dining room not waiting for a second opinion the two young men followed him across the hall and into the drawing room lord harvey took the seat next to elizabeth while giles winked at harry and went across to join his grandmother harry sat next to emma on the sofa how gallant of you to come all this way harry she said touching his hand im so sorry about what happened after the play i only hope i wasnt responsible for causing the problem in the first place how could you possibly be responsible harry youve never done anything that could have caused my father to speak to mama that way but its no secret that your father doesnt think we should be together even on stage lets talk about it tomorrow morning emma whispered we can go for a long walk in the hills and be on our own with only the highland cattle to overhear us ill look forward to that said harry he would have liked to hold her hand but there were too many eyes continually glancing in their direction you two young men must be very tired after such an exhausting journey said lady harvey why dont you both go off to bed and well see you at breakfast in the morning harry didnt want to go to bed he wanted to stay with emma and try to find out if shed discovered why her father was so opposed to them being together but giles rose immediately kissed his grandmother and mother on the cheek and said goodnight leaving harry with no choice but to join him he leaned across and kissed emma on the cheek thanked his host for a wonderful evening and followed giles out of the room as they walked down the hall harry paused to admire a painting of a bowl of fruit by an artist called peploe when emma came dashing out of the drawing room threw her arms around his neck and kissed him gently on the lips giles continued up the stairs as if he hadnt noticed while harry kept his eyes on the drawingroom door emma broke away when she heard it opening behind her good night good night parting is such sweet sorrow she whispered that i shall say good night till it be morrow harry replied where are you two off to asked elizabeth barrington as she came out of the breakfast room were going to climb crag cowen said emma dont wait up because you may never see us again her mother laughed then make sure you wrap up well because even the sheep catch cold in the highlands she waited until harry had closed the door behind them before she added giles your grandfather wishes to see us in his study at ten oclock it sounded to giles more like a command than a request yes mother he said before looking through the window and watching harry and emma walking down the path towards crag cowen theyd only gone a few yards before emma took harrys hand giles smiled as they turned the corner and disappeared behind a row of pines when the clock in the hall began to strike giles had to walk quickly along the corridor to make sure he reached his grandfathers study before the tenth chime his grandparents and his mother stopped talking the moment he entered the room they had clearly been waiting for him have a seat dear boy said his grandfather thank you sir giles replied and sat down on a chair between his mother and his grandmother i suppose this would best be described as a council of war said lord harvey looking up from his highbacked leather chair as if he was addressing a board meeting ill try to bring everyone up to date before we decide what the best course of action should be giles was flattered that his grandfather now considered him to be a full member of the family board i telephoned walter last night he was just as appalled by hugos conduct at the play as i was when elizabeth told me about it although i had to fill him in on what happened when she returned to the manor house giless mother bowed her head but didnt interrupt i went on to tell him that id had a long talk with my daughter and that we felt there were only two possible courses of action giles sat back in his chair but didnt relax i left walter in no doubt that if elizabeth were even to consider returning to the manor house it would be necessary for hugo to make several concessions first he must apologize unequivocally for his appalling behaviour giless grandmother nodded in agreement second he will never again and i repeated never again suggest that emma should be taken out of her school and he will in future fully support her efforts to gain a place at oxford god knows its hard enough for a young man to make the grade nowadays but its damn nigh impossible for a woman my third and most important demand and on this i was quite adamant is that he explain to us all why he continues to treat harry clifton so appallingly i suspect it might have something to do with harrys uncle stealing from hugo the sins of the father are one thing but an uncle i refuse to accept as he has so often claimed to elizabeth that he considers clifton unworthy to mix with his children simply because his father was a docker and his mother is a waitress perhaps hugo has forgotten that my grandfather was a jobbing clerk in a firm of wine merchants while his own grandfather left school at the age of twelve and started out as a docker like young cliftons father and just in case anyone has forgotten im the first lord harvey in this family and you dont get much more nouveau than that giles wanted to cheer now none of us can have failed to notice continued lord harvey how emma and harry feel about each other which is hardly surprising as they are two exceptional young people if in the fullness of time their relationship blossoms no one would be more delighted than victoria and i on that subject walter was in full agreement with me giles smiled he liked the idea of harry becoming a member of the family even though he didnt believe his father would ever accept it i told walter continued his grandfather that if hugo felt unable to abide by these terms elizabeth would be left with no choice but to institute divorce proceedings immediately i would also have to resign from the board of barringtons and make public my reasons for doing so giles was saddened by this as he knew there had never been a divorce in either family walter kindly agreed to get back to me in the next few days after hes had a chance to talk things over with his son but he did tell me that hugo has already promised to stop drinking and that he appears to be genuinely contrite let me finish by reminding you that this is a family matter and should not in any circumstances be discussed with outsiders we must hope that this proves to be nothing more than an unfortunate incident that will soon be forgotten the following morning giless father telephoned and asked to speak to him he apologized profusely saying how sorry he was to have blamed giles for something that was entirely his own fault he begged giles to do everything in his power to convince his mother and emma to return to gloucestershire so they could all spend christmas together at the manor house he also hoped that as his fatherinlaw had suggested the incident would be quickly forgotten he made no mention of harry clifton once theyd disembarked from the train at temple meads giles and his mother waited in the car while emma said goodbye to harry theyve just spent the last nine days together said giles have they forgotten that theyll be seeing each other again tomorrow and probably the next day said giless mother but try not to forget unlikely though it might seem that it could even happen to you one day emma eventually joined them but when they drove off she continued to look out of the back window and didnt stop waving until harry was out of sight giles was keen to get home and finally discover what it was that harry could have done to make his father treat him so cruelly over the years surely it couldnt be worse than stealing from the tuck shop or deliberately failing your exams hed considered a dozen possibilities but none of them made any sense now at last he hoped he was going to find out the truth he glanced across at his mother although she rarely displayed her emotions she was clearly becoming more and more agitated as they approached chew valley giless father was standing on the top step waiting to greet them when the car drew up outside the house no sign of jenkins he apologized immediately to elizabeth and then the children before telling them how much hed missed them tea is set up in the drawing room he said please join me there as soon as youre ready giles was the first back downstairs and he sat uneasily in a chair opposite his father while they waited for his mother and emma to join them his father confined himself to asking giles how hed enjoyed scotland and to explain that nanny had taken grace into bristol to buy her school uniform at no time did he mention harry when giless mother and sister entered the room a few minutes later his father immediately stood up once they were seated he poured them all a cup of tea he clearly didnt want any servants to overhear what he was about to reveal once everyone had settled giless father sat on the edge of his seat and began to speak softly let me begin by saying to all three of you how unacceptable my behaviour was on the night of what everyone has described as emmas great triumph that your father was not there for the curtain call was bad enough emma he said looking directly at his daughter but the way i treated your mother when you returned home that night was quite unforgivable and i realize it may take some time before such a deep wound can be healed hugo barrington placed his head in his hands and giles noticed that he was trembling he eventually steadied himself you have all for different reasons asked to know why i have treated harry clifton so badly over the years it is true that i cannot bear to be in his presence but the fault is entirely of my own making when you learn the reason you might begin to understand and possibly even sympathize giles glanced at his mother who was sitting stiffly in her chair there was no way of telling how she felt many years ago continued barrington when i first became managing director of the company i convinced the board that we should branch out into shipbuilding despite my fathers reservations i signed a contract with a canadian company to build a merchant ship called the maple leaf that not only turned out to be a financial disaster for the company but a personal catastrophe for me from which i have never fully recovered and doubt if i ever will allow me to explain one afternoon a docker burst into my office insisting that his work mate was trapped inside the hull of the maple leaf and if i didnt give the order to break it open his life would be lost naturally i went down to the dock immediately and the ganger assured me there was absolutely no truth in the story however i insisted the men down tools so that we could listen for any sound coming from inside the hull i waited for some considerable time but as there was no sound i gave the order for them to return to work as we were already several weeks behind schedule i assumed the docker in question would sign on for his usual shift the following day but not only did he not turn up he was never seen again the possibility of his death has been on my conscience ever since he paused raised his head and said that mans name was arthur clifton and harry is his only son emma began to sob i want you to imagine if you possibly can what i go through whenever i see that young man and how he would feel were he ever to find out that i might have been responsible for his fathers death that harry clifton has become giless closest friend and fallen in love with my daughter is the stuff of a greek tragedy once again he buried his head in his hands and didnt speak for some time when he finally looked up he said if you wish to ask me any questions i will do my best to answer them giles waited for his mother to speak first were you responsible for sending an innocent man to jail for a crime he did not commit elizabeth asked quietly no my dear said barrington i hope you know me well enough to realize i am not capable of such a thing stan tancock was a common thief who broke into my office and robbed me because he was arthur cliftons brotherinlaw and for no other reason i gave him back his job the day he was released from prison elizabeth smiled for the first time father i wonder if i might be allowed to ask a question said giles yes of course did you have harry and me followed when we travelled up to scotland yes i did giles i was desperate to find out where your mother and emma were so i could apologize to them for my disgraceful behaviour please try to forgive me everyone turned their attention to emma who hadnt yet spoken when she did her words took them all by surprise youll have to tell harry everything youve told us she whispered and if he is willing to forgive you you must then welcome him into our family i would be delighted to welcome him into the family my darling although it would be understandable if he never wanted to speak to me again but i cannot tell him the truth about what happened to his father why not demanded emma because harrys mother has made it clear that she does not want him ever to find out how his father died as he has been brought up to believe he was a brave man who was killed in the war up until this moment i have kept my promise never to reveal to anyone what took place on that dreadful day elizabeth barrington rose walked across to her husband and kissed him gently barrington broke down and sobbed a moment later giles joined his parents and placed an arm around his fathers shoulders emma didnt move has your mother always been that goodlooking said giles or am i just getting older ive no idea said harry all i can say is that your mother always looks so elegant much as i love the dear creature she looks positively prehistoric compared to yours said giles as elizabeth barrington parasol in one hand and handbag in the other bore down upon them giles like every other boy had been dreading what outfit his mother might turn up in as for the selection of hats it was worse than ascot with every mother and daughter trying to outdo each other harry looked more carefully at his mother who was chatting to dr paget he had to admit that she was attracting more attention than most of the other mothers which he found a little embarrassing but he was pleased that she no longer appeared to be burdened by financial worries and assumed the man standing on her right had something to do with that however grateful he was to mr atkins he didnt care for the idea of him becoming his stepfather mr barrington may in the past have been overzealous about his daughter but harry could not deny that he felt just as protective when it came to his mother she had recently told him that mr frampton was so pleased with her work at the hotel that he had promoted her to night supervisor and given her another pay rise and certainly harry no longer had to wait for his trousers to be too short before they were replaced but even he had been surprised when she hadnt commented about the cost of his travelling to rome with the arts appreciation society how nice to see you harry on your day of triumph said mrs barrington two prizes if i remember correctly im only sorry that emma cant be with us to share in your glory but as miss webb pointed out her gels cannot be expected to take the morning off for someone elses speech day even if her brother is the school captain mr barrington came across to join them and giles watched his father carefully as he shook hands with harry there was still a distinct lack of warmth on his fathers part although no one could deny that he was making every effort to conceal it so when are you expecting to hear from oxford harry asked barrington some time next week sir im confident theyll offer you a place although i suspect it will be a closerun thing for giles dont forget hes also had his moment of glory said harry i dont recall that said mrs barrington i think harrys referring to the century i scored at lords mama admirable though that might be for the life of me i cant see how it will help you get into oxford said his father normally i would agree with you papa said giles were it not for the fact that the professor of history was sitting next to the president of the mcc at the time the laughter that followed was drowned out by the sound of bells the boys began to move rapidly in the direction of the great hall with their parents following dutifully a few paces behind them giles and harry took their places among the prefects and prizewinners in the front three rows do you recall our first day at st bedes said harry when we all sat in the front row quite terrified of dr oakshott i was never terrified of the shot said giles no of course you werent said harry but i do remember when we came down for breakfast on the first morning that you licked your porridge bowl and i remember you swore youd never mention it again whispered harry and i promise i never will again replied giles not whispering what was the name of that frightful bully who slippered you on our first night fisher said harry and it was the second night wonder what hes up to now hes probably running a nazi youth camp then thats a good enough reason to go to war said giles as everyone in the hall rose to welcome the chairman of the governors and his board the crocodile of smartly dressed men made their way slowly down the aisle and up on to the stage the last person to take his seat was mr barton the headmaster but not before hed ushered the guest of honour into the centre chair in the front row once everyone had settled the headmaster rose to welcome the parents and guests before delivering the schools annual report he began by describing as a vintage year and for the next twenty minutes he elaborated on this claim giving details of the schools academic and sporting achievements he ended by inviting the right honourable winston churchill mp chancellor of bristol university and member of parliament for epping to address the school and present the prizes mr churchill rose slowly from his place and stared down at the audience for some time before he began some guests of honour begin their speeches by telling their audience that they never won any prizes when they were at school in fact they were always bottom of the class i cannot make such a claim although i certainly never won a prize at least i was never bottom of the class i was second to bottom the boys roared and cheered while the masters smiled only deakins remained unmoved the moment the laughter had subsided churchill scowled our nation today faces another of those great moments in history when the british people may once again be asked to decide the fate of the free world many of you present in this great hall he lowered his voice and concentrated his attention on the rows of boys seated in front of him not once looking in the direction of their parents those of us who lived through the great war will never forget the tragic loss of life our nation suffered and the effect it has had on an entire generation of the twenty boys in my class at harrow who went on to serve in the front line only three of them lived long enough to cast a vote i only hope that whoever delivers this speech in twenty years time will not need to refer to that barbaric and unnecessary waste of life as the first world war with that single hope i wish you all long happy and successful lives giles was among the first to rise and give the guest of honour a standing ovation as he returned to his seat he felt that if britain were left with no choice but to go to war this was the one man who should take over from neville chamberlain and become prime minister when everyone had resumed their places some minutes later the headmaster invited mr churchill to present the prizes giles and harry cheered when mr barton not only announced that deakins was scholar of the year but added this morning i received a telegram from the master of balliol college oxford to say that deakins has been awarded the senior classics scholarship i might add continued mr barton that he is the first boy to achieve this distinction in the schools fourhundredyear history giles and harry were on their feet immediately as a gangly sixfoottwoinch boy with pebble glasses wearing a suit that hung on him as if it had never left its coathanger made his way slowly up on to the stage mr deakins wanted to leap up and take a photograph of his son being presented with his prize by mr churchill but didnt do so for fear it might be frowned upon harry received a warm reception when he was awarded the english prize as well as the school reading prize the headmaster added none of us will ever forget his performance as romeo let us all hope that harry will be among those who receive a telegram next week offering them a place at oxford when mr churchill presented harry with his prize he whispered i never went to university i only wish i had lets hope you receive that telegram clifton good luck thank you sir said harry but the biggest cheer of the day was reserved for giles barrington when he went up to receive the headmasters prize for captain of the school and captain of cricket to the guest of honours surprise the chairman of the governors leapt up from his place and shook hands with giles before he reached mr churchill my grandson sir sir walter explained with considerable pride churchill smiled gripped giles by the hand and looking up at him said be sure you serve your country with the same distinction with which you have clearly served your school that was the moment when giles knew exactly what he would do if britain went to war once the ceremony was over the boys parents and masters rose as one to sing carmen bristoliense sit clarior sit dignior quotquot labuntur menses sit primus nobis hic decor sumus bristolienses once the last chorus had rung out the headmaster led the guest of honour and his staff off the stage out of the great hall and into the afternoon sunshine moments later everyone else poured out on to the lawn to join them for tea three boys in particular were surrounded by wellwishers as well as by a bevy of sisters who thought giles was just cute this is the proudest day of my life said harrys mother as she embraced him i know how you feel mrs clifton said old jack shaking harry by the hand i only wish miss monday had lived long enough to see you today because i dont doubt it would have also been the happiest day of her life mr holcombe stood to one side and waited patiently to add his congratulations harry introduced him to captain tarrant unaware that they were old friends when the band had stopped playing and the captains and the kings had departed giles harry and deakins sat alone on the grass and reminisced about things past no longer schoolboys a telegram was delivered to harrys study by a junior boy on thursday afternoon giles and deakins waited patiently for him to open it but instead he handed the little brown envelope to giles passing the buck again said giles as he ripped it open he couldnt hide his surprise when he read the contents you failed said giles sounding shocked harry collapsed back into his chair to win a scholarship however giles added reading the telegram aloud we are delighted to offer you an exhibition to brasenose college oxford many congratulations details to follow in the next few days wts stallybrass principal not bad but youre clearly not in deakinss class and which class are you in said harry immediately regretting his words one scholar one exhibitionist exhibitioner corrected deakins and one commoner said giles ignoring his friend has a nice ring about it eleven other telegrams were delivered to successful applicants from bristol grammar school that day but none was addressed to giles barrington you should let your mother know said giles as they walked into the hall for supper she probably hasnt slept all week worrying about it harry looked at his watch its too late shell already have left for work i wont be able to tell her until tomorrow morning why dont we go and surprise her at the hotel said giles i cant do that shed think it unprofessional to interrupt her while shes at work and i dont feel i can make an exception even for this he said waving the telegram triumphantly but dont you think she has a right to know said giles after all shes sacrificed everything to make it possible for you frankly if they offered me a place at oxford id interrupt mama even if she was addressing the mothers union dont you agree deakins deakins removed his glasses and began to polish them with a handkerchief always a sign that he was deep in thought id ask pagets opinion and if he raises no objection good idea said giles lets go and see the page are you coming deakins asked harry but then noticed that deakinss glasses had been returned to the end of his nose a sign that he had been transported to another world many congratulations said dr paget once hed read the telegram and well deserved if i may say so thank you sir said harry i wondered if it would be possible for me to go to the royal hotel so i can tell my mother the news i cant see any reason why not clifton can i trot along with him asked giles innocently paget hesitated yes you can barrington but dont even think about having a drink or smoking while youre in the hotel not even one glass of champagne sir no barrington not even a glass of cider said paget firmly as the two young men strolled out of the school gates they passed a lamp lighter who was standing on his bicycle stretching up to light a street lamp they chatted about the summer hols when harry would be joining giless family in tuscany for the first time and agreed they would have to be back in time to see the australians when they played against gloucestershire at the county ground they discussed the possibility or according to harry the probability of war being declared now that everyone had been issued with a gas mask but neither of them touched on another subject that was on both of their minds would giles be joining harry and deakins at oxford in september as they approached the hotel harry had second thoughts about interrupting his mother while she was at work but giles had already barged through the revolving doors and was standing in the foyer waiting for him it will only take a couple of minutes said giles when harry joined him just tell her the good news and we can go straight back to school harry nodded giles asked the doorman where the palm court was and he directed them to a raised area at the far end of the foyer after climbing the half dozen steps giles walked up to the desk and keeping his voice low asked the receptionist can we have a quick word with mrs clifton mrs clifton asked the girl has she made a reservation she ran her finger down a list of bookings no she works here said giles oh im new here said the girl but ill just ask one of the waitresses theyre bound to know thank you harry remained on the bottom step his eyes searching the room for his mother hattie the receptionist asked a passing waitress does a mrs clifton work here not any longer she doesnt came back the immediate reply she left a couple of years ago havent heard a dickybird from her since there must be some mistake said harry bounding up the steps to join his friend do you have any idea where we might find her asked giles keeping his voice low no said hattie but you could have a word with doug the night porter hes been here for ever thank you said giles and turning to harry added theres bound to be a simple explanation but if youd prefer to leave it no lets find out if doug knows where she is giles walked slowly across to the porters desk giving harry enough time to change his mind but he didnt say a word are you doug he asked a man dressed in a faded blue frockcoat with buttons that no longer shone i am sir he replied how can i help you were looking for mrs clifton maisie dont work here any longer sir she must have left at least a couple of years back do you know where she is working now ive no idea sir giles took out his purse extracted half a crown and placed it on the counter the porter eyed it for some time before he spoke again its just possible youll find her at eddies nightclub eddie atkins enquired harry i believe thats correct sir well that explains it said harry and where is eddies nightclub welsh back sir replied the porter as he pocketed the half a crown harry left the hotel without another word and jumped into the back of a waiting cab giles got in beside him dont you think we should get back to school said giles looking at his watch you can always tell your mother in the morning harry shook his head it was you who said youd interrupt your mother even if she was addressing the mothers union harry reminded him eddies nightclub welsh back please cabbie he said firmly harry didnt speak during the short journey when the cab turned into a dark alley and came to a halt outside eddies he got out and walked towards the entrance harry banged firmly on the door a shutter slid open and a pair of eyes stared at the two young men the entrance fee is five shillings each said a voice behind the eyes giles pushed a tenshilling note through the hole the door swung open immediately the two of them made their way down a dimly lit staircase to the basement giles saw her first and quickly turned to leave but it was too late harry was staring transfixed at a row of girls seated on stools at the bar some chatting to men others on their own one of them wearing a white seethrough blouse a short black leather skirt and black stockings approached them and said can i help you gents harry ignored her his eyes had settled on a woman at the far end of the bar who was listening intently to an older man who had his hand on her thigh the girl looked to see who he was staring at i must say you know class when you see it she said mind you maisie can be choosy and i have to warn you she doesnt come cheap harry turned and bolted back up the steps pulled open the door and ran out on to the street with giles chasing after him once harry was on the pavement he fell to his knees and was violently sick giles knelt and put his arm around his friend trying to comfort him a man who had been standing in the shadows on the other side of the road limped away emma barrington ill never forget the first time i saw him he came to tea at the manor house to celebrate my brothers twelfth birthday he was so quiet and reserved that i wondered how he could possibly be giless best friend the other one deakins was really strange he never stopped eating and hardly said a word all afternoon and then harry spoke a soft gentle voice that made you want to listen the birthday party had apparently been going swimmingly until my father burst into the room and then he hardly spoke again id never known my father to be so offhand with anyone and i couldnt understand why he should behave in that way towards a complete stranger but even more inexplicable was papas reaction when he asked harry when his birthday was how could such an innocuous question bring on such an extreme reaction a moment later my father got up and left the room without even saying goodbye to giles and his guests i could see that mama was embarrassed by his behaviour although she poured another cup of tea and pretended not to notice a few minutes later my brother and his two friends left to go back to school he turned and smiled at me before leaving but just like my mother i pretended not to notice but when the front door closed i stood by the drawingroom window and watched as the car disappeared down the driveway and out of sight i thought i saw him looking out of the back window but i couldnt be sure after they had left mama went straight to my fathers study and i could hear raised voices which had recently become more and more common when she came back out she smiled at me as if nothing unusual had happened whats the name of giless best friend i asked harry clifton she replied the next time i saw harry clifton was at the advent carol service at st mary redcliffe he sang o little town of bethlehem and my best friend jessica braithwaite accused me of swooning as if he was the new bing crosby i didnt bother to deny it i saw him chatting to giles after the service and i would have liked to congratulate him but papa seemed to be in a hurry to get home as we left i saw his nanny giving him a huge hug i was also at st mary redcliffe the evening his voice broke but at the time i didnt understand why so many heads were turning and some members of the congregation began to whisper among themselves all i know is that i never heard him sing again when giles was driven to the grammar school on his first day i begged my mother to let me go along but only because i wanted to meet harry but my father wouldnt hear of it and despite my bursting into controlled tears they still left me standing on the top step with my younger sister grace i knew papa was cross about giles not being offered a place at eton something i still dont understand because a lot of boys more stupid than my brother passed the exam mama didnt seem to mind which school giles went to whereas i was delighted he was going to bristol grammar because it meant id have a better chance of seeing harry again in fact i must have seen him at least a dozen times during the next three years but he was never able to recall any of those occasions until we met up in rome the family were all staying at our villa in tuscany that summer when giles took me to one side and said he needed to ask my advice he only ever did that when he wanted something but this time it turned out to be something i wanted just as much as he did so what are you expecting me to do this time i asked i need an excuse to go into rome tomorrow he said because im meant to be meeting up with harry harry who i said feigning indifference harry clifton stupid hes on a school trip to rome and i promised to get away and spend the day with him he didnt need to spell out that papa wouldnt have approved all you have to do he continued is ask mama if she could take you to rome for the day but shell need to know why i want to go into rome tell her youve always wanted to visit the villa borghese why the villa borghese because thats where harry will be at ten oclock tomorrow morning but what happens if mama agrees to take me then youll be stymied she wont theyre having lunch with the hendersons in arezzo tomorrow so ill volunteer to be your chaperone and what do i get in exchange i demanded as i didnt want giles to know how keen i was to see harry my gramophone he said for keeps or just to borrow giles didnt speak for some time for ever he said reluctantly hand it over now i said or you can forget it to my surprise he did i was even more amazed when the next day my mother fell for his little ploy giles didnt even have to offer to act as my chaperone papa insisted that he accompany me my deceitful brother made a show of protesting but finally gave in i rose early the following morning and spent some considerable time thinking about what i should wear it would have to be fairly conservative if my mother wasnt to become suspicious but on the other hand i wanted to make sure harry noticed me while we were on the train to rome i disappeared into the lavatory and put on a pair of mothers silk stockings and just a touch of lipstick not enough for giles to notice once wed checked into our hotel giles wanted to leave immediately for the villa borghese so did i as we walked through the gardens and up towards the villa a soldier turned to look at me it was the first time that had happened and i could feel my cheeks reddening no sooner had we entered the gallery than giles went off in search of harry i hung back pretending to take a great deal of interest in the paintings and statues i needed to make an entrance when i eventually caught up with them i found harry chatting to my brother although giles wasnt even pretending to listen to him as he was clearly besotted by the tour guide if hed asked me i could have told him he didnt have a chance but older brothers rarely listen to their sisters when it comes to women i would have advised him to comment on her shoes which made me quite envious men think the italians are only famous for designing cars one exception to this rule is captain tarrant who knows exactly how to treat a lady my brother could learn a lot from him giles simply regarded me as his gauche little sister not that he would have known what the word gauche meant i picked my moment then strolled across and waited for giles to introduce us imagine my surprise when harry invited me to join him for dinner that night my only thought was that i hadnt packed a suitable evening dress over dinner i discovered that my brother had paid harry a thousand lira to take me off his hands but he had refused until giles also agreed to part with his caruso recording i told harry hed got the records and id got the gramophone he didnt catch on as we crossed the road on the way back to the hotel he held my hand for the first time and when we reached the other side i didnt let go i could tell it was the first time harry had held a girls hand because he was so nervous he was sweating i tried to make it easy for him to kiss me when we got back to my hotel but he just shook hands and said good night as if we were old chums i hinted that perhaps we might bump into each other again once we were back in bristol this time he responded more positively and even suggested the most romantic location for our next date the citys central library he explained that it was somewhere giles would never come across us i happily agreed it was just after ten when harry left and i went up to my room a few minutes later i heard giles unlocking his bedroom door i had to smile his evening with caterina cant have been worth a caruso recording and a gramophone when the family returned to chew valley a couple of weeks later there were three letters waiting for me on the hall table each with the same handwriting on the envelope if my father noticed he said nothing during the next month harry and i spent many happy hours together in the city library without anyone becoming suspicious not least because hed discovered a room where no one was likely to find us even deakins once term began and we werent able to see each other as often i quickly became aware just how much i missed harry we wrote every other day and tried to grab a few hours together at the weekends and thats how it might have continued had it not been for the unwitting intervention of dr paget over coffee at carwardines one saturday morning harry who had become quite bold told me that his english master had persuaded miss webb to allow her girls to take part in the bristol grammar school play that year by the time the auditions were held three weeks later i knew the part of juliet by heart poor innocent dr paget couldnt believe his luck rehearsals meant not only that the two of us could be together for three afternoons a week but that we were allowed to play the parts of young lovers by the time the curtain went up on the first night we were no longer acting the first two performances went so well that i couldnt wait for my parents to attend the closing night although i didnt tell my father i was playing juliet as i wanted it to be a surprise it wasnt long after my first entrance that i became distracted by someone noisily leaving the auditorium but dr paget had told us on several occasions never to look into the audience it broke the spell so i had no idea who had left so publicly i prayed it wasnt my father but when he didnt come backstage after the performance i realized my prayer had not been answered what made it worse was my certainty that his little outburst was aimed at harry although i still didnt know why when we returned home that night giles and i sat on the stairs and listened to my parents having another row but it was different this time because id never heard my father be so unkind to mama when i could bear it no longer i went to my room and locked myself in i was lying on my bed thinking about harry when i heard a gentle knock on the door when i opened it my mother made no attempt to hide the fact that shed been crying and told me to pack a small suitcase because we would be leaving shortly a taxi drove us to the station and we arrived just in time to catch the milk train to london during the journey i wrote to harry to let him know what had happened and where he could get in touch with me i posted the letter in a box on kings cross station before we boarded another train for edinburgh imagine my surprise when the following evening harry and my brother turned up at mulgelrie castle just in time for dinner we spent an unexpected and glorious nine days in scotland together i didnt ever want to return to chew valley even though my father had rung and apologized unreservedly for the way hed behaved on the night of the play but i knew that eventually we would have to go home i promised harry on one of our long morning walks that i would try to find out the reason for my fathers continued hostility towards him when we arrived back at the manor house papa could not have been more conciliatory he tried to explain why he had treated harry so badly over the years and my mother and giles seemed to accept his explanation but i wasnt convinced he had told us the whole story what made things even more difficult for me was that he forbade me to tell harry the truth about how his father had died as his mother was adamant that it should remain a family secret i had a feeling that mrs clifton knew the real reason my father didnt approve of harry and me being together although i would have liked to tell them both that nothing and no one could keep us apart however it all came to a head in a way i could never have predicted i was just as impatient as harry to find out if hed been offered a place at oxford and we arranged to meet outside the library on the morning after he received the telegram letting him know the result i was a few minutes late that friday morning and when i saw him sitting on the top step head in hands i knew he must have failed harry leapt up and threw his arms around emma the moment he saw her he continued to cling to her something hed never done in public before which confirmed her belief that it could only be bad news without a word passing between them he took her by the hand led her into the building down a circular wooden staircase and along a narrow brick corridor until he came to a door marked antiquities he peered inside to make sure that no one else had discovered their hiding place the two of them sat opposite each other at a small table where they had spent so many hours studying during the past year harry was trembling and not because of the chill in the windowless room that was lined on all sides by shelves of leatherbound books covered in dust some of which looked as if they hadnt been opened for years in time they would become antiquities in their own right it was some time before harry spoke do you think there is anything i could say or do that would stop you loving me no my darling said emma absolutely nothing ive found out why your father has been so determined to keep us apart i already know said emma bowing her head slightly and i promise you it makes no difference how can you possibly know said harry my father told us the day we returned from scotland but he swore us to secrecy he told you my mother was a prostitute emma was stunned it was some time before she recovered enough to speak no he did not she said vehemently how could you say anything so cruel because its the truth said harry my mother hasnt been working at the royal hotel for the past two years as i thought but at a nightclub called eddies that doesnt make her a prostitute said emma the man sitting at the bar with a glass of whisky in one hand and the other on her thigh wasnt hoping for stimulating conversation emma leant across the table and touched harry gently on the cheek im so sorry my darling she said but it makes no difference to how i feel about you and it never will harry managed a weak smile but emma remained silent knowing it could only be a few moments before he asked her the inevitable question if that wasnt the secret your father asked you to keep he said suddenly serious again what did he tell you it was emmas turn to hold her head in her hands aware that hed left her with no choice but to tell him the truth like her mother she was no good at dissembling what did he tell you harry repeated more emphatically emma held on to the edge of the table as she tried to steady herself finally she summoned up the strength to look at harry although he was only a few feet away he could not have been more distant i need to ask you the same question you asked me said emma is there anything i could say or do that would stop you loving me harry leant across and took her hand of course not he said your father wasnt killed in the war she said softly and my father was probably responsible for his death she gripped his hand firmly before revealing everything her father had told them the day they returned from scotland when shed finished harry looked dazed and was unable to speak he tried to stand up but his legs gave way beneath him like a boxer whod taken one punch too many and he fell back into his chair ive known for some time that my father couldnt have died in the war harry said quietly but what i still dont understand is why my mother didnt simply tell me the truth and now you do know the truth said emma trying to hold back the tears i would understand if you wanted to break off our relationship after what my father has put your family through its not your fault said harry but ill never forgive him he paused before adding and i wont be able to face him once he finds out the truth about my mother he need never find out said emma taking him by the hand again it will always be a secret between us thats not possible any longer said harry why not because giles saw the man who followed us to edinburgh standing in a doorway opposite eddies nightclub then its my father whos prostituted himself said emma because not only did he lie to us yet again but hes already gone back on his word how he promised giles that man would never follow him again that man wasnt interested in giles said harry i think he was following my mother but why because if he was able to prove how my mother earned her living he must have hoped it would convince you to give me up how little he knows his own daughter said emma because im now even more determined that nothing will keep us apart and he certainly cant stop me admiring your mother even more than i did before how can you say that said harry she works as a waitress to support her family ends up owning tillys and when its burnt to the ground shes accused of arson but holds her head high knowing she is innocent she finds herself another job at the royal hotel and when shes sacked she still refuses to give up she receives a cheque for six hundred pounds and for a moment believes all her problems are solved only to discover shes in fact penniless just at the time when she needs money to make sure you can stay at school in desperation she then turns to but i wouldnt have wanted her to she would have known that harry but she still felt it was a sacrifice worth making another long silence followed oh my god said harry how can i ever have thought badly of her he looked up at emma i need you to do something for me anything can you go and see my mother use any excuse but try to find out if she saw me in that dreadful place last night how will i know if she isnt willing to admit it youll know said harry quietly but if your mother did see you shes bound to ask me what you were doing there i was looking for her but why to tell her that ive been offered a place at oxford emma slipped into a pew at the back of holy nativity and waited for the service to end she could see mrs clifton sitting in the third row next to an old lady harry had seemed a little less tense when theyd met again earlier that morning hed been very clear what he needed to find out and she promised not to stray beyond her remit they had rehearsed every possible scenario several times until she was word perfect after the elderly priest had given the final blessing emma stepped out into the centre of the aisle and waited so mrs clifton couldnt possibly miss her when maisie saw emma she couldnt hide a look of surprise but it was quickly replaced by a welcoming smile she walked quickly towards her and introduced the old lady who was with her mum this is emma barrington shes a friend of harrys the old lady gave emma a toothy grin theres a great deal of difference between being his friend and being his girlfriend which are you she demanded mrs clifton laughed but it was clear to emma that she was just as interested to hear her reply im his girlfriend said emma proudly the old lady delivered another toothy grin but maisie didnt smile well thats all right then isnt it harrys grandmother said before adding i cant stand around here all day chatting ive got dinner to make she began to walk away but then turned back and asked would you like to join us for dinner young lady this was a question that harry had anticipated and for which hed even scripted a reply thats very kind of you said emma but my parents will be expecting me quite right too said the old lady you should always respect your parents wishes ill see you later maisie may i walk with you mrs clifton asked emma as they stepped out of the church yes of course my dear harry asked me to come and see you because he knew youd want to know that hes been offered a place at oxford oh thats wonderful news said maisie throwing her arms around emma she suddenly released her and asked but why didnt he come and tell me himself another scripted reply hes stuck in detention said emma hoping she didnt sound overrehearsed writing out passages from shelley im afraid my brothers to blame you see after he heard the good news he smuggled a bottle of champagne into school and they were caught celebrating in his study last night is that so wicked asked maisie grinning dr paget seemed to think so harrys dreadfully sorry maisie laughed so uproariously that emma had no doubt shed no idea her son had visited the club last night she would have liked to ask one more question that still puzzled her but harry couldnt have been more emphatic if my mother doesnt want me to know how my father died so be it im sorry you cant stay to lunch said maisie because there was something i wanted to tell you perhaps another time harry spent the following week waiting for another bombshell to drop when it did he cheered out loud giles received a telegram on the last day of term telling him hed been offered a place at brasenose college oxford to read history by the skin of his teeth was the expression dr paget used when he informed the headmaster two months later one scholar one exhibitioner and one commoner arrived in the ancient university city by different modes of transport to begin their threeyear undergraduate courses harry signed up for the dramatic society and the officer training corps giles for the union and the cricket club while deakins settled himself down in the bowels of the bodleian library and like a mole was rarely seen above ground but then he had already decided that oxford was where he was going to spend the rest of his life harry couldnt be so sure how he would be spending the rest of his life while the prime minister continued to fly back and forth to germany finally returning to heston airport with a smile on his face waving a piece of paper and telling people what they wanted to hear harry wasnt in any doubt that britain was on the brink of war when emma asked him why he was so convinced he replied havent you noticed that herr hitler never bothers to visit us we are always the importunate suitor and in the end we will be spurned emma ignored his opinion but then like mr chamberlain she didnt want to believe he might be right emma wrote to harry twice a week sometimes three times despite the fact that she was working flat out preparing for her own entrance exams to oxford when harry returned to bristol for the christmas vacation the two of them spent as much time together as possible although harry made sure he kept out of the way of mr barrington emma turned down the chance to spend her holiday with the rest of the family in tuscany not hiding the fact from her father that shed rather be with harry as her entrance exam drew nearer the number of hours emma spent in the antiquities room would have impressed even deakins but then harry was coming to the conclusion that she was about to impress the examiners just as much as his reclusive friend had done the year before whenever he suggested this to emma she would remind him that there were twenty male students at oxford for every female you could always go to cambridge giles foolishly suggested where theyre even more prehistoric emma responded they still dont award degrees to women emmas greatest fear was not that she wouldnt be offered a place at oxford but that by the time she took it up war would have been declared and harry would have signed up and departed for some foreign field that was not forever england all her life she had been continually reminded of the great war by the number of women who still wore black every day in memory of their husbands lovers brothers and sons who had never returned from the front in what nobody was any longer calling the war to end all wars she had pleaded with harry not to volunteer if war was declared but at least to wait until he was called up but after hitler had marched into czechoslovakia and annexed the sudetenland harry never wavered in his belief that war with germany was inevitable and that the moment it was declared he would be in uniform the following day when harry invited emma to join him for the commem ball at the end of his first year she resolved not to discuss the possibility of war she also made another decision emma travelled up to oxford on the morning of the ball and checked into the randolph hotel she spent the rest of the day being shown around somerville the ashmolean and the bodleian by harry who was confident she would be joining him as an undergraduate in a few months time emma returned to the hotel giving herself plenty of time to prepare for the ball harry had arranged to pick her up at eight he strolled through the front door of the hotel a few minutes before the appointed hour he was dressed in a fashionable midnight blue dinner jacket which his mother had given him for his nineteenth birthday he called emmas room from the front desk to tell her he was downstairs and would wait for her in the foyer ill be straight down she promised as the minutes passed harry began to pace around the foyer wondering what emma meant by straight down but giles had often told him that shed learnt how to tell the time from her mother and then he saw her standing at the top of the staircase he didnt move as she walked slowly down her strapless turquoise silk dress emphasizing her graceful figure every other young man in the foyer looked as if hed be happy to change places with harry wow he said as she reached the bottom step who needs vivien leigh by the way i love the shoes emma felt the first part of her plan was falling into place they walked out of the hotel and strolled arm in arm towards radcliffe square as they entered the gates of harrys college the sun began to dip behind the bodleian no one entering brasenose that evening would have thought that britain was only a few weeks away from a war in which over half the young men who danced the night away would never graduate but nothing could have been further from the thoughts of the gay young couples dancing to the music of cole porter and jerome kern while several hundred undergraduates and their guests consumed crates of champagne and ate their way through a mountain of smoked salmon harry rarely let emma out of his sight fearful that some ungallant soul might attempt to steal her away giles drank a little too much champagne ate far too many oysters and didnt dance with the same girl twice the entire evening at two oclock in the morning the billy cotton dance band struck up the last waltz harry and emma clung to each other as they swayed to the rhythm of the orchestra when the conductor finally raised his baton for the national anthem emma couldnt help noticing that all the young men around her whatever state of inebriation they were in stood rigidly to attention as they sang god save the king harry and emma walked slowly back to the randolph chatting about nothing of any consequence just not wanting the evening to end well at least youll be back in a fortnights time to sit your entrance exam said harry as they climbed the steps to the hotel so it wont be too long before i see you again true said emma but therell be no time for any distractions until ive completed the last paper once thats out of the way we can spend the rest of the weekend together harry was about to kiss her goodnight when she whispered would you like to come up to my room ive got a present for you i wouldnt want you to think id forgotten your birthday harry looked surprised as did the hall porter when the young couple walked up the staircase together hand in hand when they reached emmas room she fumbled nervously with the key before finally pushing open the door ill just be a moment she said as she disappeared into the bathroom harry sat down in the only chair in the room and tried to think of what hed most like for his birthday when the bathroom door opened emma was framed in the half light the elegant strapless gown had been replaced by a hotel towel harry could hear his heart beating as she walked slowly towards him i think youre a little overdressed my darling emma said as she slipped off his jacket and let it fall to the floor next she undid his bow tie before unbuttoning his shirt and both joined the jacket two shoes and two socks followed before she slowly pulled down his trousers she was about to remove the one remaining obstacle in her path when he gathered her up in his arms and carried her across the bedroom as he dumped her unceremoniously on to the bed the towel fell to the floor emma had often imagined this moment since theyd returned from rome and assumed that her first attempts at making love would be awkward and clumsy but harry was gentle and considerate although he was clearly every bit as nervous as she was after theyd made love she lay in his arms not wanting to fall asleep did you like your birthday present she asked yes i did said harry but i hope its not going to be another year before i can unwrap the next one that reminds me ive got a present for you too but its not my birthday its not a birthday present he jumped out of bed picked his trousers up off the floor and rummaged around in the pockets until he came across a small leather box he returned to the bedside fell to one knee and said emma my darling will you marry me you look quite ridiculous down there said emma frowning get back into bed before you freeze to death not until youve answered my question dont be silly harry i decided that we were going to be married the day you came to the manor house for giless twelfth birthday harry burst out laughing as he placed the ring on the third finger of her left hand im sorry its such a small diamond he said its as big as the ritz she said as he climbed back into bed and as you seem to have everything so well organized she teased what date have you chosen for our wedding saturday july the twentyninth at three oclock why then its the last day of term and in any case we cant book the university church after ive gone down emma sat up grabbed the pencil and pad from the bedside table and started to write what are you doing asked harry im working on the guest list if weve only got seven weeks that can wait said harry taking her back in his arms i feel another birthday coming on shes too young to be thinking about marriage said emmas father as if she wasnt in the room shes the same age i was when you proposed to me elizabeth reminded him but you werent about to sit the most important exam of your life just a fortnight before the wedding thats exactly why ive taken over all the arrangements said elizabeth that way emma wont have any distractions until her exams are over surely it would be better to put the wedding off for a few months after all whats the hurry what a good idea daddy said emma speaking for the first time perhaps we could also ask herr hitler if hed be kind enough to put off the war for a few months because your daughter wants to get married and what does mrs clifton think about all of this her father asked ignoring his daughters comment why should she be anything other than delighted by the news elizabeth asked him he didnt respond an announcement of the forthcoming marriage between emma grace barrington and harold arthur clifton was published in the times ten days later the first banns were read from the pulpit of st marys by the reverend styler on the following sunday and over three hundred invitations were sent out during the next week no one was surprised when harry asked giles to be his best man with captain tarrant and deakins as the principal ushers but harry was shocked when he received a letter from old jack declining his kind invitation because he couldnt leave his post in the current circumstances harry wrote back begging him to reconsider and at least attend the wedding even if he felt unable to take on the task of being an usher old jacks reply left harry even more confused i feel my presence might turn out to be an embarrassment what is he talking about said harry surely he knows that wed all be honoured if he came hes almost as bad as my father said emma hes refusing to give me away and says hes not even sure hell come but you told me hed promised to be more supportive in the future yes but that all changed the moment he heard we were engaged i cant pretend that my mother sounded all that enthusiastic when i told her the news either harry admitted emma didnt see harry again until she returned to oxford to sit her exams and even then not until shed completed the final paper when she came out of the examination hall her fiancé was waiting on the top step a bottle of champagne in one hand and two glasses in the other so how do you think you got on he asked as he filled her glass i dont know sighed emma as dozens of other girls poured out of the examination hall i didnt realize what i was up against until i saw that lot well at least youve got something to distract you while you wait for the results just three weeks to go emma reminded him thats more than enough time for you to change your mind if you dont win a scholarship i may have to reconsider my position after all i cant be seen associating with a commoner and if i do win a scholarship i may have to reconsider my position and look for another scholar deakins is still available said harry as he topped up her glass it will be too late by then said emma why because the results are due to be announced on the morning of our wedding emma and harry spent most of the weekend locked away in her little hotel room endlessly going over the wedding arrangements when they werent making love by sunday night emma had come to one conclusion mama has been quite magnificent she said which is more than i can say for my father do you think hell even turn up oh yes mamas talked him into coming but hes still refusing to give me away whats the latest on old jack he hasnt even replied to my last letter said harry have you put on a little weight darling asked emmas mother as she tried to fasten the last clasp on the back of her daughters wedding dress i dont think so replied emma looking at herself critically in the fulllength mirror stunning was elizabeths verdict as she stood back to admire the brides outfit they had travelled to london several times to have the dress fitted by madame renée the proprietor of a small fashionable boutique in mayfair thought to be patronized by queen mary and queen elizabeth madame renée had personally supervised each fitting and the victorian embroidered lace around the neck and hem something old blended quite naturally with the silk bodice and empire bell skirt that was proving so fashionable that year something new the little cream teardrop hat madame renée had assured them was what women of fashion would be wearing next year the only comment emmas father made on the subject came when he saw the bill elizabeth barrington glanced at her watch nineteen minutes to three no need to rush she told emma when there was a knock on the door she was sure shed hung the do not disturb sign on the doorknob and told the chauffeur not to expect them before three at the rehearsal the previous day the journey from the hotel to the church had taken seven minutes elizabeth intended emma to be fashionably late keep them waiting for a few minutes but dont give them any cause for concern a second knock ill get it elizabeth said and went to the door a young porter in a smart red uniform handed her a telegram the eleventh that day she was about to close the door when he said i was told to inform you madam that this one is important elizabeths first thought was to wonder who could possibly have cancelled at the last moment she only hoped it wouldnt mean reorganizing the top table at the reception she tore open the telegram and read the contents whos it from asked emma adjusting the angle of her hat by another inch and wondering if it was perhaps a little too risqué elizabeth handed her the telegram once emma had read it she burst into tears many congratulations darling said her mother taking a handkerchief out of her handbag and beginning to dry her daughters tears id hug you but i dont want to crease your dress once elizabeth was satisfied that emma was ready she spent a moment checking her own outfit in the mirror madame renée had pronounced you mustnt outdo your daughter on her big day but at the same time you cant afford to go unnoticed elizabeth particularly liked the norman hartnell hat even if it was not what the young were calling chic time to leave she declared after one more look at her watch emma smiled as she glanced at the goingaway outfit she would change into once the reception was over when she and harry would travel up to scotland for their honeymoon lord harvey had offered them mulgelrie castle for a fortnight with the promise that no other member of the family would be allowed within ten miles of the estate during that time and perhaps more important harry could ask for three portions of highland broth every night without a suggestion of grouse to follow emma followed her mother out of the suite and along the corridor by the time she reached the top of the staircase she felt sure her legs were about to give way as she descended the stairs other guests stood aside so that nothing would impede her progress a porter held open the front door of the hotel for her while sir walters chauffeur stood by the back door of the rolls so the bride could join her grandfather as emma sat down beside him carefully arranging her dress sir walter placed his monocle in his right eye and declared you look quite beautiful young lady harry is indeed a most fortunate man thank you grandpa she said kissing him on the cheek she glanced out of the rear window to see her mother climbing into a second rollsroyce and a moment later the two cars moved off to join the afternoon traffic as they began their sedate journey to the university church of st marys is daddy at the church asked emma trying not to sound anxious among the first to arrive said her grandfather i do believe hes already regretting allowing me the privilege of giving you away and harry never seen him so nervous but giles seems to have everything under control which must be a first i know hes spent the last month preparing his best mans speech were both lucky to have the same best friend said emma you know grandpa i once read that every bride has second thoughts on the morning of her wedding thats natural enough my dear but ive never had a second thought about harry said emma as they came to a halt outside the university church i know well spend the rest of our lives together she waited for her grandfather to step out of the car before she gathered up her dress and joined him on the pavement her mother rushed forward to check emmas outfit one last time before she would allow her to enter the church elizabeth handed her a small bouquet of pale pink roses as the two bridesmaids emmas younger sister grace and her school friend jessica gathered up the end of the train you next grace said her mother bending down to unruffle her bridesmaids dress i hope not said grace loud enough for her mother to hear elizabeth stepped back and nodded two sidesmen pulled open the heavy doors the sign for the organist to strike up mendelssohns wedding march and the congregation to rise and welcome the bride as emma stepped into the church she was taken by surprise to see how many people had travelled to oxford to share in her happiness she walked slowly down the aisle on her grandfathers arm the guests turning to smile at her as she made her way towards the altar she noticed mr frobisher sitting next to mr holcombe on the righthand side of the aisle miss tilly who was wearing quite a daring hat must have come all the way from cornwall while dr paget gave her the warmest of smiles but nothing compared with the smile that appeared on her own face when she spotted captain tarrant head bowed wearing a morning suit that didnt quite fit harry would be so pleased he had decided to come after all in the front row sat mrs clifton who had clearly spent some time selecting her outfit because she looked so fashionable a smile crossed emmas lips but she was surprised and disappointed that her future motherinlaw didnt turn to look at her as she passed and then she saw harry standing on the altar steps next to her brother as they waited for the bride emma continued up the aisle on the arm of one grandfather while the other stood bolt upright in the front row next to her father who she thought looked a little melancholy perhaps he really was regretting his decision not to give her away sir walter stood to one side as emma climbed the four steps to join her future husband she leaned over and whispered i nearly had a change of heart harry tried not to grin as he waited for the punch line after all scholars of this university cannot be seen to marry beneath themselves im so proud of you my darling he said many congratulations giles bowed low in genuine respect and chinese whispers broke out among the congregation as the news spread from row to row the music stopped and the college chaplain raised his hands and said dearly beloved we are gathered together here in the sight of god and in the face of this congregation to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony emma suddenly felt nervous she had learnt all the responses by heart but now she couldnt recall one of them first it was ordained for the procreation of children emma tried to concentrate on the chaplains words but she couldnt wait to escape and be alone with harry perhaps they should have gone up to scotland the night before and eloped at gretna green so much more convenient for mulgelrie castle shed pointed out to harry into which holy estate these two persons present come now to be joined therefore if any man can show any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together let him now speak or else hereafter for ever hold his peace the chaplain paused to allow a diplomatic period of time to pass before he pronounced the words i require and charge you both when a clear voice declared i object emma and harry both swung round to see who could possibly have uttered two such damning words the chaplain looked up in disbelief wondering for a moment if he had misheard but all over the church heads were turning as the congregation tried to discover who had made the unexpected intervention the chaplain had never experienced such a turn of events before and tried desperately to recall what he was expected to do in the circumstances emma buried her head in harrys shoulder while he searched among the chattering congregation trying to find out who it was who had caused such consternation he assumed it must be emmas father but when he looked down at the front row he saw hugo barrington white as a sheet was also trying to see who had brought the ceremony to a premature halt the reverend styler had to raise his voice to be heard above the growing clamour would the gentleman who has objected to this marriage taking place please make himself known a tall upright figure stepped out into the aisle every eye remained fixed on captain jack tarrant as he made his way up to the altar before coming to a halt in front of the chaplain emma clung on to harry fearful he was about to be prised away from her am i to understand sir said the chaplain that you feel this marriage should not be allowed to proceed that is correct sir said old jack quietly then i must ask you the bride and groom and the members of their immediate family to join me in the vestry raising his voice he added the congregation should remain in their places until i have considered the objection and made my decision known those who had been bidden were led by the chaplain into the vestry followed by harry and emma not one of them spoke although the congregation continued to whisper noisily among themselves once the two families had crammed themselves into the tiny vestry the reverend styler closed the door captain tarrant he began i must tell you that i alone am vested by law with the authority to decide whether this marriage should continue naturally i shall not come to any decision until i have heard your objections the only person in that overcrowded room who appeared calm was old jack thank you chaplain he began firstly i must apologize to you all and in particular to emma and harry for my intervention i have spent the past few weeks wrestling with my conscience before coming to this unhappy decision i could have taken the easy way out and simply found some excuse for not attending this ceremony today i have remained silent until now in the hope that in time any objection would prove irrelevant but sadly that has not proved to be the case for harry and emmas love for each other has in fact grown over the years and not diminished which is why it has become impossible for me to remain silent any longer everyone was so gripped by old jacks words that only elizabeth barrington noticed her husband slip quietly out of the back door of the vestry thank you captain tarrant said the reverend styler while i accept your intervention in good faith i need to know what specific charges you bring against these two young people i bring no charge against harry or emma both of whom i love and admire and believe to be as much in the dark as the rest of you no my charge is against hugo barrington who has known for many years that there is a possibility that he is the father of both of these unfortunate children a gasp went around the room as everyone tried to grasp the enormity of this statement the chaplain said nothing until he was able to regain their attention is there anyone present who can verify or refute captain tarrants claim this cant possibly be true said emma still clinging on to harry there must be some mistake surely my father cant that was the moment everyone became aware that the father of the bride was no longer among them the chaplain turned his attention to mrs clifton who was quietly sobbing i cant deny captain tarrants fears she said haltingly it was some time before she continued i confess i did have a relationship with mr barrington on one occasion she paused again only once but unfortunately it was just a few weeks before i married my husband she raised her head slowly so i have no way of knowing who harrys father is i should point out to you all said old jack that hugo barrington threatened mrs clifton on more than one occasion should she ever reveal his dreadful secret mrs clifton may i be allowed to ask you a question said sir walter gently maisie nodded although her head remained bowed did your late husband suffer from colourblindness not that im aware of she said barely loudly enough to be heard sir walter turned to harry but i believe you do my boy yes i do sir said harry without hesitation why is that of any importance because i am also colourblind said sir walter as are my son and grandson it is a hereditary trait that has troubled our family for several generations harry took emma in his arms i swear to you my darling i didnt know anything about this of course you didnt said elizabeth barrington speaking for the first time the only man who knew was my husband and he didnt have the courage to come forward and admit it if he had none of this need ever have happened father she said turning to lord harvey can i ask you to explain to our guests why the ceremony will not be continuing lord harvey nodded leave it to me old gal he said touching her gently on the arm but what are you going to do im going take my daughter as far away from this place as possible i dont want to go as far away as possible emma said unless its with harry i fear your father has left us with no choice said elizabeth taking her gently by the arm but emma continued to cling on to harry until he whispered im afraid your mothers right my darling but one thing your father will never be able to do is stop me loving you and if it takes the rest of my life ill prove hes not my father perhaps youd prefer to leave by the rear entrance mrs barrington suggested the chaplain emma reluctantly released harry and allowed her mother to take her away the chaplain led them out of the vestry and down a narrow corridor to a door that he was surprised to find unlocked may god go with you my children he said before letting them out elizabeth accompanied her daughter around the outside of the church to the waiting rollsroyces she ignored those members of the congregation who had strayed outside for some fresh air or to smoke a cigarette and now made no attempt to conceal their curiosity when they spotted the two women climbing unceremoniously into the back of the limousine elizabeth had opened the door of the first rolls and bundled her daughter into the back seat before the chauffeur spotted them he had stationed himself by the great door as he hadnt expected the bride and groom to appear for at least another half an hour when a peal of bells would announce the marriage of mr and mrs harry clifton to the world the moment the chauffeur heard the door slam he stubbed out his cigarette ran across to the car and jumped behind the wheel take us back to the hotel elizabeth said neither of them spoke again until they had reached the safety of their room emma lay sobbing on the bed while elizabeth stroked her hair the way she had when she was a child what am i going to do cried emma i cant suddenly stop loving harry im sure you never will said her mother but fate has decreed that you cannot be together until it can be proved who harrys father is she continued to stroke her daughters hair and thought she might even have fallen asleep until emma quietly added what will i tell my child when they ask who their father is harry clifton the thing i remember most after emma and her mother had left the church was how calm everyone appeared to be no hysterics no one fainted there werent even any raised voices a visitor might have been forgiven for not realizing how many peoples lives had just been irreparably damaged even ruined how very british stiff upper lip and all that no one willing to admit that their personal life had been shattered in the space of a single hour well i have to admit mine had i had stood in numbed silence as the different actors played out their roles old jack had done no more or less than what he considered his duty though the pallor of his skin and the deeply etched lines on his face suggested otherwise he could have taken the easy way out and simply declined our invitation to the wedding but victoria cross winners dont walk away elizabeth barrington was cast from that metal which when put to the test proved she was the equal of any man a veritable portia who sadly hadnt married a brutus as i looked around the vestry waiting for the chaplain to return i felt saddest for sir walter who had walked his granddaughter down the aisle and had not gained a grandson but rather lost a son who as old jack had warned me so many years ago was not cut from the same cloth as his father my dear mother was fearful to respond when i tried to take her in my arms and reassure her of my love she clearly believed she alone was to blame for everything that had taken place that day and giles he became a man when his father crept out of the vestry to hide under some slimy stone leaving the responsibility for his actions to others in time many of those present would become aware that what had taken place that day was every bit as devastating for giles as for emma finally lord harvey he was an example to us all of how to behave in a crisis once the chaplain had returned and explained the legal implications of consanguinity to us we agreed among ourselves that lord harvey should address the waiting congregation on behalf of both families i would like harry to stand on my right he said as i wish everyone present to be left in no doubt as my daughter elizabeth made abundantly clear that no blame rests on his shoulders mrs clifton he said turning to my mother i hope you will be kind enough to stand on my left your courage in adversity has been an example to us all and to one of us in particular i hope that captain tarrant will stand by harrys side only a fool blames the messenger giles should take his place beside him sir walter perhaps you would stand next to mrs clifton while the rest of the family take their places behind us let me make it clear to you all he continued that i only have one purpose in this tragic business namely to ensure that everyone gathered in this church today will be in no doubt of our resolve in this matter so that no one will ever say we were a divided house without another word he led his small flock out of the vestry when the chattering congregation saw us filing back into the church lord harvey didnt need to call for silence each one of us took our allocated place on the altar steps as if we were about to pose for a family photograph that would later find its way into a wedding album friends if i may be so bold began lord harvey i have been asked to let you know on behalf of our two families that sadly the marriage between my granddaughter emma barrington and mr harry clifton will not be taking place today or for that matter on any other day those last four words had a finality about them that was chilling when you were the only person present who still clung on to a vestige of hope that this might one day be resolved i must apologize to you all he continued if you have been inconvenienced in any way for that was surely not our purpose may i conclude by thanking you for your presence here today and wish you all a safe journey home i wasnt sure what would happen next but one or two members of the congregation rose from their places and began to make their way slowly out of the church within moments the trickle turned into a steady stream until finally those of us standing on the altar steps were the only ones remaining lord harvey thanked the chaplain and warmly shook hands with me before accompanying his wife down the aisle and out of the church my mother turned to me and tried to speak but was overcome by her emotions old jack came to our rescue taking her gently by the arm and leading her away while sir walter took grace and jessica under his wing not a day mothers or bridesmaids would want to recall for the rest of their lives giles and i were the last to leave he had entered the church as my best man and now he left it wondering if he was my halfbrother some people stand by you in your darkest hour while others walk away only a select few march towards you and become even closer friends once we had bidden farewell to the reverend styler who seemed unable to find the words to express how sorry he felt giles and i trudged wearily across the cobbled stones of the quad and back to our college not a word passed between us as we climbed the wooden staircase to my rooms and sank into old leather chairs and young maudlin silence we sat alone as day turned slowly into night sparse conversation that had no sequence no meaning no logic when the first long shadows appeared those heralds of darkness that so often loosen the tongue giles asked me a question i hadnt thought about for years do you remember the first time you and deakins visited the manor house how could i forget it was your twelfth birthday and your father refused to shake hands with me have you ever wondered why i think we found out the reason today i said trying not to sound too insensitive no we didnt said giles quietly what we found out today was the possibility that emma might be your halfsister i now realize the reason my father kept his affair with your mother secret for so many years was because he was far more worried you might find out you were his son i dont understand the difference i said staring at him then its important for you to recall the only question my father asked on that occasion he asked when my birthday was thats right and when he discovered you were a few weeks older than me he left the room without another word and later when we had to leave to go back to school he didnt come out of his study to say goodbye even though it was my birthday it wasnt until today that i realized the significance of his actions how can that minor incident still be of any significance after all these years i asked because that was the moment my father realized you might be his first born and that when he dies it could be you not me who inherits the family title the business and all his worldly goods but surely your father can leave his possessions to whomever he pleases and that certainly wouldnt be me i wish it was that simple said giles but as my grandpa so regularly reminds me his father sir joshua barrington was knighted by queen victoria in for services to the shipping industry in his will he stated that all his titles deeds and possessions were to be left to the firstborn surviving son in perpetuity but i have no interest in claiming what clearly is not mine i said trying to reassure him im sure you dont said giles but you may have no choice in the matter because in the fullness of time the law will require you to take your place as head of the barrington family giles left me just after midnight to drive to gloucestershire he promised to find out if emma was willing to see me as wed parted without even saying goodbye and said he would return to oxford the moment he had any news i didnt sleep that night so many thoughts were racing through my mind and for a moment just a moment i even contemplated suicide but i didnt need old jack to remind me that that was the cowards way out i didnt leave my rooms for the next three days i didnt respond to gentle knocks on the door i didnt answer the telephone when it rang i didnt open the letters that were pushed under the door it may have been inconsiderate of me not to respond to those who had only kindness in their hearts but sometimes an abundance of sympathy can be more overwhelming than solitude giles returned to oxford on the fourth day he didnt need to speak for me to realize his news wasnt going to give me succour it turned out to be far worse than i had even anticipated emma and her mother had left for mulgelrie castle where we had meant to be spending our honeymoon with no relations to be allowed within ten miles mrs barrington had instructed her solicitors to begin divorce proceedings but they were unable to serve any papers on her husband as no one had seen him since hed crept unnoticed out of the vestry lord harvey and old jack had both resigned from the board of barringtons but out of respect for sir walter neither had made their reasons for doing so public not that that would stop the rumourmongers having a field day my mother had left eddies nightclub and taken a job as a waitress in the dining room of the grand hotel what about emma i said did you ask her i didnt have a chance to speak to her said giles theyd left for scotland before i arrived but shed left a letter for you on the hall table i could feel my heart beating faster as he handed me an envelope bearing her familiar handwriting if you feel like a little supper later ill be in my rooms thank you i said inadequately i sat in my chair by the window overlooking cobbs quad not wanting to open a letter that i knew wouldnt offer me a glimmer of hope i finally tore open the envelope and extracted three pages written in emmas neat hand even then it was some time before i could read her words the manor house chew valley gloucestershire july th my darling harry its the middle of the night and i am sitting in my bedroom writing to the only man i will ever love deep hatred for my father whom i can never forgive has been replaced by a sudden calm so i must write these words before bitter recrimination returns to remind me of just how much that treacherous man has denied us both i only wish wed been allowed to part as lovers and not as strangers in a crowded room the fates having decided we should never say the words until death do us part although i am certain i will go to my grave only having loved one man i will never be satisfied with just the memory of your love for while there is the slightest hope that arthur clifton was your father be assured my darling that i will remain constant mama is convinced that given enough time the memory of you like the evening sun will fade and then finally disappear before heralding a new dawn does she not recall telling me on the day of my wedding that our love for each other was so pure so simple and so rare that it would unquestionably withstand the test of time which mama confessed she could only envy as she had never experienced such happiness but until i can be your wife my darling i am resolved that we must remain apart unless and until such time it can be shown that we can be legally bound no other man can hope to take your place and if necessary i will remain single rather than settle for some counterfeit i wonder if the day will dawn when i do not reach out expecting to find you by my side and if it will ever be possible to fall asleep without whispering your name i would happily sacrifice the rest of my life to spend another year like the one we have just shared together and no law made by god or man can change that i still pray that the day will come when we can be joined together in the sight of that same god and those same men but until then my darling i will always be your loving wife in all but name emma when harry finally summoned up the strength to open the countless letters that littered the floor he came across one from old jacks secretary in london soho square london wednesday august nd dear mr clifton you may not receive this letter until youve returned from your honeymoon in scotland but i wondered if captain tarrant stayed on in oxford after the wedding he didnt return to the office on monday morning and he hasnt been seen since so i wondered if you had any idea where i might contact him i look forward to hearing from you yours sincerely phyllis watson old jack had clearly forgotten to let miss watson know he was going down to bristol to spend a few days with sir walter to make it clear that although he had caused the wedding to be abandoned and had resigned from the board of barringtons he remained a close friend of the chairmans as there wasnt a second letter from miss watson among his pile of unopened mail harry assumed that old jack must have returned to soho square and be back behind his desk harry spent the morning answering every one of the letters hed left unopened so many kind people offering sympathy it wasnt their fault they reminded him of his unhappiness suddenly harry decided he had to be as far away from oxford as possible he picked up the phone and told the operator he wanted to make a longdistance call to london half an hour later she called back to tell him the number was continually engaged next he tried sir walter at barrington hall but the number just rang and rang frustrated by his failure to contact either of them harry decided to follow one of old jacks maxims get off your backside and do something positive he grabbed the suitcase he had packed for his honeymoon in scotland walked across to the lodge and told the porter he was going up to london and wouldnt be returning until the first day of term should giles barrington ask where i am he added please tell him ive gone to work for old jack old jack repeated the porter writing the name down on a slip of paper on the train journey to paddington harry read in the times about the latest communiqués that were bouncing back and forth between the foreign office in london and the reich ministry in berlin he was beginning to think that mr chamberlain was the only person who still believed in the possibility of peace in our time the times was predicting that britain would be at war within days and that the prime minister couldnt hope to survive in office if the germans defied his ultimatum and marched into poland the thunderer went on to suggest that in that eventuality a coalition government would have to be formed led by the foreign secretary lord halifax a safe pair of hands and not winston churchill unpredictable and irascible despite the papers obvious distaste for churchill harry didnt believe that britain needed a safe pair of hands at this particular moment in history but someone who was not frightened to bully a bully when harry stepped off the train at paddington he was met by a wave of different coloured uniforms coming at him from every direction hed already decided which service he would join the moment war was declared a morbid thought crossed his mind as he boarded a bus for piccadilly circus if he was killed while serving his country it would solve all the barrington familys problems except one when the bus reached piccadilly harry jumped off and began to weave his way through the clowns that made up the west end circus through theatre land and on past exclusive restaurants and overpriced nightclubs which appeared determined to ignore any suggestion of war the queue of displaced immigrants trooping in and out of the building in soho square appeared even longer and more bedraggled than on harrys first visit once again as he climbed the stairs to the third floor several of the refugees stood aside assuming he must be a member of staff he hoped he would be within the hour when he reached the third floor he headed straight for miss watsons office he found her filling in forms issuing rail warrants arranging accommodation and handing out small amounts of cash to desperate people her face lit up when she saw harry do tell me captain tarrants with you were her first words no he isnt said harry i assumed hed returned to london which is why im here i was wondering if you might be able to use an extra pair of hands thats very kind of you harry she said but the most useful thing you could do for me right now is to find captain tarrant this place is bursting at the seams without him the last i heard he was staying with sir walter barrington at his home in gloucester said harry but that was at least a fortnight ago we havent set eyes on him since the day he went to oxford for your wedding said miss watson as she tried to comfort two more immigrants who couldnt speak a word of english has anyone phoned his flat to see if hes there asked harry he doesnt have a phone said miss watson and ive hardly been to my own home for the past two weeks she added nodding in the direction of a queue that stretched as far as the eye could see why dont i start there and report back to you would you said miss watson as two little girls began sobbing dont cry everythings going to be all right she reassured the children as she knelt and placed an arm round them where does he live asked harry number twentythree prince edward mansions lambeth walk take the number eleven bus to lambeth then youll have to ask for directions and thank you harry harry turned and headed towards the stairs something wasnt right he thought old jack would never have deserted his post without giving miss watson a reason i forgot to ask miss watson shouted after him how was your honeymoon harry felt he was far enough away not to have heard her back at piccadilly circus he boarded a doubledecker bus overcrowded with soldiers it drove down whitehall which was full of officers and on through parliament square where a vast crowd of onlookers was waiting for any snippets of information that might come out of the house of commons the bus continued its journey across lambeth bridge and harry got off when it reached albert embankment a paperboy who was shouting britain awaits hitlers response told harry to take the second on the left then the third on the right and added for good measure i thought everyone knew where lambeth walk was harry began to run like a man being pursued and he didnt stop until he came to a block of flats that was so dilapidated he could only wonder which prince edward it had been named after he pushed open a door that wouldnt survive much longer on those hinges and walked quickly up a flight of stairs stepping nimbly between piles of rubbish that hadnt been cleared for days when he reached the second floor he stopped outside no and knocked firmly on the door but there was no reply he knocked again louder but still no one responded he ran back down the stairs in search of someone who worked in the building and when he reached the basement he found an old man slumped in an even older chair smoking a rollup and flicking through the pages of the daily mirror have you seen captain tarrant recently harry asked sharply not for the past couple of weeks sir said the man leaping to his feet and almost standing to attention when he heard harrys accent do you have a master key that will open his flat asked harry i do sir but im not allowed to use it except in emergencies i can assure you this is an emergency said harry who turned and bounded back up the stairs not waiting for his reply the man followed if not quite as quickly once hed caught up he opened the door harry moved quickly from room to room but there was no sign of old jack the last door he came to was closed he knocked quietly fearing the worst when there was no reply he cautiously went in to find a neatly made bed and no sign of anyone he must still be with sir walter was harrys first thought he thanked the porter walked back down the stairs and out on to the street as he tried to gather his thoughts he hailed a passing taxi not wanting to waste any more time on buses in a city that did not know him paddington station im in a hurry everyone seems to be in a hurry today said the cabbie as he moved off twenty minutes later harry was standing on platform but it was another fifty minutes before the train would depart for temple meads he used the time to grab a sandwich and a cup of tea only got cheese sir and to phone miss watson to let her know that old jack hadnt been back to his flat if it was possible she sounded even more harassed than when he had left her im on my way to bristol he told her ill ring you as soon as i catch up with him as the train made its way out of the capital through the smogfilled back streets of the city and into the clean air of the countryside harry decided he had no choice but to go straight to sir walters office at the dockyard even if it meant running into hugo barrington finding old jack surely outweighed any other consideration once the train shunted into temple meads harry knew the two buses he needed to catch without having to ask the paperboy who was standing on the corner bellowing britain awaits hitlers response at the top of his voice same headline but this time a bristolian accent thirty minutes later harry was at the dockyard gates can i help you asked a guard who didnt recognize him i have an appointment with sir walter said harry hoping this would not be questioned of course sir do you know the way to his office yes thank you said harry he started walking slowly towards a building hed never entered before he began to think about what he would do if he came face to face with hugo barrington before he reached sir walters office he was pleased to see the chairmans rollsroyce parked in its usual place and even more relieved that there was no sign of hugo barringtons bugatti he was just about to enter barrington house when he glanced at the railway carriage in the distance was it just possible he changed direction and walked towards the pullman wagon lit as old jack was wont to describe it after a second glass of whisky when harry reached the carriage he knocked gently on the glass pane as if it were a grand home a butler did not appear so he opened the door and climbed in he walked along the corridor to first class and there he was sitting in his usual seat it was the first time harry had ever seen old jack wearing his victoria cross harry took the seat opposite his friend and recalled the first time hed sat there he must have been about five and his feet hadnt reached the ground then he thought of the time hed run away from st bedes and the shrewd old gentleman had persuaded him to be back in time for breakfast he recalled when old jack had come to hear him sing a solo in the church the time his voice had broken old jack had dismissed this as a minor setback then there was the day he learnt hed failed to win a scholarship to bristol grammar school a major setback despite his failure old jack had presented him with the ingersoll watch he was still wearing today it must have cost him every penny he possessed in harrys last year at school old jack had travelled down from london to see him playing romeo and harry had introduced him to emma for the first time and he would never forget his final speech day when jack had sat on stage as a governor of his old school and watched harry being awarded the english prize and now harry would never be able to thank him for so many acts of friendship over the years that couldnt be repaid he stared at a man hed loved and had assumed would never die as they sat there together in first class the sun went down on his young life harry watched as the stretcher was placed in the ambulance a heart attack the doctor had said before the ambulance drove away harry didnt need to go and tell sir walter that old jack was dead because when he woke the following morning the chairman of barringtons was sitting by his side he told me he no longer had any reason to live were sir walters first words we have both lost a close and dear friend harrys response took sir walter by surprise what will you do with this carriage now that old jack is no longer around no one will be allowed anywhere near it as long as im chairman said sir walter it harbours too many personal memories for me me too said harry i spent more time here when i was a boy than i did in my own home or in the classroom for that matter said sir walter with a wry smile i used to watch you from my office window i thought what an impressive child you must be if old jack was willing to spend so much time with you harry smiled when he remembered how old jack had come up with a reason why he should go back to school and learn to read and write what will you do now harry return to oxford and continue with your studies no sir i fear that well be at war by by the end of the month would be my guess said sir walter then ill leave oxford immediately and join the navy ive already told my college supervisor mr bainbridge that thats what i plan to do he assured me i can return and continue with my studies as soon as the war is over typical of oxford said sir walter they always take the long view so will you go to dartmouth and train as a naval officer no sir ive been around ships all my life in any case old jack started out as a private soldier and managed to work his way up through the ranks so why shouldnt i why not indeed said sir walter in fact that was one of the reasons he was always considered to be a class above the rest of us who served with him i had no idea youd served together oh yes i served with captain tarrant in south africa said sir walter i was one of the twentyfour men whose lives he saved on the day he was awarded the victoria cross that explains so much that ive never really understood said harry he then surprised sir walter a second time do i know any of the others sir the frob said sir walter but in those days he was lieutenant frobisher corporal holcombe mr holcombes father and young private deakins deakinss father said harry yes sprogg as we used to call him a fine young soldier he never said much but he turned out to be very brave lost an arm on that dreadful day the two men fell silent each lost in his own thoughts of old jack before sir walter asked so if youre not going to dartmouth my boy may i ask how you plan to win the war singlehanded ill serve on any ship that will take me sir as long as theyre willing to go in search of his britannic majestys enemies then its possible i may be able to help thats kind of you sir but i want to join a war ship not a passenger liner or a cargo vessel sir walter smiled again and so you will dear boy dont forget im kept informed about every ship that comes in and out of these docks and i know most of their captains come to think of it i knew most of their fathers when they were captains why dont we go up to my office and see what ships are due in and out of the port in the next few days and more important find out if any of them might be willing to take you on thats very decent of you sir but would it be all right if i visited my mother first i might not have the chance to see her again for some time only right and proper my boy said sir walter and once youve been to see your mother why dont you drop into my office later this afternoon that should give me enough time to check on the latest shipping lists thank you sir ill return as soon as ive told my mother what i plan to do when you come back just tell the man on the gate youve got an appointment with the chairman then you shouldnt have any trouble getting past security thank you sir said harry masking a smile and do pass on my kindest regards to your dear mother a remarkable woman harry was reminded why sir walter was old jacks closest friend harry walked into the grand hotel a magnificent victorian building in the centre of the city and asked the doorman the way to the dining room he walked across the lobby and was surprised to find a small queue at the maître ds desk waiting to be allocated tables he joined the back of the queue recalling how his mother had always disapproved of him dropping in to see her at tillys or the royal hotel during working hours while harry waited he looked around the dining room which was full of chattering people none of whom looked as if they were anticipating a food shortage or thinking of enlisting in the armed forces should the country go to war food was being whisked in and out of the swing doors on heavily laden silver trays while a man in a chefs outfit was wheeling a trolley from table to table slicing off slivers of beef while another followed in his wake carrying a gravy boat harry could see no sign of his mother he was even beginning to wonder if giles had only told him what he wanted to hear when suddenly she burst through the swing doors three plates balanced on her arms she placed them in front of her customers so deftly they hardly noticed she was there then returned to the kitchen she was back a moment later carrying three vegetable dishes by the time harry had reached the front of the queue hed been reminded of who had given him his boundless energy uncritical enthusiasm and a spirit that didnt contemplate defeat how would he ever be able to repay this remarkable woman for all the sacrifices she had made im sorry to have kept you waiting sir said the maître d interrupting his thoughts but i dont have a table available at the moment if youd care to come back in about twenty minutes harry didnt tell him he didnt actually want a table and not just because his mother was one of the waitresses but because he wouldnt have been able to afford anything on the menu other than perhaps the gravy ill come back later he said trying to sound disappointed about ten years later he thought by which time he suspected his mother would probably be the maître d he left the hotel with a smile on his face and took a bus back to the docks he was ushered straight through to sir walters office by his secretary and found the chairman leaning on his desk peering down at the port schedules timetables and ocean charts that covered every inch of its surface have a seat dear boy said sir walter before fixing his monocle in his right eye and looking sternly at harry ive had a little time to think about our conversation this morning he continued sounding very serious and before we go any further i need to be convinced that youre making the right decision im absolutely certain said harry without hesitation that may be but im equally certain that jack would have advised you to return to oxford and wait until you were called up he may well have done so sir but he wouldnt have taken his own advice how well you knew him said sir walter indeed thats exactly what i expected you to say let me tell you what ive come up with so far he continued returning his attention to the papers that covered his desk the good news is that the royal navy battleship hms resolution is due to dock at bristol in about a months time when it will refuel before awaiting further orders a month said harry making no attempt to hide his frustration patience boy said sir walter the reason i chose the resolution is because the captain is an old friend and im confident i can get you on board as a deckhand as long as the other part of my plan works out but would the captain of the resolution consider taking on someone with no seafaring experience probably not but if everything else falls into place by the time you board the resolution you will be an old sea dog recalling one of old jacks favourite homilies i find i dont learn a lot while im talking harry decided to stop interrupting and start listening now sir walter continued ive identified three ships that are due to leave bristol in the next twentyfour hours and are expected to return within three to four weeks which will give you more than enough time to sign up as a deckhand on the resolution harry wanted to interrupt but didnt lets begin with my first choice the devonian is bound for cuba with a manifest of cotton dresses potatoes and raleigh lenton bicycles and is due to return to bristol in four weeks time with a cargo of tobacco sugar and bananas the second ship on my shortlist is the ss kansas star a passenger vessel that will be sailing to new york on the first tide tomorrow it has been requisitioned by the united states government to transport american nationals back home before britain finds itself at war with germany the third is an empty oil tanker the ss princess beatrice which is on its way back to amsterdam to refuel and will return to bristol with a full load before the end of the month all three skippers are painfully aware that they need to be safely back in port as quickly as possible because if war is declared the two merchant vessels will be considered fair game by the germans while only the kansas star will be safe from the german uboats skulking around the atlantic just waiting for the order to sink anything flying a red or blue ensign what crew are these ships in need of asked harry im not exactly overqualified sir walter searched around his desk again before extracting another sheet of paper the princess beatrice is short of a deckhand the kansas star is looking for someone to work in the kitchens which usually means as a washerupper or a waiter while the devonian needs a fourth officer so that one can be removed from the shortlist funnily enough said sir walter thats the position i consider you best qualified for the devonian has a crew of thirtyseven and rarely goes to sea with a trainee officer so no one would expect you to be anything other than a novice but why would the captain consider me because i told him you were my grandson harry walked along the dock towards the devonian the small suitcase he was carrying made him feel like a schoolboy on his first day of term what would the headmaster be like would he sleep in a bed next to a giles or a deakins would he come across an old jack would there be a fisher on board although sir walter had offered to accompany him and introduce him to the captain harry had felt that would not be the best way to endear himself to his new shipmates he stopped for a moment and looked closely at the ancient vessel on which he would be spending the next month sir walter had told him that the devonian had been built in when the oceans were still dominated by sail and a motorized cargo vessel would have been thought the latest thing but now twentysix years later it wouldnt be too long before she was decommissioned and taken to that area of the docks where old ships are broken up and their parts sold for scrap sir walter had also hinted that as captain havens only had one more year to serve before he retired the owners might decide to scrap him at the same time as his ship the devonians articles of agreement showed a crew of thirtyseven but as on so many cargo ships that number wasnt quite accurate a cook and a washerup picked up in hong kong didnt appear on the payroll nor did the occasional deckhand or two who was fleeing the law and had no desire to return to his homeland harry made his way slowly up the gangway once hed stepped on deck he didnt move until hed received permission to board after all his years of hanging around the docks he was well aware of ships protocol he looked up at the bridge and assumed the man he saw giving orders must be captain havens sir walter had told him the senior officer on a cargo vessel was in fact a master mariner but should always be addressed on board as captain captain havens was a shade under six foot and looked nearer fifty than sixty he was stockily built with a weathered tanned face and a dark neatly trimmed beard that as he was going bald made him look like george v when he spotted harry waiting at the top of the gangway the captain gave a crisp order to the officer standing next to him on the bridge before making his way down on to the deck im captain havens he said briskly you must be harry clifton he shook harry warmly by the hand welcome aboard the devonian you come highly recommended i should point out sir began harry that this is my first im aware of that said havens lowering his voice but id keep it to yourself if you dont want your time on board to be a living hell and whatever you do dont mention you were at oxford because most of this lot he said indicating the seamen working on the deck will think its just the name of another ship follow me ill show you the fourth officers quarters harry followed in the captains wake aware that a dozen suspicious eyes were watching his every move there are two other officers on my ship said the captain once harry had caught up with him jim patterson the senior engineer spends most of his life down below in the boiler room so youll only see him at mealtimes and sometimes not even then hes served with me for the past fourteen years and frankly i doubt if this old lady would still make it halfway across the channel let alone the atlantic if he wasnt down there to coax her along my third officer tom bradshaw is on the bridge hes only been with me for three years so hes not yet earned his ticket he keeps himself to himself but whoever trained him knew what they were doing because hes a damn fine officer havens began to disappear down a narrow stairwell that led to the deck below thats my cabin he said as he continued down the corridor and thats mr pattersons he came to a halt in front of what appeared to be a broom cupboard this is your cabin he pushed the door open but it only moved a few inches before it banged against a narrow wooden bed i wont come in as there isnt room for both of us youll find some clothes on the bed once youve changed join me on the bridge well be setting sail within the hour leaving the harbour will probably be the most interesting part of the voyage until we dock in cuba harry squeezed through the halfopen door and had to close it behind him to allow enough room to change his clothes he checked the gear that had been left neatly folded on his bunk two thick blue sweaters two white shirts two pairs of blue trousers three pairs of blue woollen socks and a pair of canvas shoes with thick rubber soles it really was like being back at school every item had one thing in common they all looked as if theyd been worn by several other people before harry he quickly changed into his seamans gear then unpacked his suitcase as there was only one drawer harry placed the little suitcase full of his civilian clothes under the bed the only thing in the cabin that fitted perfectly he opened the door squeezed back into the corridor and went in search of the stairwell once hed located it he emerged back on deck several more pairs of suspicious eyes followed his progress mr clifton said the captain as harry stepped on to the bridge for the first time this is tom bradshaw the third officer who will be taking the ship out of the harbour as soon as weve been given clearance by the port authority by the way mr bradshaw said havens one of our tasks on this voyage will be to teach this young pup everything we know so that when we return to bristol in a months time the crew of hms resolution will mistake him for an old sea dog if mr bradshaw commented his words were drowned by two long blasts on a siren a sound harry had heard many times over the years indicating that the two tug boats were in place and waiting to escort the devonian out of the harbour the captain pressed some tobacco into his wellworn briar pipe while mr bradshaw acknowledged the signal with two blasts of the ships horn to confirm that the devonian was ready to depart prepare to cast off mr bradshaw said captain havens striking a match mr bradshaw removed the cover from a brass voicepipe harry hadnt noticed until that moment all engines slow ahead mr patterson the tug boats are in place and ready to escort us out of harbour he added revealing a slight american accent all engines slow ahead mr bradshaw came back a voice from the boiler room harry looked down over the side of the bridge and watched as the crew carried out their allotted tasks four men two at the bow and two at the stern were unwinding thick ropes from the capstans on the dock another two were hauling up the gangway keep your eye on the pilot said the captain between puffs on his pipe its his responsibility to guide us out of the harbour and safely into the channel once hes done that mr bradshaw will take over if you turn out to be any good mr clifton you may be allowed to take his place in about a years time but not until ive retired and mr bradshaw has taken over command as bradshaw didnt give even the flicker of a smile harry remained silent and continued to watch everything going on around him no one is allowed to take my girl out at night continued captain havens unless im sure he wont take any liberties with her again bradshaw didnt smile but then he may have heard the comment before harry found himself fascinated by how smoothly the whole operation was carried out the devonian eased away from the quayside and with the help of the two tug boats nosed her way slowly out of the docks along the river avon and under the suspension bridge do you know who built that bridge mr clifton the captain asked taking his pipe out of his mouth isambard kingdom brunel sir said harry and why did he never live to see it opened because the local council ran out of money and he died before the bridge was completed the captain scowled next youll be telling me its named after you he said putting his pipe back in his mouth he didnt speak again until the tug boats had reached barry island when they gave two more long blasts released their lines and headed back to port the devonian may have been an old lady but it soon became clear to harry that captain havens and his crew knew exactly how to handle her take over mr bradshaw said the captain as another pair of eyes appeared on the bridge their owner carrying two mugs of hot tea there will be three officers on the bridge during this crossing lu so be sure that mr clifton also gets a mug of tea the chinaman nodded and disappeared below deck once the harbour lights had disappeared over the horizon the waves became larger and larger causing the ship to roll from side to side havens and bradshaw stood feet apart appearing to be glued to the deck while harry found himself regularly having to cling on to something to make sure he didnt fall over when the chinaman reappeared with a third mug of tea harry chose not to mention to the captain that it was cold and that his mother usually added a lump of sugar just as harry was beginning to feel a little more confident almost enjoying the experience the captain said not much more you can do tonight mr clifton why dont you go below and try to catch some shuteye be back on the bridge by seven twenty to take over the breakfast watch harry was about to protest when a smile appeared on mr bradshaws face for the first time goodnight sir said harry before making his way down the steps and on to the deck he wobbled slowly towards the narrow stairwell feeling with every step he took that he was being watched by even more eyes one voice said loud enough for him to hear he must be a passenger no hes an officer said a second voice whats the difference several men laughed once he was back in his cabin he undressed and climbed on to the thin wooden bunk he tried to find a comfortable position without falling out or rolling into the wall as the ship swayed from side to side as well as lurching up and down he didnt even have a wash basin to be sick in or a porthole to be sick out of as he lay awake his thoughts turned to emma he wondered if she was still in scotland or had returned to the manor house or perhaps shed already taken up residence at oxford would giles be wondering where he was or had sir walter told him hed gone to sea and would be joining the resolution the moment he landed back in bristol and would his mother be wondering where he could be perhaps he should have broken her golden rule and interrupted her at work finally he thought about old jack and suddenly felt guilty when he realized he wouldnt be back in time for his funeral what harry couldnt know was that his own funeral would take place before old jacks harry was woken by the sound of four bells he leapt up hitting his head on the ceiling threw on his clothes squeezed into the corridor shot up the stairwell ran across the deck and bounded up the steps on to the bridge sorry im late sir i must have overslept you dont have to call me sir when were on our own said bradshaw the names tom and as a matter of fact youre over an hour early the skipper obviously forgot to tell you its seven bells for the breakfast watch and four for the six oclock watch but as youre here why dont you take over the wheel while i take a leak the shock for harry was to realize that bradshaw wasnt joking just be sure the arrow on the compass is always pointing sousouwest then you cant go far wrong he added his american accent sounding more pronounced harry took the wheel with both hands and stared intently at the little black arrow as he tried to keep the ship ploughing through the waves in a straight line when he looked back at the wake he saw that the neat straight line bradshaw had achieved with such apparent ease had been replaced by the sort of curves more associated with mae west although bradshaw was only away for a few minutes harry had rarely been more pleased to see anyone when he returned bradshaw took over and the uninterrupted straight line quickly reappeared although he only had one hand on the wheel remember youre handling a lady said bradshaw you dont cling on to her but gently caress her if you can manage that shell stay on the straight and narrow now try again while i plot our seven bells position on the daily chart when one bell rang twentyfive minutes later and the captain appeared on the bridge to relieve bradshaw harrys line in the ocean may not have been entirely straight but at least it no longer appeared as if the ship was being steered by a drunken sailor at breakfast harry was introduced to a man who could only have been first engineer jim pattersons ghostly complexion made him look as if hed spent most of his life below decks and his paunch suggested he spent the rest of the time eating unlike bradshaw he never stopped talking and it quickly became clear to harry that he and the skipper were old friends the chinaman appeared carrying three plates that could have been cleaner harry avoided the greasy bacon and fried tomatoes in favour of a piece of burnt toast and an apple why dont you spend the rest of the morning finding your way around the ship mr clifton suggested the captain after the plates had been cleared away you could even join mr patterson in the engine room and see how many minutes you survive down there patterson burst out laughing grabbed the last two pieces of toast and said if you think these are burnt wait until youve spent a few minutes with me like a cat that has been left alone in a new house harry began stalking around the outside of the deck as he tried to become familiar with his new kingdom he knew the ship was feet long with a foot beam and its top speed was fifteen knots but hed had no idea there would be so many nooks and crannies that undoubtedly served some purpose which given time he would learn harry also noticed there wasnt any part of the deck the captain couldnt keep a watchful eye on from the bridge so there was no chance of escape for an idle seaman harry took the stairwell down to the middle deck the aft section consisted of the officers quarters amidships was the galley and forward was a large open area of slung hammocks how anyone could possibly sleep in one of those was beyond him then he noticed half a dozen sailors who must have come off the dog watch swaying gently from side to side with the rhythm of the ship and sleeping contentedly a narrow steel stairwell led down to the lower deck where the wooden crates that held the raleigh bicycles a thousand cotton dresses and two tons of potatoes were all safely secured and wouldnt be opened until after the ship docked in cuba finally he descended a narrow ladder that led to the boiler room and mr pattersons domain he heaved open the heavy metal hatch and like shadrach meshach and abednego marched boldly into the fiery furnace he stood and watched as half a dozen squat musclebound men their vests soiled with black dust sweat pouring down their backs shovelled coal into two gaping mouths that needed to be fed more than four meals a day as captain havens had predicted it was only a few minutes before harry had to stagger back into the corridor sweating and gasping for breath it was some time before he recovered enough to make his way back up on to the deck where he fell on his knees and gulped in the fresh air he could only wonder how those men could survive in such conditions and be expected to carry out three twohour shifts a day seven days a week once harry had recovered he made his way back up to the bridge armed with a hundred questions from which star in the plough points to the north star to how many nautical miles the ship could average per day to how many tons of coal were required for the captain happily answered them all without once appearing exasperated by the young fourth officers unquenchable thirst for knowledge in fact captain havens remarked to mr bradshaw during harrys break that what impressed him most about the lad was that he never asked the same question twice during the next few days harry learnt how to check the compass against the dotted line on the chart how to gauge wind direction by watching seagulls and how to take the ship through the trough of a wave and still maintain a constant course by the end of the first week he was allowed to take over the wheel whenever an officer took a meal break by night the captain taught him the names of the stars which he pointed out were every bit as reliable as a compass but he confessed his knowledge was limited to the northern hemisphere as the devonian had never crossed the equator in all her twentysix years on the high seas after ten days at sea the captain was almost hoping for a storm not only to stop the endless questions but also to see if there was anything that could throw this young man off his stride jim patterson had already warned him that mr clifton had survived for an hour in the boiler room that morning and was determined to complete a full shift before they docked in cuba at least youre spared his endless questions down there remarked the captain this week responded the chief engineer captain havens wondered if a time would come when he learnt something from his fourth officer it happened on the twelfth day of the voyage just after harry had completed his first twohour shift in the boiler room did you know that mr patterson collects stamps sir harry asked yes i did replied the captain confidently and that his collection now numbers over four thousand including an unperforated penny black and a south african triangular cape of good hope yes i did repeated the captain and that the collection is now worth more than his home in mablethorpe its only a cottage damn it said the captain trying to hold his own and before harry could ask his next question he added id be more interested if you could find out as much about tom bradshaw as you seem to have wormed out of my chief engineer because frankly harry i know more about you after twelve days than i do about my third officer after three years and until now id never thought of americans as being a reserved race the more harry thought about the captains observation the more he realized just how little he too knew about tom despite having spent many hours with him on the bridge he had no idea if the man had any brothers or sisters what his father did for a living where his parents lived or whether he even had a girlfriend and only his accent gave away the fact that he was an american because harry didnt know which town or even state he hailed from seven bells rang would you take over the wheel mr clifton said the captain while i join mr patterson and mr bradshaw for dinner dont hesitate to let me know if you spot anything he added as he left the bridge especially if its bigger than we are aye aye sir said harry delighted to be left in charge even if it was only for forty minutes although those forty minutes were being extended each day it was when harry asked him how many more days it would be before they reached cuba that captain havens realized the precocious youth was already bored he was beginning to feel some sympathy for the captain of hms resolution who had no idea what he was letting himself in for harry had recently been taking over the wheel after dinner so that the other officers could enjoy a few hands of gin rummy before returning to the bridge and whenever the chinaman took up harrys mug of tea now it was always piping hot with the requested one lump of sugar mr patterson was heard to remark to the captain one evening that should mr clifton decide to take over the ship before they got back to bristol he wasnt sure who hed side with are you thinking of inciting a mutiny jim asked havens as he poured his chief engineer another tot of rum no but i must warn you skipper that the young turk has already reorganized the shifts in the boiler room so i know whose side my lads would be on then the least we can do said havens pouring himself a glass of rum is order the flag officer to send a message to the resolution warning them what theyll be up against but we dont have a flag officer said patterson then well have to clap the lad in irons said the captain good idea skipper its just a shame we dont have any irons mores the pity remind me to pick some up as soon as we get back to bristol but you seem to have forgotten cliftons leaving us to join the resolution the moment we dock patterson said the captain swallowed a mouthful of rum before repeating mores the pity harry reported to the bridge a few minutes before seven bells to relieve mr bradshaw so he could go below and join the captain for dinner the length of time tom left him in charge of the bridge was becoming longer and longer with each watch but harry never complained because he enjoyed the illusion that for an hour a day the ship was under his command he checked the arrow on the compass and steered the course that had been set by the captain he had even been entrusted with entering their position on the chart and writing up the daily log before he came off duty as harry stood alone on the bridge a full moon a calm sea and a thousand miles of ocean ahead of him his thoughts drifted back to england he wondered what emma was doing at that moment emma was sitting in her room at somerville college oxford tuning her radio to the home service so she could hear mr neville chamberlain address the nation this is the bbc in london you will now hear a statement from the prime minister i am speaking to you from the cabinet room ten downing street this morning the british ambassador in berlin handed the german government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by eleven oclock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from poland a state of war would exist between us i have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received and that consequently this country is at war with germany but as the devonians radio was unable to pick up the bbc everyone on board went about their business as if it was a normal day harry was still thinking about emma when the first one shot past the bow he wasnt sure what he should do he was loath to disturb the captain during dinner for fear of being reprimanded for wasting his time harry was wide awake when he saw the second one and this time he had no doubt what it was harry watched as the long slender shiny object slithered below the surface towards the bow of the ship he instinctively swung the wheel to starboard but the ship veered to port it wasnt quite what hed intended but the mistake gave him enough time to raise the alarm because the object shot past the bow missing the ship by several yards this time he didnt hesitate and jammed the palm of his hand on the klaxon which immediately emitted a loud blast moments later mr bradshaw appeared on deck and began racing towards the bridge closely followed by the captain pulling on his jacket one by one the rest of the crew came rushing out of the bowels of the ship and headed straight for their stations assuming it must be an unscheduled fire drill whats the problem mr clifton asked captain havens calmly as he stepped on to the bridge i think i saw a torpedo sir but as ive never seen one before i cant be sure could it have been a dolphin enjoying our leftovers suggested the captain no sir it wasnt a dolphin ive never seen a torpedo either havens admitted as he took over the wheel which direction was it coming from nornoreast mr bradshaw said the captain all crew to emergency stations and prepare to lower the lifeboats on my command aye aye sir said bradshaw who slid down the railings on to the deck and immediately began to organize the crew mr clifton keep your eyes peeled and tell me the moment you spot anything harry grabbed the binoculars and began a slow sweep of the ocean at the same time the captain bellowed down the voicepipe all engines reverse mr patterson all engines reverse and stand by for further orders aye aye sir said a startled chief engineer who hadnt heard that order since another one said harry nornoreast coming directly towards us i see it said the captain he swung the wheel to the left and the torpedo missed them by only a few feet he knew he was unlikely to pull off that trick again you were right mr clifton that wasnt a dolphin said havens matteroffactly under his breath he added we must be at war the enemy has torpedoes and all ive got is a hundred and fortyfour raleigh bicycles a few sacks of potatoes and some cotton dresses harry kept his eyes peeled the captain remained so calm that harry felt almost no sense of danger number four coming directly at us sir he said nornoreast again havens gamely tried to manoeuvre the old lady one more time but she didnt respond quickly enough to his unwelcome advances and the torpedo ripped into the ships bow a few minutes later mr patterson reported that a fire had broken out below the waterline and that his men were finding it impossible to douse the flames with the ships primitive foam hoses the captain didnt need to be told that he was facing a hopeless task mr bradshaw prepare to abandon ship all crew to stand by the lifeboats and await further orders aye aye sir shouted bradshaw from the deck havens bellowed down the voicepipe mr patterson get yourself and your men out of there immediately and i mean immediately and report to the lifeboats were on our way skipper another one sir said harry nornorwest heading towards the starboard side amidships the captain swung the wheel once again but he knew this time he would not be able to ride the punch seconds later the torpedo ripped into the ship which began to list to one side abandon ship shouted havens reaching for the tannoy abandon ship he repeated several times before he turned to harry who was still scanning the sea through his binoculars make your way to the nearest lifeboat mr clifton and sharpish theres no point in anyone remaining on the bridge aye aye sir said harry captain came a voice from the engine room number four hold is jammed im trapped below deck along with five of my men were on our way mr patterson well have you out of there in no time change of plan mr clifton follow me the captain shot down the stairs his feet barely touching the steps with harry just inches behind him mr bradshaw shouted the captain as he dodged in and out of the oilfed lapping flames which had reached the upper deck get the men into the lifeboats sharpish and abandon ship aye aye sir said bradshaw who was clinging on to the ships railings i need an oar and make sure you have one lifeboat on standby ready to take mr patterson and his men from the boiler room bradshaw grabbed an oar from one of the lifeboats and with the help of another seaman managed to pass it to the captain harry and the skipper took one end each and stumbled along the deck towards number four hold harry was puzzled what use an oar could possibly be against torpedoes but this wasnt the time to be asking questions the captain charged on past the chinaman who was on his knees head bowed praying to his god get yourself into the lifeboat now you stupid bugger shouted havens mr lu rose unsteadily to his feet but didnt move as harry staggered past he shoved the man in the direction of the third officer causing mr lu to topple forwards and almost fall into mr bradshaws arms when the captain reached the hatch above number four hold he wedged the thin end of the oar into an arched hook jumped up and threw all his weight on to the blade harry quickly joined him and together they managed to lever up the massive iron plate until there was a gap of about a foot you pull the men out mr clifton while i try to keep the hatch open said havens as two hands appeared through the gap harry let go of the oar fell to his knees and crawled towards the open hatch as he grabbed the mans shoulders a wave of water swept over him and into the hold he yanked the seaman out and shouted at him to report straight to the lifeboats the second man was more agile and managed to pull himself out without harrys assistance while the third was in such a blind panic that he shot through the hole and banged his head on the hatch lid before staggering off after his shipmates the next two followed in quick succession and scrambled on their hands and knees in the direction of the last remaining lifeboat harry waited for the chief engineer to appear but there was no sign of him the ship lurched further over and harry had to cling to the deck to stop himself falling headfirst into the hold he peered down into the darkness and spotted an outstretched hand he put his head through the hole and leaned down as far as he could without falling in but couldnt quite reach the second officers fingers mr patterson tried several times to jump up but with each attempt his efforts were hampered as more water poured in on top of him captain havens could see what the problem was but couldnt come to their assistance because if he let go of the oar the hatch lid would come crashing down on harry patterson who was now up to his knees in water shouted for gods sake you two get yourselves into the lifeboats before its too late not a chance said the captain mr clifton get yourself down there and push the bastard up then you can follow harry didnt hesitate he lowered himself backwards feet first into the hold gripping on to the ledge with his fingertips finally he let go and dropped into the darkness the sloshing oily freezing water broke his fall and once hed regained his balance he gripped the sides lowered himself down into the water and said climb on to my shoulders sir and you should be able to reach the chief engineer obeyed the fourth officer but when he stretched up he was still a few inches short of the deck harry used every ounce of strength in his body to push patterson further up until he was able to reach the rim of the hatch and cling on by the tips of his fingers water was now pouring into the hold as the ship listed further and further over harry placed a hand under each of mr pattersons buttocks and began to press like a weightlifter until the chief engineers head appeared above the deck good to see you jim grunted the captain as he continued to place every ounce of his weight on to the oar you too arnold replied the chief engineer as he pulled himself slowly out of the hold it was at that moment the last torpedo hit the sinking ship the oar snapped in half and the iron hatch lid came crashing down on the chief engineer like the axe of a medieval executioner with one slice it cleanly severed his head and slammed shut pattersons body fell back into the hold landing in the water next to harry harry thanked god he couldnt see mr patterson in the darkness that now surrounded him at least the water had stopped flooding in even if it meant there was now no escape as the devonian began to keel over harry assumed the captain must also have been killed or he surely would have been banging on the hatch trying to find some way of getting him out as he slumped down into the water harry thought how ironic it was that he should go to his grave like his father entombed in the hollow bottom of a ship he clung to the side of the hold in one final effort to cheat death as he waited for the water to rise inch by inch above his shoulders his neck his head myriad faces flashed before him strange thoughts take over when you know you only have a few moments left to live at least his death would solve problems for so many people he loved emma would be released from her pledge to forsake all others for the rest of her days sir walter would no longer have to worry about the implications of his fathers will in time giles would inherit the family title and all his fathers worldly goods even hugo barrington might survive now that it would no longer be necessary for him to prove he wasnt harrys father only his dear mother suddenly there was an almighty explosion the devonian split in two and seconds later both halves reared up like a startled horse before the broken ship unceremoniously sank to the bottom of the ocean the captain of the uboat watched through his periscope until the devonian had disappeared below the waves leaving in its wake a thousand brightly coloured cotton dresses and countless bodies bobbing up and down in the sea surrounded by potatoes can you tell me your name harry looked up at the nurse but couldnt move his lips can you hear me she asked another american accent harry managed a faint nod and she smiled he heard a door opening and although he couldnt see who had entered the sick bay the nurse left him immediately so it had to be someone in authority even if he couldnt see them he could hear what they were saying it made him feel like an eavesdropper good evening nurse craven said an older mans voice good evening dr wallace she replied how are our two patients ones showing definite signs of improvement the others still unconscious so at least two of us survived thought harry he wanted to cheer but although his lips moved no words came out and we still have no idea who they are no but captain parker came in earlier to see how they were and when i showed him what was left of their uniforms he wasnt in much doubt they were both officers harrys heart leapt at the thought that captain havens might have survived he heard the doctor walk over to the other bed but he couldnt turn his head to see who was lying there a few moments later he heard poor devil ill be surprised if he survives the night then you obviously dont know captain havens harry wanted to tell him because you wont kill him off that easily the doctor returned to harrys bedside and began to examine him harry could just make out a middleaged man with a serious thoughtful face once dr wallace had finished his examination he turned away and whispered to the nurse i feel a lot more hopeful about this one although the odds are still no better than fiftyfifty after what hes been through keep fighting young man he said turning to face harry though he couldnt be sure if the patient could hear him were going to do everything in our power to keep you alive harry wanted to thank him but all he could manage was another slight nod before the doctor walked away if either of them should die during the night he heard the doctor whisper to the nurse are you familiar with the correct procedure yes doctor the captain is to be informed immediately and the body is to be taken down to the morgue harry wanted to ask how many of his shipmates were already there and id also like to be kept informed added wallace even if ive turned in for the night of course doctor can i ask what the captain has decided to do with those poor devils who were already dead when we pulled them out of the water hes given an order that as they were all sailors they are to be buried at sea at first light tomorrow morning why so early he doesnt want the passengers to realize just how many lives were lost last night the doctor added as he walked away harry heard a door open goodnight nurse goodnight doctor the nurse replied and the door closed nurse craven walked back and sat down by harrys bedside i dont give a damn about the odds she said youre going to live harry looked up at a nurse who was hidden behind her starched white uniform and white cap but even so he couldnt miss the burning conviction in her eyes when harry next woke the room was in darkness apart from a glimmer of light in the far corner probably from another room his first thought was of captain havens fighting for his life in the next bed he prayed that he would survive and theyd be able to return to england together when the captain would retire and harry could sign up with any royal navy vessel sir walter could get him on his thoughts turned to emma once again and how his death would have solved so many problems for the barrington family that would now return to haunt them harry heard the door open again and someone with an unfamiliar step walked into the sick bay although he couldnt see who it was the sound of their shoes suggested two things it was a man and he knew where he was going another door opened on the far side of the room and the light became brighter hi kristin said a mans voice hello richard came back the nurses reply youre late she said teasing not angry sorry honey all the officers had to remain on the bridge until the search for survivors was finally abandoned the door closed and the light softened once more harry had no way of knowing how much time had passed before the door opened again half an hour an hour perhaps and he heard their voices your ties not straight said the nurse that wont do the man replied someone might figure out what weve been up to she laughed as he began walking towards the door suddenly he stopped who are these two mr a and mr b the only survivors from last nights rescue operation im mr c harry wanted to tell her as they walked towards his bed harry closed his eyes he didnt want them to think hed been listening to their conversation she took his pulse i think mr b is getting stronger by the hour you know i cant bear the thought of not saving at least one of them she left harry and walked over to the other bed harry opened his eyes and turned his head slightly to see a tall young man in a smart white dress uniform with gold epaulettes without warning nurse craven began to sob the young man placed an arm gently around her shoulder and tried to comfort her no no harry wanted to shout captain havens cant die were going back to england together whats the procedure in these circumstances asked the young officer sounding rather formal i have to inform the captain immediately and then wake dr wallace once all the papers have been signed and clearance has been authorized the body will be taken down to the morgue and prepared for tomorrows burial service no no no harry shouted but neither of them heard him i pray to whatever god continued the nurse that america doesnt become involved in this war thats never going to happen honey said the young officer roosevelts far too canny to get himself involved in another european war thats what the politicians said last time kristin reminded him hey whats brought this on he sounded concerned mr a was about the same age as you she said perhaps he also had a fiancee back home harry realized that it wasnt captain havens in the next bed but tom bradshaw that was when he made the decision when harry woke again he could hear voices coming from the next room moments later dr wallace and nurse craven walked into the sick bay it must have been heartwrenching said the nurse it wasnt at all pleasant admitted the doctor somehow it was made worse because they all went to their graves nameless although i had to agree with the captain thats the way a sailor would have wanted to be buried any news from the other ship asked the nurse yes theyve done a little better than us eleven dead but three survivors a chinaman and two englishmen harry wondered if it was possible that one of the englishmen might be captain havens the doctor bent down and unbuttoned harrys pyjama top he placed a cold stethoscope on several parts of his chest and listened carefully then the nurse placed a thermometer in harrys mouth his temperature is well down doctor said the nurse after she had checked the vein of mercury excellent you might try giving him some thin soup yes of course will you need my help with any of the passengers no thank you nurse your most important job is to make sure this one survives ill see you in a couple of hours once the door had closed the nurse returned to harrys bedside she sat down and smiled can you see me she asked harry nodded can you tell me your name tom bradshaw he replied tom said dr wallace once hed completed his examination of harry i wonder if you can tell me the name of your fellow officer who died last night id like to write to his mother or his wife if he had one his name was harry clifton said harry his voice barely audible he wasnt married but i know his mother quite well id planned to write to her myself thats good of you said wallace but id still like to send her a letter do you have her address yes i do said harry but it might be kinder if she heard from me first and not from a complete stranger he suggested if you think so said wallace not sounding at all sure yes i do said harry a little more firmly this time you can always post my letter when the kansas star returns to bristol thats assuming the captain is still planning to sail back to england now were at war with germany we are not at war with germany said wallace no of course were not said harry quickly correcting himself and lets hope it never comes to that agreed said wallace but that wont stop the kansas star making the return journey there are still hundreds of americans stranded in england with no other way of getting home isnt that a bit of a risk asked harry especially considering what weve just been through no i dont think so said wallace the last thing the germans will want to do is sink an american passenger ship which would be sure to drag us into the conflict i suggest you get some sleep tom because im hoping that tomorrow the nurse will be able to take you for a turn around the deck only one lap to begin with he emphasized harry closed his eyes but made no attempt to sleep as he began to think about the decision hed made and how many lives it would affect by taking tom bradshaws identity he had allowed himself a little breathing space to consider his future once they learnt that harry clifton had been killed at sea sir walter and the rest of the barrington family would be released from any obligations they might have felt bound by and emma would be free to begin a new life a decision he felt old jack would have approved of although the full implications hadnt yet sunk in however the resurrection of tom bradshaw would undoubtedly create its own problems and he would have to remain constantly on his guard it didnt help that he knew almost nothing about bradshaw so that whenever nurse craven asked him about his past he either had to make something up or change the subject bradshaw had proved very adept at deflecting any questions he didnt wish to answer and had clearly been a loner he hadnt set foot in his own country for at least three years possibly more so his family would have no way of knowing of his imminent return as soon as the kansas star arrived in new york harry planned to sail back to england on the first available ship his greatest dilemma was how to prevent his mother from being put through any unnecessary suffering by thinking shed lost her only son dr wallace had gone some way to solving that particular problem when he promised to post a letter to maisie the moment he arrived back in england but harry still had to write that letter he had spent hours going over the text in his mind so that by the time hed recovered enough to commit his thoughts to paper he almost knew the script by heart new york september th my dearest mother i have done everything in my power to make sure you receive this letter before anyone can tell you i was killed at sea as the date on this letter shows i did not die when the devonian was sunk on september th in fact i was plucked out of the sea by an american ship and am very much alive however an opportunity arose for me to assume another mans identity and i did so in the hope it would release both you and the barrington family from the many problems i seem to have unwittingly caused over the years it is important that you realize my love for emma has in no way diminished far from it but i do not feel i have the right to expect her to spend the rest of her life clinging on to the vain hope that at some time in the future i might be able to prove that arthur clifton and not hugo barrington was my father this way she can at least consider a future with someone else i envy that man i plan to return to england in the near future should you receive any communication from a tom bradshaw it will be from me i will be in touch with you the moment i set foot in england but in the meantime i must beg you to keep my secret as steadfastly as you kept your own for so many years your loving son harry he read the letter several times before placing it in an envelope marked strictly private and confidential he addressed it to mrs arthur clifton still house lane bristol the following morning he handed the letter over to dr wallace do you think youre ready to try a short walk around the deck asked kristin sure am harry replied trying out one of the expressions hed heard her boyfriend use although he still found it unnatural to add the word honey during those long hours hed spent in bed harry had listened carefully to dr wallace and whenever he was alone he tried to imitate his accent which hed heard kristin describe to richard as east coast harry was thankful for the hours hed spent with dr paget learning voice skills that hed assumed would only be of use on stage he was on stage however he still had the problem of how to deal with kristins innocent curiosity about his family background and upbringing he was assisted by a novel by horatio alger and another by thornton wilder the only two books that had been left behind in the sick bay from these he was able to conjure up a fictional family who hailed from bridgeport connecticut they consisted of a father who was a smalltown bank manager with connecticut trust and savings a mother who was a dutiful homemaker and had once come second in the towns annual beauty pageant and an older sister sally who was happily married to jake who ran the local hardware store he smiled to himself when he recalled dr pagets remark that with his imagination he was more likely to end up a writer than an actor harry placed his feet tentatively on the floor and with kristins help pulled himself slowly up once hed put on a dressing gown he took her by the arm and made his way unsteadily towards the door up a flight of steps and out on to the deck how long is it since youve been home asked kristin as they began their slow progress around the deck harry always tried to stick to the little he actually knew about bradshaw adding a few snippets from the life of his fictitious family just over three years he said my family never complain because they knew i wanted to go to sea from an early age but how did you come to be serving on a british ship damn good question thought harry he only wished he knew the answer he stumbled to give himself a little more time to come up with a convincing reply kristin bent down to assist him im fine he said once hed taken kristins arm again then he began to sneeze repeatedly perhaps its time to take you back to the ward suggested kristin we cant afford to have you catching a cold we can always try again tomorrow whatever you say said harry relieved she didnt ask any more questions after shed tucked him up like a mother putting a young child to bed he quickly fell into a deep sleep harry managed eleven laps of the deck the day before the kansas star sailed into new york harbour although he couldnt admit it to anyone he was quite excited about the prospect of seeing america for the first time will you be going straight back to bridgeport once weve docked asked kristin during his final lap or are you planning to stay in new york havent given it a lot of thought said harry who had in fact given it a great deal of thought i suppose it will depend on what time we dock he added as he tried to anticipate her next question its just that if youd like to spend the night at richards apartment on the eastside that would be swell oh i wouldnt want to put him to any trouble kristin laughed you know tom there are times when you sound more like an englishman than an american i guess after all those years serving on british ships youre bound to eventually get corrupted by the limeys is that also the reason you felt unable to share your problem with us harry came to a sudden halt a stumble or a sneeze wasnt going to rescue him this time if youd been just a little more frank in the first place wed have been happy to sort out the problem but given the circumstances we had no choice but to inform captain parker and leave him to decide what should be done harry collapsed into the nearest deckchair but as kristin made no attempt to come to his rescue he knew he was beaten its far more complicated than you realize he began but i can explain why i didnt want to involve anyone else no need to said kristin the captains already come to our rescue but he did want to ask how you intended to deal with the bigger problem harry bowed his head im willing to answer any questions the captain might have he said feeling almost a sense of relief that hed been found out like the rest of us he wanted to know how youre going to get off the ship when you dont have any clothes or a dime to your name harry smiled i figured new yorkers might consider a kansas star dressing gown to be pretty nifty frankly not too many new yorkers would notice even if you did walk down fifth avenue in a robe said kristin and the ones that did would probably think it was the latest fashion but just in case they dont richards come up with a couple of white shirts and a sports jacket pity hes so much taller than you otherwise hed have been able to supply a pair of pants as well dr wallace can spare a pair of brown wingtips a pair of socks and a tie that still leaves us with the problem of the pants but the captain has a pair of bermuda shorts that no longer fit him harry burst out laughing we hope you wont be offended tom but we also held a little collection among the crew she added passing him a thick envelope i think youll find theres more than enough to get you to connecticut how do i begin to thank you said harry no need to tom were all so pleased you survived i only wish we could have saved your friend harry clifton as well still youll be glad to hear that captain parker has instructed dr wallace to deliver your letter to his mother personally harry was among the first on deck that morning some two hours before the kansas star was due to sail into new york harbour it was another forty minutes before the sun joined him by which time hed worked out exactly how he was going to spend his first day in america he had already said farewell to dr wallace after trying inadequately to thank him for all hed done wallace assured him that he would post his letter to mrs clifton just as soon as he arrived in bristol and had reluctantly accepted that it might not be wise to visit her after harry had hinted that she was of a nervous disposition harry was touched when captain parker called into the sick bay to deliver a pair of bermuda shorts and wish him luck after he had returned to the bridge kristin said firmly its time for you to go to bed tom youll need all your strength if youre going to travel to connecticut tomorrow tom bradshaw would have liked to spend a day or two with richard and kristin in manhattan but harry clifton couldnt afford to waste any time now that britain had declared war on germany when you wake up in the morning continued kristin try to get up on to the passenger deck before first light then you can watch the sun rising as we sail into new york i know youll have seen it many times before tom but it never fails to excite me me too said harry and once weve docked continued kristin why dont you wait for richard and me to come off duty and then we can disembark together dressed in richards sports jacket and shirt a little too large the captains bermuda shorts a little too long and the doctors shoes and socks a little too tight harry couldnt wait to go ashore the ships purser had telegraphed ahead to advise the new york immigration department that they had an extra passenger on board an american citizen called tom bradshaw the nyid had telegraphed back to say that mr bradshaw should make himself known to one of the immigration officials and they would take it from there once richard had dropped him off at grand central harry planned to hang around in the station for a little while before heading back to the docks where he intended to report straight to the union office and find out which ships were due to sail for england it didnt matter which port they were heading for as long as it wasnt bristol once he had identified a suitable vessel he would sign up for any job on offer he didnt care if he worked on the bridge or in the boiler room scrubbed the decks or peeled potatoes just as long as he got back to england if there turned out to be no jobs available he would book the cheapest passage home hed already checked the contents of the bulky white envelope kristin had given him and there was more than enough to pay for a berth that couldnt be smaller than the broom cupboard hed slept in on the devonian it saddened harry that when he returned to england he wouldnt be able to contact any of his old friends and hed have to be cautious even when he got in touch with his mother but the moment he stepped ashore his only purpose would be to join one of his majestys war ships and enlist in the fight against the kings enemies even though he knew that whenever that ship returned to port he would have to remain on board like a criminal on the run harrys thoughts were interrupted by a lady he gazed in admiration when he first saw the statue of liberty looming up in front of him through the earlymorning mist he had seen photographs of the iconic landmark but they had not given a true sense of her size as she towered above the kansas star welcoming visitors immigrants and her fellow countrymen to the united states as the ship continued on its way towards the harbour harry leant over the railings and looked towards manhattan disappointed that the skyscrapers didnt appear to be any taller than some of the buildings he remembered in bristol but then as each minute passed they grew and grew until they appeared to soar up into the heavens and he had to shade his eyes from the sun as he stared up at them a new york port authority tug boat came out to join them and guided the kansas star safely to its berth on number seven dock when harry saw the cheering crowds he began to feel apprehensive for the first time even though the young man who was sailing into new york that morning was far older than the fourth officer whod left bristol only three weeks earlier smile tom harry turned to see richard looking down into a kodak brownie box camera he was peering at an upsidedown image of tom with the manhattan skyline as a backdrop youll be one passenger i sure wont forget in a hurry said kristin as she walked across to join him so that richard could take a second photograph of them together she had exchanged her nurses uniform for a smart polkadot dress white belt and white shoes nor me you said harry hoping that neither of them could sense how nervous he was time for us to go ashore said richard closing the shutter of his camera the three of them took the wide staircase down to the lower deck where several passengers were already streaming off the ship to be reunited with relieved relatives and anxious friends as they made their way down the gangway harrys spirits were lifted by how many of the ships passengers and crew wanted to shake him by the hand and wish him luck once theyd stepped on to the dockside harry richard and kristin headed towards immigration where they joined one of four long queues harrys eyes darted about in every direction and he wanted to ask so many questions but any one of them would have revealed that this was the first time hed set foot in america the first thing that struck him was the patchwork quilt of different colours that made up the american people hed only ever seen one black man in bristol and remembered stopping to stare at him old jack had told him it was both rude and inconsiderate adding how would you feel if everyone stopped to stare at you just because you were white but it was the noise the bustle and the sheer pace of everything around him that most caught harrys imagination and made bristol seem as if it were languishing in a bygone age he was already beginning to wish that hed accepted richards offer to stay with him overnight and perhaps spend a few days in a city he was finding so exciting even before hed left the dockside why dont i go through first said richard as they reached the head of the queue then i can pick up my car and meet you both outside the terminal good idea said kristin next shouted an immigration officer richard walked up to the desk and handed over his passport to the official who glanced briefly at the photo before stamping it welcome home lieutenant tibbet next harry stepped forward uncomfortably aware that he had no passport no identification and someone elses name my names tom bradshaw he said with a confidence he didnt feel i think the purser of the ss kansas star telegraphed ahead to warn that i would be coming ashore the immigration officer looked closely at harry then picked up a sheet of paper and began to study a long list of names finally he put a tick by one before turning round and nodding for the first time harry noticed two men standing on the other side of the barrier wearing identical grey suits and grey hats one of them gave him a smile the immigration officer stamped a piece of paper and handed it to harry welcome back mr bradshaw its been a long time sure has said harry next ill wait for you said harry as kristin made her way to the desk ill only be a moment she promised harry passed through the barrier and entered the united states of america for the first time the two men in grey suits stepped forward one of them said good morning sir are you mr thomas bradshaw thats me said harry the words were hardly out of his mouth before the other man grabbed him and pinned his arms behind his back while the first man handcuffed him it all happened so quickly that harry didnt even have time to protest he remained outwardly calm as he had already considered the possibility that someone might work out that he wasnt tom bradshaw but in fact an englishman called harry clifton even so he had assumed that the worst they could do was serve him with a deportation order and have him shipped back to britain and as that was exactly what hed planned to do anyway he didnt put up a fight harry spotted two cars waiting by the sidewalk the first was a black police car with its back door being held open by another unsmiling man in a grey suit the second was a red sports car with richard sitting on the bonnet smiling the moment richard saw that tom had been handcuffed and was being led away he leapt up and began to run towards him at the same time one of the police officers began to read mr bradshaw his rights while the other continued to grip harry firmly by the elbow you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law you have the right to an attorney a moment later richard was striding by their sides he glared at the officers and said what the hell do you think youre doing if you cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed to you continued the first policeman while the other ignored him richard was clearly amazed by how relaxed tom appeared almost as if he wasnt surprised to have been arrested but he was still determined to do anything he could to assist his friend he leapt forward and blocked the officers path and said firmly what are you charging mr bradshaw with officer the senior detective came to a halt looked richard in the eye and said first degree murder acknowledgments my thanks go to the following people for their invaluable advice and research john anstee simon bainbridge john cleverdon
