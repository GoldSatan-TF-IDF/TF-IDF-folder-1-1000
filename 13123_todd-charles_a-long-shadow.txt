charles todd a long shadow dudlington and one particular summer evening constable hensley walked quietly through friths wood looking left and right for some sign that others had been here before him but the wet matted leaves showed him nothing and the cold sun slanting through bare trees was more primitive than comforting it would be dark soon enough the light never lasted this time of year unlike the gloriously bright evenings of summer when it seemed to linger as if unaware of dusk creeping toward it he came to the end of the wood and turned to retrace his steps to the small clearing where hed left his bicycle halfway there he could have sworn he heard someone moving behind him a soft step barely audible but his ears were attuned to the lightest sound wheeling about he scanned the trees around him but there was no one to be seen through the tangle of undergrowth and trunks no one living imagination he told himself nerves a small voice in his head countered and he shivered in spite of himself after a moment he went hurrying on not looking back again until hed retrieved his bicycle and mounted it then he scanned friths wood a final time wondering how a place so small could appear to be so gloomy and somehow threatening even in winter the saxons so it was said had beheaded men here once long ago taking no prisoners unwilling to be hindered by captives theyd come only for booty and nothing else not slaves not land or farms just gold or silver or whatever else could be bartered at home a greedy people he thought giving his bicycle a little push to start it forward greedy and bloody by all accounts but nearly fifteen hundred years later the name of the wood hadnt changed and no one cared to set foot there after dark he was glad to be out of it yet he could still feel someone watching him someone on the edge of the wood someone without substance or reality dead men most likely or their ghosts one ghost he didnt look again until hed reached the main road out of the fields away from the wood he felt safer now he could pedal back the way hed come make the turning at the oaks and sweep down into dudlington anyone seeing him would think hed been at the pub or sent for from letherington hed been clever covering his tracks it made sense to plan ahead and not go rushing about if he had to go there of course a really clever man he told himself would stay away altogether the way behind him was still empty london new years eve frances was saying as their cab dropped them in marlborough square maryanne will be so happy to see you it will do her good yes well dont expect me to play bridge rutledge answered her half in jest half in earnest he had worked for the past hour to convince her that he was in good spirits she had always been too quick to read shadows on his face you havent forgot the last time have you at the moores i was partnered by that awful woman what was her name stillwell she dissected every hand ad nau seum put me off bridge for the better part of a year in the square behind them he heard the gate creak as someone came out of the garden and walked briskly away the policeman in him noted the fact as the footfalls stopped another gate down the street opened and shut and there was silence once more you dont bring in the new year playing bridge silly besides you ought to know maryanne doesnt care for card games his sister informed him walking up the steps to the door of number she glanced up at him thinking how handsome he was in his evening dress his dark hair and dark eyes a sharp contrast with the gleaming white shirtfront too bad she couldnt persuade him to wear it more often hed become reclusive since the war was jeans shadow still hanging over him she didnt want to believe it was france or shell shock lingering he refused to talk about himself however hard she probed and dr fleming was as tightlipped as her brother maryanne said something about an entertainmentprobably a new soprano mischief danced in her eyes as she waited for his reaction good god that was at the porters just before the war she was austrian and made the chandeliers quake now thats an outright lie ian she was italian francess laughter was silvery in the cold air her breath a frosty puff she insisted you take her in to supper and then spent the rest of the evening trying to persuade you to visit her in venice she lifted the knocker and then added jean was in a terrible huff she was left with that colonel the one with the door opened and maryanne browning enveloped frances in a warm embrace hallo my dear im so glad you could come and ianyouve been a stranger far too long give your coats to iris here and join us in the drawing room she swept them with her made introductions settled them with drinks and sat down herself to resume a conversation about canada which their arrival had interrupted rutledge knew most of the people there simon maryannes brother vicar at a country church in sussex dr philip gavin a harley street surgeon and his wife who had been friends with maryanne for years a younger couple the man missing an arm from the war were the talbots george and sally rutledge had met them at one of his sisters parties across from him sat a naval officer commander farnum and his wife becky who lived just down the road from frances the last guest was a dark haired woman of infinite poise whose eyes were turned on him as if she could read his thoughts the intensity of her gaze made him uncomfortable her name was mrs chan ning and she was new to him maryannes husband peter browning had died in the influenza epidemic of a civil servant in the war ministry he had appeared well at seven in the morning as he kissed his wife goodbye at three oclock he dropped dead at his desk overwhelmed by swift massive infection a silver frame on the mantel held his photograph a thinfaced man with kind eyes rutledge had liked him immensely the evening passed with pleasant conversation and rutledge found himself relaxing the voice in his head silent for now the company interesting enough to draw his attention away from his own thoughts they had been bleak enough lines from the letters lying on his desk still echoing in his mind he was glad to escape them if only for an hour or so mrs channing sitting across the room from him made no effort to charm her fellow guests and yet she seemed to become the heart of the party her voice never dominating but often bringing laughter with a welltimed comment he found himself wondering what her age wascloser to his than francess he decided or perhaps younger than both of them it was hard to tell because she seldom spoke of herself or of her late husband as if too private a person to thrust her experiences on strangers there were no benchmarks an attractive woman most certainly with what frances would call good cheekbones her dark hair touched with gold under the soft spill of light from the sconce behind her her extraordinary poise intriguing her laugh pleasing rutledges deep dread of watching his soul stripped naked in publicthe abiding fear of someone discovering the guilt he carried with him the horrors of shell shock the voice of a dead man he heard as clearly as his own faded the policeman in him was lulled as well and any misgivings hed felt when introduced to her had vanished all the same he was glad to be seated down the table from mrs channing his hostess on his right and mrs tal bot on his left dinner was nearly up to prewar standards it began with a consomme a la celestine followed by a roast loin of mutton with a port wine sauce baked onions potatoes a la duchesse and spinach with anchovy eclairs or an apricot gateau to end maryanne explained that her cook was a french refugee and a miracle worker a widow who had charmed the butcher and the greengrocer into slavish devotion it was not until they were settled comfortably again in the drawing room the tea tray removed and the hands of the great clock in the hall touching that maryanne surprised everyone with the news that meredith channing could raise spirits and ive asked her to conduct a seance to bring in the new yearand the new decade she ended excitement bringing a flush to her face shes to discover if all of us will be wealthy and happy in ten years time the women laughed maryannes enthusiasm contagious but farnum and talbot exchanged glances and stirred uneasily while simon started to say something to his sister and then held his tongue and in the back of his mind his dread lurching into life again rutledge heard hamish exclaim no the single word seemed to fill rutledges head and ricochet around the room but no one turned to stare at him no one else could hear it he stepped back shaken as if shed sensed the apprehension among her male guests maryanne went on its all in fun of course we did this on boxing day at the montgomerys john raised napoleon of all people the most outrageous things happened and we laughed ourselves silly the other men made polite if halfhearted noises and moved reluctantly toward the table leaving rutledge stranded in the middle of the room mrs channing came to her hostesss aid her eyes on rutledges face i fear we have one too many maryanne i did say numbers mattered perhaps mr rutledge would be content to watch rather than take part maryanne glanced at him in disappointment oh ian that would be no fun for you at all ill sit out instead i dont want to give away any of the tricks and i might at the table no mrs channing is right he said his heart thudding in his chest at the thought of confronting his own ghosts in public it was all he could do to keep a rising panic out of his face im a policeman after all hardly susceptible to raising the dead although dr gavin and i might find the talent useful he had managed to make light of it and they laughed although he felt anything but amusement there were too many dead on his soulit would do no good to raise them if he couldnt offer them life again and if by accident mrs channing summoned hamish it was unthinkable panic was closer the spacious room shrinking uncomfortably until all he could see was mrs channings face as if in a halo of brightness her expression compassionate beside him frances placed a steadying hand on his arm she was saying ians had a very trying day hes likely to raise the most boring spirits you can imagine but ive always admired sir francis drake and i wouldnt mind asking him if he actually did bowl while waiting for the armada it was the first name that had come to her she moved to the table and smiled up at dr gavin unless youd prefer someone in the field of science no no drake will please me too he answered holding her chair with a last apologetic glance at rutledge maryanne gathered her other guests then she added over her shoulder if you change your mind ian ill tell you he answered relief bottled up in fear of what was still to come it was a farce this seance craze but it was sweeping england just now and more than a few men of good repute had been gullible enough to comment publicly on the possibilities of reaching behind the veil of death they dimmed the lamps with shawls made up their table and mrs channing took her place at the head of it asking everyone to clear their minds and join hands in silence the ticking of the hall clock could be heard clearly and to one side of the group rutledge found himself gripping the arm of his chair he uncurled his fingers and in defense tried to crowd his mind rather than empty it after a moment her voice filled the room low melodious almost mesmerizing in spite of his fierce resistance he could feel the peace that seemed to wrap him and the security that it seemed to offer but there was an undercurrent of tension in the voice as well as if he thought she was aware of him sitting to one side observing outside the ring disapproving the skeleton at the feast he shivered at the thought we are gathered here at the turn of the year to call upon those wandering in the night those with knowledge those willing to come to our table and reach across the darkness that divides the living from the dead and take my hand in friendship he tried to think of an excuse to leave altogether one that wouldnt embarrass frances or cause comment instead he was pinned to the chair his mind frozen unable to function and he could hear hamish calling this the devils business urging him over and over again to go now but there was no escape mrs farnum exclaimed anxiously i felt the table lift and so you should as the spirits surround us taking their places beside us looking over our shoulders theres a little dog among them a king charles spaniel sally talbot drew in a breath it couldnt be jelly could it oh please tell me its mine her husband said quickly now sally oh but it would be lovely to know hes well and happy on the other sideyou dont know how ive missed him mrs channings voice rose above hers and behind him is the king himself we welcome you your majesty and we ask you to tell us the name of the little dog that has so graciously announced your presence the door behind them opened and iris whispered into the dimness inspector the yard is on the telephone he got to his feet with such haste he nearly knocked over the small table beside him gritting his teeth he made his way as quietly as he could out of the room it was sergeant gibson on the line wishing to confirm a detail in a case that had just been closed during the afternoon taking the upright chair in the stuffy little closet where the phone had been installed rutledge gave the sergeant the date he was after and put up the receiver for a moment he sat there so relieved to be out of range of that compelling voice in the drawing room that he could feel himself taking the first deep breath it was as if hed been granted a reprieveand he intended to make the most of it stepping out into the hall he turned to the housemaid and asked will you summon a cab for miss rutledge when shes ready to leave and tell her that ive been sent for by the yard indeed sir i will iris helped him into his coat and he left relishing the winter air cold and cleansing feeling as if hed been miraculously spared an unspeakable ordeal overhead the stars seemed extraordinarily bright above the streetlamps and the noisy evening traffic on the road beyond the square had dwindled into an occasional motorcar passing bless gibson he thought and hamish echoed the sentiment a dark growl that seemed to rumble in the space behind him on the steps he turned to look up at the drawing room windows frances would give him hell for deserting her but the farnums would be glad to see her safely home there would be no need of the cab he tried to tell himself that mrs channing possessed no strange or exotic powers but he could still feel her eyes on him and recall the way she had made certain he was not in the circle he went cold at the thought that she had somehow known his secrets that she had seen into his mind and found the shadow of hamish and refused to make that knowledge public but that was ridiculous walking home would clear his head of such nonsense flipping up his coat collar against the night air he went down the pair of stone steps to the pavement his shoe struck something that rolled making a tinkling noise across the walk and into the gutter his first reaction was surprise it was a sound he knew moving to the curb he bent down to search intently light spilling from the windows behind him picked out a metal cylinder a little distance away he retrieved it and recognized it even as his fingers reached for it a cartridge casing from a maxim machine gun its shape cool and familiar in his hand there had been thousands of them on the battlefield as common as the mud underfoot but what was it doing here on a quiet street in london he stood up quickly his gaze sweeping the fenced garden in the square then scanning the street in both directions there was no one in sight hamish said its no here by chance a sense of unease made rutledge turn to look up at the housefront he could see the drawing room the curtains drawn only a faint glow behind them from lamps shaded by shawls the quiet spellbinding voice of the woman conducting the seance seemed to echo in his head the cartridge casing hadnt been there when he arrived at the brownings it would have been dislodged then as he or frances mounted the steps and no one else had arrived after they were admitted to the house turning the casing in his gloved fingers he could tell that it wasnt smooth the lines were irregular as if something had been cut into the metal surface loops and swirls not initials soldiers by the hundreds had done this sort of thing in the long watches of the night or the deadly boredom of waiting for the next attack in hospitals and convalescent homes passing the time as they healed men had been encouraged to make such things as boutonnieres vases cigarette lighters and even canes out of empty cases of every size even copper driving bands from artillery shells and lumps of shrapnel had been turned into souvenirs an exercise in patience in the light from the nearest streetlamp rutledge tried to judge what the design was it was useless he couldnt see anything but the glinting surface where the metal had been polished not that the design mattered he was more interested in how such a thing came to be here in front of the house where hed been a guest hamish was saying it doesna signify it fell from the pocket of someone passing by i heard it fall so would whoever was carrying it why not look for it it wasna of great value who could have known that id leave early it could as well have been dr gavin he told himself called to a deathbed or mrs channing seance over leaving maryannes guests to talk behind her back about the evenings entertainment neither of them had been in the trenches i wouldna make sae much of it its out of place aye that doesna make it sinister yet in a way it did it was as if in an unexpected fashion the war had reached out to touch him again yon woman has unsettled you perhaps that was all it was but the casing in his fingers was real he hadnt imagined it where had it come from hamish was silent offering no answers after a moment rutledge slipped the casing into his pocket then he turned away from the browning house and began the long walk home rather than settling his mind the walk had given rutledge too much time to dwell on other matters the letters on his desk one of them from his godfather david trevor and that reminder of scotland of what had happened there months before had stirred hamish into grumbling activity david had written in haste young ian has measles and ive left him to morag and fiona im banished to my club in edinburgh and thoroughly miserable at missing his first christmas with us much as weve looked forward to your visit the doctor advises no excitement ive promised the lad a pony if he stays in his darkened room without fuss thats all im allowed to do you might search out a saddle and have it shipped north for boxing day if you like it had been a visit intended to mend fences rutledge had last seen his godfather in september just before fiona and the child had come to stay with trevor hed found it hard to face the young woman hamish might have married the woman whose name hed spoken as he died harder still to greet her as a friend when rutledge knew himself to be responsible for hamish macleods death it was a shadow that lay heavily between them even though hed never confessed the truth to her yet hed told himself as he had left behind the snowy fells of westmorland barely three weeks ago that perhaps the time had come to return to scotland to face the tangle hed made of his life and find a little peace it had seemed possible then a fairhaired woman in a wheelchair had made anything seem possible even confessing his nightmares to those who cared about him clearing his conscience so that he could feel something again besides despair but his good intentions had been swept away by another letter that had arrived hard on the heels of the first it had stripped away hope now he was glad not to travel north glad to be spared what would have been a futile errand hed convinced himself that love would make a difference hed have ended up making a great fool of himself instead but such protests rang hollow in his ears and all the while hamish called him a coward even after rutledge had retired the soft scots voice kept him awake taunting and accusing by turns raking up memories driving him like a spur he lay there counting the hours as the clock struck each in turn his thoughts shifting from one unsettling image to the next a narrow track of road twisting through the heavy drifts a childs face a woman standing in the cold snow light of an open door her hands on either side of the frame and the room behind her dark as the grave the sound of a weapon being fired so loud in the confines of the kitchen that it seemed to ring in his head even now shifting again he tried to find a more comfortable positiona drowsiness that might lead to sleep instead he remembered mrs channings expression as she greeted him only hours earlierthat fleeting pity a sense of understanding in her face as if shed read his thoughts or had known him somewhere before france he stared at the barely visible walls of his bedroom why had she reminded him so strongly of the war and the trenches or was it only that bloody shell casing hed never taken out of his coat pocket by the time hed drifted into uneasy sleep he began to dream of the war as he so often did jerking awake as the whistle blew to send his men over the tophe could smell the trenches he could smell the cordite the sour sweat of fear that bathed his men even in the cold air he could feel the rough wood of the ladder the terror of anticipation waiting for the soft thunk as a bullet hit its target and someone at his elbow went down he could hear the yelling the deafening sound of steady machinegun fire as they walked out into the barren hell of no mans land moving quickly toward the unseen enemy and then he was truly awake the noise and smells and drenching anguish of counting his dead fading into the darkness of the familiar room his gaze fell on the second letter lying on his desk by the windows the paper faintly white in the ambient light he knew the words by heart now dont come back to westmorland the desolation hed felt when he first opened the single sheet swept him again how do you learn to live again he thought where there is no hope no warmth no laughter he lay there trying not to think or dream or remember until first light meredith channing was also awake until dawn her mind unwilling or unable to settle into peace so that was ian rutledge she thought that tall handsome haunted man not at all what shed expected maryanne browning had said discussing her guests each in turn he was in france for four years and doesnt often attend parties now such a shame he and peter were better at charades than any of us and it was always great fun but his sister has promised to persuade him was he severely wounded she had asked he was in hospital for several months im not sure why frances never said but nothing serious apparently hes returned to the yard of course the woman he was to marry broke off their engagement as soon as he came home and wed someone else that must have been a crushing blow we were all so heartbroken for him but i never liked jean myself i thought he could do much better and then the first of her guests had arrived and mrs browning had gone to greet them mrs channing saw no reason to tell her hostess that shed seen ian rutledge before once but only at a distance she hadnt needed to include him in that silly business at the table to know his secrets war she thought is such devastation for the livingfor the deadand for those who are not sure any longer where they fit in but that brought her little comfort there were some things that one couldnt explain away grace letteridge lay awake as well the woman who cleaned for her on tuesdays had told her she had seen constable hensley coming out of friths wood i was taking the christmas bells to the attic for the rector the window was all dusty and i took out my rag to clean away the worst of it and i could just see him hurrying away on that bicycle of his for all the world like a hunted man i cant for the life of me understand why he goes there youd think hed stay away like everyone else she shook her head considering the constables foolishness but then hes not one of us is he she added else hed know a guilty conscience grace thought now it makes people do foolish things betray themselves even she turned on her side not wanting to think about hensleyor emma emma was dead and yet she might as well be alive what was it the romans believed that a spirit wandered if the body wasnt given decent burial emmas wandered grace was certain of it and it gave her no peace someone knew the secret of what had happened to emma mason and grace was convinced it was hensley why else had he failed to find emmas murderer midjanuary rutledge stood on the cliffs above beachy head light below him the gray waters of the atlantic moved in angry swirls clawing at the land all around him the grass seemed to sway and dance whispering in the echoes of the wind like disturbed voices he had come here after a difficult twentyfour hours forcing a wouldbe murderer to give himself up and release the hostages he had taken in a small cottage outside the village of belton the man tired and unshaven unrepentant and silent offered no explanation for stabbing his wife he went with the constables without giving them any trouble and the local man inspector pearson had said only i was convinced in the end hed kill all his family its a miracle he didnt in for a penny in for a pound we can only hang him once he had nowhere to go rutledge pointed out and whatever anger was driving him it had finally burned away he could still see the eyes of the mans motherin law staring at him in undisguised relief something in her face that was old as if twentyfour hours had aged her her daughter trembling with exhaustion and pain allowed the doctor to wrap her in a blanket and take her away in his carriage to his surgery blood had soaked through her dress and her hands were clenched on the blankets folds as if to hide the sight her mother had followed in a second carriage with an elderly aunt a thin pale woman who appeared to be in shock even the exsoldier standing near the horses mirrored her numbness his face turned away as soon as the affair had been dealt with and he was free to go back to london rutledge had driven instead toward the sea leaving his motorcar and then walking down to the cliffs beyond lay france it was said during the war that the big guns could be heard here along englands coast but they were mercifully silent now had been for a year and two months looking back over that year he could recognize his own long struggle to survive the strain the tension the constant badgering of hamish in the back of his mind had taken their toll jeans defection the still unsettled business with his godfather in scotland and now the letter from westmorland had he really fallen in love there in the north or had he been beguiled by those easy domestic moments in the kitchen when life had seemed so simple and comfortable a lonely man could have mistaken such brief respites for feelings that werent thereon either side he couldnt be sure anymore even though hed gone over and over his own emotions elizabeth frasers letter had ended it is better for me to live as i am where i am than to imagine i could fit into any other world i have a history in london it would do no good to pretend i havent and i dont want to reawaken the memories there they would be too painful dont come back to westmorland ian i beg of you i am safer alone he was too tired to try to work it out as long as hamish was there in the shadows of his mind hed be mad to love anyone it was reckless even to consider the possibility he had nearly got elizabeth killed after all he shuddered what would he have done then mourned her as his lost love from guilt he could hear hamishs derisive laughter a small stone dislodged by his shoe ran down to the cliffs edge and tumbled over out into space he watched it spin out then disappear into the sea far below it would be easy to step over the face of the cliff after that stone and end the struggle end the uncertainty silence the voice crush out the ghostly faces of men he had led and failed it was tempting it was in some ways the answer he had postponed in the hope that somehow he would heal its no so simple hamish said leaping oer the edge willna change the past and it canna change what you are yell be dead and so will i yell ha killed me twice that too will be on your soul the voice was clearly scots on the wind coming from nowhere and it was steel after a moment without answering rutledge turned back the way hed come to where the motorcar was waiting he had already turned the crank heard the engine ticking over and was climbing in when something on the drivers seat caught his eye it was another shell case in fact a pair of them linked together in a short length of a machine guns ammunition beltcollected and thrust there because the casings were normally ejected from the weapon as it fired he picked up the pair and stared at them the same size and caliber of the one hed found in london and this time he was in no doubttheyd been left where he alone would find them there was a pattern around the metal perimeter of one casing and he turned it around to examine it in the pale light of the winter afternoon an odd pattern a delicate staircase of poppies that curled around the brass surface but where there should have been blooms there were tiny skulls with hollow eyes staring up at him deaths heads hamish said a warning the same thought had crossed his own mind but why on only one of them rutledge asked curious still examining the workmanship may be he thinks ye ken why well enough after a moment he added there was a private soldier in one of the companies doon the line i didna know him well ye ken but his sergeant found one of his carvings with a deaths head on it and the next time oer the top the sergeant died of a bullet in his back rutledge had never reexamined the single casing hed found outside maryanne brownings house hed been far more interested in why it was on her doorstep than in what was cut into its surface as far as he knew it was still in his dress coat pocket he looked around the headland tasting the salt on his lips as the wind turned and blew off the sea there was no one else out here no one at all yet the cartridge casings hadnt been in the seat when he left the motorcar to walk out to the cliffs edge that was a certainty if anyone had followed him here from the village where was he now lying flat somewhere in the scrubby grass or long since gone on his bicycle making a silent retreat turning slowly in a circle rutledge scanned the landscape once more as far as he could see the emptiness around him seemed filled with something malevolent he couldnt shake off the sense of being watched but there was not even a gull in the sky overheard there hadnt been anyone in the square in london either after a moment or two rutledge tossed the casings onto the passenger seat and put the car in gear all the way to london he reminded himself that while someone might have known he was going to the brownings party sergeant gibson had tracked him down after allno one could have guessed that he would drive out to this godforsaken headland late on a cold and windy january afternoon he himself hadnt expected to come here it had happened on the spur of the moment a whim dictated by a need for silence and peace someone would have to be a mind reader he was nearly certain that there was no reason for anyone to follow him from the village where the hostages had been taken it was far more likely that someone had tracked him from london but why reaching his flat rutledge couldnt stop himself from looking down at the front steps there was nothing there he walked inside went up to his rooms and turned on the lamp before going in search of the other cartridge case the one from new years eve it was still in the pocket of his dress coat and he examined it in the lamps bright glow poppies rows of them gracefully circling the casing the petals of each bloom very beautifully etched into the brass alloy but between the leaves and stems he could just barely see something hiding in the greenery was that an eye peering out or had the engravers hand slipped hard to say hed have thought nothing of it if he hadnt seen the latest example now the deliberately vague socket took on a more sinister air by the same hand hamish pointed out and indeed the skill of workmanship proved that the question was rutledge thought uneasily what would have happened if he hadnt left the browning house early that last night of the old year would the casing have been retrieved until another opportunity presented itself or left to be swept up along with the leaves and debris in the gutter a malicious impulse that hadnt been successful what had he set in motion by finding it worse still what did this harrying have to do with his years in the trenches he remembered mrs channing the only guest he hadnt met before that night could she have guessed that he wouldnt stay for the seance if he could find a polite reason for walking out on maryannes party then how had she managed to step outside and leave that casing where he would find it while he was drinking his port with the other men he hadnt served with anyone named channing he searched his memory for the faces hed seen in bel ton people quickly gathering out of morbid curiosity to learn how a mans murderous rampage ended she hadnt been there hed have recognized her who else then who of half a hundred people might it have been someone at the back of the crowd surely half hidden wanting to see without being seen or none of them hamish retorted as for beachy head it was open without much in the way of cover im too good a policeman to have missed him he told himself if he followed me id have seen him it had taken nerve to step out in the open reach the motorcar toss in the casings and vanish again i could have turned at any moment and caught him you had ither things on your mind i wasnt there that long longer than ye ken rutledge shook his head he was in the trenches hamish went on else where did he come by these rutledge flinched half expecting hamish to lean forward to touch the cartridge casings he scooped them up quickly and put them in the drawer of his desk turning the key why machinegun cartridges he asked aloud or poppies hamish answered him that last nightbefore the firing squad it was a machine gunner we were sent to take out and in the spring poppies bloom in flanders theyre red the color of blood a few days later rutledge was on his way to hertford to give evidence at the trial of a man hed apprehended some months before he had stopped briefly for an early lunch at a pub in a village that lay some distance behind now and he was trying to make up his time with luck hed be in the county town in another half an hour well before he was due to meet the kc the road had narrowed for a mile or more shrinking now into a stretch that was barely wide enough for one vehicle let alone two to one side a winterbare hedgerow ran up a slope and down again giving him a feeling of being shut in between it and the flickering shadows cast by a copse on his right it was claustrophobic reminding him of a magic lantern show gone madlight and dark light and dark the trees flitting by like irregular fence palings and without substance as he geared down for the bend ahead hamish said youll have us both in the ditch he never finished the warning a shot echoed sending half a dozen crows flying up out of the trees crying raucously in alarm just as the windscreen in front of rutledge shattered glass spraying like bright bits of water into his face and he could feel the wind of the bullet passing his ear before thudding somewhere in the rear seat behind him fighting to control the motorcar as it veered across the road and straight for the clumped roots and dried wild flowers at the foot of the hedgerow rutledge was swept by horror the shot had missed himbut it couldnt have missed hamish directly behind him the bonnet came perilously close to burying itself into the earth beneath the hedgerow before he had cut the motor and the vehicle rocked to a halt his face was wet with blood but he was barely aware of it what filled his mind was the silence in the seat behind him i dare not turn and look if hes badly hurtwhat am i to do i cant touch him as the initial shock receded he reminded himself that hamish was already dead buried in one of the muddy cemeteries in france the relief that swept him was followed by a cold intense anger he was out of the motorcar the door swinging wide behind him racing toward a break in the hedgerow some twenty feet away the shot had come from a revolver he was certain of it he knew the range and his ears had unconsciously registered the direction of the sound even though he hadnt seen the muzzle flash and the only thought in his mind now was putting hands on the man who had fired it ye canna leave the motor here hamish shouted behind him yon bend but rutledge was scrambling up the stones weeds and packed earth at the foot of the hedgerow ignoring the stubby twigs and branches that plucked at his clothes and scraped his hands he found the thinning patch where one of the knot of trees had died out pushed his way through it with a final effort and plunged into the rolling pasture beyond he wasnt sure what hed expected to see there but except for a grazing horse at the far end the pasture was empty his years in the trenches had taught him to pinpoint snipers in their lairs and the skill came back to him with accustomed ease he strode along the hedgerow searching for crushed blades of grass scuffed earthany signs that pointed to where someone stretched out on the ground or crouched by the thick tangle of tree limbs and dead wild flower stalks waiting to fire underfoot the grass was a dull yellow and damp quickly soaking into his leather shoes as he broke into a trot following the line of the hedge he knew the angle of fire less than fifty feet away from where hed climbed the hedgerow he found what he was looking fora muddied patch and above it a single twig snapped in two he squatted there on the ground looking back toward the lane and he could see there was a perfect field of fire from this spot toward where his motorcar had been passing as the windscreen shattered not an accident then but what he couldnt believe that boys had been trying out their fathers war souvenir the shot had barely missed his head the question was had it missed on purpose or because the shooter wasnt skilled enough to hit his target then as he straightened he saw shoved into a thicker part of the hedge not more than a foot away three shell casings in a length of belt his anger had drained out of him and he turned quickly to scan the pasture again suddenly aware of how vulnerable he was if the man with the revolver took another shot no one there nothing to prove anyone had been there it was as if it had all been a figment of his imagination the horse was grazing peacefully and the crows had settled again into the trees across the road and yet there was the shattered windscreen and here was evidence of someone lying in wait taking aimpulling the trigger not an accidental firing but a careful ambush and the shell casings left behind as a taunt i could have killed you but i didnt this time he spent nearly half an hour quartering the pasture for tracks searching for any sign of how the shooter had come here or left at length unsatisfied he went back to lift the casings out of the hedge and look at them more closely behind him hamish said three soldiers in the trenches were a superstitious lot it was said german snipers waited for a man to light a cigarette then pass the match to the men beside him and as the third cigarette flared the sniper had made his kill three like the other casings these weres from a maxim machine gun it had been the most widely used weapon in the war half of europe copying its design for their armies and the machine gun had been the most deadly weapon of the war sweeping the stark shellpocked wirestrung terrain called no mans land with a hail of bullets that could bring a man down and pass on in a matter of seconds to kill everyone beside him long before any of them reached the first line of enemy trenches it had rutledge thought caused more casualties than any other weapon the gunner and his crew could hold off a hundred men and there was no way to stop him rutledge stood there studying the cartridge casings like the others hed found before these were clearly meant for him to examine even in the gray afternoon light he could see the skull carefully set in the cup of a poppy blossom nestled where the stamens should have been the blossom was beautifully formed the petals open and lovingly shaped the deaths head staring up at him with blackened eye sockets cut deep enough into the metal to give them a ghoulish realism without thinking he touched his gloved finger to the dark sockets and then saw there was a smudge on the leather rutledge could have sworn that it was blood but whether his own from the cuts on his face or from something on the carving he couldnt have said he found a man in hertford who could replace the shattered windscreen but there was nothing to be done about his own face except to ask the doctor recommended by the garage owners wife to pluck the deeper bits of glass out of his skin id report this to inspector smith dr eustace told him we cant have silly fools running about the countryside with loaded firearms this sliver could have blinded you if itd struck your eye instead of your eyebrow he held up a splinter of glass bloody on the tip it was an accident rutledge answered him trying to infuse conviction into his voice his face was stinging like hell he wasnt about to discuss the shell casings with anyone let alone a provincial inspector who would begin to ask questions he couldnt answer himself but all the while hamish was telling him that the shot had been a near thing for both of them and ye must ask why he didna kill you when you were in his sights on a public road he retorted silently as dr eustace went on with his digging id rather know why he followed me to beachy head just to leave a warning why not shoot me on the cliff and simply roll my body off the edge and into the sea i was an excellent target standing there against the sky it would have been the easiest way to be rid of me without a trace aye but i canna believe he wanted it to be sae easy and after a moment hamish added he likes playing wi you hed have had to be ahead of me rutledge responded grimly as the doctor probed for the last shard of glass and then handed him a mirror but how did he get clear so fast youll have to put this powder on the wounds dr eustace was saying reaching for a small packet on the table behind him else theyre likely to fester you wont look very pretty in the witnessbox in spite of my handiwork but at least the worst of the damage is cleaned rutledge stared at himself in the mirror tiny red wounds spotted his face giving him the appearance of a man with measles it doesnt matter he answered the doctor the cuts will heal soon enough but he could remember the sound of shattering glass and the familiar whistle of the bullet rushing past his ear hamish was right it had been damnably close he had felt the wind of its passing either the shooter was a very good marksman or hed come closer than hed intended it was rather like being stalked by someone who didnt exist but the bruised grass by the hedgerow told rutledge it wasnt a shadow following him he remembered too the uneasiness hed felt at beachy head hed felt it again in that pasture a tall target there by the hedgerow a target even a poor marksman couldnt have missed he didnt like being vulnerable he didnt like a nameless faceless pursuer at his heels invisible because he couldnt be identified aye he could be anywhere hamish told him even in yon courtroom staring down at you from the gallery it was a thought rutledge carried with him into the witnessbox but if this stalking had been an attempt to change rut ledges testimony it had failed he saw the prisoner in the dock convicted and walked out of the courtroom with grim satisfaction even as he scanned the faces around him five or six women twice as many men three exsoldiers still wearing their armyissue greatcoats one of them on crutches and a bakers boy in his white apron his face speckled with flour there was no one among them he recognized but did one of them know him constable hensley was not a glutton for punishment but he was not a man of selfdiscipline either when the note came he stared at it for a moment and then crumpled it in his fist there was no salutation or signature just the words i saw you there in the wood hed have sworn that hed taken every precaution who had been out in the fields or for gods sake along the road that afternoon why had they been spying on him what did they know did they have any idea how often hed gone to the wood that he was unable to stop himself from searching it over and over again looking for any sign that the ground had been disturbed where had heor shebeen this watcher how many times had he been watched he remembered that strong sense of someone else in the wood the sound of a footfall somewhere behind him now that he considered the possibility he was sure that he hadnt imagined it after all friths wood was always intimidating with that ominous feeling of something there that was not natural not even human but this time it must have been a human agency and he had been so locked in his own fancies hed mistaken it for ghosts he swore if id had my wits about me id have had him for the rest of the day he went about his duties with only half his mind on what he was doing or saying all he could think about was what had taken someone else to the wood was it only to watch him or had this person been up to no good and interrupted by hensleys unexpected arrival then why send the message why give himselfor herselfaway by admitting to being there that was a question that muddied his thinking to the point that he began to imagine nuances in conversations or sly glances caught out of the corner of his eye even the rector for gods sake had pounced on him wanting to know if hed heard any news of twins born to a second cousin in letherington where hed claimed to be hed wormed out of that one by saying hed forgotten to ask then hed wondered who had put the old fool up to it for more than a week hensley resisted the gnawing mystery of the note shoved under his front door in the middle of friday night hed come wide awake remembering that hed left the wood first what had happened there after he was gone which appeared to him to explain the noteit had been sent to frighten him into staying away i saw you a man with a guilty conscience would take that as a warning and not risk going back hensley on the other hand was eaten up by worry what had the writer found and why after all this time had he been poking around there what was worse once hed got the wood to himself what had he done the constable took every precaution he rode out of dudlington traveled three miles north of the village and left his bicycle well hidden behind the stone wall that ran along the road shutting in the stock that in good weather grazed in long meadow then he walked another mile before turning back to the wood hed been a right fool the last time to leave his bicycle where anyone on the main road could have glimpsed it he was sure that that was what had betrayed him the wood lay on the north side of dudlington beyond church lane in a fold of the land where the dower fields ended this time hensley kept the trees between himself and the village using it as a shield approaching it now he wondered what it was about this one dark place in a landscape of open fields that seemed so evil why hadnt the harkness family whod owned this land for generations cut it down centuries ago and set the land to the plow hed have had it done in a fortnight in their shoes hed been hardened in london hed seen death in many forms he was a policeman for gods sake hardly likely to be moved by nonsense about old bones and this was just a stand of trees the undergrowth just a tangle of briars and vines and fallen boughs but then countrymen were a superstitious lot it was their stories that had set friths wood apart from the beginning passed down from father to son over centuries dont go in therethe dead walk there restless because theyd had no time to pray before they were cut down shun the wood if you know whats best for you in spite of his bravado the closer he got to the trees the harder his heart seemed to pound still the note had been real enough ghosts didnt put pen to paper but what if he was walking into a clever trap he stopped at the edge of the wood in for a penny in for a pound he told himself bracingly and he stepped into the shelter of the trees grateful for the respite from the cold wind that had pursued him across the bare fields he walked slowly studying the ground as he always did poking at briars and the dried stalks of shrubs to see if the matted tangle beneath had been disturbed he was only some thirty feet into the trees when the hairs on the back of his neck seemed to stand stiffly against his collar stupid sod he scolded himself theres nothing here but your own wild fancy the sooner you do what you came here to do the sooner youll be away again he walked on catching himself on the verge of whistling he was nearly through the wood now and hed found nothing suspiciousno one had been digging here or shifting rotted logsnothing that could explain what had brought someone else here had this been a wildgoose chase then what had that damned note been about there was a sound behind him and he whirled not sure what he was going to see nothing another five yards ten fifteen god hed looked back four times already it was the wind rubbing dry branches together flicking the dry heads of dead wildflowers against one another he should have thought about the wind another twenty feet not much farther now but hed have to go back the way hed come back through the whole damned wood this time the sound was nearer he turned quickly listening for the shuffle of feet in the dead wet leaves instead he heard a bird in flight feathers riffling through the air something struck him in the back a blow like a fist piercing his body tearing into him like a hot poker jammed hard into his ribs his breath went out in a frosty gust and had trouble sucking in again even as he realized what it waseven as he knew for a certainty that it was a human agency and not a phantom that was intent on destroying himhe could feel his knees buckle and a terrifying sense of doom sweeping through him hed been shot by an arrow his fingers could just reach it the shaft round and smooth and hed be found here in friths wood with all the village knowing he couldnt stay away he mustn t die here but he knew he was going to it was his punishment he sank to his knees and then fell forward blacking out before the pain touched him inspector smith dining with rutledge at the three feathers in hertford after the court had adjourned said while you were waiting for the verdict we caught your assassin his voice was smug as if he enjoyed showing this man from london that provincial policemen were every bit as good as those at the yard rutledge looking up quickly from cutting his cheese said who is it anyone i know hardly an acquaintancea local boy he came forward of his own accord id no more than got my question out before he was telling me hed done it did he tell you why just that he thought it was a good day to go out shooting why did you question him in the first place has he shot at people before this and where rutledge added to himself had a boy found those cartridge casings to hang them so conveniently at the scene smith not liking the direction rutledges questions were taking frowned we went to him because hes generally roaming about the countryside in fair weather hes particularly fond of the massingham groundsthey include the pasture you described mrs massingham is kind to tommy and he sometimes takes advantage of that to go hunting with a revolver rutledge asked eyebrows raised smith shook his head slingshot he couldnt tell me where hed got the weapon not very bright is tommy crowell never a troublemaker before this you understand but theres a first time for everything and hes old enough to get into mischief youd forgive a younger boy my guess is he found the weapon somewherein a house or barnand simply helped himself to it without a thought of asking permission hes always had a weak grasp of private ownership not thievery so much as just borrowing for a bit as hed put it there cant be that many loaded revolvers lying about in hertford rutledge persisted does your mrs mass ingham have one smith was on the defensive now her husband was a cavalry officer he kept his weapons locked away to my knowledge she hasnt touched them since he was killed in the boer war she said as much which means hamish responded in the back of rut ledges mind that she wouldna know if one was missing and smith in awe of the massinghams most certainly wouldnt have questioned her word id like to see this tommy crowell for myself rut ledge folded his serviette and nodded to the woman who had served their meal she turned to bring him the reckoning where does he live or have you taken him into custody now smith asked gulping the last of his tea theres no need but there is rutledge told him already scanning the charges im leaving for london early tomorrow no dont bother ive taken care of it smith almost ran at his heels on their way to the door the boy cant pay for the damages to your windscreen he said huffing with the effort ive already spoken with his mother theres no money im not interested in money rutledge answered as he reached his motorcar in the yard behind the three feathers where is he now have you charged him i wasnt intendingi was going to hold him overnight to put the fear of god into him in the hope hed show me where he tossed that revolver but his mother begged me then take me to where they live smith cranked the motorcar for rutledge and then climbed into the passengers seat a mile from the massingham estate theres a lane that turns down to the east follow that another mile or so and ill tell you where to stop rutledge drove out of hertford back the way hed come and found the lane with no difficulty it was rutted and the motorcar bounced unpleasantly for some distance before the row of cottages came into view smoke from their chimneys wreathing the roofs in the cold night air smith indicated the third house on the left and rutledge came to a halt let me speak to the mother youll terrify her scotland yard invading her sitting room he got out and knocked at the door a worn woman of perhaps forty answered and then stared in alarm over his shoulder at the tall man behind smith dressed in a london made coat and hat youre not going back on your word she began accusingly i promised id keep him to home theres nothing to worry you mrs crowell id just like to speak with tommy for a bit this is mr rutledge it was his car that was damaged but he hasnt come about repayment they stepped under the low lintel and into a small cluttered room it was apparent that mrs crowell took in laundry there were baskets of neatly folded clothes and bed linens set in every available space and the odors of hot irons and strong soap permeated the house apprehensive her eyes on rutledge she called tommy from his room under the eaves he came clattering down the steps a big rawboned child of about sixteen his face changing from open curiosity to frowning uncertainty as he saw his mothers guests stopping short he looked from his mother to inspector smith his expression shifting with every thought that passed through his head before smith could speak rutledge stepped forward and held out his hand hallo tommy my names rut ledge im from london youre quite a good shot you know hit the windscreen dead center tommy crowell burst into shy smiles at the praise as he shook rutledges hand thank you sir ive had a good deal of practice ever thought about the army men hardly more than a year or so older than tommy had served under him as hamish was reminding him mrs crowell began to protest but rutledge sent her a warning glance the army tommy hesitated ma wouldnt allow it what do you prefer when youre hunting shotgun revolver a wariness crossed the boys face rutledge noted it and added im a better shot with a revolver myself and as the words came out of his mouth he saw himself standing over the body of corporal hamish macleod and drawing his service revolver to deliver the coup de grace looking down into the painridden eyes begging for release the cottage room suddenly seemed small airless sending an instant of panic through him fiona rutledge could hear the name as clearly as he had that night on the somme as the improvised firing squad stood there watching a hand touched his arm and rutledge nearly leapt out of his skin it was smith and for an instant he couldnt remember where he was or why im sorry he said swallowing hard hed missed the boys answer tommy said repeating his answer nervously ive never fired a real weapon he turned to his mother and she nodded im better at this he reached on a shelf by the mantel and took down a slingshot it was strong and well made and someone had carved and stained it to look like horn he held it out with a mixture of pride and anxiety you wont take it will you ma wont let me use it anymore but i like to look at it rutledge examined it turning it in his hands asking and you shot out my windscreen with this tommy nodded i must have done its what i was shooting but rutledge had dug a bullet out of the frame of his motorcar where it had buried itself after narrowly missing him then wheres the revolver he shook his head in confusion i dont know sir truly i dont i must have lost it smith started to speak but rutledge was there before him did you lose it in the pasture where the horse was grazing were you lying by the hedgerow and dropped it after firing at my car where the road bends rutledge added as tommy seemed unable to grasp the exact location thats the upper pasture where the road bends the boys face changed inspector smith didnt say it was the upper pastureihe said where the horses are and thats the home paddock i dont go to the upper pasture not anymore the vehemence in his voice was unmistakable and his face had paled making him look even younger than his years why because of what youd done there no sir noi dont like the dead soldier there im afraid of him rutledge had quartered every foot of that ground and there had been no dead soldier nor even the makings of a grave but it was clear that tommy had seen someone there or something in spite of rutledges efforts he got no other information from the crowell boy whatever had caused his terror had emptied his mind of details and he shook his head over and over again saying i donti dont know in the end rutledge handed back the slingshot and said thats a nice piece of workmanship and i think your mother ought to allow you to have it again with smith at his heels blustering rutledge went out to the motorcar and cranked it himself the night had turned cold with frost surely by morning pulling on his gloves he got behind the wheel smith was still protesting rutledge said i dont believe he ever touched a revolver whatever you ask him he agrees with where is the revolver i dont know where it is sir thats the literal truthhe doesnt because he never had it youve asked him a direct question and he gives you the best answer he knows how but whateverwhoeverwas in that upper pasture must have done the firing a dead soldier that i knew nothing about you didnt buy that cockandbull tale did you but then hamish was saying smith knew nothing about the casings not even a suicide smith answered look if the boy is lying about the revolver hes lying about the dead man as well its a matter of selfpreservation he doesnt remember what he did with the weapon and so he gives you a corpse instead youre a policeman and corpses are what you deal with even tommy crowell understands that he doesnt lie simple people seldom do he told you he didnt know where the revolver is and he doesnt if he saw a dead man in that pasture he described him in terms he could understand he recalled tommys exact description he was dead buried i saw him and i didnt like it and i ran buried as in a churchyard no not in a churchyard there were no flowers and no tombstone still he was lying there buried i can hardly scour hertfordshire for a dead soldier its a waste of my time and the time of my men no whoever was in that pasture couldnt have been a local man you cant be sure of that rutledge glanced at him saw the angry face etched by the motorcars headlamps and answered him carefully its your patch you know it best if you find out anything you know where to reach me in london if its not a local man smith said pursuing the issue doggedly it was no accidental shooting was it he knew where he was aiming when rutledge said nothing he fell silent thinking it through where the rutted lane met the main road and the motorcars tires fought for a grip in the icy mud as rutledge turned smith went on you have an enemy out there then id not care to be in your shoes he turned his head to look behind rutledge as if searching out hamish ill thank you to take your troubles out of hertfordshire as soon as you can we dont need them bowles was pacing his office by the time rutledge had received his summons and knocked at the door where the hell have you been the chief superintendent demanded angrily i sent for you a good half hour ago and whats happened to your face ive just got in from hertford sir i dont give a dance in hell where youve come from youre leaving for northamptonshire straightaway theres trouble in a place called dudlington in the north of the county a constable has been shot with a bow and arrow for gods sake a bow rutledge began surprised but bowles cut him off hell live no thanks to the bastard who did it leaving him in the weather to die of his wound it was intentional this shooting were certain of that and i want whoever it is brought to justice now do you understand me hens leys one of my men or was when i was an inspector in westminster he went north over my objections and look where its landed him bowless face was red and blotched with fury he shoved a file of papers at rutledge well dont stand there man i want you to interview hensley tonight if those fool doctors will let you and get to the bottom of this business theyve got him in hospital in northampton and the local man says hes just out of surgery it was useless to plead fatigue or other pressing business bowles was not a man who cared about anything but getting his own way and blustering anger was a well tested method of keeping his subordinates from arguing with him rutledge took the file and left down the passage he ran into sergeant gibson in conversation with the man sweeping the floor gibson turned away to speak to rutledge and said dourly if you want the truth of the matter hensley left under a cloud i never did know the ins and outs of it a personal matter he managed to keep it from old bowels ears im told the chief superintendent thought he was the perfect copper threw him up to us any number of times rutledge said dryly then therell be no end of suspects for this attempt at murder gibson caught himself before he grinned instead he retorted how the mighty are sometimes brought low and with that he was off down the passage leaving rutledge standing there dudlington was a tiny village of stonebuilt houses topped with gray slate roofs and a single slendertowered church huddled together in the midst of open fields as if for warmth or comfort the rich brown of plowed acres and the yellow green of winter pasture lay like a blanket around them but the houses turned their backs to the land as if ignoring it and the barns were a low afterthought tucked here and there as if no one had known what to do with them it lay north of the county town but rutledges first call was in northampton he found his way to the hospital there only to be turned away because hensley was still recovering from his surgery rutledge spent what was left of the night in a hotel recommended by an orderly and returned early in the morning over the objections of matron he stepped into the ward to see if hensley was awake the constable was in the mens surgical ward halfway down the row and on the left watching through halfclosed lids as a nursing sister bathed his neighbor in the next bed there were some six or seven other patients in the long room two of them snoring heavily and the others lying quietly as if in too much pain to move hensley looked up as rutledge stopped by his bed you a doctor then he asked hoarsely i was told they were giving me something for the pain he was pale his barrel chest swathed in bandages his thinning dark hair combed and parted as if hed already been tidied by the plump sister who now turned to rutledge its not visiting hours for another forty minutes she told him crisply ill have to ask you to leave im here on police business sister rutledge said bringing a chair from another bedside to place it next to hensleys she tried to stare him down and failed you wont tire my patient then or i must ask matron to throw you out no i wont tire him rutledge sat down dropping his hat on the foot of the bed how are you feeling he asked hensley it was a rhetorical question asked as a courtesy bloody awful hensley complained in a strained voice the roughly handsome features were drawn giving them a sharper edge he made an effort to collect himself im told the doctors here saved my life i cant say i dont remember much about what happened who are you not a local man the names rutledge ive come from london to look into this business was it old bowels who sent you hensley asked showing more interest he always did look after his own not waiting for rutledge to answer he shifted uncomfortably its these damned bandagesthey stick and pull at the stitches and theres no help for it bad enough what they did to remove the point of the arrow aches like the very devil between that and the catgut ive not had a minutes peace since i came out of the ether and found myself in this bed he shot a black look in the direction of the sister but she ignored him you say you remember very little of whats happened do you remember where you were when the arrow struck you even as rutledge spoke his mind conjured up an image of the windscreen shattering and he pushed it back into the shadows hensley looked away im told they found me at the southern edge of friths wood i cant say if thats true or not if it was i didnt get there under my own power would this wood normally be a part of your regular rounds close enough for example for you to see or hear something that attracted your attention even if now you cant remember going that far hensley answered him with more intensity than the question merited the last thing i remember was riding my bicycle along the road to letherington well to the east of the wood how could i see or hear anything from there i draw a blank on the rest of it they tell me i came to my senses as they were lifting the stretcher into mr staleys wagon if i did i couldnt tell you what was said to me do you have any idea who might have shot you would someone practice archery in the wood or hunt rabbits there not in friths wood they wouldnt people avoid it he stirred again trying to find a little comfort at any rate the trees are too close for true archery or much of anything else is there anyone in dudlington who bears you a grudge something flitted across hensleys face a shadow of guilt rutledge thought i dont have any notion what happened much less why he answered just as a patient three beds away began to cough heavily the sister hurried to his side and hensley watched her prop the man higher on his pillows no one goes to that wood not if theyve got any sense least of all me i cant think why anyone might drag me there unless it was to hide what hed done hes no a light man to be hauled about hamish said stirring his voice no more than a thread in rutledges mind no in the middle of the day when people are about whats wrong with this wood rutledge asked why do people avoid it its haunted by the dead so its said what dead hensley shut his eyes as if keeping them open was an effort its not a police matter saxon dead a long time ago the story is there was a massacre raiders herding everyone from the village into the wood and slaughtering them you havent been there you dont know what its like strange thats all i can say who found you rutledge asked i dont know i asked dr middleton that and he said i wasnt to talk he shifted again they did tell me i lay there bleeding for more than two hours i was that cold they thought i was already dead that was afterward on the journey down to northampton i can recall a little of that anyone on your patch who uses a bow he moved his hand slightly indicating he didnt know sister he called as the nurse eased the coughing patient and started down the ward with her basin of bathwater is it time yet ill tell you when its time she said mr rutledge i believe youve asked enough questions hensley turned his head restlessly bloody woman he said under his breath im the one here in the bed not her how does she know how i feel how often do you go to letherington could someone have expected to find you on the road there at a particular time of day i go to letherington when i need to meet with inspector cain or report to him theres no pattern to it he hesitated i thought i heard crows above the fields making a bloody racket i stopped my bicycle and stood there looking around thats the last i remember distracting rutledge hamish reminded him ye ken the crows flew up fra the trees by the road at the sound of yon shot no at the sound of the motorcar thats true rutledge agreed silently they werent disturbed until the revolver was fired whoever it was had lain quietly in wait for some time long enough for them to settle he brought his mind back from hertfordshire to constable hensleys attacker what agitated them in this case not an arrow being loosed the man in the bed was saying at a guess i never got to letherington but youll have to ask inspector cain about that i remember setting out i remember the crows he shook his head as if bewildered it wearies me this business of not knowing if you can bring back any more details ask matron to call chief inspector kelmore or one of his people here in northampton and hell get word to me rutledge retrieved his hat do you have a station in dudlington hensleys voice was weaker and he closed his eyes against the dim lamplight we dont run to station houses i use my parlor as my office youll find whatever you need there make yourself at home i wont be back for a bit if these bloody butchers have their say rutledge stood for moment beside the bed looking down at the wounded man he appeared to be in no hurry to find his attacker and that in itself was odd no anger no fierce need to help speed the inquiry along but then hensleys eyelids opened and he said as if realizing his own mistake ill worry about it when im better i cant now you can see that tell inspector kelmore im not fit enough for questions yet matron was coming with a little tray of medicines and a cup of water hensley saw her and his face cleared thank god matron nodded to rutledge as she reached the bed you promised me only five minutes yes i was just going tell me do you know what became of the arrow that was taken from hensleys back you must ask the surgical sister about that but the surgical sister when rutledge had run her to earth said theyd removed the shaft before he was brought here you must ask dr middleton what became of it as for the tip it was an ordinary metal one chief inspector kelmore took it but i doubt it did him much good we had rather butchered it extracting it from the rib constable hensley was very lucky his injury might have been far worse if the arrow had got past the ribs hed be a dead man rutledge went in search of chief inspector kelmore and found him in his office a stuffy little room reeking of pipe smoke kelmore was a graying man in his late forties with yellowed teeth and ears too large for his head the chief inspector shook hands with rutledge and said i was just leaving the wifes ill and im taking the rest of the day off theyve sent you here about hensley have they lucky he wasnt killed according to the surgeon he began to dig through the contents of his desk drawer then reached instead for a box sitting on the floor heres whats left of the arrow i expect thats what you came for he passed the broken shaft with its mangled metal tip to rutledge nothing unusual about it except where it was found in a constables back rutledge studied the wooden shaft then the tip i should think it would have depended on the distance the arrow flew as to how deep it might have gone yes that was my view as well hence the luck i spoke of i daresay whoever loosed this arrow is afraid to come forward and admit to his carelessness he held out his hand for the tip and thats what you put it down to carelessness rutledge asked returning it what else should i read into it as youll see for yourself dudlington is hardly a hotbed of murderers i cant think why someone would have wished hensley ill seems to be a decent enough chap had no complaints against him nor has inspector cain who oversees dudlington along with two other hamlets fairfield and letherington letherington to the north of dudlington is the largest of the three fairfield is a little more to the east he pointed to a county map on the wall ill call on cain tomorrow was there any indication in that woodwhats it called friths woodhow hensley had been carried or dragged there i dont think they looked does he claim he wasnt in the wood when he was shot thats odd he says he remembers riding his bicycle on the main road and the next thing he knew he was on his way to hospital he doesnt know how he got to the wood or when he was shot they do say that sudden and severe injury can shock the mind and events just before it happened are lost his memory might return as he heals im not sure why the yard was brought into this business before wed had a chance to look into it ourselves but there you are no offense intended none taken i expect london was concerned because hensley came from there and it was possible that someone hed helped convict had a long memory thats always possible of course yes i can see where it might have caused concern kelmore stored the arrow away again and rose to his feet ill speak to hensley myself tomorrow i must go the doctor is coming to my wife again and i must be there if theres anything you need let me know if you cant find me leave your message with sergeant thompson hell see that i get it he was ushering rutledge out of the tiny office and into the drab corridor how are you getting to dudlington its isolated you know no bus service i have my own motorcar what luck you can drive me home its on your way out of town it was nearly dusk when rutledge came to the turning for dudlington and if he hadnt been on the lookout for it hed have missed it an inn standing alone on a rise was all that could be seen in a wide landscape of fields running from his left down the slope of the land toward a little stream only visible because of the straggling line of trees that followed it in the distance he could just see a low line of roofs that indicated barns he passed the inn as he turned and made a note of it then he was in the village some hundred yards beyond holly street was narrow with houses on either side set directly on the road farther on whitby lane turned off to his left and when he followed that he saw that church street coming in on his right led to the churchyard with the slender steeple of the church rising over the roofs surrounding it no one was about except a dog trotting down the lane toward his dinner and there was no sign to indicate where constable hensley lived rutledge turned the motorcar near the churchyard and went back the way hed come toward the inn the oaks stood on higher ground than the village a large inn for its location with a pedimented front door that spoke of better days he opened the door and found himself in a spacious lobby that had once been the entry to the house a handsome stair climbed to a landing and turned out of sight there was a bell on a table by the door and he rang it after a moment a woman came out of the back tidying her hair as if she had just taken off an apron good afternoon sir are you stopping for dinner we dont serve for another two hours im looking for a room she was skeptical i dont know that we have one available ill just ask mr keating she left him there in the hall and soon a balding man of about fortyfive came out to speak to him youre looking for a room is that it sir for the night the inn appeared to be empty except for the man and the woman for several days inspector rutledge from london he was curt tired of delay ah youre looking for constable hensleys house i take it second on the right whitby lane not hard to findfollow the main road into the village and you cant miss it ive no intention of staying the night at hensleys house im looking for a room here keating was silent for a moment then he said weve got a room or two i keep them for travelers this is a rather isolated part of the world as you must have noticed and were accustomed to people late on the road looking to stop the night but im afraid were booked up just now the words were firm brooking no argument but where were the motorcars or carriages by the door to support keatings claim rutledge was about to point that out when he recalled what an elderly sergeant had told him years before i remember the day when a policeman under the roof frightened away custom id be offered poor service and a cramped little room at the back beneath the eaves in the hope id go away sooner he didnt think keating was prepared to offer him even that the innkeeper stood there inflexibility in every line although the pleasant expression on his face stayed securely in place short of calling the man a liar there was nothing more to be said rutledge turned on his heel and left he found hensleys small house squeezed between a bakery and a greengrocers the door was unlocked and he let himself in feeling the chill from no fire over the last several days the cold seemed to hang in the air and the darkness in the tiny entry compounded it retrieving his torch from the motorcar he walked back inside searching for a lamp the bloom of light dispelled the sense of emptiness but it wasnt until hed got a fire going well in the parlor that served as an office that he took off his hat and coat and set them aside the parlor was a square room windows only on the front and it was occupied by a desk sitting across from the hearth papers scattered over its surface rutledge paused to look at them and found nothing of interest notices from northampton a letter inquiring for a mr sandridge in the town and a logbook that had been kept meticulously until the day hensley was shot in the back was a sitting room a kitchen with an empty larder and upstairs a bedroom with sheets on the bed that were damp and wrinkled it willna do hamish told rutledge its no a place to be comfortable rutledge took out his pocket watch and looked at it the oaks would be serving dinner in another fortyfive minutes and the thought of a warm meal and a bed pulled at him keating be damned there was a voice from the hall at the foot of the stairs halloooo he went to the top of the steps and called down inspector rutledge here what do you need well i told myself it couldnt be bart hensley she moved into the light of his torch as he pointed it down the stairs in her direction what are you doing here he hasnt died has he no he could see her now a tall slender woman wearing a knitted hat and a gray coat with a black collar ive come to investigate what happened to him well then dinner is at eight i usually prepare it for him an arrangement weve had since he came here in you might as well take your meals at my house too theres not much choice in dudlington im your neighbor next but one on the other side of the bakery oh and you can leave your motorcar just by the side of the house its out of the way there and she was gone shutting the door firmly behind her rutledge presented himself at the house on the far side of the bakery exactly at eight the door was opened and the woman invited him in my name is barbara melford im a widow i live alone and i am paid for each meal the dining room is this way her house was larger than the constables with good furnishings and a fire in the dining room where the table was set for one you dont take your meals with hensley rutledge asked i am paid to feed him not to keep him company as ive already said im a widow and im not looking to marry again least of all not to constable hensley he could see her clearly now in the lamplight a woman in her thirties smartly dressedfor his benefit and not constable hensleystrying to cover her apprehensive ness with a chilly demeanor hamish taking a dislike to her said why did she invite you to dine for information rutledge took the chair at the head of the table and pulled his serviette out of a china ring with blue violets painted in a garish pattern weve had no news about constable hensleys condition was his surgery successful barbara melford asked as she brought in the soup creamed carrots with leeks apparently although he was in a good deal of pain when i spoke to him rutledge answered choosing his words with care nothing was said about when he might be released i cant imagine being driven that far with an arrow in my back she commented returning to the kitchen while he sat in the dining room in lonely splendor it was a pretty room with drapes of a floral brocade and an english carpet under a table that could seat eight rutledge found himself wondering if mrs melford had ever entertained here when her husband was alive he was tired and it was a very tense meal as his hostess brought each course in silence and disappeared again but he could feel her eyes on him through the crack in the door leading to the kitchen once he tried to question her about what had happened but she answered brusquely i cant see the wood from my windows thank god you must ask someone who can there was a flan for dessert better than many hed had but he didnt linger over his tea as soon as the first cup was empty he folded his serviette and calling to barbara melford to thank her he started for the door to the hall she came to speak to him then following him as far as the front door to point out a silver tray on the small table at the foot of the stairs youll find your account waiting here every morning i serve breakfast at eight sharp ill be here he stepped out into the cold night air feeling it strongly after the heat of the dining room hensleys house was still chilly the fire struggling to do more than heat the parlor he searched for the linen cupboard and at length discovered clean sheets and pillow slips as well as two or three fairly new blankets making up the bed he considered his conversation with hensley wrapped in pain still but alert enough to answer questions guardedly why since hed been found in that wood would the constable refuse to admit hed gone there for one thing moving a large man with an arrow in his back would have been difficult and dragging him would leave marks that would have to be looked into tomorrow and where is the bicycle he was riding hamish asked ill find out tomorrow there should be someone who can tell me the doctor for one at a guess yon widow doesna care oermuch for the constable she must be desperate for money to put up wi him or she finds him willing to talk more than he should about village business a man can be flattered into boasting it was late when rutledge finally got to bed the house seemed unfamiliar and unwelcoming and he hadnt found a key for the door yet hensley had used the parlor for his office which means hamish answered the thought that there are no secrets to be found here rutledge was up well before eight dressed and already searching through the meager files in a box in the parlor it appeared that dudlington had no experience with crime as such the constable had registered every complaint with meticulous care a lost dog found and returned to its owner a quarrel over a rams stud rights pilferage at the greengrocers traced to a small boy with a taste for fruit a domestic matter where a wife had accused her husband of spending more time than was necessaryin her view repairing a chimney flue at mrs melfords house he set the files back into their box and stood looking around the room there were no photographs hereor in the bedroom for that matter and little else of a personal nature but hed discovered a letter in a desk drawer a commendation from the then chief inspector bowles for hensleys services in apprehending a murderer in the city then why was hensley in this outpost of empire serving his time chasing after lost dogs and calming irate wives it was apparent that hensley had kept the commendation letter with some pride rutledge glanced at the wall clock and saw that he had three minutes to get himself to the melford house for breakfast the meal was as well cooked as last nights dinner the eggs done exactly to his taste but he asked as the toast was brought in i tried to find a room at the oaks they all but turned me away do you know why mr keating has always been a private sort he doesnt seem to care for guests staying there not beyond one night mostly he serves meals to travelers and of course the pub is popular with the men here in dudlington who was the woman an employee or his wife she laughed breaking the stern set of her face she may wish she was his wife but frank keating is a misogynist the woman is hillary timmons she lives near the church there arent many opportunities for employment here which is why you feed constable hensley for a price indeed ill just fetch the warm milk for your tea dr middleton was an elderly man his face lined but cheerful he welcomed rutledge with a nod and took him back to his surgery which was no more than a room at the rear of his house did you see hensley how is he faring well enough in pain i should think he was that arrow was in deep how long have you been the doctor here seven years last month i retired from practice and came here to die but i havent had time to get around to that he sat behind the table in a corner that served as his desk and gestured to a chair on the other side my wife died and i lost interest in living she was born in dudling ton and is buried in the churchyard i feel closer to her here where had you lived before naseby its not a very challenging practice but im the only doctor within twenty miles babies and burns and bumps thats mostly the extent of my duties dudlington is a quiet village there was hardly a soul on the streets when i came in last night thats an illusion for one thing theres the weather this time of year the wind howling across those wide fields doesnt invite you to stop on the street and pass the time of day for a quarter of an hour and the men are mostly stockmen up at dawn and home after the livestock has been fed and bedded for the night many of them come home for their midday meal which means their wives spend a good part of their day in their kitchens they do their marketing in the morning and this time of year its dark by the time the children come in from letherington where theyre schooled now we had a schoolmaster before the war but he enlisted as soon as belgium was invaded he hasnt been replaced did constable hensley have trouble keeping the peace his records are sparse and its hard to judge if thats because the village is relatively quiet or because he was behind in his paperwork weve had our share of trouble i wont deny that on the other hand people often dont bother to lock their doors human beings are human beings which translates into the fact that you dont know what theyre capable of until theyre pressed still we seldom have the sort of crimes youd find in london arson rape breaking and entering theft of property it doesnt mean that were better than londoners just that we know one another very well and the man who steals my horse can hardly ride it down church street without half the householders recognizing it on the spot he smiled but dont be fooled everyone knows your business as soon as you set foot in dudlington gossip is our pastime and youll do no better than constable hensley at ferreting it out the smile broadened i shant be surprised to see a flurry of patients this afternoon with all manner of minor complaints every one of them expecting me to tell them what i made of this man from london then what does gossip have to say about someone nearly killing hensley with a bow and arrow the smile vanished ah that i havent been privy to i wish i were then tell me about friths wood where hensley was found its not a place people frequent middleton sighed case in point no one has ever cut firewood there they dont wander there on a quiet summers evening and they will walk out of their way to avoid having to pass in its shadow my late wife told me shed never played there as a child which tells you something theres an old legend about a massacre there in the dim dark past and such superstitions tend to strengthen with time consequently the wood is avoided have you ever walked in the wood yourself never except for once about three years ago not because im superstitious but it would upset people why meddle tell me about finding hensley it was nearly teatime i was sitting in my chair in the parlor napping when ted baylor came to my door his dog heard something in the direction of the wood and began barking baylor wasnt inclined to investigate but after hed seen to his livestock he decided hed better discover what the dog was on about before it got dark when baylor let him out of the yard the dog made straight for the wood disappeared into it and barked again baylor was of two minds about what to do but he finally went in after the dog and there was hensley lying on the ground cold as a fish ted thought he was dead and told me as much but it was shock and the cold air and i managed to bring him around once i got him here and warmed again and you broke the shaft of the arrow there wasnt any choice in the matter i couldnt very well leave it sticking out of his back i asked ted baylor and bob johnson to hold it steady while i cut it with my knife i thought the tip would come out without doing more harm but it was lodged in the rib and i dont have the facilities here for major surgery do you still have the shaft middleton pointed to a basket on a table under the window its in there nothing distinctive about it just an arrow fletched with blue and yellow feathers rutledge crossed the room to examine it middleton was right the shaft was wood and not homemade the feathers appeared to be a little bedraggled but from age or use he couldnt say their condition hadnt stopped the arrow from flying trueor again perhaps it had if the bowman had intended a killing shot hamish said its no possible to tell if this was a woman or a man or how far fra the target the archer was standing if yon arrow was aimed at the constables back the archer didna care whether his victim lived or died he lay there in the wood for several hours no one came back to finish what the arrow had begun rutledge agreed unaware that he was answering hamish aloud middleton said its not likely someone went to the wood to practice at the butts for one thing the trees are too close together and for another its just not done not here in dudlington at any rate unless you were an outsider and didnt know the history of the place of course if you were looking to murder hensley i suppose that was a prime place to do it superstition or no superstition but that makes no sense you could slip into his house and cut his throat while he slept if thats what you were after and not take a chance on being seen walking into friths wood or risk finding out that the tales of haunting are true what became of hensleys bicycle he claims he was riding it on the main road before he was attacked i dont suppose anyone thought to look for it i for one believed hed been on foot there was no sign of it near his body i can tell you that did hensley offer any explanation about why hed ventured into the wood in the first place he didnt have to i could imagine the reason for myself weve always wondered if emma mason was buried there and i think hes spent the last three years searching for her grave who is emma mason rutledge asked there had w been no file for a missing woman or a murder in hensleys parlor she was a local girl seventeen at the time she vanished we searched the countryside for miles around no one had seen her leave and no one knew what had become of her her grandmother was distraughtshe would have led the search parties herself if shed been up to it foul play then we couldnt think of anyone who might have harmed her and we couldnt come up with a sound reason why she should leave abruptly without a stitch of clothing missing or even a toothbrush with her then why suspect she was buried in the wood it was the only place middleton answered with sadness that someone could have disposed of a body without being seen by half the village looking out its back windows a logical place so to speak but we covered every inch of the wood and there was nothing to indicate that the ground had been disturbed i doubt if anyone could have dug a grave there anyway with so many roots stillthe search had to be made if we were going to be thorough following the directions middleton had given him rut ledge left his motorcar at the church and walked across the fields from there he had gone no more than a few hundred yards when he realized how open the land was under a bowl of gray winter sky the grass was brown there were no trees except along the stream and all the way to the horizon nothing broke the emptiness he felt suddenly vulnerable if someone had followed him to kent and to hertford why not here the grass crunched under his feet and the wind had a bite to it he could see the wood now bare branches stood out darkly against the slate color of the clouds like fingers reaching upward it was a larger wood than hed expected and denser impossible to see beyond the trees to the next field the trunks and undergrowth weaving a thicket behind him he could see the weeks wash blowing on lines in the backs of houses the slate roofs dark under the gray clouds overhead and the tall thin spire of the church soaring into the sky like a lonely sentinel a dog barked from a house on the far side of the church near a small barn ted baylors dog by the time he had reached the wood rutledge was aware that hamish was tense and lurking in the back of his mind he stepped into the line of trees sensing the eyes of villagers watching from behind their lace curtains he had a feeling that if a saxon warrior met him at the edge of the wood and lopped off his head with a long blade no one would be surprised hamish said its no a very good idea to tempt the dead no not while walking over them walking was difficult dead or no fallen boughs and rotted trunks were traps for unwary feet under the mat of wet leaves he stumbled once and caught himself with a hand on the nearest tree there was a small area where the leaves had been churned by a multitude of feet hensley then and his saviors looking around rutledge wondered how anyone had managed to get the badly wounded constable out of the wood tight as tolerances were somehow they had got it done he examined the ground for some distance on either side of the site where he presumed hensley had been found but there were not enough signs to indicate whether the man had been dragged to the scene or fell there it would surely have been as difficult getting him here as it had been to extricate him rutledge realized he needed a good deal more light to be certain but on the whole as hamish was saying it appeared that hensley had been in the wood and on his feet when he was shot whether he had intentionally lied about that or honestly couldnt remember any of the events before the arrow struck him it was hard to say some distance away in the soft earth by the bole of a tree rutledge found a deep indentation that indicated someone had been standing here but whether it was the man with the bow and arrow or hensley himself it was impossible to tell with hensley down hamish was reminding him there had been no one to do an investigation of the ground in his place the doctor had been busy with his patient and his helpers had been in a hurry to get out of the wood as quickly as possible if theyd searched at all it was cursorily rutledge moved on studying the earth underfoot intently before taking each step but the clues were small and hard to see a stalk bent here a leaf dislodged there a twig broken where someone had brushed by it there was no way to know who had disturbed any of them hensley or his attacker the odd thing was he hadnt started a rabbit or seen a bird flitting from tree to tree twittering with curiosity the wood was empty and quiet and that was ominous in itself how difficult would it be to dig down into the composted soil to make a grave would that have been hens leys fate if hed died straightaway even a killer might have qualms about burying a man still alive rutledge shuddered at the thought it could probably be done this digging but it would have left scars on the ground for all the world to see that is if the world bothered to come and look here rutledge made his way deeper into the trees taking his time the farther he went the dimmer the light as if it had been sucked away from the heart of the wood whats more it was hard to see behind or ahead and that alone would make a man feelhe stopped short listening but there was no one moving behind him though he would have sworn he heard footsteps there who would be bold enough to walk into friths wood after him hamish said i canna say i like it in here wed best be gone but rutledge continued straight ahead hoping to come out of the wood on the far side instead he had gone in a half circle and wound up where hed come in ive got a better sense of direction than that he told himself yet it would have been easy enough to get off track as he avoided thickets and trunks grown too close together he stopped to listen again but the footfalls hed believed he had heard were silent in a way that was more chilling than knowing they were still behind him it would take ten men and the better part of a day to cover all the wood as carefully as hed done in his own circle and he wasnt sure he could find ten men in dudlington who would be willing friths wood was an excellent place for an ambush on his way back to hensleys house rutledge saw a stooped man puttering in the small garden of what must be the rectory set as it was almost in the precincts of the church he turned that direction and came to lean on the low wall that separated the churchyard from the rectory grounds as he called out inspector rutledge scotland yard may i come in and speak with you the man looked up and waved come around to the gatejust there rutledge did as he was told and found his way around the side of the house to where the man waited leaning on his pitchfork im frederick towson rector of st lukes he said taking off one of his gardening gloves to offer his hand or has someone already told you as much no ive only just met a handful of people here i saw you walking toward the wood looking for clues are you come in and well have some tea to warm our bones towson smiled yours may not be as old as mine but this cold isnt particular rutledge followed him into the tall narrow stone house surely far too big for one man to manage on his own there must be a woman who came in to clean he made a mental note to find out who it was i try to do a little work in the gardens each day to keep my hand in but the truth is my thumbs are brown not green if anything grows at all its through the kindness of my neighbors they come to offer advice and i listen he opened the kitchen door and pulled off his muddy boots before stepping inside rutledge stopped long enough to use the iron scraper shaped like a sleeping cat crouched by the door the kitchen was a warm cozy room painted a pleasing shade of blue the furnishings were old but well polished and there were blueandwhitepatterned curtains at the windows matching the cloth on the table sit down ill just put on the kettle rutledge tried to judge the mans age and decided he was perhaps sixty although his hands were knotted and crippled by rheumatism those knuckles he thought must give towson a good deal of pain at night but the rector was quick and economical in his movements and he had the woodburning cookstove fired up in no time from a cupboard he took out bread and butter setting them before rutledge with a pot of jam im fond of a little something with my tea he explained reaching for the bowl of sugar and then disappearing into the pantry to find milk the tea was steeping when he finally settled down across from rutledge and sighed ive heard no news of hensley is he recoveringor dead recovering but in a good deal of pain you can see the wood from your upper windows surely did you notice him walking that way three days ago was there anyone with him apparently he cant remember where he was just before he was shot im trying to fill in the gaps i can see friths wood only from the attic windows im afraidbecause of the church cutting into the view and i was in my study working on my sermon youd think i knew how to write one by now but it comes hard i expect ive said everything i have it in me to say he smiled wryly no the first i knew of the incident one of my neighbors came to tell me by that time hensley was on his way to northampton even middleton good as he is couldnt handle a wound of that nature he nodded as rutledge got up to fill their cups thank you inspector ah this is what i need inner warmth you and dr middleton are of an age rutledge said what is dudlington to do when you are gone i expect someone will fill our shoes nature doesnt much care for a vacuum you know tell me about hensley has he been a good man to have here in dudlington is he likely to grow old here as youve done i expect he might or so id have said last week i cant think how someone came to shoot him with an arrow very uncivilized thing to do rutledge hid his smile did most of the people get along well with him he comes from london after all and knew very little about living in a village this size he might have had difficulty understanding the differences that could have made enemies for him towson was busy buttering slices of bread we dont have all that much crime here i daresay he kept out of everyones way most of the time he told me once he was rather glad of the respite tell me about emma mason the knife stopped in midair towson stared at rutledge you move quickly young man how did you come to hear that name it doesnt matter what does matter though is the lack of a file in hensleys records documenting her disappearance a case of that magnitude he must have interviewed people traced her movements there should have been something put to paper i expect inspector cain in letherington kept all that emma wasstill is for all i knowa young girl on the brink of womanhood charming and intelligent and well liked you can see for yourself how small dudlington is and of course everyone knew emma and had watched her grow up do her parents still live here her father fell ill and died of a tumor in his bowels when she was a child her mother brought her home to mary ellisonemmas grandmotherand left her there to grow up then she went away and never came back again as far as ive been told mary was devoted to the child and i dont think shes been quite the same since emma disappeared why would emma go away without telling anyone thats the mystery emma wasit didnt make sense that shed do such a heartless thing there wasnt a cruel bone in her and nothing had been troubling her before her disappearance a young man her schooling living with her grandmother if it did none of us knew it she seemedsunny never down he finished his slice of bread and began to butter another i will say one thing about emma men ernoticed her she was quite lovely dark hair dark eyes slender and shapely i myself could see that she was an attractive child it may be that someone else saw her a little differentlyas perhaps more mature than she was perhaps she didnt know how to cope with that kind of attention a village like ours seldom breeds such beauty you know it could have been a temptation to some still thats not an excuse to run away and what about the wives of the men who noticed her were they jealous i expect they were emma wasnt a flirt mind you but she would smile at you and your heart would skip a beat even mine at my age a lonely man might read into that more than was meant and tell himself that she fancied him if you see what i mean hamish said hes no sae unworldly as he appears and a lonely man could be yon constable yes rutledge answered slowly did hensley show an inordinate interest in her it might explain the missing file he would hardly keep evidence pointing to himself he spoke to her in passing everyone did but whether it went beyond a few words exchanged its hard to say the rectory is not in the heart of the village you see and im not as stable on a bicycle as i once was where does emmas grandmother live on whitby lane across from the bakery shes a little hard of hearing youll have to remember that across from the bakery would put the ellison house nearly opposite hensleys he would have seen emma coming and going every day as he rose to leave rutledge said do you know of anyone here who ownedor useda bow and arrow the only person who ever showed an interest in the bow was emma and that was when she was twelve rutledge stopped briefly at mrs ellisons house but she didnt answer his knock a little hard of hearing he remembered and crossed the street to hensleys looking up as a smattering of sunlight broke through the clouds and touched the pink brick of the buildings with a warm rose light he nodded to a young woman carrying bread out of the bakery she ducked her head as if she hadnt seen his greeting opening the door he walked into the hall of his temporary home and climbed the stairs to hensleys bedroom hed seen a pair of battered field glasses on a shelf between the windows and he intended to borrow them he found them where hed remembered seeing them next to the window but as he reached for them he discovered that this bedroom window in hensleys house stared directly into another window just across the lane a window in the house where mrs ellison lived he held the glasses to his eyes and was surprised at how clearly he could see into the room opposite was that emmas room and had hensley been using the glasses to watch her at night why else were they sae handy hamish asked it was an unpleasant thought he shoved the glasses into his coat pocket and was turning to go down to the motorcar when he saw it a cartridge casing standing upright in the middle of his bed this time without any carving defacing the smooth surface whoever was stalking him had tracked him to dudlington it was not a surprise in many ways hed expected it but rutledge stood there looking at the small casing not touching it what disturbed him most was the fact that once more he had been so easy to find surely no one could guess that he would be staying at the wounded constables houseunless of course it had been a logical step after discovering that rutledge didnt have a room at the oaks after that the motorcar left at the side of the house would have betrayed his presence had anyone seen this invisible stalker walking into the constables house after all it was near the bakers shop and the greengrocers where people did their marketing rutledge went back to the window fronting the street looking in one direction he could see two women coming out of the greengrocers talking animatedly to each other and in the other young children walking hand in hand a nanny behind them her starched apron hidden by her heavy coat and then two men in muddy wellingtons came around the corner heading briskly up the street toward the inn or the fields it was hard to tell three houses away a woman brought out a broom to sweep the walk in front of her door it wasnt that dudlington was emptyit was that whereas a larger village or town might have forty or fifty people on the streets at any given moment this tiny pocket in the middle of nowhere seldom saw more than ten abroad at a time but the doctor had said gossip was the mainstay of life here and a stranger would have drawn faces to the window peering from behind the curtains to see where he was going and what his business might be hamish said itud tak an army to interview all o them rutledge examined the cartridge casing was it intentionally plain or had whoever was stalking him run out of carved casings it doesna matter hamish pointed out theres other business here but beyond the shelter of the village streets the land was flat and sere and rolling no protection a perfect field of fire rutledge shivered it was like no mans land where the only trees were blackened disfigured apparitions in a barren bloody world he started to put the casing in his pocket out of sight and then thought better of it would whoever had set it out for him to find come back later to see if it had delivered its message it was an interesting point and worth considering finally with care rutledge set the cartridge casing exactly where hed found it and then went down the street to take his luncheon at mrs melfords she had set out sandwiches and a pudding for rutledge if she was in the house he couldnt hear her moving about he ate quickly and then left driving up to the oaks where the main road ran beyond dudlington he found the proprietor in the bar serving several men in corduroys and heavy boots they looked around as rutledge stepped through the door then went back to their beer ignoring him rutledge nodded to the proprietor and sat down at a table near the window when keating came over to ask what he would have he shook his head later perhaps conversation which had stopped short at his entrance resumed stiffly as if the subject had been changed in midsentence it was another twenty minutes before the men took their leave and went out the door the proprietor collecting the empty glasses said you have a chilling effect on custom indeed rutledge watched the men walk across the road to the fields and stride over them toward the stream do you know constable hensley well to speak to hes not a regular you might say i dont know that anyone would call him a friend keating set about washing up has anyone asked for him in the lastsay two days asked for him everyone wants to know how hes faring someone who doesnt live in dudlington we see our share of strangers in the oaks its the road yonder that brings us most of our custom you know that what is it youre asking me in your roundabout policemans fashion rutledge smiled you know very well have you given directions to hensleys house to anyone stopping here or discussed the constables condition with anyone passing through someones knocking at your door unwelcomed it was so near the mark that rutledge considered him its not wise to obstruct a policeman in the course of his inquiries what do you have against the law or is it hens ley that you dislike i dont know that i care for either to tell the truth he set the first glass on a mat to dry did you know emma mason keating stared at him caught off guard by the sudden change in direction the conversation had taken everyone knew her he said finally his voice flat what do you think became of her is she dead or did she run away i have no opinion on the subject everyone else has i own the oaks i dont have much to do with the people in dudlington they come here if they choose or not if they want to sit at my bar and drink then i bring them their pints and leave them to it did emma mason ever come here what would she be doing here at a licensed house he countered without answering the question directly you arent a native youve lived elsewhere she might have found that attractive here now i dont meddle with schoolgirls i didnt suggest youd meddled with her only that she might have wanted more than dudlington could offer that she might have liked the idea of seeing motorcars or carriages on their way to more exciting destinations it might have put the thought into her head that here was an escape did she look her age i dont know how she looked if you want to know ask in the village not here he was angry far angrier than the question merited she has to be somewhere rutledge answered mildly shes either alive or dead shes either buried in dudling ton or shes gone away with one of the men who stopped here for a drink or directions or a dinner they wouldnt come to the village theres nothing in it for them she had only to walk up the main street and climb the hill to reach the oaks and even if she didnt set foot in the door she could see the motorcars and the men you can get out of my pub keating shouted now or copper or not ill take pleasure in throwing you out rutledge got to his feet moving without haste i havent come here to cast doubt on the girls virtue her disappearance isnt even my case but the name keeps cropping up in connection with friths wood and constable hensley was nearly killed in that same wood you can see why imcurious keating slammed his fist down on the bar rattling the glasses and bottles on it emma mason was a child a decent child with more beauty than it was safe to possess if i thought hensley had touched her id do more than send an arrow into his back id have wrung his neck youd have had your case of murder then right enough and with that he disappeared through the door behind the bar slamming it after him the wind had come up and with it a cold spitting rain rutledge walked to the motorcar and took up the crank the leather seats were cold as the grave he thought climbing in and the heater offered such little warmth that it might as well not exist he turned into the main road heading north this was the way hensley would have traveled to letherington the road ran straight and narrow between the low stone walls that followed it to the right and the open vistas of dudlingtons pastures and fields to the left as the land climbed with it it began to bend to the right away to the east on a sunny summers day when the cattle and sheep and horses filled the meadows and light glinted on the winding stream that bisected the fields beyond the village it would have been a pretty scene old england and worth fighting for he crested the hill and paused to look back there was the village the inn already out of sight the church spire standing tall and friths wood visible as bare treetops seemingly nothing out of the ordinary at this distance he set the brake and got out of the car walking to the stone wall and climbing it taking out hensleys field glasses he surveyed the ground slowly turning in a full circle then he studied the wall itself on the pasture side away from the road scanning the dark crannies at its base nothing he was about to put the glasses back into his pocket when he saw crows in a field farther along hensley had mentioned crows rising he scrambled down and went back to the car half a mile on the bend of the road took him away from dudlington and even standing in the motorcar he could see only the tip of the spire characteristic of northampton it rose above the church like a finger pointing toward god he set the brake for a second time and found a place to climb the wall again here it was overgrown with weeds and brambles but there was a lower section where he could just manage to get to the top not as flat this one he discovered as he nearly pitched headfirst into the pasture precariously balanced at best he slowly drew out the glasses and lifted them to his eyes nothing in the fields but on the far side of the wall not fifty feet from where he was he could just see a bicycle tucked under the brambles and all but out of sight he walked toward it sending the crows flying hamish said who hid it here yon constable before he went down to the wood or his assailant making certain no one found him quickly it was a good question and without a good answer rutledge lifted the bicycle brushed off the earth and dried leaves and walked it back to the place where he had come over the wall it took some effort on his part to get it into the rear of the motorcar and by the time he had finished the storm hovering in the low gray clouds all day broke in earnest he made a point to stow the bicycle behind hensleys house in the bare back garden covering it with a tarpaulin he found in the tiny shed where picks shovels and spades were kept there must have been a dozen people who saw him bring it with him he thought but until gossip had spread that word he wasnt going to make an issue of his find he wanted no questions about where and how hed come up with it after washing his hands and cleaning his boots he crossed the street to emma masons grandmothers house and knocked this time an elderly woman came to the door she was tall and handsome but when he spoke to her introducing himself she leaned forward as if uncertain what hed said he repeated his name and asked if he could come inside she invited him into the house rather reluctantly the parlor was feminine with lacy curtains crocheted antimacassars on the arms and backs of the chairs and a long lacy cloth over the table by the piano on it were photographs and one was of a young girl holding a black and white kitten and smiling up at the camera she was quite pretty even at the age of around ten with good cheekbones and a high forehead framed in hair that appeared to be dark and thick and curling mrs ellison offered him a chair and sat down herself in the flat tones of the near deaf she asked him his business im looking into the accident that befell constable hensley in friths wood he said pitching his voice so that she could hear him im not deaf young man she retorted and he smiled apparently not i do have trouble sometimes with what the words are putting them together to make sense do you know constable hensley well im his neighbor across the street i dont invite him to my house to dine is he a good policeman how should i know her lips tightened as if to hold back what else she might have said he investigated the disappearance of your granddaughter and couldnt find her he reminded her gently its always been in my mind that she went to look for her mother my daughter when her husband died emmas fathershe wanted no more to do with the child i think it was too painful a reminder of happiness lost i dont know what became of her to be truthful she never wrote to me in all these years not even to ask how young emma fared her face crumpled but she recovered and said in a reasonably steady voice beatrice was pretty too and it was her downfall sad isnt it how blood can tell when he asked to see emmas room mrs ellison raised her eyebrows in disapproval this has nothing to do with constable hensleys unfortunate accident shes not here he prompted her i shant be intruding but it might help me to see what interested her even that inspector abbot from letherington respected her privacy mrs ellison retorted i cant think what good it would do you unless its voyeurism stung he said with some harshness you cant be the judge of whats important in a police matter i can go to northampton and ask for a warrant to search it would be far less pleasant than five minutes in her room very well she rose led him to the stairs and climbed ahead of him her back stiff with protest the girls room was on the front of the house and when he went to the windows he could see that one of them the one nearest the dressing table looked directly into hensleys bedroom across the lane the walls of emma masons room had been painted a pale yellow with cream curtains at the window and a patterned cream coverlet on the bed the skirts of the dressing table were a yellow and cream print matching the cushions on both chairs the carpet was floral with splashes of cream and ivory and yellow mixed with a pale green the effect was like sunlight pouring in on such a gray day even though the lamps hadnt been lit her granny treated her well enough hamish commented as rutledge looked about him it wasna unhappi ness at home that made her leave to rutledges eyes nothing appeared to have changed since emma masons disappearance the room was clean fresh ready for its owner to step back into it again as if these three blank years hadnt existed the delicate scent of lavender filled the air and hamish said it lacks only flowers it was true something in keeping with the pretty surroundings daffodils in a slender glass vase violets in something silver roses in a cream pitcher rutledge could imagine it but there was nothing personal in the room no dolls long since outgrown only a few wellread books on the shelf by the bed and a single photograph of mrs ellison as a younger woman placed by a ticking china clock on the bedside table a shrine or was this simply the way a grieving grandmother preferred to remember her grandchild he walked over to the wardrobe and was on the point of opening it when mrs ellison said sharply only her clothing is in there dresses and coats and shoes a hat or two you neednt pry into what she wore surely he had seen what he had come to see on the way down the stairs he asked i understand emma had been interested in practicing with a bow when she was younger they had reached the foot of the stairs by the time she answered and she made a point not to invite him back into the parlor emma went through a stage where she admired that young woman who was in the robin hood tales i cant think what her name was maid marian she frowned my memory isnt what it once was it hasnt been sincesince she left me at any rate she read every book i could find for her about that forest sherwood yes thank you she begged me to take her there but it isnt a great forest any longer is it i did ask the rector and he said it would have been disappointing friths wood hamish said she would ha seen it as filled wi bandits and heroes it might have seemed an exciting enchanting forest to a girl with an imagination that ran to old tales of adventure and damsels in distress can you tell me where her bow and arrows are now good lord how should i know it wasnt i who gave them to her and i disapproved of them from the start then who did she never told me i only discovered them by chance and after that they were never left lying about do you remember the coloring of the feathers at the end of the shaft mrs ellison stared at him you must be mad of course not im not always certain what day of the week it is young man dr middleton tells me it will get worse this forgetfulness worry he says thats what does it but what do i need to remember anyway losing my daughter and then my granddaughter hardly events one wishes to take into the shadows with one he thanked her then and left but he had the strongest feeling that she was watching him from behind the parlor curtains as he crossed the street and opened the door of hensleys house she was right that he had no authority to poke about in an old mystery the problem was it seemed to intrude of its own accord into the inquiry into hensleys wounding and hed learned long since not to ignore distractions until he was sure that they had no bearing on the main issue his next step must be going to letherington to speak to inspector cain about hensley and about the mason girl his excuse was the recovery of the bicycle if he needed one there was a man sitting in the constables office and rutledge stopped in the doorway wary and on his guard but the visitor came forward his hand out and said inspector cain you must be the man they were sending from london you got here sooner than id expected hensleys superior officer hamish said sourly he doesna know the chief superintendent well had old bowelss need for haste been intended to shut cain out of the inquiry the inspector was young with fair hair and a ruddy complexion and his carriage was military in france were you rutledge added after introducing himself yes worst luck took a bullet in my hip the doctors patched me up but if you want to know tomorrows weather come and ask me rutledge lit the lamp and they sat down cain choosing hensleys side of the table desk as if by right chief inspector kelmore sent word to me that you were here but i had to wait for transportation from lether ington not much for bicycles yet you know and the carriage i generally use was busy elsewhere he grinned my wife had errands to run were expecting our firstborn in three months its costing me more to set up the nursery than it will to send him to eton congratulations rutledge said yes i visited hens ley in hospital hes still in a great deal of pain but the surgery appears to have been successful yes well hes a tough old bird i never understood why he came here from london id have preferred to be working in a city myself given half a chance much trouble in letherington or dudlington not to speak of this is cattle country you know anyone who wakes up for milking at four in the morning isnt good for mischief by eight at night ive hardly seen a man much less a cow theyre in the barns in this weather most of them will bear calves in late winter lose a cow and you lose the calf as well makes sense did you see constable hensley in letherington on friday last everyone maintains he was on his way there but if he was he never reached us none of my people at the station saw him and he wasnt at his usual haunts ive asked around the fact of the matter is id taken a bit of leave for personal business because it was a quiet week or so we thought which would lead us to believe that there wasnt any pressing reason for him to speak with you nothing for instance so urgent that someone would go to any lengths to stop him i cant imagine thats the case here in dudlington its probably the quietest of the three villages and if there was an urgent problem id have got wind of it by now since the attack occurred in broad daylight we cant make a case for mistaken identity any idea who might have set out to kill hensley god no im glad to see you feel it was attempted murder by the way in the first place it doesnt make sense that someone would choose that benighted wood to play at archery and in the second hensleys too big a man not to be heard as he came through the trees and into range finally no ones stepped forward bow in hand with an apology ive only been here two yearsmustered out in late still i cant think why anyone would wish him harm ive had no complaints against him from the local people thats generally the precursor to any trouble what do you know about emma masons disappearance i wasnt here of course when it happened pretty girl like that though might easily have her head turned by talk of better prospects than she could hope for here her mother ran off im told thats probably what put the notion into her head no trace was ever found of her and thats bothersome but i would think that if she didnt want to be found she would make sure she couldnt be grace letteridge always believed shed come back one day weeping and repentant if not pregnant i havent met miss letteridge shes probably seen you all the same she lives at the corner of the main street and this lane the thatched house with the courtyard in front and a garden did she know emma well i dont know the fact is she doesnt talk about emma at all and the general impression is that emma disappointed her well of course so much was expected of the child mary ellison is a harkness on her mothers side and the harkness family owned all the land here for miles around it was the harknesses who didnt care to see the muddy little village of dudlington at their gates and in they tore it down and rebuilt it here out of sight and presumably out of smell thats why dudlington is all of the same period it started from scratch the church is said to be a simplified design of wrens at least the spire is and then in the harkness manor house burned to the ground in a great conflagration killing three people some said it was fired in revenge for moving everyone into the new village but i expect like many great houses of its day it was likely to burn without any help gives me the willies to see my wife walking about with a candle but theres no hope of electrical power in these scattered villages theres no money for starters how have you learned so much about the history of this place rutledge asked curious i married into the history old man my wifes family has lived in letherington for at least five generations my motherinlaw reminds me of that daily another reason i pine for canterbury he shrugged i met my wife there in fact and never dreamed she would expect to live in a house across the road from her mother after wed married any suggestions about hensleys past or present that might lead me in the right direction to be truthful i cant imagine who would have the gall to shoot hensley you might ask yourself if it was something to do with his cases in london ive learned that he was involved with a number of inquiries there one into a german waiter who was a spy or said to be a spy i doubt that he was but in people could find spies under their beds and there was another case i dont remember the ins and outs of it but a man named barstow in the city claimed he was burned out by his rivals everyone agreed it was a case of arsonwhat it took some time to determine was exactly who had set the fire barstow was looking to rebuild and he had a taste for revenge hed burned his own place of business and blamed it on his enemies and they actually went to trial for it i remember hearing about barstow hensley was involved with that possibly involved in it more to the point it was rumored that hensley took bribes to look the other way bribes he was supposed to share with his superior but he stoutly denied any such thing and was rewarded with dudlington a quiet backwater markham the old constable had just retired and gone to live with his daughter in sussex and hensleys superior at the time was then chief inspector bowles hamish was reminding rutledge what hensley had said in the hospital ward was it old bowels who sent you and bowles had been furiously angry about the attack on hensley it wouldnt do to bring his name back to the attention of either the police or the newspapers if there was any hint of scandal attached to his departure what became of the file on emma mason damned if i know theres a good bit in my office but not the whole of it my predecessor in letherington wasnt what you might call compelled to put every detail down on paper id have thought hensley kept some records of his own interviews cain got stiffly to his feet i dont know much more about dudlingtons skeletons than you do i relied on hensleys experience when there were problems i have a good constable in fairfield and an even better sergeant in letherington now who see me through any help you can give me here will be appreciated come back in five years time and if im still heregod forfendill know my turf like the back of my hand where is your carriage rutledge asked him at the door i didnt see it as i came in cain grinned my constables at the oaks hes very good at gossip i depend on him to tell me whats being whispered in the dark corners of the bar and he was off favoring his left leg as he walked through the rain toward holly street rutledge saw him out of sight and then climbed the stairs to the bedroom the cartridge casing was still there where rutledge had left it rutledge made a point to search out the house belonging to grace letteridge it was one of the few buildings in the village that boasted a thatched roof thatching had always reminded rutledge of a woman wearing a marvelous hat and feeling slightly selfconscious about it in the case of this particular house the comparison was apt it was set farther back from the lane and stood out from its neighbors in the fineness of its stonework someone had built a low wall around the front creating a courtyard of sorts where roses cut back for the winter and mounded over like tiny graves marched across the brown grass he ducked his head under the low thatched roof that covered the porch and knocked at the door it was opened by a woman in her late twenties her hair a dull gold and her eyes a very pretty amber in a very plain face miss letteridge and youre the man from london how is constable hensley there was a derisive note in her voice as she asked hes expected to live rutledge answered and waited for her response miss letteridge led him into the small parlor before answering im sorry to hear it i never liked him and i shant be twofaced about it thats rather coldhearted sit down i wont offer you tea because i dont care for it myself and dont keep it in the house i do have some sherry her words trailed off indicating that she would prefer not to offer him that either why dont you like constable hensley he asked again the room was well furnished with a number of wa tercolors on the pale blue walls that caught his attention they had been done with great skill it clearly irritated miss letteridge that he appeared not to be giving her his full attention for the same reason i dont particularly care for any policeman she answered tartly they look after their own dont they hensley was sent here under a cloud and we werent told of it he wouldnt get into trouble here would he after all were very peaceable in dudlington and he only had to walk the streets and mind his own business until he could collect his pension that was the theory anyway how did you know he was under a cloud when he came here rutledge asked intrigued why else would a london police constable be sent to an outoftheway village where nothing ever happens where he wouldnt attract attention im not a fool inspector i know something about the world outside northamptonshire i worked in london during the first two years of the war there werent enough ablebodied men to do half of what was needed women were pressed into service at every turn and a police constable worth his salt would have risen quickly through the ranks as men enlisted instead his superiors banished him that may well be the case but so far i havent heard that it affected the performance of his duties no i doubt if it affected his duties youre right but once a murderer always a murderer rutledge stared at her do you know for a fact that constable hensley murdered someone in london and got away with it even sergeant gibson hadnt told him that nor had cain he condoned arson and a man was caught in that fire so badly burned that even his wife couldnt identify him i went to london myself and read accounts in the newspapers they werent very helpful so i talked to his widow shes bitter because the police swept it all under the rug he didnt die straightaway you know harold edgerton he lingered for nearly a month but in the end the doctors couldnt stop the infections that overwhelmed him by that time there were rumors that hed started the fire himself all hed done was to go back to his desk that evening to retrieve some papers constable hensley knew all this why else were they in such haste to get him out of london and what youre trying to say then is that you believe he killed emma mason it was her turn to stare at him you already know about her i only know that her name comes up when people talk about constable hensley as god is my witness he killed her and buried her in friths wood i cant prove it mind you but theres no other explanation for her disappearance did you shoot him down with that arrow out of revenge one of emma masons arrows perhaps as a sort of poetic justice was it one of emmas how fitting i gave that archery set to her you know for her birthday but i wouldnt have missed my aim inspector if id held that bow constable hensley would have died where he stood the vehemence in grace letteridges voice was chilling and rutledge listening to her realized that she could indeed have killed the question was why hamish said she was plainand the other lass was pretty rutledge asked where is her archery set now truthfully i have no idea what became of it even if i did id be mad to tell you wouldnt i what was emma mason to you that youd have killed for her she looked at him pityingly what was emma to me a mirror of myself motherless her grandmother living in a world of pretense and denial only in my case it was my father who couldnt cope with the realities of life my mother died in childbirth and my father felt that god had cheated him and so he drank himself into an early gravethe only reason he lived until i was twenty was an iron constitution that refused to give up as easily as he had mrs ellison on the other hand saw in emma a second chance the perfect child who would make up for the loss of her daughter one who wouldnt fail her the way beatrice had youre very frank about your own life ive had to be i grew up very quickly it wasnt pleasant but i refused to let it break me the way it had my father she met his glance with her chin lifted defiant hamish said it didna break her but the hurt went deep i was going to say rutledge commented that youre very frank but was emma as frank or did you read into her circumstances more than was there i didnt read anything i didnt need to beatrice was amazingly pretty and people made much of her the way they do she was talented as wella wonderful pianist and a very accomplished watercolorist she painted these grace letteridge gestured to the watercolors on the wall youve noticed them i saw your eyes on them she gave them to me before she left dudlington the first time she didnt want her mother to have them because her mother was against beatrice going to london to study art she saw it as a waste women got married and had babies that was their duty and their purpose accomplishments were fine as long as they enhanced the bride price so to speak but a woman most certainly didnt pursue a career among artists prostitution was only one step away in mrs ellisons view but beatrice ellison married yes of course she did but she made a poor choice he wasnt very good to her and in the end he left her with a child no money and no prospects she had to swallow her pride and bring emma here to live with her grandmother i can understand why she didnt want to stay in dudlington herself but she knew what her mother was like and i consider it very selfish of her to abandon the child like that she got up restless and went to the window to look out at the street she wouldnt talk to me when she came home she was unhappy and unsettled it was a difficult time but emma grew up to be prettier than her mother and that was the trouble trouble in what sense everyone made over beatrice she said turning from the window but emma had inherited her fathers charm and there was something about her that attracted the wrong kind of attention it wasnt just old women cooing over her it was men old enough to be her father or her grandfather watching her on the street or stopping her to make comments thats a pretty dress young lady or i like that hair ribbon did you know it was the color of your eyes it made emma uncomfortable long before she was old enough to understand why did you tell her grandmother what youd observed she laughed harshly she told me i was jealous of the attention being paid to emma and my father punished me for bearing tales i was sent to bed without my dinner for a week people see what they want to seeor expect to see so i took it on myself to be emmas protector and i was hardly more than a child myself it wasnt a task i felt i could do but i didnt have anywhere else to turn and emma accepted thisprotection she shrugged she appeared to be grateful for it or so she said we more or less looked after each other how old are you rutledge asked bluntly grace letteridge bristled its none of your business but he thought hed been wrong in his earlier estimate of her age young herself vulnerable and perhaps reading more into what she saw around her than was true she might have made up the notion that emma needed protection it might indeed have been her own loneliness that made her seek out the younger child and cling to her anything but coming home to a drunken father filled with his own misery why are you so certain that constable hensley killed emma mason he asked he would stop and talk to her tell her about london and plays and concertswhich hed probably never attended in his lifeor describe an evening at the opera watching the king and queen step into the royal box and how the prince of wales had spoken to him one morning as he rode his horse into the park it was pathetic an attempt to hold her attention and he would lie in wait for her ready with a new tale to spin making london seem glorious and she knewshe knewher mother lived there somewhere i listened to her concocting schemes to go there as soon as the war ended and find her mother and live in this fairytale world he had no idea what harm he was doing and its possible he wouldnt have cared more a reason for you to kill him than for him to kill emma ah but what you dont know is that emma fell in love and that put a spoke in constable hensleys wheel i believe he killed her in a jealous rage try as he would grace letteridge refused to tell him who it was that emma had thought she was in love with it doesnt matter hes dead anyway in the war but rutledge could tell it did matter a very great deal as he left hamish was pointing out that very likely grace letteridge had been in love with this man herself it might explain why she went to londonleaving emma to her own devicesand why she came home i canna believe her father would let her go sae easily unless he was dead in in grace letteridge couldnt have been more than nineteen which would make her four and twenty now and emma would have been a very impressionable fourteen rutledge walked to the churchyard feeling the cold wind across his face as he reached the gate and went inside to search the gravestones for grace letteridges father it was a wildgoose chase trying to find one man amongst so many gravestones most of them green with moss and overgrown with lichen but a grave would still be raw enough what he found was unexpected the young men of the village had not been brought home from france but stones had been set in a garden for them and the lonely rows of names struck him as sad and forgotten the cold wind had brought more rain in its wake he stood there looking at the line of empty graves and felt a sadness that went deeper than his compassion for their deaths it was what all of them the living and the dead had lost in four years of suffering hamish was silent for he too was only a marker in a lonely churchyard his last resting place a muddy hole in france with none of the trappings of home to see him into a peaceful rest there are poppies hamish said finally theyll grow again rutledge could see the poppies on the shell casings and hear again the roar of a revolver shot over the sound of his heavy motor and the calls of the crows as they flew up startled the flight of the bullet close enough for its breath to touch his face and its whine to be heard over all the other sounds brought back more than the war it brought back his willingness to die for what hed done but not like this not shot by someone who hid in the shadows with no reality and no right to be his executioner it had all begun at maryanne brownings house in london and it was time he went back to the beginning and found out what had gone wrong on the eve of a new year he could hear someone shouting and looked up distracted from his thoughts hamish said yon rector it was indeed mr towson calling from the porch of his house his voice thin in the rain and wind youll take your death standing there young man come and have a cup of tea before i freeze to death just watching you rutledge splashed across the churchyard found the gate in the wall that led to the rectory and reached the porch like a wet dog wondering what the rector would think if he shook himself violently not so much to rid himself of the water but to rid himself of the mood that had swept over him towson reached for his hat and coat tuttutting over their condition i watched you for a good quarter hour out there paying respect is one thing foolishness another i cant think you knew any of our dead rutledge followed him from the hall into the parlor gloomy in the light of a single lamp i was looking for the grave of a mr letteridge grace letteridges father ah well its nearer the rectory than the memorial garden you were standing by he spread rutledges coat across the back of a chair and stooped to put a match to the fire already laid on the hearth sit down do why did you want to find him clifford letteridge has been dead for five years i should think yes it must be going on five i called on his daughter an hour or so ago i was curious about him after our conversation im not surprised shes bitter is young grace and i cant say that i blame her shes had a sad life and yet no thanks to her father shes become a very fine young woman or could be if shed let go some of the anger inside her she told me he drank himself into oblivion his heart was dead long before he died and thats the truth he put food on the table clothes on her back kept a roof over her head and sent her to church of a sunday with strict regularity and called that fatherhood i wonder that she didnt marry if only to leave such a cold and empty life towson smiled im no fool youre here to pry the secrets of other people out of me sit there and warm yourself and ill bring in a tray of tea he left the room effectively cutting the conversation short rutledge looked at the dark paneling on the wall and somber drapes at the window then turned his attention to the portrait of an elderly mana cleric if he was any judgehanging over the hearth a grim face with no humor in it or even kindness who did it remind him of hamish said the minister who railed against my fiona yes of course that pitiless man in scotland who would willingly have hounded a defenseless young woman to her death and it had been a closerun thing she had loved hamish and it had nearly been her undoing the similarity was not so much in their features but in the unbending view both churchmen must have held of human frailty impatient to cast the first stone towson came in bearing a tray lucky for you the kettle was on the boil he said this should put some heart into you who is the man in the portrait one of my predecessors he comes with the house so to speak i expect no one else wanted him ive often wondered if he roams the rectory at night unwilling to lie quiet in his grave rutledge laughed what would you say to him if you met him in the passage outside your door i doubt wed have much in common beyond how do you do sir rutledge offered to pour the tea aware of the gnarled hands handling the pot but towson said i consider it a point of independence not to need help at least until ive spilled scalding hot tea on one of my guests you arent going to tell me about the man in grace let teridges life it was a statement not a question if she wants you to know shell tell you you must understand it could have no possible bearing on constable hensleys assailant no but i wonder if it had some bearing on miss letteridge going to london in leaving young emma mason to fend for herself and whether this mans death in the war brought miss letteridge home again shortly before emma disappeared youre an imaginative sort arent you then why does emma masons name crop up so often in connection with constable hensley yes well i expect every man wants to appear brave and worldly and exciting in the eyes of impressionable young women when hensley first came to dudlington he kept his head down as a newcomer should after all he was the outsider and he had to earn our respect constable or not but it wasnt long before he was bragging to anyone who would listen about his experiences in london i can understand that emma might be curious about the sort of life her mother lived and so she encouraged him more than was proper mrs ellison would never have painted london in such a glowing light shes convinced that london is little short of satans second address im told it went beyond mere bragging that he used his experiences to impress a young and vulnerable girl what if she believed his stories and ran away to london on the basis of them leaving hensley to take the blame for her disappearance to find her mother it could have happened that way yes still i gave emma credit for more sense the fact is shes missing surely if she went to london to find her mother mrs ellison would have been told she was there and safe or mrs mason herself would have sent emma home again with orders to stay here towson stared at him briefly over the rim of his cup are you trying to tell me that after only a few days here you believe that emma is dead and that constable hensley is being blamed for her death that that was why he was shot im saying that whatever became of emmawhether she died here in dudlington or something appalling happened to her on her way to londonon her own she might never have considered doing anything so rash as running away yes well thats one way to look at it towson sighed im a trained priest i know the shortcomings of human nature as well as most its just that i dont want to think of the child as dead im sorry id like to believe that her mother came back and so one day might emma with or without a child towson stared you are a very hard man in your own fashion that was a cruel thing to say rutledge leaving the rectory with a borrowed umbrella in his hand asked the reverend towson if there were other strangers in the village either as visitors or on business towson shivering in the cold air after the warmth of his parlor answered ive not heard of anyone and as a rule in time i hear most gossip are you suggesting now that it could be something in constable hensleys past that caught up with him rather than trouble over emma mason rutledge fell back on the triedandtrue formula of an inquiry early days yet to be sure of anything im keeping an open mind towson said doubtfully yes i see but rutledge tilted his umbrella against the downpour and began picking his way over the flagstones that made up the path to the rectory gate unwilling to be drawn into any explanation for his personal interest in strangers when he reached the constables house again and climbed the stairs intent on changing out of his wet clothing the shell casing was gone he left early the next morning as soon as it was light and the rain had become a raw drizzle hamish was in a worse mood than the weather warranted and kept up a running argument about what rut ledge was intending to do it was a long drive back to london and he was in fact absent without leave from his duties but hensley was safe in hospital and his wounding could wait for twentyfour hours aye but no if hes released and you havena taken anyone into custody hensley is as safe as houses for now on the other hand someone was there in dudlington to leave and retrieve that cartridge case hes playing with us when hes bored with that or satisfied that hes put the fear of god into us hell decide whether were to live or die its a matter of time do you want to take that risk he hadnt realized that hed used the plural we hamish said i willna die twice until im ready no but its rather like crossing no mans land again you dont know where or when death is coming and theres no way to stop this fool unless we look into the shadows for him outside london there was a brief smattering of sleet before the temperature climbed again and the sun bravely tried to find a way through what was left of the clouds rutledge stopped at his flat long enough to look through the post lying on his parlor carpet and then put in a call to maryanne browning she was at home and surprised to hear from him ian how are you frances had said you were in the north on a case i am or should be other business brought me back to london can you give me mrs channings direction id like to contact her what on earth for dont tell me you believe she could help you with your inquiries he laughed hardly that maryanne where can i find her well shes on the telephone she answered doubtfully and gave him mrs channings number i dont want to ring her up i want to know where she lives oh why didnt you say so she rummaged in some papers their rustle coming through clearly to him and he could picture her sitting in that tiny closet looking for her address book finally she gave him what he needed and he rang off mrs channing lived in chelsea in a small house near the hospital hed interviewed witnesses in chelsea any number of times but now he felt a sense of unease as he reached her door it was intensified by stiff resistance from hamish who clearly wished to be elsewhere i didna care for this woman then and i do na care for her now she answered his knock herself and said without any inflection of pleasure or surprise mr rutledge or should i address you as inspector this isnt a social occasion i take it her voice was as he remembered low pitched and compelling i want to talk to you if i may about the seance he told her baldly and she stepped aside to invite him into the house he wasnt sure what he had expected to find here it would have been easier if the furnishings had been exotic with gypsy flair or an aura of the arabian nights to dismiss her as a fraud a woman who used her parlor tricks to gain entrance to society homes instead hed walked into the sort of house any relatively welltodo widow might own for there were no mens coats on the rack in the entrance hall no hats on the hooks and no sign of a mans taste in the small drawing room decorated in pale shades of lavender and rose she herself was dressed in black with a white lace collar an ordinary woman on the surface but what lay below that surface she sat down opposite him and waited he suddenly found it awkward to begin mrs channings face showed only polite interest her hands folded in her lap her serenity unruffled by the brief uncomfortable silence she kens why youre here hamish warned silently finally she said it was something about the seance inspector i left early the evening you entertained mrs brownings guests as you may recall and i found something unexpected on the step outside her door he reached into his pocket and took out the first of the machinegun cartridge casings which hed retrieved from his desk at the flat she leaned forward to see it more clearly but made no effort to take it and examine it closely its a cartridge case of course i have no idea what kind its from a maxim machine gun indeed she commented sitting back in her chair why have you brought this to me did you think it was mine or meant for you anyone who knew the guest list might have assumed that a woman alone wouldnt choose to stay as late as a couple but i received an unexpected call from the yard and so i was the first of the guests to go down the front steps she smiled my dear inspector id never have given it a thought even if id seen it and if dr gavin had left before you did i dont believe hed have paid it any attention either commander farnum on the other hand was in the royal navy hed have recognized it no doubt and even wondered how it had got there but he wouldnt have picked it up and kept it yes ive considered that mrs channing studied his face for a moment but you were in the trenches im told this would have taken you back i think to the killing and youd have wondered why the war had intruded again on a peaceful london it was so close to the mark he was silent have there been others rutledge was on the verge of denying it and then answered truthfully if this woman had had anything to do with the cartridges she already knew the answer and if she hadnt telling her would do no harm thereve been three others hamish was clamoring for his attention warning him to walk carefully yes thats when you realized that the first one was indeed intended for you but why have you come here if you knew the answer to that why would you think i might recognize them a policeman always makes certain his information is correct you were the only person at maryannes party i didnt know i see she digested that you hold seances for the amusement of your friends what would you do if you raised the dead during one of them id be stunned inspector it isnt my intention and i have notalent in that direction thank god what i do have is a rather good instinct for what people find entertaining as soon as one of maryannes guests thought that the kings spaniel was her own beloved dog i made certain not to tread in that direction we had a rather interesting discussion instead on whether or not charles ii had climbed that oak tree or if it were merely a legend after that we had a few words with lord nelson to amuse commander farnum you had nothing to fear you know what makes you believe i was fearful it was there in the strain of your voice and in your eyes i had no intention of exposing your secrets id have avoided them but you couldnt believe that of course whether that was a policemans natural distrust of everyone or your own vulnerability i couldnt say i should think it was the latter my secrets he made it a question hamish was loud in his ears ah we come at last to the real reason why youre here today i saw you once before new years eve if thats whats worrying you but id never have said so unless you spoke of it first i was in a casualty station in france well behind the lines but still close enough to receive the worst cases youd come to ask about a young soldier and when the doctor told you he was dying in spite of all we could do you sat there with him until the end i never forgot that he didnt have to ask who the man was he remembered him vividly sergeant williams who should have died on the battlefield but somehow held on long enough to be sent back machinegun fire had struck him in both legs rut ledge had had to write a letter to his parents that night your son was a good and brave soldier it was an honor to serve with him and you can be proud of his courage under fire and the care he showed to his men it hadnt begun to say what rutledge knew about williamslittle things like how fond he was of sweets and how he shouted at his wounded telling them they werent to die on his watch by god and how he hated the machine gunners coming back to the present rutledge asked and was that the only time you saw me for it hadnt been many months before hed been brought in to the same station suffering from shell shock and claustrophobia barely alive because hamishs body had given him a tiny pocket of air to breathe long enough to be dug out of the shell hole in time and carried halfconscious back to the doctors they had patched him up and sent him forward again after a few hours rest and a shot of whiskey it was she didnt add that it wasnt the last time shed had news of him youd make a good policeman he said trying to divert the conversation she laughed a throaty laugh that was warm and filled with humor surely policemen arent the only ones who understand human nature a good clergyman must and a good doctor as well why shouldnt a mere woman have the same gift he smiled in response i never thought of you as a mere woman but you use your gifts in unexpected ways your intuition brought you here my intuition can take me places as well then tell me if you will where these shell casings are coming from why ive found them wherever i go it was a challenge after a moment she said may i see it again and this time she took the casing and held it for a moment without looking at it finally she examined the design were the others the same just poppies in rows perhaps a reminder of the dead in france no look just there see that face or skull just visible it grows more noticeable in each of the others and the last one had no pattern at all turning the case she found the skull and nodded perhaps whoever is doing this only had three that were engraved he had considered that possibility if i were to tell you what i think you must realize its nothing more than an educated guess ill accept that someone would like to see you suffer as hes suffered youre to feel hunted persecuted afraid the suggestion is that you belong among the war dead not here in london alive mrs channing broke off as she saw the expression on his face youve already thought about that havent you many times he managed to say but he had answered her with the unvarnished truth as well as his interpretation of the designs on the cases you must ask yourself whether whoever is doing this chose youthat is to say ian rutledgeor if you are so to speak a surrogate for others as opposed to a purely random target he was beginning to feel claustrophobic in this handsome feminine room hamish in the back of his mind was keeping up a barrage of furious comment and the woman before him was too aware of what he was thinking what he was feeling rutledge got to his feet i must go ive a long drive ahead of me yes she made no attempt to persuade him to stay instead she followed him to the door handing him his hat and coat youve been very helpful he told her trying to make amends for his rudeness thank you ive only confused you more inspector she answered ruefully im sorry she closed the door before he was halfway down the walk he searched the motorcar carefully as he got in expecting to find another casing there if he could be followed to hertford and northamptonshire he could be followed back to london but there was nothing on the seats or on the floor for some reason that was not reassuring it wasnt until much later that he realized hed left the original cartridge case behind rutledge drove to within a mile of the yard left the motorcar behind a hotel and stood on a street corner within sight of the main entrance of the yard he waited there for half an hour watching for sergeant gibson to leave at the end of the day gibson was surprised to see him and said bluntly youre supposed to be in the north sir i know i need information about constable hensley exactly i dont know more than i told you he was posted to the north without fanfare something to do with the barstow inquiry talk in the canteen was that hed stepped on the wrong toes and was being exiled out of sight out of mind so to speak ive heard that there was a fire at barstows place of business and that someone died a clerk who had come back to the office unexpectedly he was badly burned i remember that and died months afterward will you find out what you can about the man the fire and constable hensleys role in the inquiry gibson gave him a sharp glance the minute i start to ask questions word will fly to the chief supers ear st margarets church was just visible from where rutledge was standing it was where hed last seen jean going in with her bridesmaids a few days before her wedding to the diplomat he wondered if he would feel the same sense of loss today if she walked up to the church door the same grief he wanted to be gone from here if all else fails there are newspaper files dont call me send the packet by post do you know what youre doing sir gibson asked his eyes still on rutledges face in my view that arrow couldnt have been an accident if it isnt dudlington thats behind the intent to kill hensley then london must have caught up with him if anyone gives you trouble over this tell them we have to eliminate other possibilities ill be sure to do that sir in the fervent hope itll do some good with that gibson pulled his collar up and walked off it was a long and cold drive back to northamptonshire the rain caught up with him again thirty miles outside london as if it had been lying in wait he regretted going to speak to meredith channing it had achieved nothing and he felt hed betrayed more than hed learned it had been unsettling to hear that shed seen him in france it was what hed considered from the beginning and he hadnt been pleased to confirm it for the next thirty miles he debated her role in what had happened he couldnt picture her shooting at him from behind a hedgerow it was a dead soldier hamish reminded him so the lad said dead soldiers dont lie in wait with a real revolver whatever tommy crowell saw it wasnt a corpse but then what had it been it doesna signify hamish told him you have a duty to yon constable it wont help hensley if im dead before he is rut ledge retorted he stopped in northampton matron was not pleased to see him but late as it was he received permission to step into the ward and have a look at hensley but youre not to wake him do you hear hes still in a great deal of pain and weve just given him something to ease it so that he can sleep i wont speak to him rutledge promised when he walked quietly down the row of beds he was accompanied by a cacophony of snores he couldnt help but wonder how anyone could sleep through the noise he reached hensleys bed and went to stand beside the man stretched out there half on his back half on his side lines of pain marked his face visible even in the dim light of the single lamp on the ward sisters table and hensley was not snoring the sleep was deeper drugged one hand was curled into a fist as if it had been clenched as hensley drifted into unconsciousness after a moment rutledge turned and walked back the way hed come the sister at the table said quietly you look very tired inspector i hope you dont have far to go tonight thank you no she wasnt the plump nurse who had been angry with him on his first visit a much younger woman with kind eyes and a pleasant smile a face it would be nice to wake up to in the morning if you were ill or in pain and even as he thought it he realized how tired he actually was by the time he reached hensleys house in dudlington closer to dawn than to midnight he felt bone weary still he walked through the rooms torch in hand and searched them carefully in one corner of his mind hed half expected to find the shell casing that hed left in chelsea sitting somewhere here waiting for him the cold rain had given way to colder sunshine and rutledge felt the stiffness in his body that came from heavy sleep in a room without a fire hamish apparently already awake said sourly the oaks would be mair comfortable thats very likely rutledge swung his feet out of bed and looked at the clock hed missed his breakfast mrs melford would be furious with him for missing his meals yesterday as well just then he heard her calling to him from the foot of his stairs and remembered that there was no key to the house door inspector your eggs are growing cold and i shant keep them warm more than five minutes longer the outer door slammed and rutledge went to fetch his shaving gear in the event he was a good seven minutes late and mrs melford glared at him as he came into her dining room but she brought his breakfast and he found he was hungry any news of the constable she asked as if assuming his absence had been spent in northampton resting she went to fetch a rack of toast and set it before him with a pot of marmalade are you any closer to finding whoever it was shot him not yet yes well wed all expected the yard to be more efficient the yard he answered her shortly works with information apparently in dudlington theres none to be had she disappeared again and came back with warmed milk he found himself thinking how different mornings had been in westmorland where the kitchen had seemed an oasis of warmth and brightness had it been love hed felt there three weeks agoor only his loneliness responding to something rare unforced companionship hed probably never know the answer to that now and he must learn not to wish for more than a brief friendship the letter from elizabeth fraser had been clear dont come backhamish was restless urging him to finish his meal and leave the past where it could do no harm ye canna marry anyone its no wise mrs melford was saying everyone in dudlington has been wondering why it was you interviewed grace letteridge he came back to the present with a jolt do you suspect her of complicity in hensleys attack he countered her mouth tightened really inspector miss letteridge had spent some time in london in the early years of the war i spoke to her about that disappointed she said shed been a good friend to emma we were wondering if that had anything to do with your visit so soon after youd spoken with mrs ellison you knew emma mason then everyone did inspector she was a bright pretty sweetnatured girl what does dudlington think happened to her shes buried somewhere in friths wood thats what they say although the wood was searched and there was no overturned ground or other evidence of digging still whoever it was could have waited until after the search to put her into the ground she added ghoulishly he thought about the empty rooms in hensleys house and how easy it would be to leave a body there until it could be moved hamish reminded him of the unlocked door thats true but no one appears to go beyond the parlor more to the point hensley is caesars wifea policeman and above suspicion he answered silently and then aloud he asked id have thought her grandmother would have contacted emmas mother to ask if emma was there poor woman she doesnt know where her daughter is she wont admit that you know but miss arundel our postmistress says that letters have come back marked unknown for years now which means emma could indeed be in london with her mother and mrs mason doesnt intend to send her back to dudlington mrs melford frowned i suppose thats true but her tone of voice indicated that she was far from believing it was he finished his tea and rose to leave thank you for waiting for me this morning it wont happen again without acknowledging his apology she turned and went back to her kitchen he found his account on the table by the stairs and paid it rutledge walked down church street to the far end beyond the rectory stood the barn from which ted baylor had heard his dog barking baylor was a younger man than rutledge had expected dressed in muddy boots dark corduroy trousers and a heavy coat that emphasized the width of his shoulders he stopped stockstill as the man from london came down the stone flagged passage between the milking stalls where cows were lined up headin their rumps steaming in the cold air mr baylor good morning rutledge said ive been told it was your dog that alerted you to trouble in friths wood the day that constable hensley was shot baylor regarded him warily it was had you noticed anything else unusual that day crows taking flight across the field for example or other signs that there might be something going on never saw the crows he answered perhaps the dog had and thats what started the barking pity you cant ask him baylor retorted does he bark at the wood from time to time scenting rabbits not much of anything lives in friths wood what about your wifeor children i have no wifenor any children my half brother lives with me and he doesnt tend the cattle id like to ask him all the same baylor shrugged he wont see you now i have work to do not just yet rutledge replied briskly what did you see when you went into the wood i saw nothing but trees and i didnt much like that i was about to leave when the dog started rooting around and it was then i saw a foot showing from behind a bush went around to the other side of the bush and there was the constable facedown in the leaves white as a sheet and cold into the bargain had he been moved do you think from where hed been shot i didnt notice but there were scuff marks as if hed dragged himself a bit signs lost rutledge thought to himself when the men came in to rescue hensley did you point these marks out to anyone else no why should i have done hed lain there for two hours or more it was natural hed tried to help himself you work with cattle could you have lifted hensley and carried him some distance look here i never touched him im sure you didnt my question was could you have carried him to safety out of the woods if youd had to i very much doubt it not with that arrow in his back it was obscene him lying there cold as a fish and an arrow jutting from him for all the world as if red indians had been at him id not have touched him without the doctor asking me to try besides once id told the doctor to come right away i fetched a hurdle from the barn and took it back with me and some others heard me shouting and came to help he slapped the flank of a cow moving her over a little and added bad enough when dr middleton had us hold hensley firmly while he broke the shaft well above the wound youd have thought hed done it all his life he was so clever at it hensley never moved his voice was admiring not something you see every day not even in the war how do you explain someone using a bow and arrow in friths wood i dont that wood is not like any other ive ever seen if i were a drinking man id swear the place is full of god knows what and hensley was a fool to tempt whatever it is lives in there was he looking for emma masons grave a change in expression crossed baylors face the whispers say shes buried in there i was in france i dont know the truth of it but in my view theres no one whod have gone in there to dig a grave in the first place theres no telling what might have come to light hensley went there at least once the constable comes from london what does he know about friths wood i saw you going in there walking about what did you think of it hamish said its a challenge rutledge was on the point of quoting hamlet that there were more things in between heaven and earth than were dreamt of in most philosophies instead he replied i dont know that id like living so near to it as you do the cows wont go near it even when theyre in the pastures closest to it not for shade in summer or protection from the weather when it rains but im safe enough here he turned and looked in the direction of his house even though he couldnt see it from inside the barn why do you think the dog barked he heard the constable groaning very likely hes trained to work the animals hed have paid heed to it rutledge thanked him and left hamish said a stiff man and honest enough but with something worrying him all the same the half brother perhaps rutledge answered he stopped at the kitchen door and knocked but no one came to the door or to any of the windows overlooking the back garden and the sheds he made himself a note to ask about the elusive half brother if mrs melford wouldnt tell him dr middleton might walking back to holly street rutledge decided to stop in the shops on whitby lane and found himself in the greengrocers stepping over a basket of apples from the south he remembered the wizened sour ones that were good only for jelly in the lake district where the growing season was so much shorter the sign over the door had read freebold and son and rutledge nodded to the man standing behind the cabbages mr freebold or son son my father and grandfather god rest them have gone on to their just rewards he responded affably how may i serve you sir turning his back on the two or three women in the shop rutledge introduced himself and said im interested in friths wood everyone tells me it isnt a safe place to go and yet constable hensley appears to have gone there of his own free will im trying to find someone in dudling ton who might have seen him walk that way ive not heard of anyone freebold answered glancing over rutledges shoulder at the women in his shop apparently they had shaken their heads for freebold turned back to rutledge and said someone did say early on that he was seen leaving for letherington that day on his bicycle yes he was a great one for the bicycle freebold patted his own girth and added my days on two wheels are long vanished right enough behind him rutledge could hear one of the women titter then what became of the bicycle do you think im told no one found it there in the wood which isnt to say he didnt come home and go out again he wasnt what youd call overworked here in dudlington hed take an hour or so and pay a visit to the three horses in letherington if he found that inspector cain wasnt about he was something fond of the three horses why not stop at the oaks i expect constable hensley and frank keating didnt see eye to eye freebold answered with some reluctance youd best ask keating about that rutledge thanked him and left half an hour later he was walking into the three horses in letherington it was a sizeable village with two churches to dudlingtons one and three pubs the three horses was the oldest with a smoky interior and old oak walls set with horseracing memorabilia the owner it transpired had once been a jockey rode three winners he said to rutledge pride in his eyes derby winners at that josh morgan is the name he was a small wiry man with a large head and lively gray eyes rutledge asked for a pint and when it was brought engaged morgan in conversation about his winners and then asked i understand constable hensley came here when he was in letherington oh yes we were blessed often enough with his company a quiet man except when he got to talking about london then he could go on for an hour without repeating himself much of a ladies man he would chat up whoever was in the saloon but it was more in aid of his own view of himself he never gave themor meany trouble i will say that for constable hensley youve heard about the arrow in his back inspector cain was telling us what happened im glad to hear the constable survived nasty piece of business but then im told friths wood isnt a place to meddle with ive never been there you understand im not what you might call superstitious except perhaps on race day but i believe in leaving well enough alone had he been in letherington that day i hear he sometimes stops in at the three horses when he knows inspector cain isnt likely to find him taking his time getting back to dudlington he didnt show himself here morgan answered shaking his head and that would be unlike him always one for the road hed say not a drinking man mind you he added hastily but hed have a pint sometimes two before heading back ale was his choice the darker the better and he could carry what he drank no harm done what did he talk about as a rule racing he was a football man as well and he hated manchester with a passion nearly came to blows over that one once when we had a manchester man in the bar lorry driver he was big as a house morgan grinned i was on my knees praying thered be no brawl they could have wrecked half the bar between them but constable hens ley said he must get home to the missus and he left i offered manchester a drink on the house to see him on his way just to prevent the two from meeting on the road somewhere i didnt think hensley was married rutledge commented the house in dudlington was empty was there a wife hidden away somewhere else morgan laughed again theres a woman who nags him if hes late for his dinner he always said it was as good as being married but without the fuss barbara melford then she would be furious to learn she was being described as hensleys missus do you think hensley was afraid of someone or worried about being followed he never said as much to me of course its possible he was a policeman wasnt he theyre after telling everyone what to do if we get out of line hensley was no exception it wouldnt endear him to everyone no one else at the pub was helpful although they appeared to be concerned about hensleys condition and wished him well a far cry from the attitude just a few miles away in dudlington on his way back to the motorcar rutledge heard hamish say as clearly as if he had followed at rutledges heels the bicycle was hidden in the field but he didna ride it this far which means rutledge answered he either changed his mind about coming to letherington or was waylaid before he could get here its verra likely hamish said that he lied about where he was going and someone caught him in the wood he willna tell ye that a motorcycle roared past as rutledge cranked his engine into life he watched it out of sight then said thoughtfully thats an easy way to get about if i had distance to cover aye but where do you hide it its no like a bicycle shoved into the weeds but rutledge was searching his memory for the sound of a motorcycle near beachy head or on the road to hertford and drew a blank aye but if yon laddy tommy crowell was right the shooter is dead hamish told him his voice a taunt once again his luncheon was waiting for him on the sideboard in the dining room covered by a serviette embroidered with mrs melfords initials sandwiches with ham and a very good cheese there were pickles in a dish and sliced apples looking very much like those hed seen that morning at the greengrocers rutledge sat down in the silence of the house wondering if mrs melford was at home and avoiding him or if she had gone out he was halfway through his second sandwich when there was a knock at the house door rutledge hesitated unwilling to answer it if barbara melford was not at home then it opened and a male voice called barbara are you in there the man came into the hall and then as far as the dining room on his way to the kitchen and almost fell over his own feet when he saw rutledge it was ted baylor his boots cleaned and his trousers changed his hair freshly brushed good afternoon rutledge said concealing a smile baylor was completely disconcerted uncertain at first what to say like a suitor stumbling over his rival i didnt know you were invited to lunch here he finally blurted out hamish said yons a verra possessive man choosing his words carefully rutledge answered mrs melford was kind enough to offer to prepare my meals im staying in hensleys house and his kitchen leaves much to be desired is she here then baylor looked around the room as if half expecting her to be hiding behind the furniture i havent seen her if youd care to wait for an instant he stood there debating his choices the hell with it then baylor said finally and turned on his heel the front door slammed hamish commented dryly he willna screw his courage up to come again rutledge answered you may be right i dont think ill tell her she missed baylor he finished his sandwich and the apples then took the empty plates and his cup into the kitchen it was his turn to stop on the threshold in surprise mrs melford was sitting at her own kitchen table her face in her hands crying im sorry he began uncertain now what to do with the dishes she looked up at him why couldnt you stay in the dining room where you belonged her voice was bitter and accusing as if hed come into the kitchen on purpose with malicious intent to embarrass her i thought youd gone out he set the dishes by the sink and turned to go is there anything i can do he asked concerned for her no yes you can go away and leave me alone when youve assured me that youre all right she took a deep breath and found a tea towel to wipe away her tears its nothing or at least nothing you can repair worst luck you ken she heard the mans voice but you were there in the way and he wouldna go on to the kitchen rutledge disagreed there was more to her distress than a missed rendezvous she could have come through from the kitchen and taken baylor into the parlor out of earshot he felt helpless uncertain whether it was best to leave her to cry or to try to comfort her because there was anger mixed with her tears he decided he ought to go after a brief hesitation he walked to the door and reached out to push it open she said at his back sometimes i dont understand how a man can tell you he loves you more than life itself and then can walk away leaving you to believe hes a liar without turning he stood there facing the door and said had he made promises he wrote to me during the war he said if he lived he wanted to marry me id lost my husband only a year after our wedding in ted and i had known each other since we were children and i cared for him i told him id be here waiting when he came home and he was one of the fortunate ones he survived the day he came back to dudlington i was twenty again as excited as a girl you cant imagine how i felt he went past the house without a glance i saw him and he shut himself up in that farm of his and never said a word to me then or later i could hardly knock at his door and ask him why i had my pride why did he come here today after all this time god knows i dont oh weve met beforethis village is too small to avoid running into each other at st lukes or in the shops we nod without speaking i have my pride she repeated through clenched teeth i wont let him see that it matters and its too late to make amends what i might have felt for him is gone her voice broke again on the last word rutledge stood there waiting but shed said all she needed to say he pushed open the door and left her in the kitchen when he came to the house for his evening meal he expected to find the door locked but it was open and his food was ready for him on the sideboard mrs melford didnt put in an appearance then or at breakfast the post brought rutledge a package the next morning the handwriting was unfamiliar but graceful inspector ian rutledge dudlington northants there was no return address he opened the small box and inside folded in a sheet of paper was the cartridge case hed inadvertently left at mrs channings the sheet of paper was a note i asked miss rutledge for your present direction and she has found it for me you hadforgotten to take this with you when you left and i dislike having it in my house i dont know why its merely a metal casing but the more i look at it the more uncomfortable i feel theres something evil about it in a way id have liked to bury it in the dustbin and be rid of it however it isnt mine to dispose of and so i return it he could hear her low pleasant voice in the words as he read them and for a moment he could see her sitting at the little walnut desk in her drawing room writing the letter it was such a vital image that he was surprised he laid the letter aside and looked again at the case once more he asked himself if the shot on the road to hertford had been meant to kill him or only to frighten him hamish said if it was to kill why leave the three casings in the hedgerow because rutledge thought he came prepared for either eventuality which said that he hadnt really cared how it had turned out he had just folded the letter and put the shell case in his pocket when there was a timid knock at the door and a young woman stood on the threshold poised to back away he put her age down as sixteen come in rutledge said giving her his name and moving around the desk to the far side to leave the room to her she stepped shyly into the office looking around as she introduced herself as martha simpson he thought shes never been in hensleys house before please he pointed to the chair across from the desk im so sorry to disturb you but ive overheard my mother tell a friend that youd been asking questions about emma what had the rector said about gossip yes thats true did you know her she glanced at the other chair as if uncertain whether she ought to sit or remain standing i went to school with her we werent the best of friendsher grandmother didnt approve of me why on earth would you believe that he asked trying to put her at her ease you seem perfectly respectable to me she laughed im the bakers daughter you see not grand enough for mrs ellison but i rather liked emma and ive been very worried about her i wondered if youd had news of her i couldnt ask her grandmother directly i was always afraid id be told to mind my own business sadly no i havent anything new to tell you i asked questions for the simple reason that constable hensley had put down very little about her disappearance in his files it seemed strange given the fact that it was possible that murder had been done martha winced at the word id not like to think of anything awful happening to her she appeared to have conquered her initial shyness and finally sat down in the chair across from him she was talented like her mother she went on earnestly ive seen some of the watercolors belonging to grace letteridge emma could draw nearly as well she did a portrait of me once in pastels i still have it its framed in my room was emma a good student she was very bright yes i rather admired that im hopeless at mathematics and she often helped me when i couldnt see how to do a problem we sometimes studied together at graces house after tea i looked forward to it she never made me feel young and useless and then with an unexpected maturity that came welling up as her confidence increased she added id always believed that emma went to find her mother in spite of all the rumors to the contrary dudlington is a backwater with nothing to offer a girl like emma there isnt an unmarried man here that her grandmother would have considered worthy of her she wrote to her mother from time to time you know and the letters were returned unopened but we always suspected grace and i that her mother felt emma was far too young to come to london then she needed to finish her schooling and grow up thats understandable since mrs mason had brought her here for that purpose in the first place you saw these returned letters do you by any chance know mrs masons direction no mrs ellison always burned them angry with her daughter for treating emma so shabbily my mother often said it was shameful the way beatrice mason ignored her own flesh and blood shed known beatrice and she said shed never expected her to turn out to be such a snob she smiled deprecatingly in defense of her mother but then you must have seen mrs masons exhibitions in london she must be quite famous by now he not only hadnt seen them he had never heard of an artist by that name but then beatrice mason was rather staid for a painter hoping to take london by storm frances would know who she was or who she pretended to be but hamish was taking a different tack if she wasna sae successful as that mayhap she didna care for her mither or the daughter to know the truth i understand miss letteridge spent nearly two years in london at the start of the war did she look up emmas mother while she was there martha simpson had risen ive asked her that she said she saw no point in it since mrs mason had never shown any desire to hear from emma he wondered if grace letteridge had lied for emmas sake standing now he asked casually as if it wasnt important id have thought at seventeen emma might have given her heart to someone here and lost interest in london altogether it happens she bit her lip as if misleading him came hard to her i dont know anything about that inspector the denial had come too quickly she added emma never confided in me but you knew her you might haveer guessed where her affections lay martha shook her head vehemently no there was no one she cared for she went to london ill always believe that he pressed her if shes not with her mother and not with a man she fell in love with then what is the alternative she was too young to marry without her grandmothers permission and she wouldnt have gone away with anyone no matter how she felt about himshed been brought up to respect her grandmother emma wouldnt have caused her such shame he could imagine how the wives of the baker and the greengrocer and the butcher would have relished that sort of scandal and taken pleasure in rubbing mrs ellisons nose in her disgrace he had to agree with martha there its possible that emma hoped her mother would give her the necessary permission no somehow i cant believeshed have come back if that were true she was agitated as if hed accused emma of being immoral after a moment she added ive made a mistake in coming here id hoped for news constable hensley wouldnt answer me either its frustrating when everyone believes youre too young to know the truth but please dont tell my parents i was foolish enough to come here alone theyll be angry with me im sorry and she was out the door without looking back he called to her but it was too late restless he went for a walk to clear his head he went as far as the oaks and then turned right cutting across the wide sweep of fields that ran down to the little stream where trees marked its winding path through the pastures behind dudlington the wind caught up with him as soon as he was out of the shelter of the village and he could feel the cold penetrating his coat and touching his skin with icy fingers no wonder the village turned its back on the fields however picturesque they might seemthey faced west and the prevailing winds met no resistance on this open land until it reached the stone and mortar of mans huddled world he turned and looked back the sky was a leaden bowl overhead and the fields were a withered brown dudlington looked small and insignificant from here constable would have found very little of interest to paint on these highlands even if the cattle in the barns were put out to graze from here he thought he could see the backs of brown sheep in the pastures across the main road they were the color of dark rich gravy and their winter coats were thick and heavy the fell sheep in westmorland had been white under their blanket of snow he wondered what theyd make of these tamer surroundings protected and cosseted by lake district standards it was he thought a measure of the will to survive that living things learned to cope then why had ted baylor chosen today of all days to try to mend barbara melfords broken heart what had changed in his circumstances or hers or had he come for an entirely different reason love or an attempt to survive baylor had been the first to find constable hensley lying there cold enough to be counted as dead suddenly without warning rutledge felt vulnerable as if standing here he made a perfect target for anyone hunting him there was nothing to explain the sensation only a sixth sense honed in war the small windows of the houses he could see from here were blank closed against the wind and from the long barns that held cattle well out of the village itself it was a very difficult shot even if someone lay concealed behind the sheep it would take a rifle to hit him at that distance still he stood there searching the land all around him turning slowly it was empty he would have sworn it was empty but so was the headland in kent and the upper pasture in hertford something caught his eye as he looked at the taller building sitting at the crossroads he could have sworn he saw someone at a window of the inn a slight movement hamish said yere imagining trouble where theres none youll be as dead as i am if im wrong rutledge answered tersely the wind snatching the words out of his mouth aye im no ready to die you willna fail me a second time but rutledge was already walking briskly toward the oaks his mind busy his eyes no longer scanning the fields that seemed to stretch empty and forever around him he didnt care to be stalked it was something that gnawed at the back of ones thoughts always there will it be here or will it be not at all and he found himself clenching his teeth with the sense of walking once more into heavy fire as hed done so many countless times in france i was in the war he told himself and whoever it is hasnt counted on that if the germans couldnt kill him by god it wasnt going to be some coward lurkinghe stopped short hamish said the dead soldier dead but without a gravestone in the churchyard yes rutledge said slowly already moving again only he wasnt dead after all hed disguised himself somehow but tommy crowell wouldnt have known that hed have walked up to whatever it was he saw to satisfy his curiosity and the hunter not wanting to risk shooting the boy had frightened him instead it wouldna hae taken much to frighten him hamish answered the lad wouldna understand and if someone had heard him talking about a dead soldier lying in mrs massinghams grounds hed have been laughed at made fun of he was halfway to the oaks now his strides long and angry someone came out of the inn walked over to a motorcar and drove away disappearing up the main road to the north by the time rutledge reached the entrance of the oaks he was out of breath hed run the last hundred yards swearing to himself as he went keating he called striding into the bar there was no one there and he crossed to the door of the saloon and stepped in the fire hadnt been lit and the darkpaneled room was cold shadowed for an instant he thought he saw someone by the window and realized that it was a long portrait of a man in riding dress standing in a leafy glade his face turned toward a distant view that only he could see shutting the door again rutledge went down the passage to the kitchen and startled hillary timmons into dropping a spoon she was drying oh you did give me a start sir she exclaimed her hands going to her breast as if afraid he was about to attack her he realized his anger and frustration must be visible in his face striving to control both he said im sorry miss timmons i was looking for mr keating i cant think where he might be she answered still tense but were closed sir he mayve stepped out for a bit there was a motorcar just leaving do you know who the person was driving i dont know sir i wasnt serving in the bar today wed only a handful of people there and mr keating said hed see to them himself damn she jumped again and he apologized tell keating im looking for him ill expect him to come to hensleys house as soon as he returns hehe doesnt take lightly to orders sir well then you can tell him that if he doesnt come to me ill come after him and drag him there myself and with that rutledge turned on his heel left the door to the kitchen swinging wildly and walked out of the inn by the time hed reached the house where he was staying some of his anger had cooled but he felt that he was on the track of answers now certain that keating wouldnt be on his heels rutledge went into the bakery to find the postmistress a warm wave of yeast and cinnamon and rising bread greeted him as he stepped inside the door the trays of baked goods displayed in a counter were already well picked over as if the bakers shop had done a brisk business in scones and poppy seed cakes and dinner rolls there was a woman behind the counter who was so much like martha simpson that he assumed she was the girls mother her face was pink with the warmth of the shop and her apron was dusty with flour he nodded to her and walked on to the tiny cage in one corner that served as the post office mrs arundel a rangy woman of about thirty was sitting on her stool counting coins into a tin she looked up as rutledge came up to the cage and smiled at him inspector rutledge she acknowledged what can i do for you she had tucked the coins out of sight and was reaching for a large book of stamps as if prepared to send a letter for him you found your little box from london did you i asked ben lassiter to drop it by constable hensleys house on his way home yes thank you i wonder he began lowering his voice as mrs simpson listened unashamedly to the conversation if you can recall sending letters to london for emma mason or her grandmother im trying to locate emmas mother indeed she peered at him i do remember the letters going out with the post but they were returned for want of a proper address how often did you see these letters oh not ofteni expect one or two a year at most it was sad you know emma would come in with them such hope in her face and i took it personally when the letters came back as if i were responsible for misdirecting them she shook her head very sad how long have you been postmistress here since august when my husband went to northampton to enlist he didnt come home though hed promised he would if i let him go im sorry it was a waste she said such a waste we lost ten young men from dudlington and theyre our dead weve got seven more trying to cope with severe wounds another shot himself rather than live with both legs gone she cleared her throat as if the memories were too fresh yes well letters to and from beatrice mason i remember her you know such a pretty girl and so talented i wished her well when she went off to london and i always believed that mrs ellison was too hard on her giving her an ultimatum so to speak go and i shant take you back thats what beatrice told my older sister its a choice she said i must make a choice i cant imagine a mother being so harsh to her only child but its brought bitter fruit in its wake hasnt it why was mrs ellison so adamant about beatrice leaving was it money no mrs ellison is a stickler for the proprieties i think and the idea of her daughter hobnobbing with bohemian artists and naked models was more than she could bear nice girls didnt concern themselves with all that mrs simpson spoke breaking into the conversation beatrice was like her father he would have taken her to london himself if hed been alive to show her what sort of life she could expect there and prove to her that it wasnt the lovely adventure shed dreamed it would be her mother just put her foot down and for beatrice that was nothing short of the red flag in front of the bull rutledge turned so that he could see both women what was mason like the man beatrice married did mrs ellison approve of him i doubt she ever met him mrs simpson commented he was dead by the time emma was three or four thats when beatrice brought her home to be cared for by her grandmother i dont think he had any desire to come to dudlington to tell you the truth beatrice had probably told him what a witch her mother was what did he do for a living do you know another artist very likely mrs arundel said i never heard other than that he was poor as a church mouse and left poor beatrice nothing with which to feed herself or the baby mrs ellison told you that lord no mrs simpson laughed we got it from the woman that did for her sometimes betsy timmons i wouldnt put it past her to listen at keyholes the shop door opened and a woman came in with two small children mrs simpson turned away to greet her mrs arundel said in a voice that wouldnt carry i was told that mr mason came from a very good family that had cut him off much as mrs ellison had cut beatrice off while he was alive selling his work they lived rather well but after he died there was no one to bring in such grand sums of money who told you that i believe it was grace letteridge who got it from emma most likely hamish said sourly aye the grannys fairy tale to save her daughters good name it would rutledge thought be just like mrs ellison to put as good a face on her familys trials as she could the door opened again and a man stepped in breathless and anxious his eyes sweeping the shop and lighting on rutledge im looking for inspector rutledge im rutledge whats happened dr middleton sent me to find you the rectors had a terrible fall hedr middletonsays it would be best if you come at once with a nod to the postmistress rutledge was out the door on the messengers heels whats happened to mr towson he was in the attic searching for something he shouldnt have gone up there by himself the stairs are small he missed his step and fell hard on his hip dr middleton thinks its broken who are you rutledge asked as they hurried down whitby lane and turned into church street i dont believe weve met my name is ben staley farmer it was my wagon that carried constable hensley to northampton at the rectory there were four or five men milling about in the parlor their muddy boots tracking up the wood floors rutledge recognized ted baylor among them and asked wheres middleton baylor jerked his head toward the stairs and rutledge went up them fast the passage that led to the bedchambers was dark the doors shut hamish was saying which one but farther along the passage to his left rutledge could see light pouring from an open door and he turned in that direction it was as he thought the door to the narrow uncarpeted stairs leading up to the attics lying sprawled across the landing between the two flights was the rector his face twisted in pain dr middleton was busy examining him with some care trying to determine the extent of his injuries without doing further damage hamish said its a wonder hes no dead middleton looked up as rutledge arrived and said in a low voice i sent for you because theres something of a mystery about his fall here take this he passed a bottle of laudanum to rutledge and added i dont want to give him anything until i know whether the hip is broken bruised or dislocated his hands went on gently exploring the rectors body rutledge took the bottle shall i fetch a glass and a little water no stay here and fend off the men below i dont want them upsetting him the rector seemed halfconscious his eyes sometimes rolling back in his head who found him it was hillary timmons she comes to clean for him in the afternoon while the pub is closed she heard something thought it was an animal in pain and went to look when she found the rector she was terrified out of her wits and went screaming next door to ted baylor fortunately he was in his barn and he came at once for me it was hillary who told everyone else i sent her home with bob johnson with a powder to calm her he had spoken to hillary timmons at the oaks i saw her not half an hour ago how long has towson been lying here no way of telling except that the bruises are already showing up on his arms and his cheek there he might have been here for an hour or more the doctor rocked back on his heels sighing well i dont think that hips broken thank god just badly bruised with his rheumatism using crutches would be difficult but look at his arm see the knot just there it could mean a fracture time will tell how are we going to move him from here without hurting him appallingly thats where the laudanum comes in baylor was all for a stiff whiskey but thats the worst possible solution to shock well ease him a little and then find something to use to shift him to a bed you said there was something wrong with the way hed fallen not so much that he was awake for a few minutes when i got here he said hed been in the attic searching for something he couldnt recall what and someone came to the stairs and called him to come quickly thered been an accident old fool turned hurried down the steps and missed his footing who was it thats the problem rutledge there was no one here when hillary came to clean youd have thought with all the noise of the fall whoever had been standing in the passage there calling up for him to come at once would have looked to see if towson was alive or dead when towson was quieter and in less discomfort the men in the hall below took a leaf from the long dining room tablefit for a clergymans large familyand brought it to the attic stairs middleton sent rutledge through the bedchambers to collect blankets to pad it then between them they lifted the rector onto the improvised stretcher and carried him to his own bed he lay there white as his shirt groaning in pain middleton sent the men about their business with instructions to put the table back together before they left and drew a chair up to the bedside after a moment he said to rutledge that arms fractured now i can feel the bones scraping together but it isnt compound and i can brace it that knot on his headhe parted the white hair to point out a large lumpmay mean hes concussed worst luck ill have to ask someone to sit with him and im still worried about that hip it will keep him in bed for a bit why it didnt break is a mystery unless that arm took the brunt of his fall very likely rutledge agreed hamish was busy asking who would want to kill the rector and supplying his own answers to the question rut ledge ignored him until a word caught his attention the attic windows ye ken they look out toward yon wood can you spare me a moment rutledge asked id like to have a look at those stairs again first help me get him out of those trousers while we can it will take the two of us they removed the rectors black shoes and stockings and then gently persuaded his trousers to peel away without lifting his body more than was necessary middleton got him under the blankets wrapped him well against shock and then began to unbutton towsons shirt rutledge was surprised at how light the man was towson had seemed very vibrant and active despite his rheumatism aye and the fall should ha kilt him hamish reminded rutledge again free at length to go back to the stairs rutledge examined them the edges of the risers were worn and the steps were steep narrow and not well lighted it would be easy for a man to come down too quickly and fall he went on to the top of the steps and saw that the attic was fairly empty some luggage a trunk and a few oddments of furniture hardly filling the vast space two rooms had been built in here for servants one to the east and one to the west they had windows as did the central room rutledge pushed aside the iron bedsteads under the casements and stood there looking out to the west he could see the long sweep of pasture the line of the stream and in the far far distance the tower of another church barely visible the next village hamish pointed out the east window looked out on the barns at the baylor farm he could see them clearly and the kitchen door the windows on this side of the house and the chimney but from the central room the windows a pair of them looked out toward friths wood only the treetops were visible and the bend of the main road as it turned toward letherington and he could see the fields beyond the wood rolling down to it if there was movement in the wooda man in a dark coat for instancehe thought perhaps he could follow it to some extent it would have to be tested to be sure but it was certainly a possibility hamish made the connection nearly as quickly as he had if yon wood is sae clearly visible from here i expect it can be seen from the house next door did you see that yon upper floor is a bit higher still rutledge went back to the east servants room and looked again hamish had been right the baylor house while not precisely turned toward the wood must have windows that looked out on it just as the rectory did it was an interesting point but whether it would prove useful was another matter the question now was who had come to the stairs and called to the rector rutledge sat with towson for another hour spelling dr middleton who had gone to his surgery for splints the rector did wake up for a brief period amazed to find himself in his bed and hurting all through his body as he put it rutledge said dont you recall falling down the attic stairs towson frowned was i in the attic i seldom go there today you were and someone called to you telling you that you were needed directly towson lifted his good hand to his forehead as if to find the memory there somewhere within reach but whatever he had told middleton in the first few moments after the doctor had arrived he had no recollection of it now after dr middleton had found someone to sit with towsongrace letteridge as it happenedrutledge was free to return to hensleys house and he walked into the parlor office feeling depressed hamish said you ken its likely hell remember when hes slept but dr middleton had not been very sanguine well who knows it was a shock that fall and he lay there afterward unable to call for help it would have been trying for a younger man still he told you when you got there what had happened yes well i was salvation arriving on a white steed hillary is a sweet girl but shes not reliable in an emergency i was and he must have held on hoping for someone sensible enough to talk to then he could let it go middleton had offered rutledge a sherry dug out of towsons private store in the study before he left the rectory god knows i need it and you might as well have the benefit of it too rutledge didnt argue and it was good sherry at that why should someone call to him tell him to make hasteand then walk away when he fell it makes no sense middleton asked sitting down in the best chair and stretching his feet out before him unless of course hed had some sort of seizure and only imagined hed been called thats possible too you know but rutledge striding up church street couldnt afford to ignore the alternatives no policeman would rutledge taking the chair behind hensleys desk found himself thinking aloud out of long habit two incidents of this magnitude in one village in a matter of a single week the question is are they connected or only a coincidence hamish said mysel id ask why sae close together and that was a point to be considered why had this quiet little village suddenly erupted into violence unless hensley had found something in that bloody wood but if he had hed held his tongue even in hospital why had it been selfincriminating that was possible but even if the rector had fallen through his own carelessness hensley hadnt shot that arrow into his own back which still brought in a third party into the picture if keating had come to the house in his absence rutledge found no sign of it he debated going back to the inn but it would be a wildgoose chase keating was no josh morgan of the three horses glad to stand and gossip with his custom short of searching the building there would be no way of flushing him out if he didnt want to be found had keating played any role in what was happening in dudlington he appeared to hold himself aloof from the other inhabitants except for hillary timmonss services as a barmaid and cleaning woman and there hed chosen wellmiss timmons was a mouse terrified of lions and he could probably count on her to keep her mouth shut what were the mans secrets most people had one or two hamish said aye and youve kept yours but would ye keep it here where theres no sae much else to do but gossip there had been a few times dealing with perceptive people when hed feared his would slip out they had stood on the brink of discovery and yet hed managed somehow to forestall them set apart from the village as he was the owner of the oaks just might succeed as well hamish warned you mustna have anything to do with yon woman in london she worked wi casualties in france shed ha seen and heard more than most and mrs channing had remembered him very clearly he couldnt picture her hiding in hedgerows to shoot at him it needna be her but someone she put up to it hamish reminded him circle upon circles as for keating it would probably prove to be more useful to confront him while he was working in the pub with his patrons looking on he wouldnt find it as easy to walk away then for the presentfor the present it might be useful to speak to hensley again he ought to be out of the woods and therefore awake for longer periods traffic was heavier than hed expected on the road south to northampton and rutledge found himself walking into the hospital just as dinner was being served he thought of his own on the sideboard at mrs melfords he was once more cornered by the plump sister who disapproved of interrupting a patients meal and he said shall i have chief inspector kelmore to speak to matron it was a threat that worked he went down the line of beds some of them empty now others filled with what appeared to be new cases hensley was sitting awkwardly propped against half a dozen pillows and he was trying to feed himself with his left hand from the state of the towel under his chin it wasnt going well he looked up at rutledge a sour expression passing across his face it had more color now but there were still lines of pain around his mouth what is it now sir he asked rutledge took the mans knife and fork and cut up his meat into manageable bits then drew up a chair there are more questions than answers in dudlington inspector cain cant help me and the man you replaced constable markham has retired to sussex its your turn what questions hensley asked warily trying to appear unconcerned and failing rutledge found himself thinking that a man in bed with his dinner down his front has no dignity he said mr towson the rector fell down his attic stairs today someone had come to the door and called to him to come at onceand then went away he couldnt have missed the sound of towson tumbling down the steps or crying out in pain yet he went away towsons dead hensley demanded appalled his fork had stopped halfway to his lips good god rutledge left it instead he said i think its time you told me what took you to friths wood the day you were shot as gods my witness i didnt go there i was on the road on my way to letherington and thats the last i remember the words had become rote now that you were on the road is true enoughive found your bicycle where you left it behind the pasture wall i didnt leave it anywhere whoever shot me and dragged me to the wood he put it there hensley you were lucky to live towson was lucky to survive his fall how many more people are going to be hurt so that you can deny being in friths wood i looked for myself from the attic windows at the rectory theres the best view of the wood short of climbing the church steeple towson survived hensley was quick his mind already leaping ahead why are you here then why not ask him who it was called to him on the steps if you werent tied to this bed rutledge retorted shortly id have suspected you me only someone in that attic could have seen you walk of your own accord into that blasted wood hensley stared at him a stubborn set to his chin well theyd be lying i never went there changing direction rutledge asked tell me about the fire at barstows offices in the city hensley nearly choked on his tea whats that in aid of you can ask old bowels i had nothing to do with barstow theres someone who tells a different story that you looked the other way the night of the fire then theyd be a liar he swore nearly upsetting his tray sister he shouted but she was busy at the other end of the ward and didnt turn tell me what became of emma mason and why you watched her with your field glasses while she was in her bedroom his fingers kneaded the piece of bread in his hand you cant prove it hensley told him belligerently she was what seventeen at the time she was no innocent lily i can tell you that hensley snapped glaring at rutledge now half the village thinks her a saint the others wont open their mouths because mrs ellison rules the roost but just ask constable markham hell tell you he saw our pure miss emma rolling in the grass behind the church with miss let teridges fiance and she wasnt seventeen then it was rutledges turn to stare at hensley hamish said hes telling the truth it was all too apparent that hamish was right hensleys eyes were blazing with fury and there was no uneasy prevarication in the words hed spat at the man from london it does you no good to blacken her character blacken it hardly that reveal it more like was she promiscuous she wasnt having any of me or anyone else but there was no doubt that constable markham was right it explained why miss letteridge left for london just afterward and the man who is he thats not your business besides hes buried in the churchyard thats why miss letteridge came back on their way out of northampton on the road north hamish said i willna believe she murdered the girl rutledge avoiding a milk wagon and gearing up to pass a lorry said grace letteridge at least it gives her a motive then why did she no rid herself of the girl before leaving for london hamish was right he thought jealousy was a hot blooded crime impetuous and filled with anger her hands may have been tied then she might have been afraid to touch emma for fear the man would guess shed been responsible and reject her a second time but when he was killed she was free to come home and balance the scales anger and blame are a part of grieving hamish wasnt convinced ye ken she could ha traveled to london to make it right wi him before he went to france and shed gone as soon as her father died her father might not have approved of her following any man on such a slim hope but then there would have been no need to kill emma unless of course grace letteridge had waited in london until the man got leave only to discover he was marking time until emma was of age and free to marry where she pleased it would have been an appalling blow especially if hed died soon after their meeting leaving her with an empty future if either case was true then grace letteridge for all her dramatic pronouncement had no reason for taking a bow and arrow to shoot hensley she knew the truth or was covering up her own crime rutledge said aloud as the busy city road became industrial and then open countryside especially if he was pressing too hard on her heels by searching the wood why wouldnt he admit to that he knew better than most how jealousy could eat at the soul hed seen it in more than one murder inquiry and hed felt it himself when jean walked away from him to marry a diplomat on his way to take up a station in canada she had vanished from his life as surely as if shed evaporated into thin air she wouldna stoop to murder hamish said again in defense of grace letteridge shed ha walked away and no looked back and hensley appeared to have had problems of his own with jealousy of emma masons alleged attentions to another man rutledge stopped at the oaks as he came to the fork that led to dudlington the inn was dark and there were no motorcars in front of it he went to the door intending to knock and then thought better of it keating could look out any window to see who was at his door and when he recognized rutledge standing there he wouldnt bother to come down rutledge wasnt about to give him that satisfaction he didnt sleep well that night and by the time the clock had struck two from the church tower he got up and went to the window dudlington lay quiet in a shower of moonlight that touched the cold roofs with silvered shadow the streets were empty and the houses were dark but even as he watched a light appeared in emma masons bedchamber and he reached without thinking for the field glasses the room seemed to bloom before his eyes and he could see someones shadow cast by lamplight against the far wall it was hard to tell who had walked into the room the lamp was nearer the door than the windows and only the shadow was visible from where rutledge stood the grandmother hamish said she doesnt hear well it could be anyone slipping into the house after finding the door unlocked the lamp burned for a quarter of an hour and then went out rutledge was on the stairs in almost the same instant going down them fast on his way to hensleys office there he had a clear view of anyone who might come out the ellison door but though he watched for nearly ten minutes the door remained tight shut hamish said quietly theres the kitchen door im not going to be caught by the neighbors prowling in a womans back garden at this hour and if he slipped out through the rear of the house hes had a long head start he waited another ten and then quietly went out hens leys front door and crossed the street turning the knob as silently as possible he gave the door a little push it opened easily into the dark and empty hall early the next morning he crossed the street and tapped lightly on mrs ellisons door then knocked more firmly she came to answer it after several minutes dressed her hair neatly brushed and in place i thought id heard someone she was abrupt unwelcoming im sorry to disturb you he said ignoring her coldness i saw a light in your house when i came in last night i felt i ought to see for myself that all was well thank you she was about to shut her door in his face you do know that the rector fell yesterday her eyebrows went up no i hadnt heard he was fortunate he broke his arm he told her watching her face it could just as well have been his back indeed her refusal to be dependent on anyone or anything was evident he made one more attempt do you lock your door at night i dont need to lock it for my sins i live just across from the police good morning inspector and this time she was successful in shutting him out after breakfast he went to see dr middleton to ask how the rector was faring middleton was just finishing his own breakfast the smell of burned toast heavy in the room very upset with himself for being so foolish sit down theres tea in the pot thank you no what took him up to the attic in the first place there was something about hunting for gloveshe wasnt very clear on that but hillary discovered woolen ones hed apparently washed himself and set out to dry he must have grown impatient and gone in search of a second pair middleton reached for the pot of marmalade and spread it thinly across a slice of scraped toast i told him he was growing as dotty as mary ellison and he didnt find it very amusing i dont recall a pair of gloves on the landing nor did i i asked him what had become of them and he thought hed been distracted from his errand but he cant think why his best guess is the teakettle whistling though for the life of me i cant believe hed hear it all the way from the kitchen hes a logical sort of man and these ambiguities are worrying him more than they should are you sure he was coherent when he said something about a summons oh yes there was no doubt of that when i reached him he was dazed and fretting he began by apologizing for taking me away from the other sufferer or words to that effect and wanting to know if all was well now i asked him what he was going on about and he said id sent for him well i hadnt done anything of the sort so i questioned himconcerned about the knot on his head and whether there was concussionabout whod brought this summons and where he was to go he said he hadnt seen the messenger and i should know the answer to where he was needed better than he i told him it was nothing to be agitated over and he was to stop thinking about it that he hadnt failed in his duty he closed his eyes and let me get on with my examination i cant be sure he was altogether conscious after that i had to move him more than i liked to see what the damage amounted to and hed held on far too long already he was lucky rutledge said meaning it he should have broken his neck or at the very least his back it was nothing short of a miracle tough old bird as ive said before and not about to give up hillary told me this morning that he was begging to be out of bed even though id expressly forbidden it if hes dizzy he doesnt need to go over on his head a second time rutledge left it for a moment and then said i saw a light on in emma masons bedroom last night in the middle of the night i went this morning to see if mrs ellison was all right she bit off my head she cant sleep and i shouldnt be surprised if she walks about the house at night and broods she wont let me give her anything to help her sleep she doesnt want to spend her days befuddled that may be shes also slightly deaf and yet she doesnt lock her door i tested it myself middleton chuckled just as well she didnt catch you doing it policeman or not youd have been up on a charge before you knew what had happened to you i was talking with hensley yesterdayhes improving he added hastily as middleton was about to interrupt but it will be another week before they allow him to leave meanwhile theres another matter i want to bring up middleton was suddenly wary a doctor like a priest cant go about talking about his patients its not a medical question actually what do you know about keating up at the oaks never been ill to my knowledge beyond that i cant tell you much hes an independent devil you arent the first to notice that he came here out of the blue early in so im told he bought the oaks and stayed to himself the mothers of dudlington watched him like a hawkas it happened he had no interest in their daughters either to seduce them or marry them he chuckled again hes not from around here and that was one strike against him another was his reluctance to talk about himself and finally no one knew his aunt or his third cousin or his greatgrandfather the men who frequent the oaks were happy enough to have a local pub and didnt concern themselves with gossip and after a time it died down hes accepted as an anomaly and ignored which is apparently the way he wants it nothing wrong with that is there why the interest did he have a grudge against hensley possibly he was ferocious in his defense of emma masons good name and reputation and a good many people would like to think that hens ley knows more about her disappearance than hes willing to say yes i see where youre going what id like to know is how keating came to know emma well enough to defend her you may have it backward you knowit could be keating has something against hensley and emmas just the smokescreen to conceal that hamish said aye if yon constable recognized him almost as if middleton had overheard the voice in rut ledges head he added wasnt hensley a policeman in london before he came here rutledge walked up the hill from holly street to the oaks and this time found keating in the bar serving a late breakfast to two travelers driving to lincoln he listened to the conversation for some time the man and the woman chatting with keating about an inn theyd stopped in the night before in colchester finally their meal finished they went up to their rooms to finish packing and rutledge followed keating through the door into the kitchen keating had done the cooking himself hillary tim mons was still watching over the rector and keating had shown himself to be competent in the kitchen the clutter of pans and dishes on the worktable and the spills on the stove indicated haste but the remnants of toast poached eggs a side dish of bacon and a plate of sausages were cooked well he took off his apron and turned to face rutledge i have to be there when they come down to pay their reckoning what do you want how long have you known constable hensley he asked abruptly since he came here three years ago why theres reason to think you knew him in london has he told you as much someone else suggested it well someone is wrong there was a motorcar here yesterday morning it left quickly running up the road to the north who was driving how the hell should i know a man came in to ask directions and then walked out id never seen him before and i dont expect to see him again what sort of directions he asked if he was on the right road for stamford i told him he could reach it from here but it was more direct if he took the turning at letherington and got himself over on the main road keating had met rutledges eyes as he spoke and there was no way rutledge could call him on his answer not yet and hamish was hammering at the back of his mind youve let your imagination run away with ye he remembered his certainty just before hed seen the motorcar that someone had been standing in an upstairs window watching him but that certainty had begun to fade and he felt suddenly angry with himself the cartridge casings had got to him after all after keating had carried the luggage of his guests out to their motorcar and seen them off he came back to the kitchen where rutledge was still standing by the cluttered table not satisfied are you he asked look ive kept myself to myself ever since i came here i have no truck with dudlington and dudlington has none with me i prefer it that way hillary timmons works for you shes from the village so she is she needed the work and i gave it to her on the condition that what happens here stays here and i made it clear that if i learned shed been gossiping about me or my patrons she was out on her ear she makes good money shes not likely to go against me she cleans for the rector as well when shes not here and perhaps for others shes got a father who cant work and therere three younger ones at home shes the only income theyve got not much of a life for her is it i pay her a fair wage thats all im responsible for i cant save the world no why do you like your privacy so much dudling tons small enough you might have done better if youd tried to fit in im not interested in fitting in or doing better my life satisfies me the way it is and ill thank you to keep out of it as rutledge was walking back to hensleys house hamish said yere no closer to finding who shot the constable than you were when you came here its been time wasted rutledge swore it was true hed found himself caught up in his own troubles and intrigued by the disappearance of emma mason rather than looking strictly into the attack on hensley and yet he could see that the constable friths wood and the girls fate must somehow be tangled together find the answer to one and the others might fall tidily into place hamish said aye but yon constables an outsider he wouldna ha felt the same about a saxon wood wouldna have feared it yet he knew very well that the villagers avoided it and i dont think hensley would have set foot in it either if he hadnt had a damned good reason that reason has to be something to do with emma mason it fits too well but it was personal not a part of his duty otherwise thered have been a file and its not likely that well have the truth out of him anytime soon why was he shot and left it would ha been easy to finish him if that was the intent rutledge had reached the house and was stepping in the door he said aloud i think we may find it was a warning what was a warning inspector cain stood up from the chair behind hensleys desk dont tell me youve started talking to yourself a bad sign man rutledge could feel his face warming uncomfortably bad habit indeed what brings you here i found this last night when i was going through some of my predecessors files i thought you might be interested he held out a folder and rutledge opened it as they sat down it was a query sent to inspector abbot about a missing woman her name was beatrice ellison mason and the letter had come from london rutledge could see reading the first sheet of paper that a mrs greer had let a room to beatrice mason for several years and was now asking the northamptonshire police to find her and inform her that she was in arrears for six months rent the period in question was march to late august and the letter was dated july it ended for i am a poor woman and in need of that money for a new roof id be obliged if you would tell mrs mason i can wait no longer mrs greer ought to have spoken to a solicitor but it appears she couldnt afford one cain said thats why she wrote to abbot this letter may also explain why mrs mason brought emma to mrs ellison for safekeeping when her husband died she must have been destitute so much for the famous artist living in paris yes well thats another interesting bit read on rutledge turned the page abbot cains predecessor had noted in an awkward scrawl spoke to mrs ellison she says her daughter is studying on the continent and she herself will see to this outstanding debt with an apology for the oversight cain watching him said which she apparently did pay the debt i mean theres no other correspondence on the subject and by the time emma went missing the local police abbot in particular had either forgotten this file or felt that it had no bearing on the girls whereabouts after all her mother hadnt lived at that address since ancient history in fact still he should have looked into it cain was defensive he may have asked mrs ellison about it of course as ive told you his strong suit wasnt keeping records but stepping into his shoes ive discovered how good abbot was at dealing with people it could be said of many policemen in villages and small towns and was probably the secret of their success as an unarmed force the opposite side of the coin was that some of them grew set in their ways and bloodyminded rutledge mended his fences im sure youre right but he made a mental note to have a word with mrs ellison i dont know what bearing this has on anything but it rather puts paid to the idea that emma is alive and well living with her mother in london doesnt it cain prepared to stand up gathering his bad leg under him id not like to think that my constable had anything to do with her disappearance whats become of your sergeant and the motorcar hes gone round to speak to the rector im not sure i like the sound of that fall my sergeant says towson is crippled up with rheumatism and oughtnt to be clambering about in attics or cellars either for that matter mrs melford brought me a cup of tea thats how i learned the news he was lucky rutledge said repeating his earlier words to dr middleton the question is was the fall an accident or not good god cain said staring youre not telling me were about to have a rash of unexplained attacks on people hardly a rash of them yet time will tell but i might add that the attics of the rectory look out on friths wood its one of the few places that do short of climbing the church tower you can climb that tower you know cain informed him theres a rickety stair up to the bell above the clock face i havent the foggiest notion what can be seen from there but at a guess it would be the best viewpoint of any how did you come to know that unspoken between them was the reference to cains war injury but cain grinned two boys went up there on a lark when the armistice was declared in they rang the bells and half dudlington believed wed been attacked by germans or worse my sergeant told me about it hensley summoned him to come and read them the riot act rutledge laughed but he made a second mental note to look at that stair for himself when cain had gone rutledge collected his torch and hensleys field glasses then walked to st lukes the door was unlocked a heavy twisted ring of iron reminiscent of the sanctuary rings of the medieval period when clinging to one protected a man from arrest was newer than the church as if added to give the building a feeling of age he stood there for a moment looking up at the soaring spire there were several square stages forming the sturdy footing of the tower each level diminishing in size as it rose upward to the housing of the bell the spire itself reaching upward from there in a graceful inverted cone had tiny windows counter set on opposite sides two facing north and south two facing east and west hamish said i wouldna care to climb that high then stay here the tower door led to another one carved of heavy dark wood and beyond that lay the sanctuary the nave was highceilinged but flat someone had painted trompe loeil ovals there three of them in renaissance style with scenes of angels and saints floating on clouds and in the center panel christ was seated in glory one hand reaching high into the painted sky the aisle columns were doric with carved capitals and they appeared to uphold without effort this deceptively vast expanse above them the pulpit was tall and heavily carved rutledge thought it might have come from an earlier building that had been replaced there were long windows some with simple stained glass and a brass rail around the communion table the chancel was rather plain with an old painted wood crucifix behind the altar no tombs here the church wasnt old enough for crusader knights and elizabethan ladies there were only a few monuments he did find a nice memorial tablet to a man who had served in the sudan with gordon his nameit was harknessrank dates and his regimental insignia had been inlaid in the stone in brass rutledge wondered if hed been the last of the familys male line leaving to a distant cousin mary ellison pride in continuing the female line he returned to the tower room and saw the narrow stairs to one side that disappeared through a square hole in the ceiling the steps were stone for the first flight in keeping with the construction of the church but as he started to climb he could see very quickly that the next flight was wood without backs to the risers not a very pleasant prospect he reached the next stage of the tower and could just see the bell rope disappearing into the darkness high above his head he looked down past his feet where it hung like a mesmerized snake suspended in midair with nowhere to go only he thought there was no visible head or tail he grasped the sides of the narrow stairs firmly and went up another flight hand over hand to steady himself and he refrained from looking down for the stairs were fixed to the outside walls and a well of darkness was opening up in the empty center overhead shining his torch straight up he could see the great bronze bell another flight and the space was filled with the mouth of the bell the clapper swaying lightly in the movement of cold air through the shuttered openings on four sides yon draft must come from the cairngorms hamish said startling rutledge his foot missed the next step and he swore as his body began to swing out over the bottomless space yawning beside him but his handhold on the rough side rails was strong enough to pull him back again to safety there was a distinctly hollow pit in the middle of his stomach until he felt his dangling foot settle once more on the solid strip of wood a dozen more steps and he was at the head of the bell where massive beams held it in place at the top of the tower the clock was hung on the outer side of the window arch facing toward the village and over his head a single ladder disappeared into the spire shining his light up into the darkness he could see the wooden skeleton of the tower the framework on which it had been built like an octagon that narrowed more with each foot of height how old was that ladder it might still hold a boys weight but what about a mans rutledge thought i dont need to climb farther but he knew he did coming down was something else and he wasnt prepared to think about that yet the ladder was steadier than hed expected and with a sigh of relief he started up it when he came to the first window he realized that it looked toward the village while its brother on the far side overlooked the fields but the next pair of windows facing north and south gave him a birdseye view of friths wood and he could see more detail from here than hed anticipated with his arms wrapped tightly about the side rails of the ladder he brought up the field glasses through them he could have roughly followed movement across the breadth of the wood and even down into the thickets of undergrowth especially at this time of year when the trees were bare and even the briars and weeds mere stalks and thorny strands it was interesting to see just how closely he could bring it in far better than from the rectory attic surely who would have the courage to come here just on the off chance of seeing where hensley had gone letting the glasses hang from their leather strap around his neck he began to back down the ladder it was just light enough to see where he was going without the aid of his torch but the tolerances were much tighter at this height and he was beginning to feel the pressure of claustrophobia sealing him in a nail sticking out farther than most of its neighbors plucked at his coat yanking at him it was easy enough to free himself but the sense of losing his balance was strong taking a deep breath to steady himself he went down the ladder another few rungs god but it was dangerous and just behind him making it impossible to look down was hamish he continued his descent and finally arrived at the lower pair of windows he stopped for a moment to look at the village a toy city for a child like seeing it from an airplane he thought picking out the narrow canyons that were the streets and the chimney pots of houses he recognized the nearer ones showed him their back gardens where sheds held tools and other gear and lines for drying clothes ran helterskelter across the space available to give them as much length as possible a childs bicycle lay against the back steps in one and in another a man was just visible bringing up a giant cabbage from the coal cellar where it had been stored a wagon moved into view leaving one of the shops the rectorys slate roof was mossy and he could see into the rectors bedroom glimpsing the foot of the bed and the edge of a door through the open drapes he was staring at the baylor house beyond the rectory when he saw that someone was at a window on the top floor apparently staring directly back at him it was a shock because inside this tight cocoon of wood hed felt invisible the question was could the figure at the window actually see him or was he only gazing out at the church rutledge brought up the field glasses but it was impossible to pick out details through the windowpane a dark irregular shape but certainly human hed have missed it altogether if the figure hadnt moved and drawn his attention and yet he seemed to feel the intensity of the watchers scrutiny curiosity or something more sinister on the other side of the coin the sun had just come out from behind the clouds reaching through the narrow opening beside him and touching the ladder on which he stood highlighting his right shoulder he was pinned there vulnerable with the long descent blocked by hamish just below him caught like a bird in a sack but that was nonsense any threat to him would come from outside dudlington not from a house whose owner he knew he tried to shake off the sense of urgency pressing him now and concentrated instead on the placement of each foot feeling his way downward there was a sense of relief when he finally reached the mouth of the bell and the real stairs however rudimentary they had seemed before they felt sturdier and safer than that abominable ladder he reached out to touch the bell for a moment his hand against the icy cold metal and from this angle he noticed for the first time the mechanism that connected the bell to the clock hark hamish warned from somewhere below him and he saw the gears begin to move the clock was about to strike and he was standing there beside the bell wasting no time he went as fast as he dared down the next set of stairs reached the last flight the one of stone and was halfway down it when the great bronze tongue over his head tolled the hour the wash of sound enveloping him on solid ground at last he went straight to the sanctuary and found a pane of clear glass facing the direction of the baylor house but if there had been someone in the upstairs window he was gone now all rutledge could see was the movement of clouds reflected in the dark glass like the shadow of leaves stirring in the wind he was beginning to think hed let his imagination run away with him up in that spire hamish taunted aye youve lost your nerve it wasna a stalker standing there only a man looking out his ain window to hell with my nerve what i want to know now is whether someones accustomed to standing there and did he see what happened in friths wood last friday or at any other time if there was someone looking at me through the spires opening had he seen anyone else up there in the past few weeks theres verra little warmth at the top of yon house in winter hamish countered derisively and only two people ye ken with no much time to stand about watching ithers its no likely theyll ha seen anything unless they were verra lucky then its time to find out how good their luck is when rutledge used the brass knocker on the door there was no answer he walked around the side of the house to the kitchen garden the door there was ajar and he stepped in calling baylor are you there he could hear voices somewhere inside and he walked down the passage to the kitchen it was empty too although it was tidy the room was masculine in tone shades rather than curtains at the windows and an oil cloth covering the table the only feminine concession was a frilled but worn cushion on one of the chairs as if this was where a woman had once sat the door on the far side led to the rest of the house and he walked quietly down a second passage hed just reached a room with an open door when baylor came out and nearly collided with him what the hell he exclaimed startled to find someone in his house ive knocked on the front door and called from the kitchenperhaps its time to think of answering you must have heard me damn you youve no right to come in like this baylor was furious his face red i came to ask if i could look out your upper windows toward friths wood surely theres no harm in that its probably the best observation post in dudlington what are you saying that someone here used it to watch the wood you must be mad we had nothing to do with hensleys attack that day except to save his life dont deliberately misunderstand me baylor i simply want to stand at the window to judge how much of the wood is visible from there hamish said quietly theres someone in yon room and you must pass it to reach the stairs rutledge could feel the presence in the room silent and apprehensive look ill just go up the back stairs to the attic if youll lead the way i neednt disturb the rest of the household torn baylor considered the alternatives oh very well this way he brushed past rutledge with the intention of irritating him and walked back toward the kitchen through another door were the back stairs narrow curving and with short treads baylor went up them with accustomed ease but rutledge had to duck through the door and keep a hand on the wall as he climbed they came out on the floor above and then walked a short distance to a second flight of steps going up to the next floor it wasnt an attic as rutledge had thought but another passage with small rooms intended for children or servants the doors were shut giving a claustrophobic air to the corridor making it appear to be narrower than the one below the carpet running down the center was worn with use but sound it would hamish was pointing out muffle footsteps baylor opened the door into a bright corner room with square windows and an iron bedstead against one wall a washstand nearest the door and a tall chest of drawers to rutledges left the room seemed unused empty of personal touches or the ordinary signs of someones presence there was a desk between the north windows and he went to it to lean his hands on the wooden top so that he could look out he could see the wood quite well but not into it as clearly as he had from the church spire it would be helpful if i could send someone into the wood and then stand here to observe his progress rut ledge said a test of sorts would you be agreeable to walking there for ten minutes or so i dont set foot in the wood if i can help it find yourself another ferret without haste rutledge turned to the west window where he could look toward the church and found himself facing the narrow east opening where hed stood on the ladder not twenty minutes before a pale light came through from the opposite side of the spire illuminating the interior and he thought someone could have seen me its not impossible do you have a woman who cleans for you he asked aloud turning to baylor or perhaps your brother comes up here from time to time to look out at the fields its really quite a fine vantage point nobody uses this floor we havent since we were children and my parents were still alive can you be sure of that i told you we dont use this floor but rutledge was nearly sure someone had at least for a short time not more than half an hour ago there was the partial print of a hand in the dust collecting on the win dowsill beside him as they came down the stairs and into the kitchen the kettle was just on the boil baylor said i wont offer you a cup of tea it was a clear message to leave thank you for your willingness to help rutledge went out the door and heard it shut behind him almost on his heels he retraced his steps as far as the rectory and an exhausted hillary timmons opened the door at his knock she stood aside almost wary of him and he remembered his outburst of anger in the kitchen of the oaks how is the rector he asked after greeting her tiresome she smiled a little to take the sting out of the word he doesnt feel like doing much of anything and that drags at his patience perhaps a visitor will help oh if you would please i need to see to his dinner and theres been no time he went up the stairs to the first floor and down the passage to the rectors bedroom towson greeted him with undisguised relief thank god youre here he said i need so many things and young hillary is hopeless what would you like rutledge inquired setting his hat to one side and tossing his coat over a chair tsk theres a coattree in the hall didnt she point it out it doesnt matter what can i find for you there are three books by the desk in my study paper pens and something to write on ink my blotter he went on urgently as if afraid rutledge would desert him before hed finished his requests im surprised hillary couldnt have helped you earlier rutledge said it doesnt seem all that complicated she doesnt like touching anything in my study she never even ventures in there to dust it youd think she was afraid of it as if god lived there to help me with my sermons rutledge laughed very well ill do my best he went to the study a small room overlooking the church and began to search for the items towson had listed the books were easy enough to find on the shelf by the rectors desk and the writing materials lay next to the blotter rutledge was just looking around the room to find some means of carrying the lot back up the stairs when he noticed a framed photograph on the small table by the only upholstered chair in the room a lamp stood on the table as well next to a book filled with strips of paper to mark various chapters he crossed the room to look at the photograph and then was distracted by the book it was leather bound an album of sorts with cuttings pasted to the pages he could see the curled edges sticking out rutledge reached to open it and hamish said i wouldna pry he ignored the voice the cuttings had come from various newspapers with the name of the paper and the date written in ink on each of them most of them were obituaries in the front was mrs towsons short but flowery identifying her as the beloved wife of our dear rector others were of local men killed in the war each one pasted carefully in the center of a sheet of black paper as if honoring them he ran his eye down one or two thinking as he did that each of these young men hadnt had time to live very far beyond boyhood the war had given them their only reality their rank and dates and the battle in which theyd fallen stood out starkly as their only achievement son of young men who hadnt married hadnt had families of their own had left no mark in the world and no posterity how many of them had he seen go into battle and fall how many had he tried to remember as individuals repeating their names to himself as he stood in the trenches during the dark nights of winter and the short ones of summer mackay sutherland gordon campbell scott maciver macinnes mactaggert chisholm kerr fraser he found himself reminded of elizabeth fraser seeing her against the snow light her hair so fair like a crown her body long and slim the memory was slipping away from him now and it hurt him to think that he was beginning to forget he made himself return to the album scanning the names and ages and battles and then one name in particular caught his eye robert baylor age twenty son of the late robert and ellen baylor of dudlington farm survived by his brothers theodore and joel and his fiancee grace letteridge he closed the album carefully so as not to lose any of the markers hamish said it wasna well done looking without permission but now i know he answered one more of the dead on the somme a young man who was engaged to marry one womanbut who had been seen by constable markham rolling in the grass near the church with emma mason rutledge brought the books and writing materials to the rector and set them on the bed where he could reach them i couldnt find anything to write on that small flat handkerchief box over there will work nicely towson told him pointing to it i shant do it any harm rutledge brought it to him and set that within reach also how can you write im accustomed to using either hand when the rheumatism is worse i switch my mother was told when i was a child that i was contrary using my left hand more than my right my schoolmaster forced me to use my right and it took me nearly thirty years to forgive him he added ruefully now im grateful who will deliver your sermon on sunday i shall of course propped in the pulpit like a log theres nothing wrong with my voice and as soon as the tenderness in my leg and back has passed im allowed to be up and about rutledge grinned at him you must be careful on the pulpit steps i always am with my robes trailing about my ankles i was just across the way speaking to ted baylor his windows look out on friths wood perhaps a better view than yours baylor told me once that the servants when he was a child hated that view and would refuse to sleep in that room for fear of seeing something unspeakable in the night what became of the servants off to the war of course or to the cities to work in the factories there were only the three boys after their parents died and i expect they fared well enough the house stood empty for two years you know half of dudlington helped care for the livestock it muddled social standings when you were ankledeep in muck cleaning out the barns and all three of them survived the war thats astonishing but hamish was chiding him for misleading the rector ted did although he was wounded twice robert was killed joel came back with strange notions about what had been done to the common soldier hes not quite right in his head im told ted takes care of him but theres no one to take care of ted lifes not always fair what do you mean not quite right in his head i cant say with any certainty can you pass me that glass of water thank you joel never comes to church services and he never sets foot out of the house as far as i know i doubt anyone has seen him at all we leave him in peace hoping one day he may heal rutledge stood to go as he heard hillary timmons coming up the stairs she thanked him for spelling her and added ive found you a nice bit of ham for your dinner rector you feed me better than i feed myself my dear she blushed mr keating says im a terrible cook but ive noticed the inn guests never complain what did mr keating do before he bought the oaks rutledge asked her i dont know she told him simply he never talks about himself if i didnt know better id say he had no other life before the oaks but he mustve theres a wicked scar she clapped a hand over her mouth suddenly frightened i wont tell him rutledge assured her its all right but she hurried from the room looking as if she was on the verge of tears what was that in aid of towson asked worried for her shes been warned not to talk about keating its worth her job then you shouldnt have pressed her towson told him roundly she needs the work to help her family thats why i pay her to clean for me as do several others shes vulnerable theres no harm done rutledge answered him i shant say anything about it and neither will you but when he left he noticed that the rector didnt ask him to come to visit again on the way back to hensleys house he thought about what hed learned that day it was still a jumble of impressions and facts and he wasnt sure where they were leading but he had come to rely on intuition over the years and never discounted the smallest bit of information it sometimes loomed large in the end once hed pried open the secrets locked in a silent village hamish said yere wasting time climbing the kirk tower it willna tell you who hated yon constable grace letteridge for one possibly keating there may be others keeping their heads down even ted baylor who had the best view of friths wood and may have seen his chance though what he has against hensley i dont know yet unless it has to do with his dead brother and emma mason rutledge listened to his footsteps echoing against the stone walls of whitby lane keeping pace with his thoughts were the small windows of dudlington meant to keep the cold out or to conceal what was inside he realized glancing up that there was a motorcar just by the door of hensleys house and he stopped trying to place it but it wasnt one he could recall seeing at the oaks he walked through the door but there was no one in the parlor he went through to the sitting room beyond it and stopped stockstill on the threshold unable to believe his eyes in the chair on the far side of the room halfhidden in the shadows was meredith channing mrs channing spoke first yes well i thought i ought to come it was as if she had answered the thought in his head hamish unsettled and pressing hissed send her away there have been no more casings he said baldly i think its finished no not finished waiting she began to remove her gloves how could you possibly know that it doesnt matter how youre being lulled into dropping your guard forgetting to look before you find yourself in a position where you cant fight back where youre a perfect target and helpless rutledge saw himself in the spire pinned there in the wooden octagon of boards unable to protect himself his skin crawled you understand i see she dropped her gloves into her handbag why should it matter to you one way or another she smiled how like a man youre a friend of maryannesive met your sister and a few of your other friends how could i turn away it was a long distance to drive just to deliver a warning you might have written instead oh do stop being suspicious and sit down she had lost patience with him im here what i want to know is what can i do he stood there for a moment longer then realized how foolish he looked like a defiant child crossing the room he sat down in the chair on the other side of the oval table at her elbow glancing around she said these are spartan quarters waiting for you i looked in the kitchen hoping for a little tea to warm me theres none in the tea tin and none on the shelves its constable hensleys house he said im using it while hes in hospital ive a very nice room at the oaks im surprised you arent staying there he smiled grimly then you havent met the owner hell have nothing to do with a policeman under his roof have you asked yourself why hes something of a curmudgeon im told i found him very polite although he may not go on being polite if he discovers im here to see you how did you find me i sent you the small package if you remember he felt like a student being put in his place by his teacher yes of course sorry ive got other things on my mind i can see that she rose to go and he stood as well ill find out if the inn can run to a cup of tea for a moment she regarded him intently if theres anything i can do please ask ill only stay on for a day or two but i was worried you see and you did come to me first with that she walked out of the room and he let her go hamish said shes an outsider shes no afraid of the wood it was a change of mood that surprised rutledge but he answered slowly considering the matter yes its true he crossed the street to mrs ellisons house and knocked loudly she answered the door and for a moment was clearly considering shutting it in his face but he said its about your daughter she allowed him to come in then to stand like a tradesman in the entry what do you want with my daughter inspector cain discovered a letter in his predecessors files it was from a mrs greer of london asking to be paid for six months lodging at her house your daughter had left without settling her account she replied curtly to my shame but i will say on her behalf that shed lost her husband she had had to give up her child and she went to france to heal i havent told anyone its too embarrassing i hope youll respect my request to keep the matter between us whats become of beatrice ellison mason mrs ellison you must know she looked away from him shes dead i never told emma that she preferred to think her mother was in london painting she went to paris you see married a belgian there and she was in liege when the germans bombarded the city she must have been one of the casualties because i havent had any news of her since july of she wrote to you he asked with surprise she turned away from him scorn on her face now no i had other means of learning her whereabouts someone i went to school with was living in paris and she sent me news when she could thats how i knew of my daughters second marriage i would think that other children had come then and beatrice must have felt awkward telling her new husband about emma why should he care if he loved her beatrice often made rather free with the truth and mason isnt the most romantic name for an artist she called herself harkness i understand it has a finer ring to it i expect is she telling the truth hamish asked rutledge thought she was there was conviction in her voice and he could see that she was tense with feeling her hands clenched together until the knuckles showed white why did you let your granddaughter write to a london address that didnt exist that must have been a cruel disappointment when the letters were returned unopened you arent a mother inspector she snapped at him how can you be the judge of whats best for a young easily impressed child who thought maid marian was a heroine and who wanted to spread her own wings the truth from the beginning might have been easier theres still the chance that she went to london in search of her mother and london is no place for a young girl alone anything could have happened to her there doesnt that frighten you she would never have done such a foolish thing you didnt know her then perhaps she went there looking for a young man who had marched off to war if he had struck her she wouldnt have looked any more shocked and angry how dare you you were young once my granddaughter was a godfearing young lady i saw to that get out of my house he left then aware that he had upset her and that any other questions would have been useless mrs ellison had barricaded herself in a comfortable private world of her own secure from hurt struggling to ignore the loss of her only child and her only grandchild refusing to understand that she might have driven both of them away with her strong sense of propriety and family duty artists came to a nogood end and it could be argued that beatrice had chosen her own fate but that young girls bedroom was still waiting for young emma regardless of the fact that she might have grown into an entirely different person if she was still alive harder perhaps disillusioned certainly and possibly no longer innocent after the door had closed he wished hed asked her for the name of her school friend in paris as he walked through dudlington trying to clear up the mounting pile of evidence that went nowhere contradicting itself at every turn rutledge saw grace letteridge coming out of the butchers shop she hesitated when she looked up and found he was striding toward her then straightened her shoulders and stood there waiting for him as if i were the guillotine he thought and hamish added she doesna want to talk about the past when he came up to her she said id like to hear that constable hensley has died of infection he made himself smile it wouldnt help would it hes not the source of your anger what do you mean its cold and the street isnt the proper place to talk about private matters will you come to the police station or shall i accompany you to your house either way theres no tea to be found in either of them she laughed ruefully i do have tea come on then and ill make us both a cup they walked back to her house in silence shed refused to let him carry her purchases and he didnt press she took his hat and coat and pointed him toward the parlor he stood there studying the watercolors done by beatrice mason they were good he couldnt fault them technically but he wondered if she would have made the essential leap to london tastes a quality that would have made her firstrate as catherine tarrant and others had done in oils it would depend he decided on her dedication and how quickly her skill matured she had a husband and a child hamish reminded him they would ha dragged her down what if her dreams had faded and she realized that a little talent could be more heartbreaking than none it might explain her decision to marry her first husband and then her second security while she played at being an artist security while she went to parties or showed her portfolios and talked about her work hardly the glory she might have hoped for but talented wives were given a very different reception from young women struggling alone in rooming houses with no entree into society he turned as grace letteridge came back with a tray of tea things youll have to make do without cakes or sandwiches but at least its warm rutledge took the cup she handed him adding sugar and milk from the tray you like her work i think grace said glancing up at the paintings she has a wonderful sense of light he told her yes thats what struck me harder to achieve in water colors i should think than in oils she took a chair on the far side of the room and said all right what is it youre bursting to ask questions arent you ive been trying to piece together some of the things ive learned as i asked questions about hensley and emma masonand lately asking questions about her mother as well is beatrice ellison mason living comfortably in liege do you think or did she die in the german attack in liege id never heard that beatrice had moved to liege why are you asking me you know we never kept in touch or id have known where to search for emma what does mary ellison have to say about that she believes her daughter went to paris married there and shortly afterward moved to belgium well then whats the matter with that i think mrs ellison has been covering up the truth that beatrice was dead it was what he himself had begun to accept did emma ever suspect that of course not she believed her mother was living in london its what the whole worldwell what the dudlington world believed anyway she set her teacup down and considered the policeman in her parlor are you suggesting that beatrice killed herself that she couldnt face living without her husband and after seeing to emmas future she did something awful mary ellison would never admit that her daughter was a suicideit was not something that happened in respectable families and her pride would prefer that people believed any plausible tale rather than stumble on the truth my friend in paris writes it needna be suicide hamish said theres prostitution social suicide by anyones standards perhaps thats why mrs ellison paid the debt at the rooming house when mrs greer wrote to demand her money it could have been quiet blackmail what debt grace letteridge asked him and who was blackmailing whom hed answered hamish aloud cursing himself he said no one i was just speculating on something that inspector cain discovered in the records inspector abbot had left an address for beatrice mason in but it was useless by the time mrs ellison learned of it two years later he quickly shifted the subject do you remember abbot of course we saw him about as often as we see inspector cain he would pay brief visits to dudlington from time to time looking in on the shopkeepers and the rector and the doctor keeping his ear to the ground hed called it what sort of policeman was he he was disastrous when it came to something serious like emmas disappearance he couldnt fathom why shed left a loving and comfortable home to run off to london he was close to retirement oldfashioned in his thinking about women and unwilling to believe that a harkness could do anything approaching the scandalous he left most of the questioning to constable hensley mrs ellison was distraught and it didnt help when inspector abbot badgered her practically tearing poor emmas room apart in an effort to learn how shed hoped to make her way to london the fact is no one came forward and admitted to helping emma leave and in the end the inquest returned a verdict of foul play by person or persons unknown that upset mrs ellison even more and i lost my temper with constable hensley calling him incompetent and stupid and thats when i began to suspect him i couldnt believe a londontrained policeman was so inept he had to be covering up something and the only thing that made sense was his part in emmas murder murder is hardly more socially acceptable than suicide yes well even the fact that mary ellison is related to the harkness family isnt much comfort to her now the words were bitter spoken with anger im told that someone saw emma somewhere behind the church one day rolling in the grass as he put it with a young man she stared at him so thats and then she broke off thats what rutledge asked when she failed to go on grace letteridge shook her head vehemently but her mouth had tightened who was the young man he persisted but she was already collecting the tea things and carrying them out to the kitchen effectively closing the subject he followed her through the house i even know the name he told her as she set the tray on the kitchen table her back to him it was robert baylor she whirled so quickly he wasnt prepared couldnt even defend himself her right hand slapped him so hard across the face that he saw pinpoints of light dancing in front of his eyes dont ever say his name to me do you hear dont you ever dare and before he could prevent it she was out of the room and going up the stairs where he couldnt follow her rutledge stood there in the kitchen his face stinging and his own anger mounting you shouldna ha pressed her sae hard no if the young man was hers if it was robert baylor who seduced emma mason why does she feel so strongly that it was hensley who killed the girl but then there was no proof that emma had been seduced she could just as easily have fought baylor off especially if the attack had been a trial balloon as it were a test to see whether this very pretty girl was willing or not hensley on the other hand hearing about what appeared to be a successful seduction might well have tried his own luck and when emma threatened to tell her grandmother rid himself of the girl and the problem then why had hensley even brought up what constable markham thought hed seen because rutledge realized robert baylor was safely dead in france and couldnt deny it and hensley had quietly managed to shift suspicion to grace letteridge hensley was clever hed escaped one black mark against his name in london he couldnt have risked a second one here particularly not laying hands on a young girl whose grandmother was connected to the harkness family was that a strong enough motive for the first murder emmas bowles had given the constable a second chance allowing him to redeem himself in the backwaters of northamptonshire but even bowles would quickly wash his hands of hensley if there was a raging scandal of that nature chief superintendent bowles valued his title and his position more than he valued a subordinate rutledge had the feeling that the disconnected bits and pieces were beginning to make more sense but what about the second attempt at murder hens leys own rutledge had made an enemy of grace letteridge bringing up robert baylors name and if shed shot hensley in revenge for what she believed hed done to emma rutledge realized hed better be watching his own back then where exactly did the relationship between robert baylor and grace letteridge fit into this picture in late afternoon rutledge walked to the oaks and received a chilly reception from keating when am i to have my barmaid back again it wont be long towson is showing improvement what brings you to my door ive nothing more to say to you ive come to speak to one of your guests mrs channing is there a parlor where we can speak privately youre not to upset her keating told him belligerently not under my roof surprised by such unexpected protectiveness rutledge said ive come to ask a favor of her not badger her hamish said she has befuddled him keating went away to speak to her and after several minutes returned to conduct rutledge to a small but pretty sitting room done up in cream and gold as if keating had followed the existing color scheme when he repainted the room for his use meredith channing was there standing is anything wrong she asked anxiously trying to convey her concern without giving the listening keating anything to whisper about over the bar i need someone i can trust to help me test a theory ah she nodded to keating thanking him and dismissing him at the same time the innkeeper left the room reluctantly and rutledge wouldnt have put it past him to listen outside the door i didnt know i was someone you trusted she told rut ledge with a wry smile you continue to surprise me he had the grace to flush and said answering her smile its your eyesight and your honesty i want to put to the test then tell me what you need will you come with me first to pay a visit to the rector mr towson hes taken a nasty fall and i think you might cheer him a little he inclined his head toward the door and she glanced at it recognizing his suspicion of course let me fetch my coat inspector and ill come directly he waited in the entrance hall and after a time she came dressed in a warm coat of deep burgundy and a very attractive hat he thought of his sister frances who enjoyed hats and wore them with grace and style she walked with him down the hill to whitby lane and then to church street when they were out of earshot of the inn she said do you really wish me to visit the rector i cant quite believe youve got the time to take up good works as a matter of fact youll spend a few minutes with him and afterward i want to take you to a window in his attic id like you to wait there until ive walked to friths wood and then mark my progress after that depending on what youve got to tell me ill take you to stand at another post why me because as far as i can tell god help me you havent got any connection to anyone here and you have no reason to lie about what you see i need that objectivity she laughed iani may call you ian i think if im pressed into service by the yardwhat is it im supposed to see wait a bit until ive shown you the setting then it should be very clear they walked on in silence her stride matched his this was a woman who was independent and selfassuredand more than a little unsettling when they turned into church street she said oh what an interesting church as a reward for good behavior ill show you the ceiling before i take you back to the inn which reminds me do you think keating is trustworthy youre the only guest now and his barmaid is currently nursing the rector oh i think im quite safe my virtue as well as my life what is keatings history one seldom meets an innkeeper who is surly to his guests as if he would prefer it if they never came at all i dont know frankly he appears to like the oaks because it isnt in the center of dudlington as most pubs and inns generally are he isnt watched i expectnot a part of the rampant gossip that keeps the village on its toes yes that could be the bar isnt rowdy at night i can tell you that oh people laugh and they play at darts and theres even a chessboard in one corner if anyone is interested i peeked in there this afternoon when hed gone to letherington to buy my dinner youd make a good policeman he told her opening the gate to the rectory walk watch the flagstones but shed turned to look beyond at the encroaching fields its so barren so empty there are fruit trees here and there in fact i think thats a pear in the corner of the wall it might be pretty here in the springor pastoral in summer when the cattle and sheep are out there grazing yes im sure but just now i feeli dont knowthe word that comes to me is naked a target hamish said and rutledge shivered she turned back and he followed her up the walk he went to the rectors room first and told him that there was an attractive visitor downstairs who is it he raised himself on his pillows drawing his dressing gown across his nightclothes you dont know her but i think youll enjoy her company towson his spirits lifting said have i shaved properly and my hairbrush its there on the top of the tall dresser when towson was satisfied he said is hillary still in the kitchen i might ask her to bring us tea his expression was longing and rutledge laughed ill see to it when he returned with mrs channing rutledge watched in amusement as the rectors eyes widened im so sorry to meet you under such unhappy circumstances she said warmly walking to the bed to take his hand the queen herself couldnt have done it more graciously moving down long rows of wounded in a hospital ward rutledge standing in the door saw towson rise to the occasion and even in his dressing gown put on his churchmans face finding the right words to welcome his guest leaving them to get acquainted he went down to the kitchen and asked hillary timmons to prepare tea by the time rutledge came back with the tray mrs channing and the rector were gossiping like old friends he found himself pouring the cups and passing them listening to a conversation about the works of dickens he had already told mrs channing what he wanted of her and now he explained what he needed to towson he borrowed mrs channing for a few minutes to show her the way to the attics and warn her to beware on the stairs and then he left going out the door to the back garden letting himself out of the back gate and walking openly up the sloping pastures toward friths wood it took him no more than fifteen minutes to reach the wood and step into the outriders of trees they seemed to close in after him and he was in the heart of the wood walking without haste first one way and then the other hamish unhappy with the exercise made no bones about it telling rutledge roundly that he was asking for trouble nothing is going to happen he said his voice steady but he felt again that sense of being watched and of something unpleasant surrounding him he moved on in a half circle then began to make his way to the fringe of the wood before walking briskly back to the rectory only once did he let himself glance at the windows of the baylor house but he could see no one there he found a very distressed meredith channing waiting for him by the stairs as he came through from the kitchen you hadnt told me about the woodnot the truth she exclaimed her hands clasped together in front of her its an old wood surrounded by legend its a cold and brooding place and i thought i saw a shadow following you looming there among the trees i couldnt call out a warningyou couldnt have heard me if i had but it was all i could do to stay by the window and watch what kind of shadow i dont know a darkness something i was too far away to tell he wondered for a moment if shed made it up you could see me moving through the copse then could you tell who it was walking there or see what i was doing i could only be sure a man was there in among the trees because i knew it was you i could identify you yes if it had been a stranger i couldnt have sworn to what he looked like and there were times when you were concealed behind a knot of branches or thick patches of undergrowth it really depended on the line of sight through the trunks and brush youve just met the rector could you have identified towson if hed been out there i think i probably could have unless he was heavily bundled up in a coat and scarf then id have been less sure tell me about the shadow who was it it wasntyoull think me madit wasnt really human it was something shapeless hovering near you someone heavily disguised like the soldier in mrs massinghams pasture hamish had felt it too that sense of danger was it something i could have turned around and touched or a sixth sense created out of what you felt about that wood meredith channing shook her head dont ask me to answer that i dont know but i can tell you this much i had the strongest feeling while i was watching that if you went into that wood after dark you might not come out alive they thanked the rector and said goodbye walking out into the golden light of an approaching sunset it gave the cold and empty fields a glowing warmth and set shadows by the stream while the church spire seemed to be on fire come into the church rutledge said it may be too dark but id promised to take you there mrs channing was still distressed by her experience in the attics and her first thought was to refuse he could see it in her face but then she went with him to the tower door in the sanctuary there was still an afterglow spilling through the stained glass and giving to the painted ceiling just the right blend of light and shadow to make it seem real rising high above their heads into a blue sky with cushions of clouds that seemed solid enough for saints and angels to float on how lovely she exclaimed walking farther into the church and turning a little for the best view and how unexpected out here in the middle of nowhere its a trick of the eye rutledge told her move this way and look again good heavens thats quite amazing isnt it and very suitable here yes he let her walk around on her own her head tilted the light sometimes touching her hair or her face or the burgundy of her coat i imagine it wouldnt be easy to do this on a flat surface over your head and know as you worked that it would have dimensions when was it done sometime in the early nineteenth century when the village was moved here and rebuilt well it was a gifted hand i should think she took one final look and then went back to him where he was waiting by the sanctuary door they stepped through it and shut it and were crossing the flagged floor to the main door when there was a sound well above their heads as if somethingor someonehad accidentally touched the clapper of the bell the echoing note seemed to be caught somewhere above them a resonance that had nowhere to go rutledge looked up at once to see if the bell rope had moved it was stirring a little but whether from being touched or from the wind through the shuttered windows by the clock face he couldnt be sure he was strongly tempted to go up the stone steps to the wooden ones and see for himself but there was mrs channing to consider as well she must have read something in his face for she said dont i think theres someone above us he told her quietly i want to see who it is open the tower door and go back to the inn ill be all right here he cant stay up there forever no if i leave hell see me hell know youre waiting and be ready no it was true he debated for only a moment longer and then said stay here he went up the stone steps swiftly and as quietly as he could though his footsteps seemed too loud filling the tower room with their noisy progress he came through into the level where the wooden flights began and looked up into the darkness of the tower a single rotted leaf drifted down from above brushing his shoulder the shutters cast slanted bars of light across the face of the bell but below and above there was gloom and as he watched the bars of light began to fade and the gathering dusk left the tower completely dark there had been no one on the stairs when he had begun to climb and no one beside the bell hed have wagered his life on it whoever it was had climbed well up into the spire and was hidden there in the shadows that were growing deeper by the minute and he himself had no torch with him rutledge stopped there were better ways to catch whoever it was he made his way back down again making no attempt to conceal his movements this time mrs channing was standing there face upturned a pale blur in the dimness ian lets be off he said and opened the tower door for her in silence they went down the walk to church street and then turned into whitby lane go to hensleys house and wait for me there he said to her i want to make my way back to the church id rather you didnt yes but there isnt much choice go on before i lose him she did as she was told walking briskly up the lane without looking back a sharp wind swirled a dust devil at her feet as rutledge retraced his steps to the end of the street there was a house on the corner but no lamplight shone out its windows he flattened himself against the outside wall and moved on to the next house which faced church street he stopped there his view toward the church open the houses fronting the street were quiet and no one was about except for a large dog sniffing at the gutters there was an empty motorcar standing in front of one door and a lorry by another he could hear the sound of hammering from that house as if a tradesman was finishing work on a door or other wooden surface the banging was rhythmic and steady and then silence fell from somewhere he could hear a childs voice raised in a question and another dog barked at the first warning it to mind where it stopped rutledge waited a quarter of an hour and then the church door opened and someone came out shutting it quickly behind him he studied the night looking for movement and then began to walk around the church on the side away from the rectory rutledge broke into a sprint going after the dark shape he was fast and he was determined but by the time he reached the church it was too dark to see where the figure had goneout into the open fields or north toward friths wood or whether it had simply disappeared into a back garden where it was to all intents and purposes invisible rutledge searched for a good half hour but came up with nothing as he walked back toward hensleys house he said it wasnt a dead soldier this time it was a living human being with no guid reason to climb yon tower unless hed followed you from the wood did he know the church tower could be climbed before i went up it he asked thinking it through did he step inside the church while i was in the spire unable to see him i was so busy searching for the best view i could have missed the sound of the church door opening hamish didnt answer him and where has he vanished to now rutledge went on but hed seen the houses from the spire each with its back garden and a few with a narrow alley that led to a street there were a hundred places where someone could hide without drawing attention to himself he had the advantage squatting in the dark leaning into the shadow of a chimney flattened into a doorway it was a catandmouse game that rutledge was not likely to win that thought made him swear his footsteps echoed the lane was quiet the shops dark everyone had gone home soon mrs melford would be setting her table in the dining room expecting him to come and mrs channing was waiting for him as well there was a lorry coming up behind him he could hear the changing of the gears as the corner was turned and the sound of the motor gaining speed to take the slight rise in the lane at first he didnt make the connection he assumed that the workmen had finished for the day and were leaving dudlington or heading to the oaks for a pint before going back to their place of business the odd thing was theyd forgotten to turn on the lorrys headlamps the heavy vehicle was almost on his heels when he realized it wasnt workmen behind the wheel not at that speednot without lights hamish was shouting something and rutledge made a wild dive for the small rose garden in front of grace let teridges house the wing of the lorry struck his leg and clawed at his shoe he landed hard among the stubby rose canes one of them stabbing into his shoulder and his arm hurt as it took his full weight then he rolled a long highpitched screech of metal on stone filled the air and the lorrys wing scraped heavily against the wall knocking it inward on top of rutledge before veering away the heavy stones rained down on rutledges ankles and shins even as he tried to see who was behind the wheel from down the lane there was shouting two men racing toward the lorry ordering it to stop and doors were flung open on either side of the lane light spilling out onto the cobblestones silhouetting people attracted by the noise he heard a womans voice crying out and then the lorry was gone taking the turn into holly street with squealing tires before disappearing up toward the oaks and the open road rutledge was beginning to feel the battering hed taken his ankle throbbing his arm going numb under him and something gouging at his stomach as though trying to tear through his shirt into his flesh he lay there for an instant trying to collect himself and then grace letteridge was standing above him look what youve done she was exclaiming my roses the lorry he said but she was too angry to listen it wouldnt have happened if you hadnt been here poking about its your fault the two workmen went thundering by their breathing loud and one of them swearing the same words spilling out over and over again threatening what he would do when he caught the thief rutledge got slowly to his feet nearly as angry as grace letteridge was taking her by the shoulders he shook her lightly and said shut up and listen to me did you see who was at the wheel shocked into silence she glared at him finally his words seemed to sink in and she retorted no why should i have look at my poor walllook what youve done to my roses the wall can be repaired the roses put back in the ground he turned to the faces staring at him from windows and doorways did any of you get a good look at the person driving there were head shakes denial and one man said there wasnt time dr middleton was hurrying through the garden gate staring around at the damage my good god he said looking rutledge up and down are you in one piece man barely rutledge looked at the torn cloth of his trousers and he had a feeling the dark lines marking his leg were blood from a cut here grace we need your house until i find out whats broken middleton ordered i dont want him in the house she cried ive enough work to do here a voice called from up the lane here doctor bring him in here rutledge swung around to see mrs channing standing beside mrs melford outside hensleys house can you make it that far middleton asked him dont worry ill get there he turned his back on grace letteridge and walked stiffly limping a little out of the garden and toward the two women he could feel her staring at his back her anger still palpable b oth mrs channing and mrs melford followed him into hensleys office with dr middleton at their heels mrs channing disappeared toward the back of the house and mrs melford pushed a chair forward for rutledge to sit in he sat grateful to be off his feet someone came to the door to hand dr middleton the shoe that rutledge had lost by the wall he glimpsed an unshaven face and then it was gone the doctor took the other chair from behind the desk and propped rutledges right leg across it these trousers wont be mended he said and searched in his bag for his scissors cutting the cloth to peel it back from the wounds there was a darkening bruise near his thigh and the back of his leg was bloody a long cut running down the calf middleton looked up as mrs channing came in she said to him theres water on to boil fortunately the fire hadnt gone out she took in the damage to rutledges ankle already turning red over the strengthening blue of a bruise and said you were lucky you know stupid he answered is more to the point middleton straightened turning rutledges face toward him youve scraped your cheekbone on something where else mrs melford followed mrs channing back to the kitchen as rutledge opened his shirt the canes of the rosebushes had left their mark on his shoulder and across one arm on his stomach and along his side their thorns had torn at his hands dr middleton went for the water himself came back to bathe rutledges wounds and sprinkle an antiseptic powder on them then cleaned the gash on his calf youre going to be sore tomorrow the doctor warned him who was that fool driving id like to know he ought to be shot a good question theres a clean shirt in my luggage in hensleys room and another pair of trousers he looked ruefully at the earth caked on his coat and all but filling one of his shoes the doctor finished his work thats three he said tightly hensley towson you id like to know whats going on here damned if i know rutledges cheekbone had begun to throb he put up a hand to touch it realized the hand was filthy and let it drop again whos the lady with mrs melford a friend of hers no shes from london he flexed his arm and shoulder then bent his knee a time or two he wouldnt be climbing back up the spire ladder anytime soon i dont understand was it an accident youd have thought the driver might have stopped if it were it was intentional someone had taken a lorry standing outside one of the houses on church street that would be the lawrences middleton nodded they had worm and much of the wood has to be replaced i say my prayers every night that theres none to be found in my house insidious little beasts he paused i hesitate to ask but you dont believe it was anyone at the lawrences do you i cant for the life of me no rutledge bent to drag his stocking back over a rapidly swelling ankle just as the door opened and the two workmen clad in overalls stepped inside the lorry was just at the top of the rise where holly street runs up to the oaks the older of them said door open no one inside rutledge saw middletons look whoever it was could have slipped back into dudlington or was long since gone up or down the main road whos to pay for the damage then the second of the men demanded itull cost a pretty penny to set things right submit your charges and ill look into it rutledge said did you see anyone prowling about outside the lawrence house while you were clearing away half an hour ago their little dog was shut in a bedroom he barked madly for a few minutes we thought it might be a passing cat illtempered little beast that dog working around him will cost the lawrences i can tell you too bad he didnt sink his teeth in whoever it was stole the lorry ill bring you a list of damages tomorrow his companion promised rutledge were late as it is he considered rutledges injuries nasty piece of work the bastard what did he want to go and do that for with that pronouncement he turned on his heel and ushered the other man out rutledge had buttoned his shirt and was gingerly shoving his foot into a scraped and flattened shoe mrs channing came in at that moment mrs melford has gone to fetch your dinner she doesnt feel you ought to be walking about just yet ill see myself to the inn and we can talk more tomorrow stay he began but she shook her head youve had enough on your plate inspector you shouldnt walk up that road in the dark theyve just found the lorry abandoned there grace letteridge stuck her head in the door half expecting to be turned away her anger had faded and she waited for rutledge to acknowledge her im sorry for yelling at you she said contritely then looked from rutledge to mrs channing i realized afterward that you had nowhere else to go to get out of that fools way what on earth was he trying to do he made no effort to introduce the two women someone stole the lorry and lost control of it as they sped away yes well id like to know who it was ill make him pay for the damages youre in line behind the workmen who lost the lorry is he seriously injured grace letteridge turned to ask dr middleton hell live the doctor said you were rude grace im not best pleased with you just now yes it was ill done she admitted mr rutledge and she was gone shutting the door behind her thank you doctor rutledge said getting to his feet and testing the bad ankle i can manage now i think if you need anything to ease the pain send for me the doctor gathered up his things and closed his bag stay off that ankle if you dont want it twice its size tomorrow a cold bath wouldnt hurt he nodded to mrs channing and left hes a good man she said staring after him yes he had drawn on his coat i dont like the idea of you staying at the oaks im safe enough thereyou arent intending to walk me home are you of course he took several steps while hamish badgered him and said it doesnt hurt however bad it might appear to be youre a liar inspector well theres more hot water on the stove you must soak that ankle for a bit when you come back then use only cold water she collected her own coat and said as she returned you could have been seriously injured who was it did it have anything to do with those wretched casings probably he held the door for her and she stepped out into the street why should someone want to kill you what have you done to earn such hatred i dont know that hes ready to kill just yet hes trying to frighten me you called it waiting was it the person in the church tower very likely then perhaps youre wrong about the casings it could be that youve come too close to the truth here in dudlington he could feel the ankle stiffening in the cold night air i dont know that ive reached that stage yet yet you wonder if it could be keating who drove at you i dont wonder so much as leave the possibilities open she took his arm to steady herself over the cobblestones or so she said but he rather thought it was to help him manage them they walked in silence the rest of the way finally he said as they came to the door of the inn how do you live with what you feelor knowor glimpse very uneasily how do you live with what you suspect when youre halfway through solving a terrible crime how do you even conceal what you feel he thought about westmorland then and the doubts hed felt there and in so many other investigations i decided to become a policeman to speak for the dead they have no one else you see somewhere theres always proof of what happened some piece of evidence that will obtain a conviction its important for the guilty to be brought to justice i think without justice theres chaos that sounds very like revenge inspector no i leave it to the court to judge if im wrong i expect the court to discover that during the trial hamish said nell shaw and he could see her again rough and awkward and bent on bringing him around to seeing evidence as she did evidence to refute her husbands guilt your cases stay with you meredith channing remarked as if shed followed the direction of his thoughts he came quickly back to the present and remembered the woman he was speaking to in the dark as they approached the lights of the oaks he glimpsed her face it was withdrawn looking inward how much did she really know about what was happening to him was she an enemy or a friend rutledge left mrs channing at the door of the inn as she went up the stairs lighted by a faceted chandelier overhead he could hear voices from the bar they were talking about the accident with the stolen lorry he listened for a moment curious to see how it would be viewed someone was saying better if we were rid of him ive heard it said hes not interested in what happened to the constable its an excuse to pry into other matters what other matters a second voice asked therere no secrets here i for one a third voice broke in would like to know the truth about that brother of baylors they say hes scarred afraid to show his face on the street thats ridiculous the second voice retorted well then have you seen him yet someone else asked no but yes well if you ask me hes dying gas in the lungs my wife heard in the greengrocers ted wont talk about it no hes lost one brother he doesnt want to lose the other of the two the first voice put in id take robbie over joel any day robbie was a good man there was general agreement and then the sound of chairs scraping on the floor people were leaving rutledge turned to go as well before anyone found him there eavesdropping just as he reached for the handle to the door he happened to glance back at the staircase at the top of it barely visible in her burgundy coat stood mrs channing her face a pale oval as she looked down the stairs straight at him he left without acknowledging her presence there rutledge found his dinner waiting on the table in hens leys bare dining room it was still warm and he sat down gingerly to eat his ankle ached like the very devil and he realized he shouldnt have walked to the inn and back in the night air but mrs channing had said something about hot water on the stove finishing his meal he carried the dishes into the kitchen and turned up the lamp the teakettle was where mrs channing had told him it was and a hand over the spout told him that the contents hadnt cooled yet he poured water into a basin from under the sink and sat down to take off his shoes the stocking on his right foot was hard to remove and he looked at the discolored ankle with distaste lowering his foot into the water he felt the warmth rise up his leg and the gash on his calf began to sting ignoring it he leaned his head back in the chair before long he could feel himself slipping into sleep it had been a long day he thought and it hadnt ended well hamish said listen and he lifted his head there was a sound from the dining room he called mrs melford the dishes are here in the kitchen she didnt answer or come through after a moment he got awkwardly to his feet and leaving wet tracks behind him he hobbled into the dining room no one was there imagination he thought or the brink of dreaming but hamish wasnt satisfied and rutledge looked around a second time it was then he saw what was lying in the seat of his chair a shell casing picking it up he examined it no carvings just a reminder that he was vulnerable and might well have been run down by the lorry if he hadnt been agile enough to leap over the wall into grace letteridges garden an admission of responsibility he searched the house but he knew it was useless whoever it was had come and gone without being seen rutledge slept poorly that night for one thing his ankle throbbed giving him no peace for another with the doors unlocked there was no safety from intruders and the smallest noise brought him up from restless sleep what did his stalker have to do with constable hensley it was something rutledge found difficult to believethat hensleys wounding had been a ruse to draw him north on the other hand dudlington offered its own peculiar opportunities for drawing him out into the open and any killer worth his salt watched for his opportunity the question was why should he rutledge be stalked in the first place was it yard business then why the cartridge casings from a machine gun used in france if it was something that had happened in the trenches then why leave it this long when the war had ended fourteen months before he was in hospital hamishs voice seemed loud in the bedroom and rut ledge came awake with a start it made sense the more he thought about it the more he believed it could be true but there were thousands of men suffering from war wounds scattered all over the country trying to track down one man among them was hopeless hamish said theres yon farmers brother rutledge considered joel baylor but they had never served together the name was unfamiliar and god knew hed learned the name of every man hed sent into battle he would have remembered revenge was personal as a rule otherwise it was pointless he thought about what mrs channing had said about revenge and that brought him back again to nell shaw there was a very good chance that someone who had been sent to the gallows had left behind a family member with vengeance in his or her heart who was trying to say to him that the war might have delayed retribution but hadnt blunted the desire for it and since rutledge hadnt died in france he was fair game now that sounds very like revenge inspector he could hear that warm melodious voice speaking to him in the dark what had meredith channing to do with his past shed been in france she said and he believed her she had seen him there and he believed that as well but it was when they were brought together at maryanne brownings party that he had come within her reach once more she couldnt have followed himfired at himtried to run him down with the stolen lorry but she could very well have an accomplice a son or nephew or even a paid assassin to do what she physically couldnt it would explain quite tidily why she had learned his address and why she had followed him here to dudling ton to watch him die but was that true or only his feverish imagination searching for a real face in place of the nebulous one that seemed never to be quite mortal hamish said watch your back the night seemed to brighten suddenly as a lamp was lit in the window across from his it took him longer to get out of his bed and to the window than hed expected and the floor was cold under his feet there was someone in emma masons bedroom again and although he watched for a good half hour he couldnt tell who it was he was tempted to walk into the ellison house to see for himself but there was something else he could do shoving his feet into his shoes and wrapping his coat around him with the belt he walked down the stairs to the door and out into the street he found himself a vantage point from which he could see just the window in emmas room and the rest of the darkened house when the light went out at last he waited patiently the window on the stairs was lit for an instant and then the light strengthened again in another pair of windows after a minute or so it was turned out mrs ellison had been in her granddaughters room and finally had found her way back to her own bed he hadnt been alone in his sleeplessness loss rutledge thought took many forms and this was one of them meredith channing had also found it difficult to sleep when the scraping screech of metal had brought her to the door of the constables house she had stood there transfixed rutledge was lying in the lee of a destroyed wall one arm thrown out to brace himself the other one pinned under him and then doors were flung open on all sides as the lorry roared on up the lane and a young woman had come rushing out of a house to scream at the fallen man it was like seeing something in a dream she thought only the sounds were real the shouts and the cries and that unbearable scraping of metal against stone the doctor had come running then though she hadnt known who he was taking charge and silencing the angry woman while rutledge had struggled to one knee then dragged himself to his feet shed come to her senses at that stage knowing what she must do and so she had called out to the doctor and the woman in the house but one had stood there with her saying something about dinner and what on earth had been in that drivers mind to do such damage and then flee when rutledge reached the house she had looked at the scrape on his cheekbone and the bleeding wound in his leg his hands scratched and filthy from the soft earth in the garden lockjaw the woman called mrs melford was saying and she herself had hurried to the kitchen to heat water and find strong soap after all shed been trained she knew what to do in emergencies more to the point it kept her hands busy and all the while her heart had been thudding in her chest like a drum it had been a near thing she thought too near it wasnt until later when she was walking through the winter darkness with her arm touching his that she realized she had stopped thinking about him as a policeman it didnt do to know people she thought it was better to hold them at arms length and then it was easier much easier to stand aside and let them die she had learned that in the war rutledge woke with a start and groped for his watch lying on the bedside table it was late already half past seven he groaned how many hours had he slept at most two or three he felt as if his eyes had never closed he put his foot gingerly over the side of the bed and was relieved to feel less pain than he had during the night hamish his voice muted this morning said aye but its no verra handsome true the swelling was still noticeable the discoloration was worthy of an artists palette but he could stand with his full weight on it after he had laced his shoes the rest of his bruises were complaining but not as vociferously stiffness plagued him though for a good ten minutes before hed worked it out he shaved with haste and presented himself to mrs melford only two minutes late for his breakfast he had to smile at her examination of the way he walked aye she has a cane in yon umbrella stand and so she did but she said nothing about it and disappeared into the kitchen as he sat down to eat when she brought in his tea she finally said im still shocked by what i saw last night it was some time before i could sleep accidents do happen he told her the driver couldnt have been familiar with the weight of a lorry inspector you neednt try to put a better face on it everyone in dudlington is talking about your narrow escape she looked down at him in the chair at the head of her table thats threehensley the rector and now you whats wrong here what kind of monster are we harboring hamish clicked his tongue at the turn gossip had taken i dont think rutledge began but she shook her head id wondered why scotland yard sent an inspector all the way to dudlington just because a constable had been injured i couldnt see why northampton shouldnt look into it but you know something dont you thats really why youre heretheres something else that youre keeping from us i might as well tell you what people are whispering she wouldnt listen when he tried to convince her there was no conspiracy to keep the truth from dudlington she simply walked away saying she was tired of lies trying to shrug off the depression settling over him rut ledge finished his breakfast and was just stepping into the street when the postmistress came out of hensleys house theres a letter for you inspector from the yard i thought it best to bring it to you straightaway thank you she smiled one professional to another and went hurrying back to her little cage in the corner of the shop itull feed the gossip frenzy hamish told him a letter from london yes in fact the letter had come from sergeant gibson im writing this at home it began i dare not leave it lying about at the yard rutledge sat down at the desk in the little office and looked through the two pages of gibsons scrawl hoping to find something of interest what the sergeant had written distilled into its essence was that the search for evidence against hensley was hopeless the sprawling black lines went on the file is straightforward thefire the blame settling on mr barstows competitor and the charges brought against the man but they never went to trial those charges howard edgertons death was put down to infection its what took him off true enough i tried to look up his widow but it appears she went to live with herfamily in devon the competitor a mr worrels lost his business when the whispers had done their work the file is presently listed as unsolved i did discover the name of the man said to have set thefire barstow didnt do it himself you understand he hired a j sandridge who was never caught hed been employed by mr worrels and held a grudge over a promotion that never came his way rutledge stopped reading sandridge where had he heard that name hamish said he doesna live here but rutledge had a good memory for names it had served him well in the war he got up and went searching through the files in hensleys box sandridgesomeone had written a letter inquiring for him it was from a miss gregory asking if there was another address for him coincidence or was there a connection dudlington was too small to hold so many coincidences rutledge went back to gibsons letter but there was nothing else of interest except the last line id take it as a favor if you burned this after reading it after committing the details to memory he did as hed been asked although his foot was complaining stridently rutledge drove to northampton to see hensley but the man was feverish his face flushed his body racked by chills hamish growled something about infection as rutledge drew up a chair hensley said im ill its that damned sister shes been neglecting me but the ward was filled with cases and the nurses were trying to cope matron had ordered rutledge to stay out of their way the wall of a building had collapsed on mercer street and five of the workmen had been brought in for surgery along with two civilians unlucky enough to be walking beneath it rutledge had seen their families waiting in the corridor wives whitefaced and anxious children with large frightened eyes clinging to their mothers and aunts he said constable why did bowles send you to dudlington there must have been a good reason for the choice there was a man retiring markham i was given his place what does it matter i was just as glad to be away from london for a bit for a bit hensley moved restlessly then grimaced they lanced my back this morning i could have told them their incisions werent healing properly they thought i was a com plainer and ignored me why were you happy to leave london and move to the north i was tired of hunting german spies half of it was someones warped imagination the butcher is surly he has an accent hes given some woman a bad bit of beef or the waiter doesnt look english the man bringing in the luggage at a hotel seems furtive wont meet the eyes of patrons when hes spoken to youd think listening that half the population of germany was sneaking about england looking to stir up trouble the speech soundedrehearsed as if hensley had told the story so many times he half believed it himself it had nothing to do with edgerton then it wasnt a question hensley turned to look at rutledge dont put words in my mouth damn you but you know very well who edgerton was and how he died did you also know someone named sandridge hensley said look im not well i shouldnt be badgered like this his voice was sour and he had long since stopped using sir when he addressed his superior although hamish was accusing him of badgering as well rutledge persevered tell me about sandridge a woman wrote to the police in dudlington in search of someone by that name i thought she might be looking for a soldier in the war someone whod made promises he didnt keep or hed been killed and she hadnt been notified not being a relative so to speak i told her to try another village by the name of dudlington in rutland your reply wasnt in the file it ought to have been i put it there myself rutledge wasnt sure whether to believe him or not and thats merely a coincidence the fact that the fire setter in the barstow arson was also a sandridge i never put that together with london why should i its not that rare a name surely sir there were rumors that youd taken money to look the other way when the fire occurred and rumors now that you were responsible for emma masons death where theres smoke i didnt do nothing of the sort here i wont stand for this im a sick man sister a tall thin woman with reddish hair came at his urgent call what is it constable she asked beginning to smooth the rumpled bed linens im not well sister i need to rest i think my fever is worse she touched his forehead then turned to rutledge i think you should leave sir if you would we mustnt distress him just now rutledge stood to go but looking down at hensleys face the eyes turned away his skin taut and red he said when you come back to dudlington will you be safe the eyes swung back to rutledge something in them that reminded him of a cornered animal rutledge felt a surge of guilt i wont be coming back hensley said tensely ive been thinking i could take an early pension and go abroad they do say spain is all right one of the night sisters lived there for a time with an elderly couple i think i might like it they speak spanish there you know not english and then rutledge was walking down the ward toward the door when he looked back hensley was slumped in his bed exhausted the drive back to dudlington ended in a sudden downpour wind whipping the rain through the motorcar one sleeve was wet nearly to the shoulder by the time rutledge turned down to holly street and put his car beside the house and hamish still irritated with him for his callousness in the hospital ward made certain that rutledge was aware of it still he wondered if hensley had told the truth regarding a copy of his response to the letter about sandridge being in the file had he even written it or let sleeping dogs lie rutledge got out stiffly his ankle cold and more painful than he was ready to admit the house was chilly and dark unwelcoming and he always felt a sense of unease when he came in but there was no reason to think anyone had been there although he went into each room to give it a cursory glance changing out of his wet clothes he laid a fire on the hearth in the sitting room and sat down leaning his head against the back of his chair hamish said i wouldna let down my guard sae far rutledge said his eyes closed im not asleep the lassie with the garden she came to apologize you gave her short shrift so i did i was nearly as angry with her as i was with the bastard in the lorry it was just as well yon woman from london wasna with you when the lorry came up the lane i dont know that hed have tried to run me down with witnesses there on the ither hand he could ha waited until she was no in the way before taking the lorry rutledge rubbed his eyes with both hands then massaged his temples i would like very much to know why she told me there was a shadow at my back in friths wood what shed really seen there yet hed felt eyes watching him every time hed been in that wood why would she lie she has nothing to do with this business in dudlington you havena asked her about emma mason he heard someone at the door and then mrs melford called to him he got up to walk to the parlor his stiffened ankle giving him some difficulty he found mrs melford standing there with a basket in one hand and a streaming umbrella in the other you missed your luncheon she said i thought you might like the sandwiches for your tea yes thank you he took the tray from her and said come in if you will youve lived here for many years id like to ask you a few questions about what she asked still holding the umbrella about beatrice ellison and her daughter emma mason she reluctantly furled her umbrella and stood it by the door which she then shut behind her i dont know anything other than gossip you must know that i havent been friendly with mrs ellison since beatrice left i thought the least her mother could do was to let the girl study painting for a bit and see if she was enthusiastic about the discipline of learning it properly that must be quite different from painting for ones own pleasure how did beatrice get on in london splendidly as far as we knew one had only to ask mrs ellison to hear a glowing report who was her daughters teacher do you know if i heard the name i dont recall it you dont question mrs ellison you see shell tell you what she feels is any of your business and nothing more than that but i gathered that she was happy for the world to know that beatrice had prospered even if shed been against the whole idea and then beatrice came home with her child yes that was the first and only time shed come back there were a few people who were terribly catty about it saying that beatrice had grown too famous to bother with dudlington anymore and of course there were others who were saying she hadnt come back because she had nothing to show for her years in london but the little girl and then emma left what was the gossip then of course it was that shed gone to london to find her mother we were sure mrs ellison would rush after her and bring her back that is if it were true that beatrice was a failure and then the whispers began that constable hensley had had something to do with emmas disappearance what sort of whispers that since he knew london hed helped emma escape her grandmothers clutches that somehow he was involved i cant tell you when the suspicion arose that hed had more to do with her disappearance than was proper that hed asked a price for helping and when emma got frightened he did away with her to keep her from telling her grandmother mrs ellison is related to the harkness family everyone is wary of that even the constable i dont precisely know what she could dobut i imagine if she were to ask for an investigation someone would listen do you think mrs ellison knows about such whispers and who do you think would be bold enough to tell her it was a good point thank you mrs melford youve been very helpful he was beginning to take her measure the briskness that concealed her fear of being hurt again the kindness that had remembered his tea and he rather liked her he thought she deserved more happiness than had come her way she nodded and turned to go then asked who was the woman with you yesterday a relation the gossip mill she hadnt brought the sandwiches out of kindness after all or at least not completely we have mutual friends he said lightly she was so clever about how to prepare for the doctor mrs melford answered and picked up her umbrella it surprised me when shed gone rutledge went back to the fire and ate his meal to the accompaniment of hamishs voice still in a foul mood the rain faded in another hour and rutledge limped down to grace letteridges house stopping for a moment to look at the scene of the collision between wall and lorry it had indeed been a near thing he thought and hamish who had been silent for a time said no death perhaps but verra severe injury youd lie like yon constable in a ward with the sisters ignoring you rutledge went on up the walk grace letteridge answered his knock and couldnt stop her eyes from dropping down to his ankle youre walking i see she opened the door wider and reminded him to wipe his feet on the mat i am someone has been seeing to your roses the wall will take more work im afraid yes well i had hoped this rain would settle the canes into the ground again i wont know until the spring if theyve survived ill pay for the damage he said it was your garden that saved me from more serious injuries too bad for my garden she answered and led him into the parlor was that why you came to offer to pay or was there something else on your mind he had intended to ask her outright if she recognized the name sandridge and then decided as hamish growled in the back of his mind that he wasnt sure where grace letteridges loyalties lay instead he had brought a rough map hed made of the village and asked her to pencil in the names in the box representing each house why bring it to me mrs melford or anyone else could have done it for you thats probably true on the other hand id rather not have the fact that im doing this bandied about the neighborhood she took the sheet of paper and unfolded it frowning over it you draw surprisingly well is there some requirement for policemen to be poor at sketching a map ignoring him she began to put in the names of each householder he waited patiently letting her work without interruption after ten minutes she sat back the tip of the pencil between her teeth as she regarded her handiwork nodding to herself she passed the sheet back to rutledge he scanned it searching for one name but it wasnt there he did see that where hensleys house ought to be was the name of the greengrocer freebold doesnt hensley own the house he lives in he asked pointing to it perhaps he does constable markham paid to rent it i dont know what arrangement there is with constable hensley i really dont care to know so hensley could pull up his roots with ease and make spain or another country his home he could also disappear with ease and no one would be worried about property left behind certainly the furnishings in the house while adequate were far from valued pieces an interesting point hamish agreed but look you where is the money he took as a bribe he canna put it into a bank and he canna leave it lying about where anyone stepping in the door can find it put his hands on that money rutledge thought and he might have some leverage with hensley to pry out the truth aye but its no a part of your duty just how much did bowles know or care grace letteridge was saying inspector he came back from his thoughts im sorry i cant believe it was an accident what happened last night but why should someone want to kill constable hensley and then when you come here want to kill you as well it was an echo of what hed heard mrs melford say he answered i dont believe the attacks are related what else could they be in a village this size but he couldnt tell her about the cartridge casings meredith channing was waiting for him when he came home she had set her umbrella by the door and it was dripping a puddle of water across the floorboards when he stepped over the threshold ah youve been away most of the day i wondered how you were managing well enough she nodded so i can see sit down you look very tired it cant be easy concealing the pain for hours even from yourself you must have been a terrifyingly good nurse if you could read your patients mind some of them couldnt speak you know after a while one got used to making a fairly good guess about their needs why did you come here hed asked it before and couldnt stop himself from asking it again i dont know to tell you the truth what i felt with that shell casing on the table in my house was not particularly pleasant and so i sent it back to you but the darkness was still there as if it had left ashadow behind i could see it there feel it even in the night if it disturbed me so intensely i was concerned about how it must have troubled you did you know anyone by the name of edgerton in london edgerton wasnt there a cricket player by that name before the war a tennis player i think rutledge said watching her face but she showed no reaction to his fabrication well then what about him he died of burns after a fire how horrible she stared at him was he a friend i never met him then why do you think i mayve she frowned are you feeling feverish hensley was feverish and that was a cause for anxiety im trying to learn how a man named edgerton tied into this business with the constable your tennis player he smiled at her indeed never mind i expect he died while you were in france theres no reason you should remember him no we were quite cut off from everything but the fighting we seldom had time to think about anything else sorry theres another name im curious about sandridge either she was a very good liar or this name also failed to mean anything to her shaking her head she said no not familiar at all so much for that he thought he couldnt fathom her as well as he read most people she was an enigma behind the charming facade behind the gracious manner and the warm mesmerizing voice what was she i thought perhaps we might call on the rector she was saying if you are up to walking so far he must be lonely he went with her though his preference if asked was to stay by the fire and let the ache in his ankle fade a little they reached the rectory in time to see a woman coming down the walk and rutledge recognized her as the postmistress mrs arundel she nodded to him tipping back her umbrella to say im glad to see you suffered no lasting harm from the look of grace letteridges garden wall you ought to be on crutches they knocked on the front door and hillary timmons answered it looking harried good day sir theyve all come to bring himself somethinga pot of jam a treat from the bake shop a little broth im fair run off my feet trying to keep up weve brought nothing mrs channing said soothingly why dont i sit with him for an hour or so and allow you to rest hillary timmons teetered on the thin edge of duty and then capitulated just an hour if you wouldnt mind she said then have yourself a nap and ill stay with mr towson im even capable of making him tea hes had tea twice already first with mrs freebold and then with mrs arundel she sighed ive never seen such a man for a little bite of something sweet as he puts it yes well then we shant be having tea go on ill show myself up to his room and with that mrs channing started up the stairs rutledge was on the point of following her when she said no youll be bored to tears inspector but you might see if you can find a dickens novel in mr towsons study ill read to him if he cares for a little distraction rutledge discovered bleak house sandwiched between a book of sermons and one of o a mannings volumes of poetry he took the novel up to the rectors bedroom where towson and mrs channing were deep in a conversation that stopped as he came down the passage im well enough inspector he answered rutledges greeting but im told youve had an accident of your own a stolen lorry whod have thought it here in dudlington im happy to see dr middleton didnt clap you in your bed and leave you to die of boredom with only a bruise here and there rutledge responded lightly what i cant understand for the life of me is why someone should steal the lorry in the first place and then abandon it not a quarter of a mile away mrs freebold was telling me that there was a darkhaired man with thin lips and narrowed eyes driving it he wore a hat rutledge said pulled down low i couldnt see more than that ah well that explains why mrs arundel heard he was a large man with an evil expression he smiled i doubt if anyone got a good look at him he left the lorry where no one was likely to see him walk away either from windows at the oaks or from the houses on holly street mrs channing looked at rutledge with a questioning glance but the rector was in full cry now are you trying to tell me he was someone here in dudlington i dont know rutledge answered what do your callers have to say on that subject that he must have held a grudge against the firm doing the work at the lawrence house he must have had the fright of his life when he learned later that the man he nearly ran down in the lane was a policeman from scotland yard serves him right too rutledge found mrs arundel in her little cage at the rear of the bakers shop she smiled at him and said is there a letter you wish to mail to london inspector ill see that it goes first thing in the morning he showed her the map of dudlington that grace let teridge had helped him fill out is this a fairly accurate list of residents he asked she examined it carefully yes yes it is youre very thorough inspector and theres no one else living in dudlington besides the names given here of course you havent listed the children or any of the servants and mrs wainwright is a widow mr neville has never married thank you he took back his list and folded it again he could feel mrs simpsons eyes boring into the back of his head as she strained to hear the conversation he found mrs melford at home busy with a stew for his dinner and he showed her the list as well thats correct inspector she told him handing it back i wonder you need the names of everyone in dudlington surely we arent all under suspicion not at all he assured her but it helps me form a better picture of the village she said then if thats all i must get back to my dinner your dinner and he left it at that hamish said it didna work yon map in a way it did rutledge sat at hensleys desk and ticked off the houses he already knew ellison there let teridge lawrence simpson freebold hensley here the rectory baylor and of course keating at the oaks theres no sandridge here i hadnt expected it to be that easy he put the map away and stood looking round the room if i were hiding something where would i choose it has to be safe from prying eyes sitting here waiting for hens ley to come back to his office or even a determined search by someone intent on finding where hensley kept files or money where still favoring his ankle rutledge began a thorough search starting at the top of the house and working his way down it was hampered by the dark day when lamplight let shadows fall in corners and made it difficult to judge if a board was askew or only appeared that way in poor light hamish reminded him that the house still belonged to the freebolds and it wasnt likely that hensley would choose a secret place they might already know existed room after room rutledge examined every possible place where something could be hidden the bedrooms the bath the stairs the sitting room and dining room the kitchen the cellar where the coal bin filled one corner and old bits and pieces filled another digging through that he came across a sled a broken drying rack for clothes a chair with a missing leg a box of dishes with chipped edges and only one cup a stack of old newspapers for starting fires a carton of tools and a doorknob that had been tossed in by itself yere wasting time hamish told him theres naething to be found but he refused to give up he came back to the lone doorknob and stared at it thoughtfully it looked to be a more recent vintage than the rest of the bricabrac and then he began to pull the litter out of the corner working fast and stacking each item in the center of the earthen floor when hed pulled an old trunk filled with clothing half a century old out of his way he could just feel rather than see the rough edges of a door there was a hole that looked more like a knot in the wood than an actual cavity but he thrust the doorknob inside there must have been a matching knob on the other side because he was able gently to pull the door open just far enough to bring it the rest of the way with his fingers the knob on the far side had been nailed in place giving it stability and as the door opened to the point that he could see in he realized this cabinet was shelved as if once used for jams or preserves it was empty now except for a dark leather satchel and a collection of papers he was just about to draw them out when he heard a voice over his head swearing he left the door where it was and hurried up the stairs as fast as his complaining ankle permitted mrs channing was standing in the parlor office calling his name ive forgotten you he said contritely i should have come back before this no i expected to make my own way to the inn but what have you been doing is that a cobweb in your hair he realized that there was even coal dust on one sleeve and a smudge across the back of his hand searching he said telling the truth id hoped that hensley kept his more important files somewhere less accessible than this room and were you successful she asked no inflection in her voice i was debating whether to shift a large pile of coal when you called me away as far as i can tell thats the only task i have left yes well ill not keep you but if i were you id be careful digging about in cellars with those cuts and scrapes on your hands theyre still open wounds and easily infected i hadnt thought of that ill just find my coat and see you to the inn nonsense im perfectly capable of walking that far alone he waited until he was certain she was gone sitting in the dark parlor for a quarter of an hour only then did he go back down the cellar stairs with his torch and look into the closet the satchel contained money far less than hed expected and the papers were an odd assortment one of them was a letter to the young woman who had been searching for the man sandridge it was straightforward just as hensley had told him denying that there was anyone in dudlington by that name and suggesting that she had got the wrong dudlington the only interesting thing about the reply was that it had been written on official stationery giving it the stamp of authority the others were a collection of interviews in the days following the disappearance of emma mason rutledge took them to his bedroom and in the course of the evening read through them the first documented mrs ellisons frantic summons one morning reporting her granddaughter gone in the night the constables notes were brief she was very upset called miss mason to her breakfast and when there was no answer went up to room to wake her granddaughter she was not there and no indication of hasty departure no letter left behind grandmother then searched rest of house no sign of miss mason i immediately organized a search party calling in every available man spoke to everyone in village house by house covered fields two miles in every direction also barns and sheds the next five or six pages were questions put to various people who had had some contact with emma that last day one of them was martha simpson shed heard words between emma and miss letteridge that morning and it had had to do with london she thought betsy timmons hillarys older sister had remembered emma crying in her room in the afternoon as shed gone upstairs to begin her cleaning hensley himself noted i saw miss emma at around six oclock as she was leaving the bakers shop and she was carrying a letter in her hand when i spoke to her she ignored me i had the impression there was something on her mind he had added her lamp remained burning until late in the night i cant say when it went out the next interview was with the rector he said only that hed seen emma mason at the church the day before her disappearance he had found her sitting there in a pew not mrs ellisons as he rememberedand she seemed to be crying but when he approached her and asked if she was unhappy shed shaken her head and told him that she was praying for her grandmother he hadnt known what to make of that but it was clear that she didnt want to confide in him and he had left her there there was an interview with mrs lawrence she had seen emma as she was leaving the church but emma had turned away from her and instead walked out toward the fields mrs lawrence thought she might be meeting someone there because emma had seemed furtive the final report came from mrs simpson as she was looking out her window just at dusk she had seen emma arguing with a man but she couldnt identify him in the poor light the girl turned and walked into her grandmothers house shutting the door with some force mrs simpson was reluctant to describe the man for fear she might be mistaken and hensley reported that he hadnt pressed rutledge couldnt be sure whether these were copies or the originals which hensley hadnt forwarded to inspector abbot in letherington neither could he be sure whether the constable had kept them to use in his own investigation or was trying to conceal his own personal role in the girls disappearance had he for instance been the man that mrs simpson saw but couldnt name mrs ellison was growing deafshe might not have heard her granddaughter leave in the night for that matter she might not have heard someone come to the door and on some excuse lure the girl out of the house all in all rutledge hadnt found anything incriminating one way or the other not sufficient money to prove that hensley had taken a bribe in london nor any proof that hed had something to do with the girls disappearance what was odd was that the letter regarding sandridge and the interviews regarding emma mason had been stored here together as if there was some connection setting the interviews aside rutledge considered what hed read who had the girl been speaking with when mrs simpson saw her at dusk was it hensley if so hed adroitly covered his tracks by admitting to encountering her on the street and mrs simpson had seen emma walk into her grandmothers house afterward but whom had she met when she walked into the fields after leaving the church if the bakers wife had suspected it was hensley on the street with emma mason at dusk it would explain the rumors blaming the constable for her disappearance a comment here a remembered remark there a lively imagination adding another bit of information and before very long suspicion would be rampant hamish said yere forgetting yon woman with the rosebushes grace letteridge might easily have been the person to start a rumor about hensley for reasons of her own shed quarreled with emma was it an old jealousy between them rearing its head again over robert baylor hed said once that jealousy was a crime of hot blood something could easily have stirred it back to life again emma mason might not have walked out of her grandmothers house in the middle of the night to meet a man but she could very well have come down to the door if a distressed grace letteridge had knocked it was an image he couldnt get out of his mind emma her bedroom lamp burning late into the night still awake grace letteridge watching from her own windows until mrs ellison had gone to bed then waiting for the older woman to fall asleep the village quiet only the sound of the church clock striking the hour grace standing in her doorway to be sure no one was watching and then slipping across the street emma answering her door because dudlington was a village where she knew everyone and feared no one and grace standing there tears in her eyes saying she couldnt sleep that they had to make up their quarrel then and there then coaxing urging emma to come to her house where they could talk without disturbing mrs ellison and emma vulnerable and easily led following her across the street and into the house the door shutting behind her he wondered if hensley had been standing at his own darkened window watching emma in her room pacing the floor his field glasses offering him a clear view of her face as she moved back and forth across his line of sight and then tired he put up the glasses and went back to his bed emmas light still burning unaware that in five minutes tenemma would be lured to her death if this was trueany of itthen why had grace or anyone else shot hensley with an arrow why stir up the past by reminding people of emma and the suspicion that she was buried in friths wood what had happened that had forced grace letteridge to act the rain had been swept away by first light the wind heralding clearing and colder weather rutledge went down to the kitchen and blew the fire into life to heat his shaving water hamish said the men shaved in the trenches in cold water yes well our gas masks had to fit smoothly im not in france now you havena thought of westmorland for some time the voice in his head had a hard edge this morning turning from one harrying to another but it was true he hadnt hostages to fortune he said aloud taking the kettle upstairs with him he knew himself he was the sort of man who would have been happier settled into a good marriage with children coming in a few years if the war had never happened if hed married jean in he might already have a child of three clinging to his hands or asleep on his knee and another due in the spring a very different world that instead hed gone to france had fought in the trenches for four horrific years and then come home damaged by what hed seen and what hed done he shuddered to think how a child might view hamish children were quick to grasp the subtleties of emotions around them to see through evasions and quickly identify prevarication he couldnt explain and he couldnt explain awayhow do you tell a child that its father is haunted there must be a wayother men had done it but that was a lie and he was beginning to understand that whatever he might have felt for elizabeth fraser if hed been free of his guilt and shell shock he had nothing to offer her now she had been right to tell him not to come back to westmorland even if she didnt understand the reasons why he would accept her decision he must quietly shut that door and never open it again he stood there looking in the mirror damning the war damning the men who began it and the officers who plotted each battle as he began to shave rutledge remembered one of the charges leveled against the highestranking planners and tacticians at general headquarters that they had lost touch with the reality of war on the battlefield and had ordered charge after charge into the teeth of the machine guns as if they were facing an inferior enemy who would break at the sight of sheer numbers officers far from the carnage of no mans land for whom casualties were regrettable numbers on a morning report werent faced with the bleeding bodies one stepped over in a broken retreat to the lines what had these men brought back from france how had they slept at night with their blunders and stubbornness and their guilt they didna suffer any guilt hamish told him bitterly they didna see what they had done what of the hundreds of faceless men on the streets looking for work trying to pick up the threads of family life hoping that the dying had made a better britain and finding they were lost in it faceless men people stepped around them now ignored the brave boy whod marched away to glory and now begged on the street because a onearmed man couldnt work he thought sometimes in the dark corners of his mind that the dead were the lucky ones they hadnt been disillusioned he was still in a dark mood when he went to his breakfast mrs melford was in the kitchen he could hear her moving about how did she feel cooking meals for strangers to make ends meet in the aftermath of war that train of thought took him to mrs ellison who had lost her daughter and her granddaughter but had held on to her pride in her name mrs melford brought his tea and said there was a fire this morning did you know a fire he repeated trying to bring his mind to bear on this news where i was hoping you could tell me what had happened mrs simpson said something about the baylor house barbara melford had avoided using ted baylors first name she didnt add that that was the one place she felt barred from going any word would have to come to her secondhand ill look into it he said was there much damage i dont knowmrs simpson did say that no one was hurt thats good news he finished his breakfast paid his account and walked down the lane in the cold sunshine the heavy odor of charred wood reached him on the wind when he turned into church street but when he came nearer he couldnt see any signs of fire in the front of the house he knocked at the door and an angry ted baylor answered it another vulture come to gawk he asked im a policeman rutledge responded well i can tell you it was nothing that would involve scotland yard my brother had nightmares in his sleep and knocked over his lamp it burned a good part of the table the cloth over it the carpet under it and scorched the floor before i smelled smoke and smothered the flames hed fallen asleep with his lamp burning is there a law forbidding it rutledge himself had slept with his lamp burning for the first weeks after hed left the clinic in a vain attempt to keep the nightmares away before hed left for warwickshire he had slept sitting in his chair more often than lying in his bed theres no law forbidding it but i understand the need for it i dont see how you could baylor said his anger draining and his face lined with exhaustion unless you were in the war i was on the somme rutledge told him simply baylor pulled the door closed behind him and stood on the step with rutledge its been hard dealing with the screams i dont sleep much myself hes all right when hes awake hes been to london to the doctors they havent helped sometimes i find myself thinking he would have been better off dead you dont mean that i dont know whether i do or not joel has always been a trial he looked out over the fields this land is in my blood but not in his he wasnt born here he doesnt have the same feeling for it maybe you have to be bred to it robbie was he reminded me of my grandfather an easy understanding of what animals need even a stray cat would come to him for petting and he was thrown away in the war his life wasted joel is city bred he likes the crowded streets the smell of the river when there was fog coming in the way the nights were never really dark first time he heard an owl he was petrified a smile lingered at the corner of his mouth but he was unaware of it i told him it was a demon out in friths wood searching for the damned the night it screeched outside his window on that tree over there he climbed in bed with robbie and pulled the sheet over his head and the next morning my father took his strap to me for frightening my brother well half brother we werent as kind to him then as we could have been he was a fish out of water and we should have made it a little easier than we did ive tried to make it up to him he had been talking like a man deprived of human companionship spilling out his frustration and his guilt and his strong sense of duty hamish was saying and how did yon brother see it baylor said as if answering him i expect he forgave us after a bit but we didnt know what to make of him when he came to live with us after his grandmother died she was always partial to him probably because he had no one else but we were jealous robbie and i for no reason other than the fact that he was different from us rougher around the edges arrogant sometimes generally offputting when we least expected it a trial at school as wellbetter at football than we ever were faster in his reactions stronger he shivered as he stood there in the cold wind in only his flannel shirt and yet he seemed reluctant to return to the warmth of the house rutledge could sense that baylor was ridden with guilt yet again for wishing that joel had died in the fire in his room his lungs filled with smoke but the man had saved his brother and there was nothing the law could do about wishes after a moment baylor turned to him and said as if the words were pulled from him how is she he didnt pretend he didnt know i should think shes wondering what went wrong i found her crying after you left that night baylor swore with feeling its hopeless but i wont shame joel by telling her that i shouldnt have told you as much as i have sometimes the words seem to spill out and i cant stop them it was wrong have you talked with the rector he seems to be a man of great understanding thats why i cant talk to him he looked at rutledge hed understand too much i just have to soldier on and get through it what happened to joel in the war rutledge felt himself tense knowing what the answer would be shell shock but baylor surprised him he was gassed at ypres his lungs are rotted out i listen to him at night and i curse them all the generals and the germans and the wind blowing his way that morning he said it smelled of violets odd thing for a city man to tell you but thats what he said yes ive heard the same thing there was silence between them the church clock struck the half hour finally baylor took a deep breath and prepared to go back inside his house you have a gift for listening if i didnt know better id say you tricked me into talking but theres been no one since rob died and its been building up id ask you to forget what you heard if i didnt think it was impossible go back to your brother i wont add to the gossip mill he left baylor standing there and walked back the way hed come the odor of smoke was still strong hed made a promise to baylor but he knew mrs melford was waiting for news by the time he reached the lane he knew what he was going to say to her mrs melford was standing at her front window just behind the lace curtains the sun touched them and gave them an opaque quality that would have concealed her if she hadnt moved as he came toward her door she opened it and invited him in a lamp fell over no harm done just a small fire quickly put out i expect it was alarming at the time did you tell him i was worried should i have mrs melford shook her head no certainly not the worst fire i can remember in dudlington was in a cattle barn im glad it was not that she stood there for a moment longer as if hoping he would give her more details a verbatim account of what had been said then she nodded saying good morning inspector rutledge drove into letherington to send a telegram to gibson at the yard cain crossing the street saw him and came to speak to him news then a request for information thats all he finished his telegram and then turned back to cain do you know anyone by the name of sandridge sandridge he shook his head means nothing to me any particular reason for asking rutledge said in hensleys files theres a letter requesting information about the man he kept it in his files i wondered why sometimes the most obscure fact can turn out to be useful true how is hensley by the way feverish i couldnt be sure how much of it was pretense for my sake and how much was real infection he said youve not made much progress cain commented so far the best evidence is that the attack had to do with emma masons disappearance but the village is silent about her they think shes buried in that wood and theres the end of it is she i dont believe she is ive looked at the ground digging there would be a major venture therere the roots for one thing and a deep layer of leaf mold any disturbance would be obvious youre thinking of a real burial put a body out there under a bed of leaves and let the animals dispose of it where you have cattle and sheep theres feed and if you have feed therere bound to be mice if not rats and the wood is an ideal habitat for creatures that eat bones rats dont know about the saxons then why didnt the first searchers find her do you really think they made a careful search of the area theres no certainty they looked beyond the surface a clever man could have made the ground appear untouched youre the devils advocate no im simply offering possibilities hamish was not impressed ye ken hes ambitious with an eye for london rutledge said then bring me a dozen men who arent superstitious and lets begin quartering the wood where are you going to find them not in lethering ton or even fairfield ask chief inspector kelmore in northampton come with me now rutledge said and well make a beginning there should be shovels and rakes in hensleys shed cain laughed is this a challenge old man just an eagerness to test your theory before we inconvenience the chief inspector where is she buriedassuming shes deadif she isnt in the wood someones cellar rutledge answered him and turned to walk back to his motorcar cain followed him beneath the floor of a cattle barn is more likely considering the stench there a decomposing body would hardly be noticed rutledge drove back to dudlington with his mind on more than the road as he made the turn by the oaks he saw mrs chan ning standing in the drive looking up at the sky keating beside her was pointing out a flock of geese flying over she looked absorbed in what he was saying and keating appeared to be enjoying himself as he talked about the birds she had a knack rutledge thought of seeming all things to all people he wondered if she gave a damn about birds but her face showed only interest as if she had spent her life studying the habits of wildfowl his last glimpse of her as he drove down holly street was of the burgundy coat snapping around her ankles in the wind and one hand holding hard to her hat she must have noticed his motorcar because she appeared on his doorstep not a quarter of an hour later did you hear about the fire she asked him as she walked into hensleys parlor he had taken the time to stop at the greengrocers for a packet of tea and the kettle was already heating she could hear it whistle from the door it was the latest gossip over my breakfast she followed him into the kitchen and watched as he searched for sugar and tinned milk then took down the cups and saucers did you see the geese fly over theyre such a pretty sight calling encouragement to one another changing places in the lead to keep from tiring im impressed you didnt come here to talk about birds he said waiting for the tea to steep but yes i saw you she quoted theres a beauty in birds on the wing that stirs the heart and makes earthbound creatures long for flight but the larks above the battlefield are silenced by the sounds of war i have watched birds out at sea catching the wind and longed to follow them to some safe place far from here he stopped short it was o a mannings poem safe yes i thought you might know those lines mrs chan ning said comfortably as if she had discovered a fellow enthusiast mr towson is fond of the poems as well we had an interesting conversation about them he had investigated the death of o a manning and it had left a deep scar on his soul had she known that too youre a woman of many talents he said neutrally she took her cup and sipped appreciatively theres nothing like a good cup of tea on a wretchedly cold day why are you so suspicious of me am i he parried you have been since the night we met ive told you ive no reason to wish you ill i wish i could believe that you have an uncanny ability to make people like you but theres that undercurrent of knowledge that you shouldnt by rights have do you think i wouldnt have warned you if id known about the lorry i wish you could tell me who it was who shot constable hensley with a bow and arrow in friths wood she frowned are you asking me to help you it was a rhetorical question nothing more i cant call up visions at will you know if i could id have done a great deal of good in this world by warning others of their imminent danger but sometimes i find myself uncannily accurate and thats frightening i dont want to know the day of my death or your death or any other sad thing thats better off hidden from all of us could you put your hand on patients in the aid stations and know which would live and which would die i didnt need to i could look at the doctors faces and read the answer there but yes in time you come to have a sixth sense about such things i didnt like it and i fought against it i even tried to distance myself not allowing my emotions to be touched it didnt work mrs channing finished her tea and set the cup aside thank you inspector that was very good do you wish me to go back to london and leave you to it she had a way of interjecting a complete change of thought into an apparently innocuous remark i dont know he answered her truthfully i wish i knew what it was you wanted she stood there looking down at him if i hadnt alarmed you with my pretense of a seance you wouldnt have left mrs brownings party early someone else might have seen that shell casing and thought nothing of it instead you found it and it has brought something frightening into being i feel responsible in a sense you see youre saying that whoever came out firstmyself or commander farnumwhoever set up the casing would have decided that man was his victim she didnt answer him what if it was the doctor he hadnt been in the war then it would have been someone else on another day it was a very interesting possibility but she didnt wait to discuss it he got to his feet to help her into her coat and with a smile she was gone the quiet room seemed to close in on him he got up and walked to the door looking at the lock that had no key he wasnt certain whether it was worse to think of himself as the target of someone with a grudge against him or to see himself as a target of opportunity a man with a grudge was at least comprehensible could even be tracked down and stopped someone who had chosen him at random was like smoke in the dark invisible until his victim stumbled into it it was late and the afternoon light was waning when rut ledge found a rake and a pitchfork in the shed behind hensleys house just where hed expected them to be there was also a shaded lantern and a sturdy pair of boots the wind was still very cold but dropped with sunset by seven oclock the shops were closed and the streets all but deserted he put the spade and shovel into the motorcar tested the shaded lantern in the kitchen found his torch and as soon as his dinner was over he drove out of dudlington he left the car very close to where hed found hensleys bicycle then climbed the wall on the far side of the road and made his way across the fields toward friths wood hamish a good covenanting scot kept up a grumbling monologue in rutledges head reminding him that daring the devil in the dark of night in a haunted wood was little short of madness it isna wise to open doors that have no business opening im here to close one he answered somewhere a fox barked twice he walked on grateful that there was no moon to pick him out a lone figure on the brow of the rolling pastures when he reached the wood he stopped to take his bearings he could see lighted windows here and there in the village and even the weathercock on the top of the church spire reflected their glow there was no one in the pastures no one following him from the road no one ahead of him in the wood all the same for a moment he wished he could tell hamish to set a watch as he had done so many times in the trenches three years he thought a long time for a body to lie among the trees but there were a few bones that might survive even now if he knew where to look for them he began by working through the brambles and vines using his hands where he could bringing up the rake or the pitchfork for areas he couldnt reach the shielded lantern was used sparingly for as his eyes adjusted to the darkness he could see more than he would have believed possible he thought this is how an archaeologist must feel exploring one small square at a time unveiling what lay below the surfaceor didnt lie therewith great care rotted trunks and fallen branches had turned into crumbled wood and there was layer after layer of wellrotted leaves the rake was deep into one corner when a skull came to light small and with a pointed muzzle a fox he thought crawling in here to die in peace he buried it again and kept going there was the scurry of mice in another place and he overturned a nest of furlined leaves and four tiny white shivering bodies setting it back in place he thought he heard something behind him like the bones of dead fingers clacking together but it was only the boughs and bare branches rubbing together in the wind he worked for more than an hour then stopped to catch his breath it was a hopeless task he told himself one man on his own the wood had been searched after all by men who were afraid hamish retorted they wouldna care to find the devil under a bush there was some truth in that the church clock had struck two in the morning and he was tired but he had begun to learn the way the ground under his feet was constructed and where the brambles grew thickest he could pass on because they had been settled here far longer than three years their canes deep in the leaf mold and their bases thick as his wrist with old growth by three hed covered more of the wood than hed expected and he began to think looking around him that he might finish before the late dawn broke but by four he had still had no luck and this particular part of the wood had seen some wind damage in the past for there were more downed trunks than elsewhere he moved each one shone his shielded torch along the length sending beetles and spiders fleeing from his light before letting it go again some broke apart in his hands and others wet with dew and slick with green moss left an unpleasant miasma in the air and a slippery coating on his gloves he had worn heavy boots borrowed from hensley and a pair of the mans corduroys hanging in the closet and two layers of sweaters over his shirt now he was sweating heavily and his muscles were beginning to ache his ankle had been ready to quit an hour ago a wildgoose chase hamish said dryly better a feather bed rutledge chuckled just as his pitchfork bit into something with a very different feel leaving the tool where it was he knelt to clear away the earth from its prongs smoothing and pushing gently by turns until he had found what he was after he brought the lamp closer the pitchfork had buried itself between a jaw and a shoulder blade in what had once been a human neck rutledge rocked back on his heels hamish said the saxon massacre but rutledge didnt think it was there was more definition in the bones than something from the dark ages whether it was emma mason or not he couldnt judge but it was time to call in experts who could covering his find carefully so that it was neither visible nor vulnerable he stood up and shouldered his implements hamish said will ye stop now it was a good question he had another two hours until daylight and it was possible that he would never have a better chance his muscles complained his hands were cold through his wet gloves he was tired enough to sleep on the open ground as hed done more than once during the war still he went back to work as methodically as before and after another hour and threequarters of digging he hadnt made any other gruesome discoveries he could see an opalescent light on the horizon as he trudged back across the fields toward his motorcar he and hensleys tools were filthy from the digging and he tried to clean his boots a little before stepping behind the wheel the seat was cold and damp with the dew as he drove back to dudlington and left the car in its accustomed place and he could feel his fatigue as he stowed the tools where hed found them a hot bath helped to wake him up and took away some of the strain on his body and as soon as he had eaten his breakfast he drove south to northampton where he could find a telephone his call to the yard was patched through to chief inspector bowles who gave him a lecture on the speedy resolution of his cases we dont have the time for arcane wanderings in the past rutledge whether there were saxons on the rampage in the time of alfred has no bearing on who shot constable hensley i understand sir no you dont ive been summoned by my own superiors and all ive got to report to them is silence what has this skull got to do with hensley pray rutledge took a deep breath if the skull is that of a missing girl it may begin to explain why he was attacked to prove that it is the girl i need someone from the yard experienced in skeletons mainwairing for one can you spare him for a day or two mainwaring was one of the most experienced men at the yard he had been trained as a doctor but he had found the dead far more interesting than the living and he had made a study of bones he could tell very quickly whether a skeleton was that of a man or a woman what age theyd reached at the time of their death and oftentimes what had killed them there was silence at the other end of the line then bowles said youre sure this could be the missing girl i dont want mainwaring wasting his time on those damned saxons three days sir one to take the train as far as northampton one in dudlington and another to return to london ill be waiting for him at the red lion in northampton bowles was still reluctant do you think hensley killed the blasted girl is that what you want to prove his voice conveyed his disbelief if the girl is buried there then his presence in the wood would have alarmed the killer if i found her theres no reason hensley couldnt have done the same given the right conditions i see yes well that makes sense you cant be sure on your own about the skull we must think in terms of bringing the case to trial sir if im wrong about the body there in friths wood then i must look elsewhere for a reason behind the attack before we make fools of ourselves in court he managed just the right cajoling tone to mask the threat in his words friths wood thats a pagan name if i ever heard it not surprised something nasty happened there very well mainwaring will be on the next available train the connection was cut as bowles put up the phone with a heavy hand rutledge standing in the small telephone closet at the red lion hotel swore softly to himself if he was wrong about emma mason bowles would never let him forget it out on a limb was the last place the superintendent wished to find himself even on behalf of one of his own waiting for mainwaring to come north rutledge went back to the hospital in the center of town matron forbade him to speak to hensley he has a high fever and dr williams has moved him into a private room then let me speak to dr williams hes left for the day i suggest you come back tomorrow there may be some improvement by then rutledge feeling the first stages of exhaustion had taken a room at the hotel and he slept for five hours hardly aware of where he was by ten oclock that evening mainwaring had arrived he was nearly as tall as rutledge broad shouldered and fair he was also filled with curiosity rutledge walking with him back to the red lion was peppered with questions about the skeleton youll see it for yourself tomorrow he finally told his companion is it true youre leaving the yard to work for the british museum mainwaring laughed im putting in for chief inspector if it doesnt come through ill consider the victoria and albert youve been in the yard longer than i have why hasnt your promotion come through im not happy sitting at a desk directing others rutledge told him im content dealing with cases firsthand yes well we all say that dont we until were given advancement is the dining room still open do you think im starved they left early for dudlington and mainwairing who hadnt been to the area found the drive interesting as the oaks came in view at the top of the rise he said i have a wager with george reston that theres only one pub in the village youd win how is george his shoulder is much better but the legs taking its own sweet time motorcar accidents are the very devil and getting worse i hope you brought your boots weve a long walk ahead of us rutledge had reached hensleys house and turned in the door is always open you wont need a key a bed is a different story they walked into the house and mainwaring looked around with surprise these are your accommodations id have thought youd been put up at the oaks this is constable hensleys house a woman next door prepares his meals for him he offered to let me live here while hes in hospital an arrow is a nasty piece of work if they dont strike something vital straightaway then you die of septicemia from the dirty point dont say that hensleys got a fever now they waited until well after dark as rutledge had done before driving up the north road then walking out through the fields mainwaring said is all this secrecy necessary possibly the girls grandmother lives in dudlington as soon as someone sees us carrying tools toward the wood the gossip will fly and i dont want it to reach her before i do no i agree they walked in silence for a time and as the wood loomed dark in its fold of land mainwaring whistled the haunted wood thats exactly what most of the people in this vicinity believe has it ever been cleared out who knows it may have been larger in the past and whittled away until this was all that was left or it may be the same size its always been he shifted the pitchfork on his shoulder but when the village was moved here and rebuilt in the shadow of it the houses turned their backs to it superstition is a powerful emotion my family live near avebury my grandfather swore he saw lights moving among the stones on moonless nights he broke off speaking of lights they could see what appeared to be a shaded lantern bobbing among the trees get down rutledge murmured and they dropped to their haunches their silhouettes blending into the ground for another quarter of an hour they watched the light then it was doused and whoever had walked there seemed to vanish rutledge dropped his pitchfork stay here he started running at an angle to the trees keeping his profile low intending to cut off whoever had been in the wood after several minutes he saw someone walking up the slope of the dower fields toward the village whoever it was he was wearing a long coat that flapped around his ankles as he kept up a brisk pace a hat pulled low changed the shape of the head rutledge thought perhaps whoever he was chasing was glad to be out of the wood and trying to reach the security of the village as quickly as possible the figure had reached the far side of the church when rutledge ran hard toward the back garden of the rectory and used the shadows of its walls to hurry toward the churchyard he stumbled over a low tombstone choked off a curse and then ran on trying to watch where he put his feet as he came around the far corner of the church he nearly collided with the figure it let out a cry of alarm recovered and tried to turn back the way it had come but rutledge was on it catching at the nearest shoulder with an iron grip a lantern fell to the ground rolling under his feet the figure ducked twisted and almost broke his grip but as it struggled the hat came off and rutledge pulled his quarry around for a good look at its face only it wasnt a man it was mrs ellison rutledge was shocked into speechlessness of all the people he had expected to find in friths wood mary ellison was the last he released her at once she stood there and he could feel her eyes glaring at him but her voice was husky as she spoke you arent the only one to watch from windows she said what have you found in the wood who was the man you brought back to dudlington with you inspector cain is my granddaughter there in the wood tell me i dont know he began still at a loss for words what could he say to her hamish answered his thought nothing its too soon rutledge said aloud weve been searching quietly so as not to cause you pain or give people a reason to gossip she was still breathing hard i saw you putting the implements into the car i saw you leave where else would you be taking a rake or a pitchfork at that hour of the night but the wood i couldnt sit there waiting her voice shook i have a right to know what youve found and why you brought that other man here mrs ellison let me take you home she seemed to shrink into herself it cant be my granddaughter i wont believe it in that heathen unblessed place no i refuse to believe it what did you find when you got to the wood nothing she was still breathing hard it was dark and the lantern cast shadows everywhere i couldnt stay any longer that place terrifies me nothing in the world could ever have taken me there but emma let me see you to your house its very cold and youve had a shock she shook her head i know my way go back there and do whatever it is you have to do as his own breathing slowed he watched her walk steadily down church street and turn into whitby lane and then he went on across the fields again to find mainwairing he wasnt where rutledge had left him and it was clear that his curiosity had got the better of him rutledge went down to the wood the leaf mat under his feet was silent and he walked carefully almost from memory mainwaring had his torch and the lamp and he was on his own there it was hamish speaking a flash of light caught his eye and he went in that direction mainwaring nearly jumped out of his skin when rut ledge spoke from behind him found any bones blast you rutledge did you catch whoever it was you were chasing yes lets get on with it this way it took him a few minutes to find the bones again and he gently pushed aside the covering hed drawn back over them mainwaring squatted at his heels interesting saxon massacre victim lord no not at all look at the condition this wood isnt the irish peat bogs you know the conditions here are deplorable here let me get closer they exchanged places and rutledge held the lantern while mainwaring worked it took some time to clear enough of the skeleton to make a judgment the small bones were gone carried off long since to feed whatever animal had discovered them but the skull was there and the shoulders part of the rib cageand the pelvis mainwaring whistled under his breath while he worked as if to keep the spirits at bay at one point he said to rut ledge i can see why the locals dont like this place i dont much care for it myself when i walked under the branches of the first trees i felt as if id stepped back in time to something ugly do you believe in ghosts ian i could be persuaded to here what are those the thigh bones yes best indicator of height but the feet are gone he continued to work the lantern light shining on his face and on the bones that came to light under his careful prodding his hands moving delicately as he cleared away rotting leaves and earth that should do it he said getting stiffly to his feet you can have the local maninspector cain was it bring in people to finish the work theres no point in keeping this business secret any longer youre telling me then that weve found what we came here to find rutledge felt depressed it was a sad end for the pretty lively girl he had pictured in his mind now the question was who had brought her here and hidden her body and what was he going to tell mary ellison tomorrow morning this morning mainwaring was cleaning his hands on his handkerchief you were right to send for me it wouldnt have done to pursue this case under the impression it explained hensleys unfortunate wounding he couldnt have had anything to do with our bones rutledge said im sorry ive just poked a hole in your favorite theory this isnt your lost emma mason this is a mans body probably closer to thirtyfive than to forty but he didnt bury himself which says he was murdered i cant tell you how theres nothing on the remaining bones to show us inspector cain came with his team of workmen and watched them scour the area around the site of the burial looking for more evidence the people of dudlington clustered close by the church watching silently but unwilling to come any nearer rutledge had knocked on mary ellisons door as soon as hed reached dudlington fairly certain she hadnt gone to bed she answered the door fully dressed and stood there staring at him waiting for the blow to fall he said we didnt find emma i dont know whether thats a comfort to you or not he thought for an instant she was going to fall for she swayed and then caught the edge of the doors frame with her hand i cant tell you whether it is or not at my age theres not much time left to hope the body was brought out of friths wood in a blanket and carried to letherington speculation was rife mrs melford and mrs arundel had found an opportunity to speak to rutledge and mrs channing had come down to hensleys parlor her face filled with sadness i think im going to return to london she told rut ledge when there was a chance to speak to him privately i dont like this place it seems so bleak this morning with everyone unsettled by whats happening in the wood i saw the rector go into mrs ellisons house hobbling on crutches i would have taken my oath that id found her granddaughter and i think she believed i had as well although i didnt tell her what wed discovered just as well shes a strong woman shell manage still it brought everything back to her im sure yes who is the young man who was working with you hes from london mainwaring had gone up to hensleys bed and fallen asleep there not stirring for several hours rutledge wished he could have done the same two nights without rest had left him groggy and the ankle that had plagued him for several days had begun to ache again like the very devil from stumbling over the grave in the churchyard hamish withdrawn and silent seemed tired as well mrs channing her mind elsewhere said thoughtfully this exonerates constable hensley the girl wasnt buried in the wood after all or so everyone is saying but what happened to emma mason i dont know i dont suppose anyone will i dont think id be very good at police work its dreadful sometimes isnt it dreadful yes i took the liberty of making tea she told him youll find it on the dining room table thank you i dont seem to have much appetite this morning he walked into the dining room and poured himself a cup adding sugar and a little milk she followed him there and stood in the middle of the room as if uncertain what to do go or stay did you really want those bones to belong to the girl he reached in his pocket for a telegram that inspector cain had handed him that morning while waiting for his men to do their macabre work in the wood i asked one of my best men in london to find what he could about beatrice ellison and her daughter emma mason he couldnt trace either of them mrs ellison believes her daughter died when the germans marched through belgium it may be true even so it doesnt explain what became of emma she took the telegram and scanned it yes i see this then was your last hope the body in the wood it may still be there of course but i have a feeling it isnt i understand she went back to the office to fetch her coat was there a young man involved in the girls disappearance do you think if shes married and living elsewhere shed be hard to find there was a young manhe was set to marry someone else whether she got herself involved with him or not i dont know he died in the war theres a memorial to him in the churchyard then she disappeared by her own choice perhaps because of that someone else it would be hard to live in a village this small with the other woman so to speak for a time he said i thought the other woman had killed her her eyebrows went up it could still be true id dig up that rose bed if i thought it would do any good he said half to himself it was hamish who answered him or look beneath yon wall grace letteridge came to call shortly after mrs channing had gone back to the oaks she stepped briskly into the office and said i expect i owe constable hensley an apology i always believed it was he who killed her that he went to the wood time and again to see if anything had been disturbed it made sense that he couldnt stay away that he wasnt able to put it out of his mind out of guilt but shes not there after all rutledge said hensley isnt well he may not live whoever shot him may be guilty of murder i didnt do it if thats what youre accusing me of you told me once rutledge said taking the chair behind the desk and leaning back in it that you would like to see him dead she made a gesture with her hand as if brushing away his words im not a murderer although i do have a temper sometimes i wont deny that were back where we began then tell me how old is your rose garden if youre asking me if emma is buried there youre a fool we could dig it up and find out inspector cain can bring his men back to do it after theyve finished in the wood she turned to go youll have to get a warrant first she told him i wont let you touch it without one rutledge was leafing through the file on emma mason when mainwaring came in from conferring with the police in letherington ive talked to the local peoplecain and his sergeant and their coroner your body has probably been out there in the wood for some time we arent in agreement about how long but if you want my best guess it would be forty years forty indeed weve examined the bones in good light and in more detail looked at the condition and sifted through the soil around and under them and this is what came out of the earth under them he held out a slim gold toothpick rutledge took it turning it in his fingers it had been engraved christmas it doesnt prove he died then he could have carried this for many years and this it was a farthing cleaned of its earth and corrosion and it too bore the date whoever went through his pockets missed both of them how many memories go back that far to cain has promised to go through his predecessors files yes thats the right place to start rutledge agreed our bones must have come from one of the villages close by if not dudlington itself friths wood is too far off the main road and half hidden to boot its not the most likely place for a stranger to conceal a body for one thing he wouldnt know of the stigma attached to the wood the reverse could be said for the local people they want no part of that wood and i cant say i blame them cain had the devil of a time getting his work party together hamish said i wouldna wait for yon inspector to sift through files theres no pressing need to hurry by his lights it was true but then mrs arundel the postmistress could give him a list of the oldest inhabitants of dudling ton i must say ian that you do have the most interesting luck im glad not to be in your shoes when bowles hears of this mainwaring held out his hand cain has found someone driving to northampton and i should just make my train good luck old man youre going to need it rutledge said early days yet they shook hands and mainwaring took the stairs two at a time on his way to fetch his case when he came down again rutledge had already gone mrs arundel sitting behind her brass cage considered rutledges question the oldest residents well mrs lawrence on church street for one she lives with her grandson and his wife patricia mr cunningham of course but hes not very clear in his mind most days it was the lorry belonging to workmen at the lawrence house that had run him down mrs melford had informed him that they were turning one of the smaller bedrooms into a nursery yes i think i know the house he thanked the postmistress and left patricia lawrence answered rutledges knock she was clearly pregnant her maternity smock hardly concealing her condition when hed explained his business she said doubtfully my husbands grandmother is a lovely old lady but she can be quite dotty at times i dont know if youll have much luck the elder mrs lawrence was reading in a small parlor on the first floor her glasses were perched on her nose but her eyes were shut and a soft whistle accompanied her breathing just skirting a snore grandmama mrs lawrence said touching her shoulder lightly eh the old woman said looking bemused im reading cant you tell theres a policeman to see you if youre up to speaking with him not that bold as brass constable is it no grandmama inspector rutledge is from scotland yard watery blue eyes moved to rutledge standing just behind the younger woman and she looked him up and down hes no policeman i know im here for a short while until the constable recovers from his surgery rutledge said stepping forward im sorry to disturb your reading he added pulling up the chair nearest to hers but im told that if anyone knows the history of dudlington its you sarah lawrence smiled delighted on my good days i can tell you what it was like to see the old queen married a pretty slip of a girl she was then hardly came up to the princes shoulder but running to plumpness if you ask me i never saw that wicked scotsman she was so fond of but even as a small girl i was quite taken with her prince pity he had to die but there you are yes he glanced up at patricia lawrence indicating that hed like to speak to her husbands grandmother alone she nodded and said ill just fetch some tea youd like that i think sarah lawrence squinted her eyes to see the mantel clock is it teatime already no grandmama but we have a guest yes indeed very well young man tell me why youve come it isnt about the queen im sure shes dead she was swathed in shawls but her hair pure white was beautifully brushed and her black dress was of good quality her grandson and his wife hamish noted were taking good care of her i remember my own granny he added and how she ruled the house rutledge said to mrs lawrence as the sitting room door closed im looking for a man who went missing many years ago perhaps as early as do you remember gossip about that what was his name sadly we dont know it she stared at her lap thinking in you say that was the year we put in the pear tree my husband and i the one blown down in the storm of a pretty thing it was too white clouds of blossoms covering every limb i was that fond of the pear tree what was happening in dudlington that year he prodded gently when the storm came when you put in the pear tree ah i told you that was he tried another tack who was the doctor in mrs lawrence do you remember his name it was blair dr blair i never liked him thought he knew more about children than their mothers did and who was the rector that would be mr anderson i think or no mr anderson came in the next year it was mr fellowes he walked her through the village asking about the postmaster the greengrocer and every other person he could think of to jar her memories do you remember mrs ellisons marriage it must have been quite a social affair pooh she wasnt married in st lukes too small by her lights connected with the harkness family you know her aunt in northampton arranged the wedding there werent that many invited from dudlington though her husband had family here at the time theyre gone of course thats why he sold the farm mr shepherd owns it now he wanted cattle not sheep said his name would become a byword if he ran sheep they lost their only son in the war sad and who owned the bakers shop simpsons father he would let us have treats on our birthday what do you remember about the christmas of he asked guiding her slowly but she frowned was that a special christmas do you think i dont remember much good coming of it why there was a typhoid outbreak that autumn and my best friend died of it i wasnt intending to celebrate because of it but mr lawrence my husband told me we must think of the children and the rector told me i mustnt forsake god he sat there for another ten minutes priming the pump of her memory to no avail after all it was many years ago for a woman who must be well into her eighties but his questions had jarred some of the tangled threads in her mind and as patricia lawrence brought in tea on a pretty painted tray sarah said oh do look id forgot the teapot i broke the spout on mine and mr ellison found me a match for it in london he was there a number of times in and he said it might take my mind off sallys death my friend you see that was kind of him rutledge replied taking his cup as the younger woman passed them around yes he was a kind man i never knew what hed seen in mary clayton except that she was cousin to a harkness and pretty as a picture she was off again on another line of thought recalling that her own father had known old mr harkness who died of a broken heart when the manor burned to the ground he collected butterflies you know his niece kept some of the trays at her house thats the oaks of course its seen a sad comedown since her day let me tell you he finished his tea and rose to take his leave sarah lawrence seemed disappointed as if she had expected him to entertain her for another hour or so rousing herself she made an effort to hold his attention you were asking me about except for the typhoid it wasnt an unusual year you know but now that was a year of tragedy the rectors wife died gerald baylor was nearly trampled to death by one of his bulls and mr ellison died in an accident in london a runaway horse that was and him leaving behind that dear little girl beatrice was such a suitable name you know i can remember her christening as if it were yesterday rutledge left soon afterward and found himself walking toward st lukes church it was a place of tranquillity with no echoes of constable hensley emma mason or mrs channing inside it was chilly the stone walls already letting go of what had briefly passed for the winter suns warmth he pulled up his coat collar as he chose a chair set near the pulpit his mind working hamish said its nae use it willna all fit together somehow it does in the end ill see my way clear his voice startled him ringing hollowly through the empty church you were sent here wi only the ain duty murder is my duty aye but no a corpse long dead before you were born rutledge didnt answer him hamish persisted it willna serve theres nae proof you canna find it after a this time i must speak with the rector hes no the man to burden with such a tale it was true the rector for all his experience of the world was also a little unworldly he wouldnt believe what rutledge had to tell him and the gossip mill would soon have part of the story if not all of it the doctor then aye the doctor after a time rutledge left the church and went to find dr middleton middleton would have none of it youre reaching for the moon you know i think what i just described to you is likely certainly its possible and how do you expect to prove it be reasonable man theres nothing to be gained by looking into it and it could cause a great deal of pain if youre wrong there was that as well youll give me your word not to speak of any of this rutledge asked middleton smiled grimly i live here you know im not about to cut my throat to spite my face rutledge went back to hensleys house and began to write his report an hour later he finished it and set it aside under a stack of papers on hensleys desk mrs channing tapped lightly at the door shortly afterward and said ive come to say goodbye my bags are packed and the car has been brought around it isnt over yet he told her theres been nothing since the lorry ran you down i think hes warned off after such a public display or tired of the game i expect he wanted someone he could frighten badly and if thats true he chose the wrong man you dont lie very well i dont want to see you die she said bluntly ive seen enough of death and destruction i want to hold my seances and bring back dead kings and silly jesters and the ghost of hamlets father theres no harm in that and it makes people laugh and it keeps my mind from dwelling on what it shouldnt be remembering you were the soldier inspector but i put soldiers back together or tried to help others do that i dont know which is worse im about to make an arrest as soon as i do i can leave dudlington i think you only want me here to keep an eye on me its partly true she was suddenly angry im going back to london its too late to change my mind then go mrs channing said in exasperation thats so like a man all right ill call your bluff inspector goodbye she walked to the door and was on her way out when she stopped and turned i think frank keating has been in prison dont ask me why perhaps the way he avoids people if hes paid his price for whatever he did it doesnt matter but if you had sent him thereit might be worth looking into consider that bit of information my parting gift it was the middle of the night when rutledge woke with a start there was someone in the bedroom standing somewhere between the door and the window halfasleep his first thought was that it must be hamish coming out of the shadows of his mind the voice at last assuming shape and depth and reality he lay where he was fighting to hold his body quiet keeping his breathing even a silhouette paused briefly against the pale light from the window and then was gone rutledge had the distinct feeling that it had moved nearer to the bed he counted the seconds waiting if it was hamishhe didnt finish the thought he could hear the faint sound of breathing but he couldnt see who was there a shadow in among darker shadows his heart began to pound please god not hamish and then he was awake enough to realize his danger i know youre there he said softly into the blackness of the room is that what you want or have you come to leave another shell casing by my pillow there was silence what do you want what is it that makes you want to kill me it was a challenge thrown down deliberately but it brought him no response the lamp was on the table by his bed it would take too long to light it and he cursed himself for not bringing his torch upstairs with him it was a blunder he wouldnt repeat did i send you to prison or does it have to do with the war hed lost track of where the breathing was coming from and then the silhouette was passing the window again on its way back to the door rutledge had a split second to make his decision then he was out of the bed in one smooth motion muscles tight as a spring as he launched himself at the figure but it eluded him and he crashed into the tall dresser instead swearing as he hit his shoulder hard against the corner he wheeled toward the door and felt cloth rip though his fingers his hands coming up empty he went down the stairs as fast as was safe plunging out the open door and into the empty street whoever it was had gone or had slipped into the shadow of a doorway invisible in the night he went back inside his bare feet cold from the cobblestones and the threshold was it you he asked hamish tell me if it was you hamish said hes still in the house you were tricked firmly shutting the door rutledge found his torch where hed left it on hensleys desk and began a search of the ground floor but as he walked into the kitchen he knew it was too late behind him the outer door opened and closed so quietly he wasnt sure at first that hed heard it the intruder had doubled back and gone his presence had been a message i could easily have killed you as you slept so much for meredith channings prediction that it was over rutledge stood in the parlor that served as hensleys police station and realized that without a key he was at the mercy of someone intent on terrorizing him it would be only a matter of time before the sport palled and the decision was made to take this game to its logical conclusion and he had a feeling that he wouldnt see the blow coming rutledge went to call on grace letteridge that morning finding her brooding over her roses i dont think this one will live she told him as he came up the front walk the roots arent stable she rocked the offending canes back and forth i wont know for certain until spring but the signs arent good yes well that one left a thorn in my back id swear to that she stood up and dusted her hands youre a liar probably come inside and let me ask you a few questions why should i do that im not guilty of anything and whats more i dont know anyone who is still she reluctantly preceded him into the parlor and sat down prepared to block him at every turn he could feel her resistance across the room tell me about robbie baylorno dont fly off at me this is more important than your pride grace letteridge glared at him that is my pride i know its why you went to london to be rid of him and of emma and of dudlington she was beautiful he told me he couldnt help himself that he hadnt meant to do more than take her in his arms and the next thing he knew he was pinning her down on the grass kissing her she clawed his face and then he slapped hers and so you left hed already decided to join the army but every time i looked at emma she reminded me that hed found her beautiful and his pledge to me hadnt stopped him from from whatever it was he intended to do emma wouldnt tell me her side of what had happened i expect she was ashamed that it had shocked and frightened her and made her feel as if shed betrayed me but for a very long time i believed she must have encouraged him in some way i preferred to blame her than blame him even though i knew that was wrong constable markham had taken pleasure in dropping hints you see and of course id seen the scratches on robs face after nearly a week of wondering i cornered him and forced him to tell me the truth what brought you back to dudlington when rob was killed they found a letter among his things it was addressed to me to be sent in the event of his death he told me again what had happened that hed regretted it ever since and that he didnt want to die with that on his conscience that he had truly loved methat he wanted forgiveness she bit back tears and looked away from him what did you say to emma when you came home i showed her his letter i thought she had a right to know all of it all that mattered but our friendship was never the same i hadnt trusted her i deserted her when she needed me most and i couldnt make amends if you had your chance to live through that summer of again would you have done the same thingwalk away she turned back to face him oh yes i believed he loved me but he couldnt have loved me as deeply as i thought he did if he was attracted by emma and she was only fourteen then she paused to try to kiss her was bad enough to slap a child because she spurned him was a side of his nature i hadnt seen before what hurt most of all was that id misjudged him so completely i thought he was the best of that family but he was just like his brothers selfish to the core the fact that emma was mrs ellisons granddaughter didnt stop rob baylor grace letteridge laughed but it was harsh and full of pain at the time i dont believe he was thinking very clearly about anything least of all the harkness bloodline did mrs ellison know that emma had attracted such unwanted attention they quarreled about it sometimes mrs ellison was of the opinion that emma encouraged men that if she were truly a ladyand a harknesseven the most hardened seducer would step aside abashed her mouth twisted wryly that made emma cry she told me she wanted to go to london and find her mother and i told her that she didnt even know where to begin to look after all her letters had come back she couldnt be sure where her mother might have gone next bathwinchesteroxfordparis do you think she heeded that or in desperation went anyway i thought she was dead and that constable hensley had killed her i always wondered you see what robbie might have done if hed gone too far as it was hed slapped her and called her a tease but she hadnt told her grandmother that part of it she was too ashamed constable hensley could have felt that he ought to be more successful than a farmers son and realized too late there was no turning back mrs ellisons name carries a good deal of weight in this part of the county and shed have gone after him tooth and nail even if she thought emma was to blame he wasnt popular here and everyone would have sided with mary ellison still the skeleton you found in the wood wasnt emmas was it so i was wrong after all hamish said you canna be sae sure shes telling the truth no it wasnt emmas body he agreed ignoring the voice and after a moment he added i find myself wondering if it was her grandfathers he held out the gold toothpick and watched her face surprise gave way to a rapid shift in emotions recognition understanding fear it was the last christmas present beatrice ever gave him where did you find it surely not in the wood with the skeleton dear god rutledge said how did you know about the toothpick beatrice told me about it she chose it herself a child of five in northampton her mother had taken her there to visit a cousin and she saw it in a shop i doubt if she knew at the time what it was she just thought it was pretty and the cousin let her buy it for her father mrs ellison wasnt pleased with the choice but the cousin told her not to be silly the child could do as she liked and so it was engraved and wrapped in silver tissue and a green ribbon and youre certain she gave this to her father oh yes theres no doubt about it she recalled it vividly and talked about it when she missed him because she wished shed found something morei dont know more respectable a watch fob or shirt studs even a chain for his keys i expect mrs ellison took meanspirited pleasure in telling her that a toothpick even a gold one was hardly worthy of a harkness for whatever reason beatrice couldnt forget it she reached out to touch the slender length of gold with the tip of a finger there couldnt be two such could there what became of ellison he died in london struck by a runaway horse it was sudden and dramatici remember my father saying that mrs ellison screamed when she got the news it was so out of character everyone talked about it where is he buried you just told me he was the man in the wood yes he probably is but if he died in london there must have been an inquest a funeral his wife would have had to be present mrs ellison went to london to take care of the arrangements she left beatrice here with the rectors wife because what could a child that young understand he was buried there she said she couldnt bear to bring him back to dudlington that she herself wished to be buried in london with him when the time came my father remembered that too he told me long afterward that he was shocked but then its what mary ellison wanted and beatrice never doubted that her father was buried in london she even knew the name of the cemeteryhighgate there was a great stone lion near the grave and its name was nero beatrice longed to go there and see it for herself surely if she went to londonbut that may explain why she was estranged from her mother the grave wasnt there would you be willing to swear under oath to what youve just told me she clearly hadnt considered that she glanced toward the window as if she could see mary ellison from where she sat must i i cantdo you really believe that mary if she told everyone that her husband was buried in london then why is there a skeleton in the wood with the toothpick that beatrice had given her father do you believe mrs ellison gave away the toothpick out of a callous disregard for her daughters feelings i dont know but why would mary make up such a complicated storythe runaway horse the cemetery lion and how was he actually killed theres no way to be certain well im glad that beatrice isnt here it would have broken her heart i think beatrice is dead as well and emma she stared at him her hand to her mouth her eyes wide no please i dont want to hear this i cant prove it just yet he said but ive got to try but howi cant see mary ellison for gods sake taking up a gun or a knife or a flat iron to her own flesh and blood shes notit sickens me to even think such a thing rutledge hesitated and then told her its often said that a womans weapon is poison grace letteridge was still upset when he left her part of her had wanted to believe him and another part of her refused to accept that it was possible rutledge said as he walked out the door you mustnt say anything not until im certain and that may take me some time but the constablewho shot him with a bow and arrow do you have emmas archery set and if you dont who very likely does mrs ellison is strong enough to bend a bow i think although shes probably not a very good marksman but she only had to drive the point of that arrow into constable hensleys back deep enough to frighten him and keep him away from the wood its even possible she intended to retrieve the arrow only it had struck bone and everyone in dudlington would have believed the saxon dead had attacked him with a ghostly weapon a perfect threat to keep people out of friths wood dont you think why are you telling me this she asked at the door i wish youd never come here not to dudlington and not to my house i had to trace that toothpick i couldnt think of anyone else who knew the family as well as you did mrs ellison never let anyone get close to her perhaps because of her secrets perhaps because of her nature i cant be sure will you tell me why when you know yes id like the answer to that myself rutledge sat by the fire in hensleys office the toothpick in his hand if all the world thought harry ellison was dead and had been buried in london for all these years no one would have set up a hue and cry over the fact that he had disappeared and it was in keeping with mary ellisons character that she would rather have her husband decently interred than for her to be gossiped about in dudlington as a deserted wife hamish said she went to the wood two nights ago yes she wanted to be sure i hadnt found her husband she let me believe it was emma she thought i was searching for which was clever of her i believed her even pitied her what matters now is that all alone in the dark of night shed ventured into friths wood she wasnt afraid of it because she hadnt been brought up in dudlington and taught to fear it that much she and constable hensley had in common its not surprising that shed see the wood as a place to rid herself of her husbands body aye but how did she lug him there i dont know he may have been alive when he got there but already feeling the poison if she was capable of killing him she could surely think of an excuse to lure him there to die there was a sound at the door and he looked up palming the toothpick so that it couldnt be seen meredith channing stood there her face grim i came back she said simply im not the coward id hoped i was he laughed id take you to lunch in letherington if i thought it wouldnt start the gossipmongers talking im hungry and not particularly worried about gossip for that matter you look as if youd be better off out of dudlington whats happened if you wanted to kill your husband how would you go about it i didnt kill him if thats what your policemans brain is telling you no im not accusing you id like to know how you would go about such a thing if it were in your mind she walked toward the window that gave onto the street her back to him women dont care for bloody scenes its easier to use poison if you arent there to watch him die i should think that would be the most difficult part watching she turned back to him i dont like being drawn into your brutal world ian had it been his brutal world that had decided elizabeth fraser not to welcome him back to westmorland he hadnt thought of that but shed had a taste of just how unspeakable murder could be for the first time since hed received her letter he could sympathize with what must have been a difficult choice for her and in turn respect it hamish said aye you wouldna care to see her hurt and it was true taking a deep breath as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders he brought his mind back to meredith channing im sorry he said as he shut the toothpick into a cabinet behind the desk and got to his feet i didnt intend to make you a part of it either lunch is still on offer ill just tell mrs melford that i wont be in he left a note for her when she didnt answer his knock then brought around the motorcar for mrs channing as he held the door she stepped into the vehicle and found a scarf in her pocket to put around her hat when he turned the crank he heard hamish telling him he was unwise but she was right he needed to be away from dudlington for a few hours yet he couldnt stop himself as he got in behind the wheel from looking up at the bedroom windows where emma mason had slept luncheon was roast ham and potatoes with boiled cabbage and a flan it was the best the unicorn hotel could produce but mrs channing didnt complain instead she talked about her life in london making it seem amusing and interesting shed been born in somerset she told him and hadnt gone to the city until her marriage but learned to live there without too much homesickness for the west country she never spoke of her husband directly as if talking about him was still painful rutledge listened interjecting comments now and then but a good part of his mind was elsewhere how does one prove that poison was usedand where were the bodies of beatrice ellison and her daughter emma mason not in the wood surelyhed searched too carefully to have missed them but their murderer had learned perhaps from her first experience not to rely on such a public place in the house thensomewhere he came back to the present when hamish whispered ware mrs channing was sitting across the table from him an amused look on her face im sorry he began embarrassed and then realized it was the second time hed apologized to her that day do you treat all your guests this way she demanded ive asked you at least twice if youd pass the salt he had the grace to laugh as he handed the silver saltcellar to her and then his hand stopped in midair it would be so simple to put something in the sugar bowl or saltcellar so easy to abstain ones self what is it mrs channing asked watching his face as he gave her the saltcellar he shook his head remembering something thats all but she was holding the saltcellar as if it might bite her staring down at it with loathing before she set it aside unused yes she said slowly it would work wouldnt it or the almond paste between the layers of a favorite cake and then you could dispose of what was left without a worry in the back garden under a pot of geraniums even burning it up in the stove although the smell would be sickening a fiveyearold child would never suspect that her mother had just killed her father death was loss hard enough to understand folding her napkin meredith channing sat back in her chair as if her appetite had fled small wonder you havent married she told him then saw the look on his face and remembered what maryanne browning had confided to her about his engagement im so sorry that was not called for i was simply about to say that of all the men ive ever dined with youre the first to put me off my food her attempt at levity fell flat he thought its going to be impossible to prove but if she shot hensley the killing hadnt ended the hotel receptionist came to his table and said quietly inspector rutledge yes inspector cain has been looking for you and saw your motorcar in the hotel yard theres been an urgent telephone call from northampton im to tell you that constable hensley is dying and youre to come at once mrs channing insisted on driving with him if you must stop in dudlington before you go on to northampton you may be too late theres nothing i can do but i dont mind waiting until you know whether this is true or not why shouldnt it be true he asked stepping into the motorcar beside her telephone messages can be contrived as i remember there are some very lonely stretches just south of dudling ton open pasture rather than houses a perfect place for an ambush if his nemesis could hide in the open land of beachy head he could hide along the roadside as he did in hertford and wait for the motorcar to come by no that puts you at risk if the shot kills me ill lose control of the wheel you could die in the crash i could have died nursing those poor soldiers with the spanish influenza too or on the crossing between dover and calais i could have been one of the nurses who went down with the britannic im not afraid and someone else in the car with you might deter him who knows she reached into the rear seat to lift up the woolen rug that he kept there and rutledge stopped breathing for a heartbeat as she seemed to have trouble retrieving it almost as if hamish had held on to it he thought but she said nothing as she finally brought it between their seats and proceeded to spread it over her knees that as he knew too well by now was no proof that she hadnt sensed a presence there just that she had chosen not to speak of it for the moment they drove fast trying to cover the miles as quickly as they could but rutledge kept his eye to the verges of the road where death could also be lurking hamish in the rear seat was trying to tell him something but rutledge had no time to pay heed to the words that seemed to echo in his ear when they at last reached the busy outskirts of northampton where industry seemed to thrive rutledge felt himself relax for the first time his neck and shoulders were stiff from tension it eased as they made their way to the hospital how is your ankle mrs channing asked when he got down and limped around to her side of the motorcar to open her door much better driving aggravates it a little by the time ive walked a hundred paces it will be all right and it was they found matron in her office and he asked to see constable hensley there was a message to come at once he said dreading to hear the news that her patient had already died matron nodded gravely his fever has risen alarmingly last night but it fell back a little this morning is this a relative she indicated mrs channing no she said holding out her hand my name is meredith channing i was a nurse in the war i was hoping you might let me sit somewhere quietly while mr rut ledge speaks to the constable matron responding to that warm compelling voice said yes youll find a small room down the passage and to your left just across from the surgical theater its for the staff and theres usually a fresh pot of tea on the hot plate youll find it quiet and comfortable im sure thank you mrs channing turned and walked away leaving rutledge to follow matron to the room where the doctors had isolated hensley hamish was saying theres no call to harass him if he didna kill the girl rutledge answered silently well see indeed the constable looked ill his face flushed his hands restless outside the sheet that covered him his eyes were too bright and as they focused on rutledge he said god im afraid of dying rutledge sat down by the bed and said i dont know that you are dying hensley shook his head from side to side in denial i can feel it the fever eating away at me theyve cleaned the wound twice and it hasnt helped theyre afraid the infections spread into my blood he took a deep breath trying to quell his distress i hope youve brought good news of a kind while youve been away rutledge said weve had several new developments in dudlington weve found a body in friths wood i knew it the sick man said rousing himself i knew that letteridge bitch had killed her where in the wood did you find emma id searched until i was crazy with dread of that place but i couldnt stay away it was the first time hed admitted to going to the wood rutledge tried to describe where he had made his discovery hensley said id looked there more than once but not as deep as you did you didnt carry a pitchfork hensley flinched poor emma she ought not to have died like that like what alone in that blasted wood she was afraid of it you know her grandmother had told her tales about seeing lights there in the winter he shivered and reached out to pull up the bedclothes i freeze and i burn theyve put a hot water bottle at my feet now i was worried last night when they started going cold its the first sign of dying rutledge said we found a body in the wood but i didnt say that it was emmas hensley broke off plucking at the bedclothes to stare at him not emmas but i thought his eyes glittered in the light of the table lamp he said wretchedly its this fever nothing makes sense it was a mans body i have several very good reasons to think it might be harry ellisons emmas grandfather hes buried in london i dont think he is ill have the yard take a look tomorrow but i dont expect them to find a grave grace letteridge couldnt have killed him she wasnt born when he died i think mary ellison may have done it and buried him in the wood then made up the story about the runaway horse in london god help us he lay back in the bed with the back of his hand across his eyes matron put her head in the door please dont tire the patient inspector he needs all his strength yes thank you matron when the door closed rut ledge said is frank keating actually a man by the name of sandridge hensley took away his hand and looked at rutledge on my word hes not but if hensley had been a cohort of sandridges he wasnt likely to admit the connection what happened in london hensley did you look the other way when barstows place of business was set afire hensley moved restlessly you lied to me you think im dying that i ought to confess what if its a ruse and i pull through this i didnt kill emma mason that much ill tell you but i wont speak of london he turned his head aside you werent there and some people have a long memory theyd know who talked he wouldnt change his mind and finally rutledge stood up to go he had just put his hand on the latch to open the door when hensley said here you never told me whats become of emma then we havent found her yet but i hope to very soon rutledge put in a call to the yard to have someone look in highgate cemetery for harry ellisons grave site im told theres a great stone lion nearby called nero i know the tomb you mean sir the constable on the other end answered him it shouldnt be hard to find out if theres an ellison in the vicinity he spelled the name again to make sure he had it right where can i ring you back sir inspector cain letherington hell see i get the message thank you sir ill make sure its taken care of straightaway before he left the hospital rutledge spoke to the doctor in charge of hensleys care the man looked drained as if he hadnt slept in several days but he sat down for five minutes to answer questions if we cant stop the infection hes a dead man dr williams told him bluntly but constable hensleys strong he has a sound constitution that may make all the difference everything that can be done has been done but in medicine there are no certainties will you stay in touch yes thats why i asked matron to put a call in to you today he could be unconscious by tomorrow if it was necessary to speak with him time was of the essence and we ought to ask are there any relatives who should be notified he lived alone in dudlington i dont know what family he has sergeant gibson or chief superintendent bowles at the yard may be able to tell you ive spoken with the chief superintendent hes rung us several times in fact he seems most anxious for his man hensley had made no mention of that yes rutledge answered dryly he does care about this one the drive back to dudlington was silent for a time the miles speeding away behind them hamish for reasons of his own was withdrawn and rutledge watching for the ambush they might have escaped on the drive south wasnt in the mood for conversation meredith channing sat quietly beside him but he saw when he glanced her way once or twice that she too was watchful her eyes never leaving the roadsides the early winter dusk bleak and concealing had enveloped them some miles outside the city of northampton and the headlamps threw long beams of light across the drab landscape he didnt think they would have much warning if someone was waiting for them in the night but then a hidden sniper would have to be certain of his target it would cut down on his accuracy towns and villages appeared and vanished their houses and churches and farms noticeably empty of life here at the dinner hour a cold wind whipped through the motorcar is he dying this constable hensley you went to see mrs channing asked after a time as if needing distraction from her watch the doctors are fighting to save his life theyre afraid it may be blood poisoning now not just an infection at the site of the surgery they dont offer much hope but they also tell me hes strong it was difficult to carry on a normal conversation in the motorcar but she said what a shame mr keating at the oaks told me what had happened to the constable its far more complicated than keating realizes i want hensley alive to testify in two cases yes well if wishes were horses they were silent again for several miles ill drop you at the oaks keating may not be up ill be sure youre safely inside before i go on thank you they reached the turning to dudlington sooner than they had expected the inn was dark and the headlamps were the only illumination to guide rutledge as the road began to curve and run down into the village he had just made the turn toward holly street and the circular drive that led to the front of the oaks when something caught his eye hamish shouted there left a succession of thoughts ran through rutledges mind someone saying that cows were kept in the barns this time of year and his own voice making a remark about camouflage hold on he twisted the steering wheel hard and the tires skidded before leaving the road in the same moment he cut the headlamps mrs channing cried out as the motorcar went careening out into the meadow bouncing wildly over the uneven ground into darkness swaying and lurching as it went rutledge fought the wheel and brought the heavy vehicle under control then to a wrenching halt he was out of his door almost before the recoil of the sudden stop had settled racing back to the cow lying in the grass for all the world chewing its cud she turned her head toward him as he got nearer her white and black hide giving her the look of a harlequin half invisible he could just see the whites of her eyes he realized in that moment that she was realand pegged to the ground so that she wouldnt wander off it hadnt been a trap with a marksman under the hide but a ruse and he had fallen for it he swore and went to pull up the pegs the cow scrambled to her feet and shook herself then she turned and began to amble away as if she knew where to find her barn he caught the rope around her neck and soothed her mrs channing opening her door called inspector leading the cow with him he went back to the car are you all right he asked im sorry there was no time to warn you a few bruises nothing serious whats this i expect he felt id drive straight over it thinking he was under the hide and preparing to fire thank god i didnt id have killed bessy here and probably myself as well when the motorcar turned over on me she reached out a gloved hand toward the cow then thought better of it poor thing shes probably frightened to death here let me walk you as far as the inn then ill take her home before she wanders out into the road and someone else does hit her no im all right ill see myself to the inn but he wouldnt let her he walked her as far as the stairs and gave her his torch to find her way up them satisfied that she was safe he turned back to the motorcar and then untied the cow from the frame at first the animal was determined to go her own path but soon enough she stopped pulling against the rope and followed him meekly down holly street her hoofs clattered on the cobblestones and she walked with that swaying motion that made cows seem so slow and bucolic but he could still see the whites of her eyes telling him that she was anxious he led her down whitby lane and then along church street toward the baylor house leaving her in the yard he went to bang on the door in a few minutes ted baylor flung open the door his braces down and his hair awry as if hed been asleep in his chair what is it he began and then over rutledges shoulder he saw the cow my good god whats she doing out there id like an answer to that myself is she yours baylor reached behind him for a coat pulling it on as he closed the door yes i recognize her how many others are missing he hurried around the house toward the distant barns rutledge still leading the cow fell behind as he matched his pace to hers but she began to trot as she crossed the yard baylor had the great door open the dark interior yawning behind him by the time rutledge got there he was lighting a lamp and then holding it high as he walked down the barn looking at the rows of cattle drowsing on their beds of straw rutledge followed him a miasma of fresh straw steaming animals and manure filled the air here baylor said pointing to a half stall that was empty this appears to be the only one thank god rutledge brought the cow up and handed him the rope do you lock the barn he asked why should we the cows dont try to leave where the hell did you find her near the oaks i almost ran her down i dont believe you why should i lie about it besides he retorted i have a witness it doesnt make any sense baylor was examining the cow running his hand over her sides and flanks shes mine all right as far as i can tell shes not hurt i dont like the look of this who would want to harm one of my beasts where was your brother tonight in his bed where id have been if i hadnt fallen asleep while reading can you be sure where he was you werent awake yes by god he stamped his feet warming them hes not likely to be out in the damp night air not with his lungs then why didnt your dog bark if a stranger meddled with the barn baylor said i was thinking of the cowwhere is that bloody dog the cow was settling in at last going down to her knees and then her belly with an almost human sigh she lay there quiet as a statue except for her regular breathing wed better have a look for him rutledge answered they searched the yard and baylor went to the kitchen door to shout for the dog in the house but it was nowhere to be found where did you say the cow was by the road wed best look there for the dog as well rutledge said shed been pegged down by the road but there couldnt have been a dog up there id have seen it even if it didnt bark would bossy allow anyone to approach her and lead her away without a fuss if she didnt know him depends on whether or not the man knows cattle doesnt it baylor went to the barn again made a swift search and came back to the door where rutledge was waiting he doesnt wander off that dog i dont like this nor i rutledge stood there in the night air thinking can you whistle him up give him instructions to bring in the herd oh yes baylor gave the signal a series of low and highpitched whistles they would carry for some distancehad to carry when herdsman and dog were separated when there was no response he repeated it hamish said listen there was a sound muffled and far off that could have been an animal in distress baylor cocked his head on the other side of the rectory i think and he set off at a trot in that direction rutledge followed the bobbing lantern but when they reached the far side of the rectory there was no sign of the dog whistle again baylor did and the muffled sounds were louder a strange whine hollow and well above their heads baylor held up the lantern looking around scanning the roofline of the rectory rutledge more accustomed to tracing sounds said the church the tower room id say as they reached the tower door rutledge put out his hand for the lantern let me go in first for all he knew it was a trap he pulled the door open and stepped inside the dog had been tied to one of the handles of the sanctuary door and muzzled with a length of dark cloth he growled at the sight of rutledge visible mainly as a hulking shadow in the doorway as the lantern cast his silhouette against the wall there was no one else in the tower entrance or on the stairs baylor ted baylor came in and spoke to the dog reducing it to whines and wriggles of ecstasy he took away the muzzle and the dog began to bark in short staccato yelps baylor soothed him as he untied the rope id have killed him if hed harmed the dog he said through clenched teeth tell me who i wish i knew rutledge had opened the sanctuary door and lifted the lantern high but there were too many places to hide bring the dog here he cant go in there not in there to the door but the dog sniffed briefly at the air of the nave then turned back to baylor theres no one in the church baylor said youre right i think whats all this in aid of baylor asked nodding toward the north and friths wood is it to do with the bones theyve found were they the girls thats the whisper going about i dont know i can tell you the bones dont belong to emma mason you can scotch that rumor if you would theres no point in upsetting her grandmother if it can be helped and whos to gossip to the grandmother i ask you baylor said sourly she all but accused my brother rob of attempted rape a few years ago theres no love lost there but yes id not want to learn bad news that way he turned to go taking the dog with him what youve done its appreciated he said over his shoulder his voice gruff and he was gone into the night his lantern bobbing as he crossed the churchyard the dogs wagging tail flicking in and out of the yellow glow rutledge walked back through the quiet streets to the motorcar where it sat in the field he was about to crank it when a thought struck him what if someone had meddled with it in his absence first the kirk and now the motorcar yere edgy man still without his torch or a lamp there was no way he could be sure that all was well in the end he walked to hensleys house and went in to find frank keating pacing the floor waiting for him where the hell have you been keating demanded ive been here for close on two hours i had other business to see to he fought to keep weariness out of his voice the bones yes apparently word of them is all over dudlington a man from letherington came into the bar tonight i heard him tell his mates about digging in the wood and finding bones i shut the bar then and came to look for you there was something in his eyes that rutledge couldnt judge fear he thought and a resistance almost as if he had come here against his better judgment was it the girl he asked finally when rutledge stood there silent for gods sake tell me who it was you found bloody hell man tell me it wasnt emma mason in fact it wasnt a womans body at all keating seemed to collapse into himself with relief thats all then he said brushing past rutledge on his way to the door rutledge put out a hand to stop him keating jerked his arm clear dont put your hands on me why should you care whether the bones belonged to the girl or not i told you ive seen her about the village too pretty for her own good and all the men leering at her i hear how they talk in the bar mind you foulmouthed bastards hensley worst of all i threw him out told him not to come to the oaks again do you think what he said was bragging or the truth if itud been the truth id have choked the life out of him rutledge said again why do you care about emma mason why do you think i lost my own daughter and ill never have another the hurt doesnt go away no matter what you tell yourself its there day and night id have killed any man who touched her why should i stand for such talk about another mans child if i wouldnt have stood for it about my own with that he was out the door slamming it behind him hamish said it may be that yon constable lied to keep you from speaking to him that he wasnt sandridge id considered that i wonder how much he was paid to set the fireand if it was enough to make it possible for him to purchase the oaks in the earlymorning light rutledge examined the motorcar carefully but no one had touched it as far as he could tell he drove it without incident back to the house and put it away the time had come to speak to mrs ellison he waited until it was nearly ten oclock and then walked across the street and knocked at her door it was some time before she answered her face was lined and she looked as if she hadnt slept well come in inspector she said and this time led him to the parlor indicating that he should sit down ive seen all the activity at your door something has happened hasnt it youvefound emma her voice almost broke on the last word he said gently we didnt find her in the wood mrs ellison i told you the truth earlier im sorry if you were still worried she almost fell apart then drew herself together again and faced him with no sign of pain it was an act of courage and he had to admire it thank you she stood the lady of the manor dismissing the policeman i didnt like to ask you know i didnt wish to break down in front of someone he sat where he was reaching into his pocket he held the toothpick out to her she looked at it then lifted her eyes to his face am i meant to know what that is it was i understand a gift from your daughter beatrice to her father christmas the date is engraved on it i cant imagine what youre talking about inspector its not the sort of thing a girl like beatrice would give her father on any occasion her expression was slightly puzzled and she raised her brows as if seeking an explanation there are those who tell me otherwise yes im sure there must be people eager to tell you what they want you to believe but that doesnt make it true does it good day inspector she walked to the door and stood there waiting for him to leave youve never seen this object before in your life no i cant speak any plainer than that hamish said as they reached the street again she willna break and ye have only the word of the lass with the roses hearsay hardly evidence that would stand up in a courtroom against the patrician calm of a mrs ellison the jury might not like her but they would believe her theres the nonexistent grave in highgate cemetery in london you canna be sure it isna there if she planned so carefully she wouldna leave that to chance but it was hard to believe that mrs ellison had gone to so much trouble and expense to bury an empty casket he drove to letherington to see if there was any news when he rang up the yard he found himself talking to inspector mickelson his voice cold and distant over the line rutledge asked for sergeant gibson and was told he was out rutledge rang off his second call was to inspector kelmore in northampton who after speaking with several other people informed rutledge that they hadnt any information on a harkness of the age he described well need more details before we can pursue it although sergeant thompson tells me there was a harkness who lived here at the turn of the century she died in the same year as the old queen he says it was a sad story which is why he remembers it her maid claimed she was poisoned but no one believed her she died soon after herself and that was the end of it was she a wealthy woman this miss harkness he could hear kelmore in the distance repeating the question then he came back on the line thompson says shed been very wealthy at one time but outlived her money except of course for the house that went to a family connection who sold it shortly afterward to pay for the funeral how did the maid die rutledge asked there was further consultation in a fall down the back stairs thompson thinks but send us more information about the woman youre after and well be happy to run her down rutledge thanked him he thought very likely hed found the right cousin after all from the hotel he went to see inspector cain and discovered that he too had been called away reluctantly rutledge drove back to dudlington feeling as if his hands were tied what he needed was a warrant to search the ellison house but he was inclined to believe that inspector cain would refuse to ask for it on such slim evidence after all mrs ellison had connections and cain was ambitious rutledge had learned to be wary of ambitious men rutledge found mrs channing sitting in the small parlor at the oaks writing a letter she looked up as he came in i never heard the end of the story about the cow shed been taken from one of the barns past the church her owner was glad to have her back unharmed im sure he was she put her hand into the portable correspondence box shed brought with her from her room and held out his torch thank you my pleasure after a moment he added i need a favor what is it id like you to invite someone from dudlington to have dinner with you in letherington mrs ellison i want her out of her house for several hours she was ahead of him youd search without a warrant he said you dont want the answer to that it makes you an accessory she looked at him youre risking your reputation yes i wont do any damage i wont take away anything what i want to see is what sort of flooring she has in her cellar i could go in at night when shes asleep but there are times when she walks about the house i shouldnt like to frighten her what possible excuse could i have for asking a stranger to dine with me that you knewor thought you knewher family harkness is the name id rather not if you dont mind he was disappointed but said thats all right i understand that night when the street was dark and all the lights were out in most of the houses on whitby lane rutledge dressed in a black sweater and black trousers walked boldly to the door of the ellison house and tried the lock it was open he slipped into the entrance and listened from somewhere in the house he could hear snoring a steady rhythmic sound that indicated a deep sleep hard of hearing mrs ellison might be but sudden sounds in the night penetrated dreams he moved silently toward the kitchen finding his way with his torch his fingers shielding most of the light the kitchen was tidy a kettle ready for morning a cup and saucer set out on the table next to the floral tea caddy and the sugar bowl looking at the doors leading off the kitchen he decided that one was a pantry another the door to the back garden and the third possibly the back stairs he tried them each in turn and found a fourth door near the back entry that proved to be a rough staircase into the cellar he went down carefully as hamish warned him to be wary this isna the way to find an answer the soft scots voice whispered cain wont listen if there isnt a very good chance im right aye but how will ye tell him yere right rutledge ignored him hed reached the bottom of the stairs and cast his light about the cellar it looked like a hundred others the door to the yard slanting over the head of a short flight of stairs a collection of scuttles and gardening implements scattered here and there a barrow and all the oddments of a house lived in for many years a shelf held preserves and jams and tins of fruit another held jam kettles and strainers and other kitchenware not frequently used a third held a collection of chipped dinner plates bowls cups and saucers in at least two patterns old boots stood in a box by the outer door and on hooks above them he saw a mans trousers a worn coat and an old hat three umbrellas lay on a ledge nearby overhead in the rafters were bunches of herbs set to dry from the look of them they hadnt been used in many years for something had been at them as he touched one of the bunches of lavender it crumbled between his fingers the floor under his feet was earthen packed hard over the decades certainly not loose enough for a woman to dig graves in a wildgoose chase hamish said urging him to go where else but the cellar could mrs ellison have buried the bodies of two women mind its already been searched by the constable no according to his notes hensley took her word that shed already searched the house who was going to call that into question why would anyone even consider the possibility that mrs ellison had murdered her own grandchild she took a calculated risk and won whats more the back garden was overlooked by the windows of her neighbors and she would have drawn attention to herself if shed gone out to dig in her flower beds late in the night his torch went methodically from left to right floor to rafters without a break in the walls or floor to indicate past activity of any sort taking two steps across the floor careful not to leave the marks of his shoes in the dust he turned to throw his light behind the stairs and there he saw a large wooden cupboard up against the wall its double doors barred with a short length of plank nailed across them in front of it was an old bullseye target of straw with a faded canvas covering the kind that was used in practicing at the butts with a bow and arrow the light stopped there as rutledge absorbed what he was looking at he thought measuring the cupboard with his eye that he could easily fit any two women hed met in dudlington inside those doors providing they werent unusually tall or heavy he walked around the staircase and put his free hand on the wooden bar it was solidly nailed in and he would need a crowbar to pry it off its no proof hamish was saying rutledge leaned forward to sniff at the tiny crack where the doors on either side met a musty odor met his nostrils leavened with herbs rosemary he thought for one and thyme what else lavender yes that was it a blanket chest or a coffin for beatrice ellison and emma mason he made his way back up the stairs walking carefully on the outside of the treads to keep the creaking of old wood at a minimum once in the kitchen he shut the door behind him and took out a handkerchief to wipe the soles of his feet so as not to leave dusty tracks on the kitchens floor he had reached the dining room on his way to the front door when he realized that the snoring had stopped he froze where he was flicked off his torch and listened at the top of the stairs a light bloomed and faded as if someone had walked across the head of the stairs with a lamp in hand rutledge stayed where he was breathing as shallowly as he dared a door opened shut he thought he could move then and was halfway through the parlor when a voice called whos there he stopped again hidden beside the tall case clock against the parlor wall he wasnt sure whether she had actually heard him moving about or sensed his presence hamish scolded if she comes down wi the lamp theres no hope shell see you and it will no look verra good in london rutledge thought shell hear him but after a moment the lamplight faded again and there was silence in the house he stood there by the clock for a good half an hour unwilling to move in the event she was waiting at the top of the steps where she could see the door after a while satisfied that she had gone back to sleep again he moved silently to the front door and opened it stepped outside and closed it for the first time he was able to take a deep breath it seemed to seep into every corner of his body reviving it moving swiftly but quietly he went down the steps and into the street there was no one in sight he scanned each direction his eyes taking in the windows overlooking him as he listened for any sound or footsteps but not even a dog had barked as he stood there he was halfway to the door of hensleys house when something made him look up at the windows of emma masons bedroom he remembered then what mary ellison had said when he caught her by the church two nights ago you arent the only one to watch from windows he could just barely see her there in the darkened room staring down at him the white oval of her face set above the black of her dressing gown and he was speared by moonlight in the unshadowed middle of the street his torch in his hand his face upturned toward her and guilt probably written there in his expression of surprise for an instant their eyes held and then rutledge strode briskly into hensleys house and shut the door behind him he asked inspector cain for a search warrant and just as rutledge had expected he was met with a reluctance that bordered on intransigence you said yourself she denied any knowledge of that toothpick its only miss letteridges word against mrs ellisons and it could be said that miss letteridge was feeling vindictive for reasons of her own youll find your evidence when you make the search you cant be sure of it look i must live here long after youve returned to london if were wrong if your search turns up no evidence whatsoever that this woman is a murderess then what and i honestly find it hard to believe that a harkness could poison someone rutledge finished for him interrupting bloodlines dont prove with certainty that shes innocent but can you be absolutely positive those bones are ellisons remains not just someone walking on the road who fell ill got to the wood and died and buried himself afterward time covered his remains not a human agency youve got to admit that thats possible look you came here to deal with the attack on constable hensley there was nothing in your brief about emma mason nor her mother nor her grandfather who shot hensley mrs ellison shes admitted that her granddaughter was interested in bows and arrows she had the means ive met mrs ellison socially frankly i cant quite see her wandering in friths wood with the intention of killing anyone besides how could she have walked boldly toward the wood with a bow in her hand she could have left it there for use if hensley got too close and she felt the time had come premeditation yes no one goes to that wood rutledge if they can help it do you think mrs ellison is superstitious cain shook his head were not getting anywhere bring me proof rutledge beyond hearsay and suspicion i must have something i can actually hold in my hand as it were rutledge left his anger barely controlled but he knew that cain was right he drove back to dudlington with hamish making his presence known through an undercurrent of disapproval she kens what you know you canna change that and if shes been sae clever all these years shes not likely to give herself away now he concentrated on the road watching the fields speed by his motorcar thinking about dudlington and how blind the village had been to what was happening cain couldnt overlook mrs ellisons connection with a onceprominent family and neither could mrs ellisons neighbors he arrived to find chaos smoke was billowing out the door of hensleys house a dark plume that was acrid and choking he could hear the coughing as the men worked to smother the blaze with water and blankets and buckets of sand from somewhere hamish was urgently reminding him of papers that were at risk in the cupboard behind hensleys desk rutledge plunged through the door to see what the damage was the fire hadnt reached the office but it appeared that a live coal from the hearth had exploded onto the carpet in the sitting room and the flames had run up the sides of a chair before someone had stepped into the office and smelled smoke or had the coal had help moving from hearth to carpet there was no time to wonder rutledge inserted himself into the chain as those pumping water from the sink passed buckets down the line and others clattered down the steps with more bedclothes and linens to help smother the blaze rutledge saw keating stop and pick up papers being trampled underfoot in the office and set them out of the way they had fallen from the desk and had been scattered by the multitude of feet hurrying through the greengrocer was there the baker and his helpers as well and someone from one of the houses on the other side as well as a half dozen men he didnt recognize the burning carpet was now a smoldering blackened ruin and half the chair was gone the wood of the floor had been heavily scorched ten minutes more he thought and the drapes would have caught as well men were moving outside into cleaner air and water sloshed under their feet and was tracked through the office keating was still there rapidly sorting papers as if looking for something rutledge had put away most of the concealed papers hed discovered and the rest were the routine reports hensley hadnt got around to filing he turned away as keating stepped outside and without waiting for thanks walked on up the hill to the oaks someone brought a bucket of hot tea sweet and leavened with milk and it was poured into mugs sweaty faces covered in grime grinned in reaction and relief one man even called to rutledge to ask if hed ever worked with a fire brigade before then rutledge remembered that the house wasnt hensleys only let from the greengrocer the willing hands had come to help one of their own still he thanked them walking among them and talking with each man ted baylor was there saying gruffly its the least i could do as if his presence was repayment for the safe return of his cow the air was still heavy with smoke and the house would have to air before he could sleep in it that night looking up once toward the house across the way he could see mrs ellison standing back from the window but watching what was going on you arent the only one to watch from windows shed said but had she had anything to do with the fire he left the men to their tea and went across to knock at her door to his surprise she came to answer it did you see who went in before the fire was discovered and then he added its not my house or hens leys it belongs to freebold why should i help you because youre a harkness and must set a good example her eyes were cold as glass you have enemies she said and i wish them well with that she closed the door in his face mrs channing had come down from the oaks and was helping dr middleton bandage hands and offer a soothing cream for singed faces when shed finished she came to stand by rutledge out of reach of the lingering wisps of smoke still coming from the house was it an accidentset on purpose she asked in a low voice i dont know it wouldnt have done much harm unless id been in bed and asleep it was then he remembered the figure in his room in the middle of the night how could a village this size turn a blind eye to a stranger coming and going without gossip flying he looked at the men still standing about talking the excitement had died and ordinary conversations had sprung up among them they wore heavy corduroy trousers sturdy boots a tweed jacket or one of heavy canvas and hats that they pulled down over their faces to fight the harsh wind blowing across the fields turn their backs he thought and they were more or less indistinguishable save for variations in height and breadth from man to man as a rule people here werent likely to stand at their small windows with nothing to do but watch the passing scene on the other hand the inspector from london glimpsed knocking at a neighbors door would command a second glance the familiar sight of a stockman striding past hunched against the cold would not he could come and go at will without attracting attention even harry ellison had kept a set of work clothes by the outside cellar door it was similar to exsoldiers in the cities all of them so much alike so many of them out of work or trying to fit into a world that had changed while they were away that people looked away from them invisible a dead soldier hed seen them in kent and again in hertford and never given them a thought but here it would have been different disguise meant to fit in and not stand out it explained why his tormentor was never seen his appearances were never marked he was invisible because he was not out of the ordinary when people had finally gone about their business rut ledge went inside and spent an hour wiping up the wet floor where the scorched remnants of carpet had been cleared away to the dustbin then he finished cutting out the worst of the charred horsehair in the side of the wing chair it helped a little to disperse the heavy odor of fire hamish noted a fine way to cover up the smell of death rutledge wondered if mrs ellison had thought of that afterward he walked to the rectory and found towson sitting at his study desk trying to write with his left hand and very frustrated pshaw he said as rutledge tapped lightly at the open door i shall have to deliver my sermons from memory this scrawl is hardly legible no one will mind you should have half a hundred committed to memory by now towson grinned as he set his pen in the dish one of the great things about age is that what happened twenty years ago is more easily recalled than what happened twenty days ago his grin faded you smell strongly of smoke has there been another fire has someone been injured there was a small blaze at constable hensleys house a spark from the fire fell on the carpet no harm done except to the carpet poor man hes suffered enough i shouldnt like to think of him coming home to more adversity what can we do im sure we can manage to find him a new carpet somehow hes developed a fever the hospital staff is worried about infection towson clucked his tongue i ought to go to northampton and spend some time with him do you think you could see your way to driving me there i think mrs channing might be happy to drive you rutledge paused what do you remember about the day you fell down the stairs its still a trifle hazy im afraid bits and pieces are coming back to me there was something about moneyi was happy about it but i cant think what it was had you by any chance just spoken with mrs ellison he blinked mary ellison i dont believemary ellison he leaned back in his chair his face changing from uncertainty to a growing surprise yes by god thats who it was i do remember she came down the passage calling to me and i answered from the head of the attic stairs she scolded me for taking such a risk and asked if i went up there often towson suddenly looked sheepish im afraid i was annoyed hillary timmons and dr middleton have lectured me on going up there in fact just last week im afraid i told mrs ellison rather blithely that i went up several times a day to enjoy the view from the windows hamish said it wasna the answer shed expected to hear why had she come surely not just to scold you rut ledge persisted that was what astonished me you know she didnt generally call on me but she said she was here to donate fifty pounds to the church fund it was an unexpected gift but one we need rather badly when i started down the steps to thank her she told me to go on and finish what i was doingwhich was searching out a pair of gloves though i hadnt said anything about that she didnt speak of an emergency not at all it was afterward that someone shouted for me to come at once im sure shed been gone for oh a good five or six minutes id been thinking how best to use the money enjoying the prospect but she hadnt gone very far rutledge found himself thinking she must have looked in the kitchen and the laundry to see if hillary timmons was in the house have you seen her since now that was the odd thing she came just this morning to ask me about a pot of chutney shed left on the table in the hall a day or so ago not wanting to disturb me while i was convalescing sadly she never mentioned the donation to the church fund i wish id remembered it and brought it to her attention chutney rutledge asked feeling his heart lurch hillary found it there on the hall table and set it in the pantry she didnt know where itd come from but she thought i did so when mrs ellison asked me about her gift i blurted out that it was delicious and i thanked her profusely i was too embarrassed to admit i had no idea what she was talking about towson she went on to say she wondered if it hadnt gone off she even suggested bringing me another pot white lies do have a way of coming back to haunt you well in for a penny in for a pound how was i to tell her id never seen it couldnt return it if my life depended on it all i could do was assure her it was of excellent quality and so you found it and tasted it as soon as shed gone it was the sort of thing he was sure the rector would do to make good his white lie good heavens no i asked hillary if shed seen it and she told me where shed put it i dont care for chutney you see and so i told the girl she could take it home to her family rector will you take me to hillary timmonss house i want that pot of chutney ill ask her for it tomorrow if you like i wasnt aware that you were so fond of it you must take me there now he was on his feet standing in the doorway urging the bewildered clergyman to follow him but i dont understand why shouldnt hillary enjoy it theyre not very well off you know i dont particularly like taking it back as if id found someone else to have it youve only to speak to mary ellison im sure shed be happy to give you your own and he was just as certain that she would not all right first well look to see if hillary already has taken it if she has well go directly to her house he was firm but when towson didnt move he started down the passage to the kitchen reluctantly the rector limped after him you must tell mewhats wrong i dont know wheres the pantry rutledge asked opening the door to the kitchen it was warm and cheerful and he remembered standing in mrs ellisons kitchen feeling like an interloper in her private world towson went to the pantry running his finger along pots of jam and honey and preserved plums a man with a taste for sweets ah this must be it perhaps she forgot to take it or doesnt care for it after all relieved he picked up a small jar with a square of white linen over it tied around the mouth with a silver ribbon hillary did mention the silver ribbon she thought it quite elegant ill buy her the finest chutney in london and have it sent to her but i must take this with me now very well but towson was still doubtful his eyes on the pot id be happier if this didnt come to mary ellisons ears im still hopeful of that fifty pounds the rector saw rutledge to the door looking out at the light drizzle that had begun to fall he said im grateful that you helped me piece together part of what had happened the day i fell it was like a hole in my mind the sort of thing that people must feel after a seizure or an apoplexy its rather frightening you know im sure it must be in truth there had been a time when rutledge hadnt been able to remember the war ending he hadnt expected to see it in fact for the last two years of the fighting in his mind he had been prepared to die only he hadnt the appalling realization that he had lived in spite of what hed done in the trenches blotted out everything else the guilt of surviving when so many around him had died was insupportable his men that day had been equally shocked at first the silence overwhelming as the guns that had fired so frantically all morning stopped their battering and then neither jubilation nor relief followed just a numbness that gradually filled with the knowledge that now they could go home rutledge had given them their orders as he himself had been ordered to do saw to their safetyand after that there was nothing a blank space of time the next thing he was aware of he was in a clinic in england with no understanding of how hed got there or why hed feared those missing weeks feared what he might have done and not even the doctors could give them back to him it had taken him more than a year to do that and a night in kent when it had all come rushing back towson was saying im sure the rest will come in time if i dont press too hard i shouldnt worry too much about it rutledge agreed middleton tells me i might actually have had a seizure there was anxiety in his voice now put there by a callous murderer who had used this mans goodness to bring him down no youll realize that when you remember towson smiled has anyone ever told you that youre a kind listener you might have gone to the church rather than the police you know not with the blackness in my own soul rutledge answered him silently and then with a wave he pulled his hat down against the rain rutledge carried the chutney in the palm of his hand close to his coat as he walked back to the constables house he couldnt take the chutney to inspector cain he didnt trust the man to have it analyzed properly particularly if cain learned it had been made by mrs ellison a wildgoose chase he would complain another attempt by an outsider to point a finger at a woman of impeccable reputation in an effort to solve a murder hed not even been sent to dudlington to investigate inspector kelmore on the other hand had no ties to dudlington and his people were capable and trustworthy that was the best solution he went into the house something gnawing at the edges of his mind hamish was silent no help at all after standing there for a moment rutledge turned back to the door and went out to the motorcar the drive to northampton seemed to take longer than usual rutledge glanced from time to time at the pot of chutney in the seat next to him was it only his imagination or was it somehow sinister malevolent time and a good laboratory would tell him the answer to that inspector kelmore was out of his office when rutledge got there but sergeant thompson took the little pot with its silver ribbon and held it gingerly between his thumb and forefinger as if expecting it to blow up in his face ill take it down straightaway sir he sniffed the air do i smell smoke sir there was a fire in dudlington i helped to put it out and what shall i tell dr pell to be looking for i dont know arsenic at a guess he told the sergeant where the chutney had come from who had given it to the rector and why hed brought it to northampton leaving out only his concerns about inspector cain someone gave this to the rector thompson shook his head whats the world coming to sir ill be at the hospital if you need me very good sir i hope you find the constable resting comfortably the last bulletin we had was that his fever has risen i dont think they believe hell make it worst luck rutledge found matron in her office and sat down across from her desk his mind shifting directions as he said how is constable hensley no better a little worse perhaps hes not always conscious now rutledge swore to himself its important that he recover were doing all we can i assure you inspector but there is a limit to what medicine can do he survived that arrow in his backhe survived the surgery to remove it i should think he could survive a fever but even as he said it he knew that it was not true a raging infection was generally fatal may i see him yes of course sister will show you to the room she rang the little bell on her desk and a young nurse stepped through the door rutledge thanked matron and followed the young woman down the passage hensley was in the same private room as before and rutledge wondered if chief superintendent bowles had ordered it people sometimes rambled in fevers and words spoken could never be taken back the constable was lying under a sheet half on his side half on his back he looked very ill indeed his flushed cheeks sunken his body somehow reduced in power and size rutledge went up to the bed and touched the arm lying on top of the sheet it was searing to the touch as if a fire burned beneath the skin invisible to the naked eye hensley stirred opening his eyes to stare blankly around the room then shutting them again rutledge said quietly constable inspector rutledge here can you hear me there was no reaction he called his name again and this time hensley opened bloodshot eyes trying to focus them who is it his voice was husky as if his throat was dry the young sister came forward and held a straw to his lips telling him firmly to drink from the glass rutledge could see him drink thirstily and then pull back as if the water didnt sit well on his stomach thank you sister he said dismissing her when shed gone out of the room it took rutledge several minutes to bring the constable back to a level where his voice reached the man he tried to lift his head and then turned a little inspector rutledge sir constable hensley do you believe it could have been mary ellison who shot you there was a slight motion of his head negative its possible she killed her husband her daughter and her granddaughter the painridden eyes considered him i wont be there to see her hang then id have liked that i still havent found this man sandridge but i came across your money you werent paid enough to take the blame for what happened to edgerton i think its time you told the truth you dont want to die with it on your conscience hamish in his mind said you mustna badger the man but rutledge responded time is short hensley was feebly shaking his head old bowels looks after his own but if you die and sandridge is still out there he might be persuaded to talk is that what you want bowles will blacken your name to save himself it wasnt a great deal of money i didnt know then that edgerton would die id have asked for more did you give a share of it to bowles is that why he closed his eyes to what youd done and let sandridge go free he set me to watch over sandridge and i did hes a dead man any way you look at it hell hang youre right if hes taken into custody do you want to hang with him i wont live to hang he turned a little those fever bright eyes on rutledges face you dont give a damn about me its bowles you want why did you agree to look the other way barstow told me either i helped or hed see i was blamed i was afraid of him i dont believe you not of a man like barstow you didnt know him he wanted his revenge and he was going to get it and whod take my word over his anyway there was a german waiter wed brought in old bowels and i he wasnt a spy but the newspapers got hold of the story and german fever was high we held on to him for a bit a warning to others so to speak i dont know how barstow found out a lucky guess maybe or he had someone inside the yard he said if sandridge was taken hed let it be known wed made a mistake on the waiter he lay there his arrogance gone did you share the money with bowles but hensley had nothing more to say who is sandridge is he in dudlington or lethering ton is it keating you lied to me about mrs ellison didnt you he asked finally why would she kill her own flesh and blood if i knew that id be ready to leave dudlington rutledge told him no you wouldnt you want it all who killed emma where sandridge is and whether or not bowles was involved emma deserves to be found she deserves to have her killer tried and convicted she was only seventeen for gods sake i lie here and sometimes i cant tell whats true and what i dream i can see emmas face sometimes and shes pointing a finger at me i dont know why i did her no harm not for want of trying rutledge said she was that pretty you never saw her you were twice her age and instead of protecting her you hounded her like all the rest shes in the wood hensley said id stake my life on that he gave a gasping cough that was intended to be a laugh i did stake my life on it i suppose but youll find her in that wood mark my words he began to cough and choke and rutledge wheeled to the door to find the young sister just outside dr williams came then and gave hensley something to make him quiet again rutledge stood by the bed listening to the ragged breathing and waited but hensley had gone where rutledge couldnt follow it was some time before sergeant thompson brought rutledge a report on the contents of the chutney its preliminary he said im to tell you that sir but dr pell says you should know he thinks its arsenic you did say you were in a hurry for the answer how much arsenic enough to kill a man or a woman a good spoonful of the chutney might do it his mind brought him an image of the rector spreading a lavish spoonful of jam on his bread and he thought if towson hadnt disliked chutney hed be dead by now or the timmons girl and her family id like a search warrant to go into the house of the woman who made up this pot ive a strong suspicion that there are two bodies in her cellar the sooner we retrieve them the better thompson said what if youre wrong sir hamish interjected aye what if i dont think i am will you ask inspector kelmore for the warrant or shall i ill see to it sir thompson walked out of the small room rutledge had been given while waiting for the test results it was late when the warrant was issued and rutledge could leave it was nearly midnight when he reached dudlington and he was hungry wishing now hed stopped for his dinner on the road in the dining room under a napkin he found a plate of roast ham sandwiches mrs melford had been kind to leave them he thought and he went through to the kitchen to make himself a pot of tea he had poured it sweetened it and was looking for the tin of milk when he realized what hamish had been telling him for the last ten minutes ye canna be sure mrs melford made themor who filled the sugar bowl you canna be sure rutledge set down the cup of tea and pushed away the sandwiches he had been in northampton for most of the day the house was open and anyone could have left the plate of sandwiches or added something to his sugar bowl he sat there for a moment longer and then went to bed hungry rutledge woke to a hand on his shoulder gently shaking him for an instant he thought it was hamish and a half stifled cry was wrenched from him as he froze trying to shrink inside himself and away from the prodding fingers and even as he realized it wasnt hamish but a human agency he was unprepared for the voice in his ear inspector rutledgeian it was mrs channings voice low and strained he was fully awake by that time and answered her quietly whats happened i dont know its frank keating hes been drinking all day since the fire he closed the inn and i tried to talk to him but hed have none of it i went to bed and left him there in the bar still drinking i thought hes had enough that hell fall asleep in his chair and wont wake up before late morning is he still there rutledge asked his mind beginning to work with some clarity thats the trouble i couldnt sleep and i thought i might try a little hot milk that was at two oclock and when i looked into the bar he wasnt there but the door was standing wide cold air filling reception i think hes gone out it had taken determination for her to walk this far in the night not knowing where keating was or what had sent him to the bottle rutledge said yes all right wait for me in the office ill dress and come down to you she was gone in a whisper of clothing her scent like jasmine lingering behind her he remembered the perfume that elizabeth fraser had worn and how it had suited her lily of the valley very english and subtle jasmine on the other hand possessed a heady sweetness dressing swiftly he went down to hensleys office the heavy odor of smoke still seemed to be caught in the very walls acrid on the night air mrs channing was waiting there her coat around her and her hands clasped together as if she were cold i thought about making us some tea she said but the fire appears to have gone out no dont touch anything in the kitchen stay here he told her while i search for keating oh no im going with you she looked around her and added ive never liked coming into this house theres something heredespair fear i dont know it took all my courage to walk in here into the darkness to search the house for you if i hadnt seen the motorcar outside i dont know what id have done you should have come sooner if hes been drinking all day oh yes she said mocking him and where were you he didnt answer saying instead ive brought my torch and hensleys field glasses if youre ready she got up quickly as if afraid he might change his mind they walked in silence back to the oaks rutledge took her to her room is there a key she held it out to him he went inside and made certain there was no one in the armoire or under the bed wait here and keep the door locked ill call you if i want you to open it i wont knock yes all right ill brace a chair under the knob just to be safe not a bad idea he waited for the sound of the key turning in the lock before going back down the stairs and into the public bar it was empty as shed told him it was still he cast his light about the room behind the bar itself in the corners one table held a nearly empty bottle of whiskey and a glass that had left rings on the surface as if at the end keating had been careless pouring from the bottle from there he began a methodical search of the house beginning with the public rooms the small parlor where hed talked with mrs channing the dining room with table linens set out for use serviettes folded with almost razorsharp edges the kitchen was surprisingly tidy pots and pans set out on a side table the worktable well scrubbed and dishes stacked by size and ready to hand the light moved on and next to a cabinet he found a drawer upturned on the floor its contents scattered as if theyd been kicked about in a search for something hamish said cutlery their blades flashed in the torchlight their wood and bone handles worn with use knives of every size and kind blades sharp enough to cut through hide and muscle and even bone ye canna tell whats missing no he must have pulled out the drawer in a fit of temper letting the contents fall and then he took what he wanted and left the rest if it was sandridge and hed thought that the dying hensley might give him up he might have decided to kill himself rather than go back to prison this time to hang the question was where would he do it rutledge went up the stairs two at a time ignoring a dart of pain in his ankle there were three bedrooms on this floor and mrs channings made the fourth he searched the others then went up another flight of stairs to what had been the servants quarters he had given that up and returned to the quarters behind the kitchen where staff took their meals beyond there were sitting rooms for female staff and male staff as strictly separated as in a convent in the year when the oaks had been built one of the sitting rooms had been converted into a bedroom it was almost monastic the iron bed brought down from the servants floor a stand beside it two chairs a tabledesk and a rag carpet over the floor what had been a tall chest for the servants to keep their coats in had been converted into an armoire for keatings clothes there were few enough of them and only one good suit among them rutledge shut the armoire and turned to the table that served as a desk on it were meticulously kept accounts receipts for goods and spirits and a box of menus and recipes for various dishes hed already switched the beam of light in the direction of the stand by the bed when he realized hed seen his own handwriting moving round the table he looked again and there it was under the accounts only an edge showing he lifted the ledger and found one of the sheets hed written in hensleys office laying out in detail his evidence against mary ellison it was water stained and there were sooty fingerprints across the top as if someone had rescued it after yesterdays fire and only then noticed what had been written on it a pair of uneven creases showed that it had been hastily folded and shoved into a pocket that was how it had got here before he could consider the implications of why he heard a voice in reception shouting his name moving swiftly he reached reception and shone his light straight into the frightened face of grace letteridge inspector she exclaimed surprise in her voice ive looked everywhere for you you must come at once theres trouble how did you know to find me here i didnt you werent in constable hensleys house and i was desperate i came here for frank keating mrs channing is upstairs theres no time it may already be too late someone has broken into mary ellisons housethe door is standing wide and all the lamps are lit hamish said ware for there was something in grace letteridges voice an undercurrent of excitement that didnt ring true he had no intention of leaving meredith channing alone in the oaks taking the stairs again he went to her door and called out i cant find keating but hes armed and may be suicidal now theres trouble at mrs ellisons house and i must go i dont think you should stay here alone no there was the scrape of something heavy being shoved aside and then the sound of the key being inserted into the lock she opened the door her voice breathless i think of myself as brave but not foolhardy she was at his heels on the stairs and together they hurried after grace letteridge down the walk and along the road into holly street hamish was saying i wouldna trust the lass nor the ither they reached the corner of whitby lane and looked up at the ellison house grace had been right lamps were lit in every room rutledge left the two women in the lee of the constables doorway and went up the steps into the ellison house the first thing he saw were splatters of blood on the walls of the entry bright in the light of the lamp hanging there mrs ellison he shouted there was no reply its inspector rutledge can you come to the door are you all right silence greeted his words as they seemed to echo through the house keating he called are you here dont do anything foolish man i mayve been wrong in my conclusions that report was only one of many possibilities he listened to the silence now sometimes it was possible to tell if a house was empty just by the feel of it as if the air itself had more room if shes no here where did he tak her friths wood rutledge ran down whitby street along church street and into the tower of st lukes with his torch in one hand he climbed the stone steps to the first level and illuminated the bell rope setting the torch on the wooden flooring he reached for the rope and began to pull down with all his strength there was a disjointed clang and then he found the right rhythm on the rope a strong pull down let the rope slide through ones fingers and when it had reached its apogee another strong pull down the bell in the tower began to toll a cadence that echoed over his head and filled the tower with its resonance he pulled it five times and then silenced it and a second five times and a third then he left the tower racing down the uneven stone steps and out the door men were beginning to gather most in clothes pulled on hastily over their nightclothes buttoning coats as they walked mrs ellison may be in friths wood he called to them his voice carrying as it had on the battlefield against the noise of the guns we need lamps as many as you can bring and hurry they stood there for a moment staring at him these were local men who wouldnt venture into that wood in daylight much less in the dark of night im not asking you to go alone he told them take a partner keep together but i need you to search there isnt time to send to letherington and there may be someone with hersomeone armed but he thought they were more likely to find her body her killer long away he went back to hensleys house intent on taking grace letteridge with him to the wood if anything was amiss hed be able to put his hand on her she was there shivering in the doorway her gaze on the house across the way wheres mrs channing she went inside there she had a feeling someone must be hurt she wanted to help damn the woman had she seen the blood in the front hall and jumped to conclusions or had she gone down to the ellison cellar to look for bodies he turned and went back to the ellison door calling mrs channing she answered him quietly her voice carrying a warning that something was not right ian could you come into the kitchen please rutledge stood there in the doorway considering his options but there were none the only other choice was the door from the back garden but it would plunge him too quickly into the midst of whatever was wrong in the kitchen with no time to judge the situation there was nothing else he could do but trust in mrs channings warning hamish was hammering in the back of his mind urging him not to trust anyone he stepped inside the house walking steadily through the dining room and down the passage to the kitchen making no effort to conceal his movements and then he was opening the passage door and about to step into the kitchen itself mrs channing stood there her back against the cooker her face turned toward the cellar stairs she didnt look at him her attention was on something he couldnt see rutledge swung slowly toward the cellar door and found himself staring at frank keating holding a kitchen knife at the throat of a whitefaced mary ellison her eyes large and desperate one of her hands was bleeding as if she had tried to shield herself someonemeredith channinghad given her a tea towel to wrap around the wound blood was beginning to soak through there had been a woman in belton kent stabbed and held hostage in her own kitchen but hed been well prepared for that the local inspector knowing the people involved suggesting what to expect and how to approach the angry man inside useful tools indeed here he was on his own frank keating wasnt angry there was a coldness about him that was far more dangerous he reeked of alcohol the kitchen awash in the smell of stale beer and too much whiskey but if he had been drunk he wasnt now keating what is she to you what does it matter what shes done have you been down in that cellar rutledge yes i have he kept his voice steady his hands at his side he could just see mary ellisons expression as he answered keating a bleakness that was there and quickly smoothed away then you know whats down there i think i know yes dont ask me what this woman is to me you wrote that you had no proof ive found it for you keatingi have proof now i went to northampton to find it you neednt have done this dont lie to me what proof is there in northampton theyre in the cellar not in northampton he moved the knife so that the sharp tip pricked at mary ellisons throat tell him tell him what you did keating rutledge began i cant use a forced con tell him but mary ellison stood there the knife at her throat and said nothing there are witnesses here rutledge you and mrs channing myself and the proof is down there he jerked his head toward the cellar if she wont speak by god ill see she dies anyway youll hang what difference does it make to me im a dead man already what difference can it possibly make to me the anguish in his voice was so overwhelming that mrs channing took an inadvertent step forward as if to offer comfort stay where you are he shouted his grip on mrs ellisons arm tightening she flinched but didnt cry out mrs channing stepped back i didnt intend then she fell silent looking at rutledge for guidance why are you a dead man rutledge was already asking the distance between them was too great by the time he reached keating and struggled with him the knife would have plunged into mary ellisons throat he fell back on words instead to talk keating out of what he was intending to do the rector had called him a good listener it would be words in this case that would make a difference must make a difference as hamish was busy reminding him he had to choose them carefully keating was shaking his head unwilling to be lured into rutledges trap mary ellison spoke for the first time this man she said such loathing in her voice that even keating appeared to feel it this man is under the delusion that hes my son inlaw mr mason emmas father stunned silence followed her announcement mrs channing uttered a little sound half pity half surprise hamish said it canna be true he died of a tumor but so much of what mary ellison had told everyone was a lie are you frank k mason rutledge asked the man with the knife he spoke the name with authority as if he possessed the knowledge to support it youve asked london about me havent you well be damned to you i served my sentence i have a right to live as i please it was beginning to make sense rutledge glanced at mrs channing then said to keating can she leave the less she knows the better and have her go for help the instant she steps out that door she came of her own free will i didnt bring her here but here shell stay then lets move into the dining room where the women can sit down mrs ellison looks ready to collapse let her the two words were savage and then he said i wasnt guilty but i couldnt prove it id been out looking for work and a man promised me thirty pounds to help him break into a shop i walked away i had a family i didnt want any part of it money or no but when he came to trial he told the court id planned the crime and carried it out that hed been persuaded against his will to help me why should the jury have believed him i was a locksmith he said with simple pride and a good one hed never been caught before thats the truth of it hed been too careful and he spoke well like a gentleman they tell me hed all but cried in the witnessbox out of shame for what hed done and those twelve bastards in the jury box believed him he went free i was taken up and sent to prison leaving my family destitute beatrice would never have come home to dudlington if id been there to feed her and the child a locksmith married to the daughter of a woman with harkness blood in her veins it must have been a great comedown for mary ellison to learn that the daughter who had gone to london with such high expectations had married a workingclass man no wonder shed told the world that he was dead no wonder shed taken in emma and then seen to it that the daughter who had disappointed her didnt go back to london and her disgraceful life or worse bring her unemployed husband to live in dudling ton when he was released rutledge said and you came here after youd served your sentence to watch over emma i didnt know she was alive mrs ellison had written to me in prison to say that emma and beatrice had died in a fire in london one day i came here just to walk in the churchyard and stand at their graves but there werent any and when the rector saw me and came over to speak to me i asked him if he knew where emma mason was buried here or in london he said i must be mistaken she wasnt dead she was living here with her grandmother i nearly broke down but when he asked my name i said it was frank keating the next day i took every penny i could scrape together and bought the oaks it was languishing but i was good with my hands i could fix it to suit me i couldnt tell the girl she was mine id have ruined her chances but i could see her speak to her from time to time and i didnt think mrs ellison would have any reason to recognize me if i stayed out of the village as much as possible i could still look out for emma he turned to mrs channing and then to rutledge his eyes pleading but his words harsh if you tell anyone anyonei was her father ill kill you too he had dropped his guard only for an instant but it was enough rutledge shouted a warning far too late for keating to recover mrs ellison twisted herself out of his grip dodged the knife and with the full force of her body pushed frank keating down the cellar stairs rutledge heard himself swear shoving mrs ellison to one side he went leaping down the steps to bend over the injured man find dr middleton he shouted at meredith chan ning bring him here keating lay at the foot of the stairs bleeding from one ear his body crumpled and one leg thrust out at an awkward angle he looked up at rutledge his eyes trying to focus never mind me stop her rutledge dared not leave him he knelt beside keating and said help is coming dont move where can she go mrs channing came back shortly afterward with dr middleton grace letteridge told me where to find him she said now go do your work and leave mr keating to the doctor and to me when rutledge came back up the stairs he found grace letteridge in the ellison kitchen she was shaking her arms wrapped around her body i was certain hed kill her she said not the other way round i was in the passage just now listening i couldnt stay there on the street not knowing what was happening which way did mrs ellison go she ran straight into me pushing me out of her way and went out the door inspectori think shes taken your motorcar i heard the motor turn over he went outside and looked somehow mary ellison had managed to crank the car and back it out of the narrow space between houses where would she go he demanded turning to grace letteridge i dont know he remembered mrs channings motorcar at the oaks and started out at a dead run the motorcar had been moved to the side of the inn out of the way of custom stopping there he cranked it stepped inside and gunned the engine it roared in his ears had she gone northor south as he sat there looking out across the fields he could see lanterns bobbing in a line the search party returning emptyhanded from friths wood shed have avoided them he thought and turned south he followed suit running fast his headlamps piercing the darkness it was some time before he caught up with his own motorcar he could see it in the distance tail lamps small red dots just vanishing around a bend in the road if he could catch up with her here in these rolling barren fields it would be better than trying to stop her in a town where she could lose him in a tangle of streets where was she going what earthly reason did she have for fleeing she might have stayed and faced keating down but then keating had opened the cupboard in the cellar there would be no facing that down hamish said into the wind she doesna want to die in dudlington or on the hangmans rope somewhere anonymous where she wasnt a harkness wasnt guilty of murder a nameless woman taken from a canal or a river buried in a paupers grave the vanished mary ellison would be whispered about speculation would be rife but after a few months her name would pass into obscurity untarnished the certainty grew as he followed her mary ellison was choosing her own end her husband had failed her somehow and then her daughter running away in defiance had failed to reach the heights of fame through her art instead shed married a man who was to become a common felon rutledge didnt know what emmas sin had been but he thought perhaps the fact that she was so beautiful had something to do with it mary ellison had watched men making fools of themselves over the girl and in the end she had blamed emma no harkness would wish to be a public spectacle it was somehowunsuitable then without warning his motorcars headlamps swept the sky ahead of him leaping upward and then dipping in a wild arc his first thought was that he hadnt anticipated her decision to crash the motorcar they werent seven miles from dudlington her body would still be taken back for burial and then the delayed echo of the shot reached him rutledge pressed down on the accelerator sending mrs channings motorcar speeding around the bend only his driving skill keeping the tires on the road it was nearly too late by the time he glimpsed the other car skewed across the roadway in front of him directly in his path seemingly unavoidable his hand went out for the brake pulling hard on it putting his vehicle into a gravelspewing skid hamish was shouting at him and he was fighting the wheel wondering if both of them were dead men when the motorcar rocked to a hard stop he was no more than two feet from his own bonnet and through the windscreen he could see the driver slumped over the wheel her head cradled in her arms as if she had decided to stop and rest he was out and running without thinking when he opened the drivers door mary ellison fell into his arms catching her he laid her gently on the grass at the verge then went back to look for his rug to cover her in the dark there was no way of telling where shed been hit blood seemed to be everywhere and he wasnt sure whether she had struck her head against the windscreen or if the wheel had caught her across the chest he brushed back her hair and found the thin line of a cut there blood welling out of it and into her face it wasnt deep enough he thought to account for a gunshot wound there was a long gash on her chin half hidden by the collar of her nightdress and it was bleeding freely as well working frantically he could see her staring at him her eyes wide in her face i dont want to lie in dudlington theres an unused grave in london she managed to say be still dont talk she made an effort to bring her hand to her chest it hurts and he realized that most of the blood came from there not the cut on her forehead or the scrape on her chin this time the shooter hadnt missed rutledge tried to stuff his handkerchief into the wound binding it tight with the belt from her nightdress but he wasnt a doctor there was no way to save her not in dudlington she repeated trying to catch his hand and make him promise what had your husband done he asked why did you kill him hed developed a taste for gambling he was on the verge of losing all we had and emma what had she done to deserve to die she found her mother when she went looking for that cursed bow and quiver the face that had showed no emotion until now began to crumple i couldnt let my granddaughter go back to london to live with a common criminal even if he was her father and afterafter shed found beatrice there was no turning back it broke my heart her breathing changed and he could feel her body struggling to draw in air her lungs fighting the injury if i tell you something will you bury me in london she asked rapidly trying to hold on to consciousness i cant promise then ill take what i know with me her eyelids fluttered a little and then without warning she was gone rutledge laid her back on the grass covering her with the rug from the car she had been he thought a woman of great pride and with it a strong sense of what was due her name she had been the last of the harkness family and she would kill rather than bring dishonor to it a paradox there was no time to think about mary ellison not now hamish was shouting in his ear and rutledge got slowly to his feet turning to look at the hillside behind him he hadnt expected to come facetoface with this man not tonight possibly not ever unless a shot was fired pointblank at him and in his concern for mary ellison he had left himself vulnerable she took the bullet meant for you the man said i didnt intend to kill an innocent woman he looked haggard as if hed slept rough and only a stubborn determination had kept him going and the revolver was still in his hand rutledge said nothing standing there in full view waiting the wind whistled down the hill blowing through his hair he couldnt remember what had become of his hat he thought it was probably still in the parlor on hensleys coattree it didnt matter it wouldnt save his life theyd learned that in the trenches that helmets were necessary he wasnt sure what had happened to his he fought to keep a grip on the present hamish was there in the forefront of his mind now im no ready to die and i willna let you die theres nothing i can do rutledge said in response for this time had been bound to come since hed stood on the steps outside maryanne brownings house in london he had been lucky that it hadnt come sooner that hed finished his work he felt suddenly tired unwilling to fight ye didna want to die in scotland ye canna die now he was aware of the man across the empty road from him dressed in workmens clothing muddy corduroys a flannel shirt and a heavy coat it looked like the remnants of a castoff officers coat the stalker seemed to be considering him in turn both of them taking the measure of an adversary i dont know you rutledge said at last or why you have cast such a long shadow over my life if youre going to kill me at least tell me why its the wars shadow not mine and then he added grudgingly i hadnt expected you to show so much courage what happened to you in the war what happened to all of us you were an officer you should know you bled us without mercy you sat in safety well behind the lines and sent us out to face the guns day in and day out for inches of land what we lost in one attack the next must win back again for your own glory for no reason other than ignorance and stupidity and sheer bloody waste i was in the trenches myself dont lie to me i swore id make someone pay for what theyd done to us i swore that if i survived the fighting id come home and kill as many officers as i could find how did you know that i was to visit mrs browning on new years eve the cook told me id met her in a shop where i swept the floors and sometimes wed talked about france that day she said to the butcher her mistress had guests coming to dine and i asked her who they were commander far num she said and captain rutledge she said was the captain in france i asked her and she said he was four years mind you and home without a scratch on him i knew then youd been far from the front safe as houses somewhere in the rear not many of my mates saw the wars start and the wars end they fed the machine guns instead have you seen what those guns do to a man have you ever walked into a field hospital and looked how to answer him without being accused of another lie whats your name rutledge asked instead he was drained his mind refusing to work with any clarity you never cared to know the names of the dead or the living for that matter we were numbers on the chart table without faces pushed forward because it suited the french or the americans or the war ministry and when those were slaughtered you found more to send up the line you found my brother and my cousin and my neighbors and my son he stopped and looked at the body of mary ellison i didnt mean to kill her and thats the truth i wanted to make you afraid as afraid as i ever was i wanted you to know what it was like to look death in the face to know there was no way out without shaming yourself i wanted you to remember what the guns did to people like us i didnt intend to kill a woman why did you let her drive your bloody motorcar there was a mixture of shame and anger in his voice she borrowed it without asking have you lived out here in the middle of nowhere where did you sleep how did you eat its better than the trenches perhaps it was rutledge thought but it was no way for a soldier to live the man steadied the gun you can beg for your life i never begged for my life from a german and im damned if ill beg it from an englishman rutledge said anger rising in him the revolver fired and he could hear the whine of the shot passing his ear beg rutledge stood where he was her death was an accident he said let me help you before its too late the next shot seemed to ruffle his hair and he flinched in spite of himself damn you beg another shot went wild the revolver wobbling as the man began to cry the tears running down his face unheeded then it steadied once more the muzzle pointed straight at rutledge rutledge steeled himself he couldnt be sure how many shots were left in the weapon but he couldnt reach the man and he knew that if he tried the next shot wouldnt miss listen to me rutledge began my death wont bring your dead back it wont even satisfy you even if you kill a dozen like me it cant change what happened in france nothing can i never intended to kill you he said at last i just wanted to see the fear in your face and hear you beg to live not for you not for anyone hamish was as angry as he was helpless in the confines of death the muzzle held steady and it seemed that minutes ticked by and then the man moved for an instant rutledge thought he was going to kill himself the revolver rose to his temple in one fluid action but instead of pulling the trigger he touched the barrel to his forehead in a salute it was grotesque a mockery of the acknowledgment of enlisted man to officer and yet it was also an admission he turned away striding up the rise and into the dark night rutledge searched for an hour or more but without a torch or a sense of which direction the man had taken he couldnt find his lair the place where hed gone to ground hamish said tomorrow when its light rutledge moved his own motorcar to the side of the road and then lifted the body of mary ellison into mrs channings vehicle his rug still wrapped around her there was nowhere else to put her except in the rear seat where hamish sat turning to drive back to dudlington he wondered if the stalker was watching him and what was going through his mind meredith channing and grace letteridge sat waiting in the office that hensley used for police business their faces were drawn with anxiety and exhaustion and he thought as he stepped over the threshold that they had already said to each other all that there was to say and silence had long since fallen in the room mrs channing started to her feet when she saw him her gaze sweeping him and the blood still wet on his coat his hands what happened her voice was tense are you hurt shes in the motorcar mrs ellison there was an accidenton the road shes dead i must take her home ill come with you mrs channing said as if she had read more in his answer than hed intended grace letteridge stood where she was waiting for a chance to speak to him she seemed to have aged since hed seen her last not an hour before i told you once that id kill constable hensley if i discovered hed murdered emma i remember hes dead she said the message came half an hour ago she lost her composure then and her eyes filled with tears of guilt rutledge found himself thinking beware what you ask for but hed lost any chance now of finding out the truth about what role bowles had played in the barstow affair he would have to face that later when there was time to consider it he thought about this house and how empty it was yet how much hensley had wanted to come back to it the constable hadnt expected his life to end this way hamish said you werena prepared yoursel grace letteridge struggling to keep her voice steady was still speaking to him he tried to listen i also asked the messenger to tell inspector cain aboutabout mrs ellison as soon as possible was that proper he should be here very soon yes thank you i dont think i could have driven that far tonight and frank keating hes badly injured but hell live theyre to take him to letherington to be cared for grace said i dont think i could have killed anyone after all and i felt so certain she shook herself trying to come to terms with an old anger will you send dr middleton to mrs ellisons house he asked her yes after that im going home she turned to mrs channing ill make tea if youd like a cup she glanced toward the street and said ill just wait untiluntil shes inside mrs channing held the motorcars door as rutledge lifted mrs ellisons body and carried it into the house he went up the stairs and laid her gently on her bed it was all he could do what happened mrs channing asked again standing a little behind him was that man waiting on the road as wed feared he told her briefly how will you explain this gunshot wound to inspector cain i dont know somehow i cant even give him a description of the man he was ordinary no different from thousands of others who came back in i must have passed him in the street half a hundred times and never noticed him but im almost certain now hes the one who brought my shoe back after my encounter with the lorry daring me to recognize him hell come for you again when you least expect it i dont know possibly not i think killing mrs ellison instead has shaken him until he discovers she was a murderess and deserved to die changing the subject she said i havent looked in the cabinet in the cellar i didnt want to see no its best you didnt they went through the house turning out the lamps that frank keating had lit during his search for his daughters body when rutledge reached the kitchen again he said i dont think i want to go down to the cellar myself well leave it to cain when he comes its his case after all mine is finished you look terrible and you ought to wash off her blood thank you as soon as cain arrives dr middleton walked in just then looking from mrs channing to rutledge where is she upstairs in her room he nodded and left in a few minutes he came back to the kitchen and sat down at the table his shoulders hunched keating made me look in the cabinet i didnt touch them i couldnt after all these years youd think i had become inured to death he ran a finger around his collar where was she trying to go it seemed sofutile fleeing like that she wanted to die where no one knew her theres an unused plot in london she asked me to bury her there ill do what i can i dont think anyone would want her final resting place to be st lukes anyway best if its all forgotten who shot her thats a gunshot wound you know and you werent armed i heard the shot i wasnt there to see it no one from dudlington im certain of that no one here could have caught up with us in time someone out after a fox who knows he could hear motorcars arriving outside he said to middleton i dont suppose you know a man named sandridge middleton raised his head to look at rutledge theres not going to be more killing is there not if i can prevent it sandridge is joel baylors mothers name his father recognized him when they were married but i dont know that its official the brother who was gassed rutledge turned to go ill send in cain and then theres one more thing i must do in the event it was nearly dawn by the time he had finished with inspector cain after that he walked to the barn where the baylor cattle were housed as he expected he found ted baylor mucking out the man turned to him havent you caused enough trouble that was a wildgoose chase to friths wood i didnt know at the time that it wasnt a matter of life and death youve lost nothing except perhaps a few hours sleep grunting baylor turned back to his work raking the warm piles of manure out into the center of the barn what do you want to speak to your brother joel it wont do you any good to see him it might clear up many things for instance why he hid from constable hensley hensley had known from the start that he was here i didnt know about hensley baylor sighed not until i heard them arguing one night soon after joel had come home after that they avoided each other hensley swaggered on the streets but he knew better than to show his face here i dont think they trusted each other to tell you the truth i was always afraid it was joel in friths wood with that bow and arrow we had them as children he knew how to use a bow look i didnt know about what joel had done either not until much later when he learned a man had been killed in that london fire he joined the army and hes paid for what he did i dont think it will do any good to bring him to justice he wont live to see the hangman you know that still baylor said all right i want to be there he stood his rake against a barn pillar and dusted his hands hes still my brother the only one left lets get it over with they walked in silence from the barn toward the house a few flakes of snow began to fall desultorily at first and then with gathering intent it wont last but it will be colder tomorrow by march the daffodils will be in bloom hard to believe isnt it yes and then endeavoring to bring something good out of so much pain and grief rutledge said to his companion barbara melford deserved better of you you ought to tell her why you havent kept your promise its not your affair baylor started to say but rut ledge cut him off in midsentence good god man are you going to throw away your life and hers shell wait for you if you explain about joel and whos to inherit when both your brothers are dead and youre locked in your own bitterness too stubborn to beg her forgiveness you dont know anything about it but in the snow filled darkness baylors voice was less sure no i dont thats true perhaps you dont care after all dont care the words were wrenched from him gentle god then tell her when joel is dead shell believe youve spoken out of duty and shell refuse from pride i didnt want to drag her into the shambles joel had made of things i thought it best rutledge held the door for baylor and followed him into the house and up the stairs rightly or wrongly your brother lived his life as he saw fit in spite of that you owe him the obligations of blood thats admirable but barbara melford shouldnt be expected to pay for his sins too ahead of him there was a quiet no ill see she doesnt joel baylors windows overlooked the barns and friths wood he wasnt asleep instead he was sitting in a chair struggling to breathe through burned lungs the sound of his efforts filled the room he had been a strong and handsome man at one time now his clothes hung on his thin frame and his face was lined with suffering hensley is dead rutledge said as he walked in ive just been told did he talk before he died the question was guarded but resigned no he was loyal to the end is that the gods honest truth did you shoot him with that bow and arrow i probably would have if i could have walked as far as that wood he made me feel like a prisoner in my own house perhaps youd like to tell me now what happened in london the only witness here is your own brother my word against his you arent interested in what happened to edgerton you didnt know the man its evidence you want against chief superintendent bowles if he was a party to that fire even if he had no way of knowing what might happen then something must be done edgerton had a family they deserve an answer joel baylor turned his head to look out the window if id stayed here and helped run the farm my life would have been very different but i was greedy his words were punctuated with short breaths his back hunched with the effort i wasnt raised to farming thats the trouble you can make amends even now if you tell me what happened he turned back to rutledge i dont know he said and it was hard to judge whether he was lying or telling the truth i cant tell you what lay between hensley and bowles it might have had nothing to do with the fire i set it hensley looked the other way barstow swore the building would be empty still a man died i was paid for my silence and hensley for his thats all i was privy to and it was bad enough i never asked hensley who else was involved you should have but hensley was dead joel began to cough choking on the fluids in his lungs it was some time before he was able to catch his breath again his brother had been right the man wouldnt live to stand trial hamish said hes no going to help but rutledge wasnt ready to give up if you change your mind you have only to send me word not at the yard its better to send a message to my flat joel baylor shook his head in denial nothing more he gasped rutledge was halfway across the room on his way to the door as ted baylor quietly urged him to leave his brother in peace then he stopped and swung around did hensley ever tell you that the girl youd known in london had written to ask what had become of you a miss gregory as i remember that roused joel baylor no i thoughtno damn him he never said a word so much for loyalty then rutledge responded and walked out of the room it was nearly seven when rutledge and mrs channing drove to the place where hed left his motorcar rutledge was surprised to find it still there he looked at the blood on the drivers seat and remembered mary ellison collapsing in his arms as hed opened his door her body had been heavy without the strength to help him he thanked mrs channing for the lift and then walked up the hillside to begin his search again in the earlymorning light he found what he was looking for someone had dug a hiding place out of the earth making himself a safe haven in this winter pasture where no one came in january it was so well concealed that rut ledge could have stepped on it in the dark and still not seen it there was a covering built of old wood and straw and earth shielded by long stalks of grass and even mossy sod rutledge lifted it not sure what he expected to find hamish said hes gone in a way rutledge was glad hed expected to find the man dead of a selfinflicted wound whoever he was he must have been a sniper in the war or a gamekeeper before it he knew how to use the land in his favor how to make it conceal him and protect him he could have lain in wait for machine gunners to show themselves or poachers coming for the estate game under cover of darkness hed learned from the animals he was paid to protect how to disguise himself and how to live off the land but who was he where had he come from and where had he gone hamish said the shop where he swept the floor perhaps rutledge answered not sure he meant it let sleeping dogs lie and he wondered what dr fleming who had brought him out of the darkness would have made of the man there was a square of paper in one wall of the trench caught between the prongs of a split stick rutledge reached down to pull it out it read simply i was wrong hamish said it was a near run thing rutledge slowly let the top fall back into place over the hole when he reached the motorcar he found mrs channing still there waiting that morning just before hillary tim mons had come to shut up the inn for several weeks shed packed her belongings and set the cases in her car ready to return to london nothing had actually been said between them about her departure but rutledge had glimpsed her luggage in the boot she looked up as he came down the slope of the land her eyes searching his face he was gone he said yes id hoped he was let there be an end he stood there by her car listening to the motor ticking over under the bonnet i thought perhaps you were behind what was happening to me you saw too much that first night i know what you thought she hesitated and then said i wish now id done as you asked and taken mary ellison to dinner it might have turned out differently no it was bound to end the way it did you can never be sure of that she met his glance then holding it dont marry that girl in westmorland ian shes been through enough neither of you would be happy for very long she put the motorcar in gear and left him standing there staring after her hamish the first to recover said ye didna tell her about westmorland
