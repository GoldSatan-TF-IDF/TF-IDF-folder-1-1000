jeff abbott promises of home prologue years ago forgive these wild and wandering cries confusions of a wasted youth forgive them where they fail in truth and in thy wisdom make me wise alfred lord tennyson in memoriam what you fellows dont understand trey slocum growled a cigarette clenched between his teeth is that you got to stare death in the face to be a real man the rest of us soontobe seventhgraders werent quite so sure outside the wind howled fiercely rattling the tree house and moaning with the promise of tragedy i knelt on the rough wooden floorboards and risked being called a yellowliver sissy by peeking out the small open window whats wrong jordy you got to see if the bad ol storms comin trey jeered kicking my sneakers with his muddy cowboy boots he was awful proud of those boots always claiming they were handtooled leather from his uncle over in giddings i had a half a mind to tear one off his foot throw it into the storm and let him fetch it my daddy says hurricanes are real bad news they aint no ladies little ed dickensheets said trying to keep a note of panic out of his voice hed been whining since birth shut up dickinmouth clevey shivers teased and then of course little ed was all over clevey pummeling him with fists clevey outweighed little ed by about twenty pounds so he just rolled on the treehouse floor as little ed tried to inflict damage laughing in counterpoint to the lament of the wind little ed exhausted himself soon enough and gave up rolling off clevey honor served by his effort clevey yawned his normally red face a little more florid i believed little eds daddy big ed was a wise man clouds blackened the sky above the colorado river and the wind shrieked through the tree branches like a vengeful banshee they called the storm althea on the tv news and she was bearing down on central texas like a mother who sick and tired of calling you home for supper brandished a hickory switch in her hand she was a hurricane only when she hit the coast trey said knowingly she done spent herself hitting corpus christi they start dyin over land shes just a tropical storm now trey always spoke in this way as if the secrets of the universe had been revealed to him and to no one else we didnt much challenge him on it because he was too cool for words my mamas gonna whip me good for staying out in this junebug moncrief fretted scratching his brown bur of hair i wouldnt be worried about his mama if i were him i always thought his daddy was a sight meaner my own daddy wasnt going to be too pleased about my afternoon either trey pushed his black cowboy hat back and surveyed us sitting around him scowling his nightdark eyes ranging across each of us me junebug tanned little ed redhaired clevey and blond and bespectacled davis foradory who sat placidly playing solitaire smoking a menthol cigarette and ignoring the rest of us yall are just a bunch of little chickenshits trey snorted yall were all gungho to sit out this hurricane in the tree house and swear to be blood brothers in the very face of death itself and now yall just want to run home and cry against your mamas aprons the tree creaked loudly as the wind surged and little eds brown eyes widened as though that cryingintheapron suggestion wasnt a bad one at all i patted him on the shoulder little ed dickensheets truly was the littlest of us still eleven and scrawny for his age we picked on him but didnt let anyone else plus with that surname of his he needed our protection davis foradory pushed up his glasses and cut his playing cards in the slow measured manner in which he did all things theyre going to be looking for us you numbnuts we probably got another ten minutes left till one of yalls mamas calls my mamaw and she comes out here to see if this is where were at the tree house sat near the colorado river in the middle of the live oaks and loblolly pines that gave way to foradory pastureland davis lived on the farm with his grandmother foradory who was a right sweet old lady and his grandfather who everyone knew had lost his mind and never went looking for it the tree house groaned the way id imagined a woman in heat did i could feel the floor swaying against my butt the nosewrinkling smell of wet wood pervading the room you could find a turd in a bowl of ice cream four door trey shook his head at daviss pessimism and finished off his cigarette hey jordy give me another of those will you i tossed him the pack after i took one for myself junebug sitting next to me by the open window looked surprised but didnt comment trey smiled and tossed me the matches look at young master jordan trying to become a man trey laughed as i lit up and took a tentative puff id only smoked a couple of times before i wasnt yet a hardcore smoker like trey or davis i figured daddyd whip me good for venturing into this storm i might as well indulge in the few vices available to me as a twelveyearold i coughed and trey laughed again junebug who did not approve of cigarettes looked away from me i saw treys eyes watching me and junebug as though some contest for my lungs was being waged it had seemed a good idea riding out the storm together id gotten worked up with excitement sitting around the house that still summer day watching the grayishwhite curls of altheas strange clouds inch across the sky knowing that they were from some fierce faraway tempest that might touch or spare us no telling although mirabeau was a few hours inland daddy and mama stayed by the tv and radio nearly all day there was talk of evacuations of corpus christi and galveston talk of the hurricane in that had leveled galveston and killed six thousand people talk of earlier deadly texas ladies carta beulah and celia and talk of flooding in the inland towns on the texas rivers mirabeau sat in a gentle bend of the colorado and wed all been watching the skies waiting for the torrents that must come if althea hit the coast at an unkind angle trey had stopped by while i sat on my front porch idly tossing a softball in the air with little preamble he proposed camping through the storm in the old foradory tree house we used for smoking cussing and bragging are you crazy sit out a hurricane in a tree house shoot shell be all broke up by the time she gets here if she ever shows up not much more than a rainstorm i reckon get junebug and clevey and davis itll be cool we can brag about it in school boasting was treys butter on the bread of life if it aint gonna be so bad then we wont have too much to brag about i pointed out although the suggestion did have an edgy appeal i wasnt about to jump into another one of treys harebrained schemes id gotten my britches warmed good for the last one fashioning a swing rope on the bridge into town that spanned the colorado trey deliberated pushing back his cowboy hat he dressed just like a grown man did his daddy tended horses out at hart quadlanders place and trey felt it necessary to dress exactly like his father western shirt faded jeans and boots that were cared for like a rich womans skin if the storm aint shit then we just hang out butand the devil glinted in his dark cherokee eyesif it is then we can say we stared down death i let the softball rest in my hand trey would do any crazy stunt that popped into his brain if reason was ink he couldnt dot an i but he knew that i was the barometer of what would impress our peers if i thought the notion was worthwhile hed pursue it with relentless vigor but this idea sounded a little insane like perching on the tracks of the approaching train and taking your own sweet time to get out of harms way i dont know trey look jordy he said in a caressing voice hed later use on women with much success itll be the last great adventure of the summer well all be trapped in school soon enough and man thatll be real death lets do it we havent had a storm like this come in ages next time one this big comes well be long in the tooth less we get killed today i tossed the softball back up into the air he shrugged okay jordy the rest of usll sit up in the tree and watch you swim with the other losers when the floodwaters come i frowned at him the ball bouncing in my hand i still hadnt figured out why treyd decided last year to be my friend since birth id hung around with junebug and davis and clevey and little ed trey was too cool for us regular kids what with his calmly appraising eyes loners swagger and quickfisted way of dealing with anyone who crossed him but hed taken to me and then to the others i wasnt sure davis and junebug were pleased about my newest friend but trey finally beguiled them a natural air of danger surrounded trey that other boys couldnt resist he made mirabeau less boring an achievement of no small value my mother came out on the porch drying damp hands on her slim jeanclad hips as always trey was at his most gentlemanly with her tipping his hat like she was a houston debutante come to call mornin miz poteet i was just tellin jordan here that were fixin to get us some blowin tonight my mother with her blonde hair high cheeks and penetrating green eyes was the prettiest of all my friends mamas and the smartest and the funniest i took great pride in her she came up behind me leaning against the back of the wicker chair she liked trey but i didnt think she was ever fooled by his wiles he was trouble pure and simple good afternoon trey i hope yallve got your horses set to weather the storm yasm we do daddy and mr quadlander are gonna take good care of them and wont you be helping them mama asked her voice wry it was a practiced game between themher giving him his chance for a honeyed explanation trey posed the poster child for earnestness with his cowboy hat held over his innocent heart and a dark cowlick standing at bent attention ah no maam see im going to be out courtin miss althea so she dont blow any of us away he was only a boy but already he had the sparkling eye of a dedicated flirt mama laughed a sweet musical tinkle that sounded more like a young girls than a mothers ill certainly sleep better knowing that youre protecting us all jordan im going to make lunch now trey would you like to stay and eat ham sandwiches with us no thank you maam trey smiled it was hard to believe the number of cuss words hed taught me when he put on his proper talk i got to go buy miss althea some candy and flowers mama laughed ruffled my hair knowing full well it would mortify me in front of trey and said come eat in a few minutes jordan trey if your miss althea gives you grief and you and your daddy run short of water or food yall come see me okay yes maam trey nodded with respect as mama went back inside he shook his head jesus jordan your mama sure is pretty i smiled that he thought mama was pretty but stopped when i saw the wistful look on treys face he didnt even have a mama cancer took her was the only explanation he ever offered they said on the radio the storms hittin corpus right now trey continued his gentle cajole that means shell be here in a few hours look that tree house has been there for twenty years its as solid as a rock well meet there at four oclock okay i hated to disappoint him but i still wasnt keen on his plan this idea doesnt sound too swift he shook his head stare it in the face jordy you dont want to be the only chickenshit that doesnt show up and with a smirk he straightened his black cowboy hat and sauntered down the street of course id shown up boys do foolish things and my friends and i were determined to be junior achievers in the idiot division id told mama i was going to wait out the storm at junebugs and hed told his mama he was staying with me mamad fretted but let me go trusting me not to be stupid the others told similar lies and thats how i found myself crouching in a shuddering tree house the illicit taste of smoke in my mouth staring across the dimness at trey the burning ember of the cigarette dangling between his fingers rain blew in with increasing force davis carefully stashed away his cards stretched out his long legs hed hit his growth spurt first and fiddled with the transistor radio hey put on some music trey demanded some buck owens maybe im trying to find the station in bavary see what they say about the storm davis said if their towers down were gettin the hell out of this tree junebug said sounding like an old man davis played gently with the controls garbled static was all he could summon the bavary station seemed to have trouble deciding whether or not itd stay on the air when do you think the eyell get here little ed asked quietly this is the eye little ed trey teased once that other side of the storm hits this tree housell probably land in oz yeah little ed and you can be a munchkin clevey laughed little ed frowned yeah and you can be one of those buttugly flying monkeys heavey clevey didnt care much for that particular nickname bestowed when hed gotten a real sudden case of stomach flu in second grade and blew his cookies all over miss lavinia duchamps school desk while trying to get permission from the old battleax to run to the bathroom he started pummeling little ed but junebug forced them apart he was always our peacemaker our healer of young wounded egos yall shut up davis snapped kbavs back on intermingled with the static which was sounding more like wind to me the longer i listened to itor perhaps every noise now sounded like wind were a few words we could make out heavy rains reported near bavary and east bonaparte county do not travel unless absolutely winds gusting to mph with threat of tornadoes forming a man reported missing in la grange due to flashflooding hmmph junebug frowned at trey this wasnt so clever of us to do this now was it we ought to get on home you can go out in that if you want stinkbug trey said i think its probably safest for us to stay right here he leaned against the trembling wall of the tree house and propped his boots up on the crates we used for a table no whats safest is for us all to hike back to my mamas house and stay there davis foradory stood and stretched i think weve proved enough trey come on lets go on back to my mamaws we can have chocolate milk and cookies chocolate milk and cookies trey mocked in the overly nasal tone a lounging prince might use that just sounds divine four door im sure you and the other ladies will enjoy yourselves better than getting our asses blown over to fayette county davis shot back he wasnt easily gulled by trey he pulled open the rattly door the torrent outside roared wind and rain gusting in over us davis gingerly set a foot out on the ladder and paused jesus shut the door clevey hollered davis turned back his eyeglasses already coated with raindrops do you hear that sounds like the trains running trains no trains would be running as a hurricanes totters tore across the texas coastal plains i peered out through the window squinting into the darkness darkness squinted back at me it was almost as though night had settled on mirabeau as althea passed over like some shadowy wraith eclipsing sun and summer sky i saw trees bending hard in the wind and grass in the foradorys pasturelands rippling like waves on the ocean then i saw it a dark jagged line moving toward the woods except this line was spinning its point in the earth its top arcing back and forth in a short pendulum swing tornado i screamed the other boys froze with shock yeah right jordan trey began but then he caught sight of my eyes his face blanched like an old mans im not kidding tornado coming get out get down the ladder i hollered there was a mad scrabble as boys leaped for the rope ladder we had pulled up behind us pushing it out into the darkness it unfurled like a cracking whip i yelled at clevey go down first and hold it steady for the others he nodded fear in his freckled face as he moved down each rung his weight brought the ladder back toward earth i saw clevey reach the bottom practically sitting on the last rung to steady it gusts tore at his hair like a madwoman and looking down at him i saw him staring toward the funnel eyes wide in shock i turned to little ed pushing him out next followed by davis i gestured at trey go i hollered im sorry jordy he said in a whisper that somehow cut through the screams of the storm he descended into the slashing wind and darkness junebug turned from the window his eyes intense we gotta go now jordy now he ordered shoving me down the ladder climbing down practically on top of me clevey still crouched on the bottom rung the others were gone running god knows where i fell to the ground the storm shoving me with the force of natures worst bully where are they junebug shouted at clevey house clevey yelled back four doors house nearly a half mile away i stumbled junebugs hand gripping my wrist as he pulled me along he was bigger than me and i didnt resist i could hear a roar like a growl of god i tried to cry out but the gale tore my voice from my throat sending it spinning far above into the dark rotcolored clouds junebug and i ran across pastureland toward the old river road that snakes along the shores of the colorado i risked a glance back and through a sheet of rain saw the frees churning in the circular wind our boyhood hideout and second home cartwheeled crazily apart like a matchstick house its heading this way i screamed into junebugs ear run run we didnt get much farther halfway through the pastureland we fell into a ditch with water already swirling in it i tumbled head over heels junebug sliding down more gracefully i landed in muddy grasstopped water i froze in terror thinking a flash flood would sweep us away but the rain was collecting placidly and was only up to our anklesfor the moment we were alone lie down cover your head junebug ordered me wheres clevey and trey and the others i hollered but he shoved me down forcing me to obey i went facefirst into the cold rainwater sheltering my head with my thin arms junebug pressed down beside me and we waited listening as the roaring twister approached i thought of daddy and mama finding my bodyand my sister asking if she could have my catchers glove she fancied herself a better ballplayer than me which was ridiculousshe couldnt hit to save her life i thought of our friends talking about how stupid we were in braving altheas wrath and i thought of my whole life left unlived in heaven would i forever be a boy or would i get to grow up a noise like gods own tantrum roared in our ears i shoved my face into water and mud and grass trying to burrow into the ground i didnt know how much later it was when i felt junebugs weight ease up beside me i first became conscious of the quiet it was as penetrating as the noise had been an eerie stillness settled on the land and the sky rather than being dark shifted to a bilious greena gigantic dead eye staring sightlessly down at us junebug and i were coated in mud and twigs we shook with dampness and shock our clothes completely soaked the tornado had passed near us disintegrating in the storms competing winds or as it hit the trees that crowded in on the river holy god i heard myself say in something that didnt sound like a childs voice its the eye itll be calm for a little while then itll be much worse junebug started crawling out of the ditch i followed him my breath catching in my throat when i looked at the land trees lay shattered in a swath a dirty smell hung in the air even though wed just been battered with rain where the tree house stood not even the tree remainedonly a gaping maw where the old roots had vainly clutched the land lay like a dead thing clevey junebug brayed at the top of his voice davis trey where are yall oh god dont let em be dead i coughed we got to find them before the eye passes then we got to get to mrs foradorys we cant stay out here again junebug ran toward the woods calling for little ed and clevey his voice slicing through the ominous quiet i followed him avoiding even the trees that had survived seeing too many branches barely hanging on their moorings here i heard treys voice call back hoarsely over here hurry hurry his voice broke shock and fear had replaced coolness and swagger junebug and i didnt see the others right off they had fled into a dense copse of loblolly pines that the tornado spared i finally saw them in a small clearing a stonefaced trey his arm around a sobbing little ed clevey shaking davis staring at the ground gapemouthed we ran up to them and junebug saw her before i did crying out jesus christ the six of us stood there silent for once as a group our eyes riveted on the body of a teenage black girl id thought the sky looked like a dead staring orb but that girls open eyes were the true thing blank empty without a hint of life staring unflinchingly at the storm her skin was brown as rich earth and her face was the kind that just gets prettier with time but she had no more time left she was drenched her yellow blouse molding to her soft motionless breasts i made my eyes look at her face again i couldnt see any blood on her but there was a dent in the side of her long dark hair as though someone had dropped her like a doll from a great and unforgiving height her mouth was open and delicately small white teeth stood in perfect formation a lank of her straightened hair lay across her throat she was wearing a navy windbreaker torn open by the storm old jeans and muddied cowboy boots she was beautiful and we six boys stood paralyzed as the giant wheel of the hurricane moved its calm canopy of eye away from us to thunder down more destruction but where the path we walked began to slant the fifth autumnal slope as we descended following hope there sat the shadow feared of man who broke our fair companionship and spread his mantle dark and cold and wrapped thee formless in the fold and dulled the murmur on thy lip and bore thee where i could not see nor follow though i walk in haste and think that somewhere in the waste the shadow sits and waits for me alfred lord tennyson in memoriam why on earth does wanda dickensheets think she looks remotely like elvis junebug asked me sipping coffee and chewing on a cheese kolache first time i ever saw a woman dressing like a man sister offered dropping another kolache on junebugs plate she left me unpastried putting her head near junebugs shoulder to get a better look at the latest goingson in downtown mirabeau frowning i watched the spectacle across the street ed dickensheets steadied a sign against the blustery november breeze while his assistant fastened a garish placard to the awning of the old dress shop that the dickensheets had bought apparently ed didnt steady it quite right as his wife wanda brayed at him from the sidewalk to hold the placard straight wanda was dressed like elvis presley in his later years resplendent in a white highcollared rhinestoned jumpsuit a black pompadour wig covered her head and her ample breasts were somehow concealed from view i could see eds lips tighten as wanda yelled in her finest fake tupelo accent her jetblack mans wig bobbing along with her temper i hope this doesnt mean little eds going to start dressing like priscilla i said oh my god sister peered out the sitaspells window from the cafe counter shes actually waving a jelly doughnut at him quick jordy get my camera ill sell the picture to the national enquirer i was too busy reading the sign ed was hanging worldfamous institute of elvisologywhere the king still lives as soon as the tabloids find out that elvis is alive in mirabeau i said all those inquiring minds are going to leave those burger kings in chattanooga high and dry well have ourselves a tourist trap get out the radar gun junebug and make the town some money what the hell has gotten into ed junebug asked but i didnt correct him i still thought of ed as little ed hed kept that nickname all through high school up until his daddy big ed dropped dead of one chickenfried steak too many itd been hard to keep from calling him little ed since he still wasnt a big man i resolved to mend my ways after all now ed was a respected seller of radio ad time for kbav in addition to being mirabeaus newest businessman i dont believe its as much ed as wanda and her mother ivalou i offered fighting off the urge for a cigarette to go with my coffee the stress of the past few weeks had pert near driven me back to the packs if wanda is elvis then ivalou is surely colonel parker those two conned ed into that trip to graceland and since wanda saw how much money folks spend on elvis mementos shes been the queen of painted velvet she thinks theres enough people sharing her taste to keep a business running wheres old clevey when you need him junebug laughed hed have a field day poking fun at ed for this one some thingslike cleveys teasing ed until a vein popped out on eds foreheadnever changed cleveyd been coming in daily to the cafe since it reopened last week but he hadnt made an appearance this morning undoubtedly too busy trying to find more interesting news around town for his stories in the mirabeau mirror its better hes not here hed probably request a song from wanda and i dont want to hear her warbling jailhouse rock i said sister made a huffing noise and went to wipe her spotless counters junebug shook his head and then glanced around the newly redone cafe all these new businesses mirabeaus about to get metropolitan dont you think having left boston to come home i couldnt exactly agree with his assessment of the new mirabeau now i love mirabeau its my hometown and i had willingly moved back close to a year ago to help care for my mother whos ailing from alzheimers agony was watching mamas daily slide down into dementia but the idea of her in a nursing home was even more painful i have a horror of those places theyre the modernday version of the iceberg set adrift with the eskimo elderly i had no wish to see my mother in an antisepticreeking dormitory full of people waiting to die in any case junebug was plain wrong the town hadnt changed that much in the years id been up north enjoying my career as a textbook editor the addition of two new businesses hardly signified an economic boom the institute of elvisology might cater to its special customer base a whole six weeks i guessed the newly bought and refurbished sitaspell cafe held i hoped and prayed a far brighter prospect as long as its two proprietresses could agree right now the future looked bleak having abandoned their only two customers junebug and me the two intrepid entrepreneurs debated with pinched smiles by the kolache counter the fragrantly steaming fruit pastries sweeter than their words but no less heated candace sweetie pie weve covered this already i am not preparing any ethnic dishes aside from texmex spaghetti or french fries sister insisted nicely shed finally given up her glamorous job as the cook out at the end of the road truck stop also known locally as hell with twelve booths sister was one of the best cooks in the county and shed finally realized her culinary talent was wasted on folks too roadtired to use their taste buds sister looked right spiffy in her new turquoise tshirt with sitaspell cafe stenciled in white cursive across the front we can nearly pass for twins she and i with our blond hair and green eyes i of course have a calmer more pleasant temperament but my friends in houston say lithuanian food is in my girlfriend candace tully ran a tired hand through her heavy brown hair we need a gimmick something different to grab customers food they cant get elsewhere in mirabeau if we dont lure em no ones going to she paused for advertising pathos and sang in a tremulous soprano come in and sit a spell this recital fired salvo number two sister took a deep breath i already told you candace we are not doing that stupid radio ad if ed stops making a fool of himself in the street long enough to pitch that offkey jingle again you just tell him im not exchanging a month of free lunches for ten seconds of airtime he needs to give us a better deal im sure hes giving himself bargain rates for that fool elvis store sister crossed her arms i knew that meant the conversation was over candace hadnt quite learned yet ladies ladies i stood cajoling peacefully before candace could launch a counteroffensive they both looked up at me like i was aiming to lose myself a testicle i ignored it they both love me too much to actually hurt me yall cant argue out here in front scare off any stray customers that wander in go in the back and wrestle in the flour sister glared candace tossed up hands and said the problem arlene is that theres still loyalty to minerva people feel funny coming in here knowing shes gone minerva halsey had been the sweetnatured owner of the sitaspell according to rumor minerva had opened the cafe sometime during reconstruction and never changed the grease shed died in her sleep two months ago leaving the downtown mirabeau property to a niece in victoria who had no interest in running a cafe in a small central texas river town candace had offered to put up the money she had it to burn thanks to her long family history of aggressive capitalism if sister would cook the food tired of fending off truckers most days sister had accepted now all they had to learn was to work together considering each was as stubborn as a government mule this was no small task fine arlene we wont offer european cuisine candace demurred the very soul of compromise well copy every other single menu in mirabeau and see how that sets us apart from the competition sister rolled her eyes and forced a tight smile this isnt one of them city bistros honey with tables and umbrellas out front advertising water that makes you belch im going to start cuttin chickens for todays lunch special as candace set about wiping off tables that hadnt been dirtied by any customers she muttered about the unhealthiness of fried foods i returned to my seat junebug frowned again watching ed and wanda dickensheets argue over their sign at least wanda wasnt still waving that doughnut i just wonder if this institute is going to offer degrees in elvis studies he said elvisology i corrected automatically i lowered my voice i hope this little partnership of candaces and sisters works out what am i going to do if it doesnt ill be stuck right in the middle junebug shrugged itll be good for them both candace will have a real job for a change instead of all that volunteering its time she worked for herself and arlene itll be nice for her not to slave away at bubba jaspers truck stop he paused for a moment then said gruffly i hated her working out there i sipped at my coffee without comment the burgeoning romance between junebug and my sister had not been exactly unwelcome just strange when two people youve known practically your whole lifeand who have only had the faintest of friendships because of yousuddenly decide to make a go of romance its quite unnerving i couldnt complain that junebug had come courting i just would have never put my mouthy sister and my laidback policechief friend together but considering the horrible history sister has with men i thought junebug made the best possible choice he was a good man sister hadnt dated much in the six years since her noaccount husband ran off to play cowboy with a traveling rodeo and i wanted her to find happiness mind you i was not about to be consulted for my opinion they could make googoo eyes all they wanted then if they broke up guess whod get caught in the middle you only need one try bubbas not too happy about her leaving i took his untouched kolache and began munching yeah i heard junebug looked stern he always was tryin to spark arlene he spoke her name with an annoying amount of reverence i forced myself not to cross my eyes actually i wondered how you felt about all this jordy junebug stirred his coffee not looking up at me what do you mean finally my view on this nascent relationship was going to be asked for i cleared my throat preparing my brotherly blessing well jordy this restaurants going to affect you and candace i mean this gives candace even deeper roots in mirabeau and it gives your sister her own business does that mean youll stay here longer how rude id been expecting a solicitation for advice not a chance to expound on my own problems i didnt want to answer because i didnt want to contemplate my future in mirabeau id given up a promising career in publishing to come back and while being head honcho at the mirabeau public library was fun and often rewarding it couldnt quite compare with the exciting bigcity life id lived now that sister and i had fulltime help to assist with mama sister had abandoned night shifts and started her own business why couldnt i go on back to my old life in boston secure in the knowledge that mama was taken care of two reasons the first was candace with whom id fallen in love when she was working parttime at the library and when i say im in love with candace its a bald statement of fact shes become a part of my thoughts and my breathing the tempo of my heartbeat its downright scary reason number two was bob don goertz loving candace had been a surprise the real thunderbolt though was finding out in the course of a murder investigation this past spring that bob don was my natural father a fact no one had previously bothered to share with me i had to deal with the shock of discovering my mother was flawed with discovering the dead man id loved as my father wasnt my daddy and with dying to deal with a stranger who desperately wanted to be a father to me and bob dons not exactly a shrinking violet about what he wants he has the largest car dealership in bonaparte county you dont build an automotive fiefdom out of shyness i sighed i dont know junebug i dont believe candace will ever want to leave mirabeau she really loves it here does that mean you might consider marrying her someday junebug asked idly oh god i thought hes going to propose we have a double ceremony instead i coughed she and i dont talk much about wedding rings i used to think candace was eager to settle down and get married but she doesnt seem to be in any rush plus i was in my early thirties and candace was in her late twenties so she was still exploring her options at least all the options that mirabeau offered there were about four total and i know cause i counted them one day when i was real bored junebugs walkietalkie squawked he answered it then listened his face growing grim hell emergency out off old river road gotta go he stuck his stetson over his brown crew cut and stood scratching at his slight beer gut that was just beginning to form whats the problem i asked politely junebug wouldnt ever admit it but ive been more than helpful in unraveling some local crises hes not ungrateful but im not exactly deputized goodbye jordy junebug grimaced thanks for the coffee honey he called to sister he scooted out quick before i could offer to ride along i sighed went back to sipping my coffee and tried not to think about those hard questions junebug asked me as a diversionary tactic from myself i glanced out the cafe window wanda dickensheets postured beneath the institute of elvisology sign crouching with fake heartbreak as though shed just finished crooning in the ghetto her cameraarmed mother ivalou purcell snapped orders ami what i could only hope were not publicity photos ed stood surveying the street embarrassed at his wifes shenanigans poor ed i wondered if i asked nicely could wanda be persuaded to trill a rendition of dont be cruel and get the hint i quit having to worry much about candace and sister as my morning got unduly hectic at the library the rest of my staff florence pettus and itasca huebler were both out sick with a bad flu that was making early rounds of mirabeau so i did the layout for the library newsletter returned phone calls to people wanting to reserve books or tapes and listened to a very eager salesman from austin as he pitched unaffordable booktracking software to me determining id earned a moment of peace i enjoyed a cup of coffee out by the periodical tables with the librarys most loyal patron old willie renfro coffee out on the floor is strictly forbidden but he and i were the only ones around and were extra careful i was then pleasantly surprised by a visit from my old friend davis foradory and his son bradley davis kept the nickname four door by becoming a solid kid and plowing through other schools defensive lines for the mirabeau bees our school mascot comes from a lessthanstylish play on the name of the second president of the republic of texas for whom our fair town is named mirabeau b lamar it has cursed all mirabeau high school graduates with horrible memories of wearing too much yellow and black during our formative teen years davis had kept his owlish look though and now he worked as a lawyer and was also a part owner of kbav our countys only radio station not that many men in mirabeau wear coats and ties on a daily basis but davis always looked as sharp as a crease by mirabeau standards you understand he wouldnt have kept a single client if hed represented them in an armanitoo sophisticated to trust at that point today he wore a gray suit with a red striped tie he stood at the counter with bradley who did not look too happy bradleys big for fourteenhed gotten his growth spurt early a gentle blond boy with a smiling face i dont think ive ever seen bradley unhappy but when life is so very simple as it is for bradley i suppose its more difficult to be sad hello jordan davis greeted me with his usual cool formality hes one of my oldest friends but he never addresses me by my nickname hi davis hey there bradley bradley for some reason shy shuffled his feet and stared at the floor hi jordy he finally said jordan this is a little embarrassing i found this under bradleys bed davis reached behind bradleys back and produced a thin childrens book where the wild things are by maurice sendak its a classic most boys bradleys age are hiding a different kind of wildthing literature beneath their beds bradley neglected to return this book when we returned several others a few weeks back davis said using what sounded to me like his courtroom voice i like itcool pictures bradley said by way of defense nervously he dragged a hand across the back of his mouth and along a freckled cheek leaving a wet smear bradley salivates more when hes tense ive noticed admiring a book was a good defense with judge poteet thats okay bradley i love books too but other people might want to read it too and we only have one copy i kept my voice real kind i have a reputation for being sharptongued not sure how i earned that but im genuinely fond of bradley i opened the book and peeked at the due date whoops twenty weeks ago this oned slipped through the cracks bradley gave me a cautious toothy smile davis looked pained breaking rules was not ever on his daily agenda say youre sorry to jordan son for hoarding the book he instructed sorry jordy bradley whispered staring at his feet i take back what i said before he could and did look sad bradleys going to pay the fine out of his chores money davis announced bradley hung his head in furflier shame i did a quick calculation usually we notify someone of an overdue book three times then charge them the fine the replacement cost of the book and a fivebuck extra processing fee thatd come to over thirty dollars for this particular transgression but we hadnt notified the foradorys itasca probably forgot to file the card right i couldnt entirely blame the problem on bradley hed kept the book because he loved it and wed let him the book was being returned in perfectly good shape how many pleasures in life did this kid have its a quarter bradley i said using my patented authoritative voice bradley began digging around in his pockets davis frowned he pointed at a sign some idiotincharge who shall go unnamed had left hanging behind the counter that says ten cents a day jordan that applies to adult literature i said smoothly were currently running an amnesty program on overdue picture books note i was careful not to say childrens books in front of bradley im sure he must have some pride davis wasnt buying now jordan i wasnt about to brook argument mr foradory i am the director of the mirabeau public library and do believe i know our current overdue rates i said this with all the gravity it was worth i was glad candace wasnt here to see me in my nobler moment id never hear the end of it bradley carefully picked a quarter out of a palmful of change held it up for my inspection and when i nodded he placed it in my open hand thank you sir i said im sorry jordy i wont do it again bradley offered i knew he was right id just decided what to give bradley for christmas with his own copy of sendak he wouldnt be tempted by ours and he could spend hours with max and his fanciful friends davis still frowned okay if he wanted to make up for bradleys minor crime he could help me decide how to keep poor ed from selling his soul to elvis merchandisers inspiration struck wed received three new books today a bestselling sexdripping potboiler the latest james lee burke and a new childrens book they still lay on the counter bradley we just got in a new picture book want to be the first to look at it his skyblue eyes lit up and he laughed a deepchested cawing if he hadnt been deficient in certain areas he might have been considered the handsomest boy in the junior high school it really was a shame sure a new book yeah now you cant check it out yet because i havent done all the paperwork or put in the datedue slip this went over his head and i hurried along best with bradley just to give him instructions rather than options you sit over there and be real careful with it since its new i need to talk to your daddy for a minute bradley took the book and ambled to a chair mumbling to himself davis looked like hed just been summoned to the principals office you have a second davis i asked i guess i need to get bradley home though cayla doesnt like it if hes out long he followed me into my little office i sat on the desk and gestured toward a chair hows he doing with home schooling i asked davis shrugged as well as can be expected cayla has the patience of a saint with him of course i think its hard not being around other kids as much but hes probably learning more maybe well have him in regular school again before too long if caylas comfortable with him being back around other kids davis indulged himself in a long sigh ive found its best not to hope too highly for bradley that way he doesnt get disappointed i thought it was more that davis didnt get disappointed but i forced my jaws shut davis misinterpreted the thinness of my mouth im sorry about the book jordan davis ran a hand through his thinning strawberryblond hair i hoped i wouldnt lose mine as quickly as he seemed to be relinquishing his oh dont worry about it actually i wondered if youd talked to ed about his institute of elvisology you know that wanda cavorts about town acting like the king during various stages of his career shes practically auditioning for a postage stamp davis permitted himself a quick smile i had lunch with ed yesterday wandas pretty excited about their new venture her mothers pushing ed and wanda to make a success of it i sighed eds heart isnt in that store im not sure he even likes elvis poor little ed i swear that woman and her mother are going to clean him out look hes got a good job with you at kbav i hope hes not going to forsake that he says he wontwanda and ivalou are going to run the store eds just putting in all his money i made a face okay call me immature doesnt that sound crazy to you ed and wanda arent exactly famous for business savvy davis nodded back on the familiar ground of commerce and bankruptcy first the nursery she wanted to start then the artsandcrafts store and now this not a single one ever pans out for them im afraid the only good that could come out of this is if he went bankrupt maybe wanda would divorce him thatd get both her and that vulture ivalou out of his hair i hate to see him throwing money away davis cant you talk him out of this crap youre a lawyer hed listen to you davis preened a little at the compliment like a peacock settling its plumage before a flock of hens i tried but wandas got him by the short and curly im not sure what he sees in that woman i shrugged isnt it awful davis he hasnt even started and were both already sure hes going to fail again i ought to have more faith in him davis shook his head and adjusted his wirerim glasses its hard to have faith in eds entrepreneurial sense when you know his history i started to tell him about junebug getting called away because of an emergency this isnt new york and we dont have that many emergencies on bright fall friday mornings when a tinkling bell announced the early arrival of my newest volunteer gretchen goertz technically gretchen is my stepmother in that she is married to my biological father however since most of mirabeau still regards the late lloyd poteet as my dad gretchen being my stepmother is not a relationship id advertise neither would she we just dislike each other too much she resents my presence in her husbands life and any attention and time he pays me i take exception to the attempts shes made to blacken my character and run me out of town its a lovehate relationship in that we love to hate each other bob don despite his kindness to me i still have trouble referring to him as my father had come to me a couple of weeks back and suggested that gretchen volunteer at the library id sooner have invited jack the ripper to restock the crime shelf while genghis khan minded military history and joseph stalin handled psychopathology but bob don pleaded with me i just hate that you and gretchen dont get along he had said in his most coaxing salesmans voice twisting the gaudy diamond ring on his right hand and i think if yall worked together youd understand each other shes trying jordy to accept that youre in my life shes been squeezing in a therapy session over in bavary between her alcoholics anonymous meetings and she says its helping her deal with her anger i think shed like to deal with her anger by eviscerating me bob don please jordy i have never asked you for anything but i am asking you to give her a chance id had to consider it of course bob don pays for my mothers home health care which keeps her out of a nursing home and prevents my pocketbook from being pirated but aside from thathe is my father and i felt i should endeavor to make the relationship work id counted to ten and forcing a smile agreed on a preliminary basis anyway id needed a new volunteer to replace candace who was resigning from the library to reopen the sitaspell id just made sure i wore an athletic cup to work the first day gretchen showed up i figured shed appear grouse and then i could dismiss her with a clear conscience it hadnt quite worked out that way gretchen to my surprise proved a conscientious worker and a quick study her only failing thus far was her nearly fanatical adherence to every letter of the rules which i interpreted as i damn well pleased and an occasional criticism of me always couched in the most diplomatic and helpful language the librarys not so big with one glance gretchen took in old man renfro with an empty coffee cup at the periodicals bradley foradory looking at a freshly cracked book and me having a teteatete with davis instead of devising an improvement over the library of congress system i could see her whole body frost in about one second she stuck her head in my doorway need any help she asked i wondered if shed left the front door open seemed a little chillier in here all of a sudden no thanks gretchen i said davis stood saying he had to go but manners made him pause and inquire about my mother i answered his questions briefly and politely i know folks dont like to talk about alzheimers they act like its catching the niceties completed he retrieved his son all right bradley dads wasted enough time here time to go home and i saw it for a moment nakedly sharp fear crossed bradley foradorys face he flinched as his father reached for him the expression vanished in an instant replaced by the amiable empty look bradley usually wore he let his father guide him to the counter bradley gave me the picture book thanks jordy thats a pretty book bradleys manners are far better than most peoples pretty book gretchen snatched the book from me as soon as bradley handed it over like i said his manners are better than most well if you want to check it out you come back by later and well have it all ready i offered he gave me one of his purely happy smiles he seemed okay but i felt uneasy as i watched davis steer bradley out of the library was that boy afraid of his father a vague apprehension tugged at me as they left gretchen permitted me five blissful seconds of silence before starting this book hasnt been processed jordy youre not supposed to let anyone have it until its processed gretchen wouldve made a great librarian in the dark ages when they chained tomes to shelves to keep them from being stolen god only knows what vengeance she would have exacted as bradleys late fee probably she wouldve lopped off his arm and mounted it book still in hand above the return desk as a dire warning to all others gretchen im not in the mood for this i thought you came in to help not to lecture me well pardon me mr losethetaxpayersmoney she huffed she clutched the book to her blue argyle sweater vest and glared with her steelygray eyes these books dont grow on trees you know that little retard could have wandered off with it orworsedrooled all over it i glared at her i dont like that word gretchen not one bit please dont use it again in this library she surprised me by looking ashamed she ran her nailpolished fingers through her short permed gray hair im sorry youre right bradley cant help the way he is i dont know the fancy words for his condition so i call em like i see em i was still amazed she wasnt quarreling with me i softened my tone you can say he has a disability without hurting his feelings she nodded as though it took an effort id suspected bob don had pleaded with her plenty as well i knew she loved my father that she wanted to make her marriage work and that shed make peace with me for that end shed already sobered upand stayed that way i gestured toward the new books since you reminded mecorrectlythat the books need processing go ahead and do the paperwork okay i will she said back to her usual stridency fine i pushed the restock cart toward the shelves suddenly fraught with worries about junebug wooing sister candace making a go of the cafe my friend ed losing his shirt to his female elvis having an ill staff feeling unease over bradley and dealing with my favorite volunteer i had a hell of a headache if darwin ended up in the religious section today i wouldnt be surprised id hoped to escape the library for lunch right before noon but to my eternal regret i didnt friday at noon is a terror so complete so utter and so deep that no adult should have to withstand it friday is story day the kids start arriving about eleventhirty and once theyre inside their volume controls never seem to get adjusted games of tag in the stacks are extremely popular as are attempts to smuggle in crayons either for vandalism or for a delicious prelunch snack the periodical section usually habituated by the elderly clears out faster than an afterhours beer joint when the sirens approach whoever said old folks crave the company of children needs to come into this library on a friday and see how spryly these eldsters get away from the little tykes dont get me wrong i love children wellbehaved children in the look whats new bin im always displaying books on child discipline and the virtues of celibacy but they just dont seem to move i might try personally recommending selected titles to folks who should reconsider adding to their brood in the future to my neverending astonishment gretchen lives for story day she wanders among the future embezzlers and spouse cheaters sweetly cautioning them to put that down or dont put that in your mouth she insists on the little darlings calling her aunt gretchen and me shudder uncle jordan it might be easier if a lot of the mothers stayed for story day and several of the sainted ones do but too many moms see it as the friday babysitting service and duck out to shop or have lunch or meet some trucker out at the highway motel also known as the mirabeau mattress for a little midday epic of their own either gretchen reads stories to the assembly or miss ludey murchison does miss ludeys certifiably insane in my opinion but she likes children and they love her shes around eighty and has a wonderful reading voice that is frequently broken by coughing or gasps for air ive tried to break her of her occasional habit of chomping pears while she recites but she says she needs her vitamins fortunately i know both heimlich and cpr so our bases are covered a huddle of pintsized literati swarmed around my knees as i worked my way across the room im convinced the large number of children in mirabeau is a direct result of the towns limited entertainment options people really should read more i did a doodie a diaperclad individual of undetermined gender informed me the speaker straddled my shoe while making this announcement i moved my foot back how nice i smiled encouragingly go tell aunt gretchen im sure shell be interested the child tottered off its balance suddenly at risk lord give me strength i honestly didnt expect the day could go further south until that is trey slocum wheeled himself into my library and i felt the cold hardness of hate enter my heart when i was a senior at rice university i went to a friends halloween party his family was a large rambunctious louisiana clan and theyd gone all out festooning the house with goblins and ghouls and sticky fake cobwebs they provided an open bar and a couple of fortunetellers my friends greataunt was one of the holiday seers a drunken old woman who in hindsight was pathetic but at the time seemed terribly amusing we all mustve been drunk not to pity her she was laying out tarot cards between generous gulps of red wine and as she tossed a card toward me it spun flat across the table whirling a hanged mans picture i flicked at the cards corner snickering and made it twirl back across the smooth cherrywood tabletop the old ladys hand had lashed out catching my wrist in a death grip dont you laugh at fortune little boy and dont you make it spin she hissed at me the smell of cheap grape heavy on her breath fortune always spins back around in good time theres no need for you to jostle the wheel i quieted at this unexpected pronouncement and my date pulled me away from the table to dance to the latest depeche mode song id never forgotten what that drunken lady had said to me though god did fortune spin around before trey came in i was helping two new patrons an attractive but roughlooking woman in her midthirties and an intense young man around thirteen judging by her hearty ruddy complexion and weathered hands the woman apparently spent a lot of time outdoors she had brown hair that would have been beautiful if shed just left it alone instead shed teased and moussed the front of it so hard it resembled a rabbits frizzy tail id noticed her eyes toochocolatebrown ones clear and intelligent there was something vaguely familiar about her but when you live in a town where some of the same families have lived for generations you arent surprised by nagging thoughts that you may have met someone before you aint the librarian she politely said after telling me her son wanted to get a card her eyes appraised me frankly and she had a crooked sexy smile you dont got gray hair and a gingham dress not today i only wear the gingham on wednesdays i pulled out a blank form for her and the boy to fill out im jordan poteet well hello im nola kinnard and this is my son scott the woman answered her son was around my nephew marks age a plainlooking brownhaired boy with a shy demeanor a pug nose and clear hazel eyes he mumbled a quiet hello and offered his hand after his mother gently elbowed him giving me a curt handshake while scott puzzled over the form nola kinnard chatted about how much she enjoyed being back in mirabeau i glanced away from her and that was when i saw trey slocum in a wheelchair easing himself through the front door my whole body iced held cold for a minute then began a quick thaw as shock and anger heated me shock that he was in a wheelchair and anger that he was even in town he didnt see me at first he was examining the posters id made to advertise the kids christmasbreak reading program nola kinnard still prattled at her son her voice sounded as far away as though she were on the other side of the river slowly i turned to her and said im sorry what my own voice usually a little raspy was hardly more than a croak how many books can he check out scotts had to go quite a spell without reading and he wants to catch up i like the dune books scott spoke up finally for himself his voice stood on the edgy brink of change i only got through the first couple before we left beaumont and i im sure there was more and if id been in my normal mind i would have gladly listened finding a teenager who enjoys reading is gold in my book but my eyes left scott and nola and went back to trey whose gloved hands were poised above the wheels of his chair he was staring at me stockstill in his own shock nola kinnard glanced to where i was looking and said oh honey i thought you were going to wait in the car she narrowed her eyes at me appalled at my rude ogling at a crippled man she didnt have a clue honey i heard myself repeating her words and my voice sounded as dulled as an old knife you know that man she looked startled at my tone well sure do you know trey jordy my god trey pulled up his chair across the floor and stopped a few feet short of me he looked much the same as the last time i saw him six years ago chambray shirt glossy black hair under a cowboy hat twilightdark eyes fancy boots a mustache and beard but the patch of chest underneath the open v of the shirt looked wasted the legs in the boots seemed atrophied under the jeans and the skin behind the beard shone sallow he smiled thinly at me my god what are you doing here jordy i didnt know you were back in town i found my voice hello trey i made myself look at his face and not the wheelchair well how nice nola perked up are you old friends we were once i answered before trey couldi wanted the record straight my hands gripped the edge of the counter trey used to be my brotherinlaw i take it youre with him nola looked confused yes im with trey your brotherinlaw jordy maybe you and i should step outside and talk treys voice was low i raised an eyebrow oh god help me i wanted to beat the crap out of this man even if it was in front of a woman and boy hed taken as his own i sensed a presence near my elbow gretchen i heard the faint drone of miss ludey reading rumpelstiltskin to the children and no one knows my name she said in a guttural voice tinged with evil then gretchen broke through the stony tension jordy is there a problem gretehens interference i didnt need right now no gretchen theres not thank you though for asking i stepped around the counter and the kinnards glaring down at trey my hands closed around the handles of treys wheelchair and i steered it toward the door gretchen would you please get scott his card and if youd be kind enough to show him where the sciencefiction books arehes a frank herbert fan trey nolas voice trembled not sounding nearly as confident as before its all right nola ill be back in a minute i need to talk to jordy in private i didnt give him another chance to talk i began pushing the chair rapidly toward the doors for one awful moment i thought of shoving him through the glass possibly one of the meanest fantasies id ever had and i swallowed at the cruelty of it instead of course i opened the doors left them propped open and wheeled trey outside i shut the doors behind me when i turned back trey had moved over to a stone bench in the shade of an ancient live oak the cooling wind that hinted at a coming blue norther chilled me as i crossed my arms and sat on the bench the clouded sky was the color of old pewter the scent of approaching rain and thunder rode the air smelling like pennies stuck too long in a pocket i didnt speak waiting for two elderly ladies to navigate their careworn way past us smiling a greeting and go into the library i turned to trey he stared into my face and lit a cigarette shielding the flame from the november breeze he didnt look like his lungs could inhale half a puff i dont suppose youd believe me if i told you it was good to see you plum he said softly dont you call me that i snapped my grandparents had nicknamed me plum when i was young and sister still reverted to it when she was feeling particularly tender toward me treyd used it on me when hed married sister first to tease me but then out of real affection or so i had thought a sour taste was in my mouth and i wanted to spit sorry i guess im more glad to see you than you are to see me he blew smoke out away from me i watched it dissipate why are you back trey i thought you were never going to come back to mirabeau god jordy aint it obvious he gestured at his legs at the cold chrome of the chair i got hurt bull messed me up good i cant ride no more cant walk i knew i should commiserate with him i knew it but i couldnt hed done his share of hurting the poteets and i wasnt in a forgiving frame of mind are you moving back with those two i pointed to the library through the glass i could see nola kinnard anxiously watching us she saw me see her and she moved away who are they supposed to be trey sister and marks stunt doubles or just another passing fancy i know youre mad at me why dont you just punch me out and be done with it jordy trey said through gritted teeth im not going to hit you i didnt eliminate shoving the chair into traffic though i rested my face in my hands my fingers sore from clenching id never felt such acrid burning anger i wanted to slap the cigarette out of his mouth god this couldnt be happening i looked up at him he looked miserable i take it you have not seen your exwife and son we only struck town yesterday morning so arlene doesnt even know youre here my voice rose no she dont i thought id call her later today call her youll do no such thing i grabbed the chair and stuck my face close to his you have made her suffer enough trey you arent going to hurt her or mark anymore i dont want to hurt arlene you dont how do you think she and mark are going to feel when they see you gallivanting around town with your shiny new family did that ever occur to you his hands clenched over my wrists what are you doing back in town anyway you get fired from your highfalutin job up north no i snapped back i came back here because my mothers dying of alzheimers his face crumpled hed always liked mama that didnt earn any mercy from me of course you couldnt know that since you havent bothered to stay in touch since you abandoned my sister you asshole she needed my help i took a long calming breath theres this thing called family trey it matters you make sacrifices because your family needs you because you love them i know thats a foreign concept to you but i dont need a lecture from you he yelled i dont need you judging me look at me dont you think ive paid enough for my mistakes his voice cracked i stepped back is that your ploy is that what youre planning to use on my sister and my nephew oh lets feel bad for treyhe got hurt off playing cowboy well i felt sorry for you long before you ever got stomped by a bull you had the best woman and the best boy in the world and you gave them up for a bunch of dumb animals i hope it was worth it you moron are you done trey asked his voice cutting cold like the wind yes i am fine im glad youve gotten your usual tantrum out of your system jordan he lowered his voice you dont know the facts i may have left arlene but i never abandoned her i sent her money every month for mark dont lie i shouted but he ignored me and i left town for my own reasons which contrary to what you think had nothing to do with arlene and mark i dont care just keep your distance better yet why dont you leave town again because nolas got family here her uncles dwight kinnard he used to work with my daddy and hes offered to put us up for a while i can believe you were stupid enough to leave arlene i cant believe youre rotten enough to come back steer clear of my family trey i couldnt resist twisting the knife you know she did get over you shes dating junebug now and hes our police chief maybe theyll even get married shes got a real man this time he looked away quickly but not before i saw the pain in his eyes he didnt offer a reply so i turned and went back into the library i felt vaguely ill letting him have it hadnt made me feel better nola and scott stood by the front counter watching us scott held a stack of books clutching them protectively to his chest gretchen hovered between the kinnards and the checkout counter nola grabbed my arm with a strong hand what did you say to him you asshole how can you be cruel to a man whos suffered like he has cruel lady i pulled my arm free that man invented the word but maybe hell treat you and your boy better than he did my sister and her child i hope so nola gave me a hard stare and shoved the door open scott glaring at me suddenly threw his stack of novels at me they scattered at my feet you cant say anything bad about trey scott yelled hes a good man better than you are that boy believed in trey desperation tinged his words the anger seeped out of me id have given anything if he was better than me son i said it would have saved folks i love a lot of grief nola pulled scott out the door ignoring his tossed books i watched her bend over trey hugging him while scott grasped the handles of the chair and maneuvered it to a decrepit blue ford escort they loaded trey in nola lifting his legs for him and tucking them in the car i turned away and stalked back to my office ignoring the character voices that miss ludey provided for the children thered been a momentary pause in the narrative when scott had screamed at me but miss ludey was if anything a trooper jordy are you okay do you need gretchen tried no just leave me alone i slammed my office door behind me and spent the next hour staring at my desk candace is going to drive me to drink sister announced she had come home around four and flopped down on the couch her sitaspell tshirt begrimed with sweat i got to go back there in a minute and do up the dinner fixings the shortorder cook candace hired from that greasy spoon in bavary dont know his butt from a hole in the ground im sure shed anticipated a few quiet minutes at home she seemed surprised to see me but gretchen had offered to cover for me id never left gretchen in charge of the library before and i might be lucky if she didnt frame me for stealing the coffee money while i was gone but i couldnt worry about her not with this terrible errand on my mind god this was going to be hard i sat down next to her slipped her sneakers and socks off and began to give her one of my patented foot rubs the secret is rubbing deep between the toes gee what brotherly concern sister teased oh that does feel good you must want me to keep candace busy while you tomcat around town not hardly i said leaning back against the couch id already checkedmark was upstairs studying geography no time like the present whats mama doing sister demanded taking a nap i hope shes not up again all night i dont need her bayin at the moon on top of everything else sister pushed her other foot into my lap dont rub just one jordy i got to use both of them dogs all day i kneaded the bottoms of sisters foot examining her sole intently i got some news upsetting news but you got to know and you got to decide how to tell mark i stopped rubbing and looked at sister trey is back in town he came into the library today dead silence sister pulled her foot from my ministering hands her face looked carvednot a muscle moved she finally pursed her lips and swallowed her mouth crinkled like shed downed a dollop of poison thats not funny jordan its not meant to be arlene with my invocation of her first name she knew it was true she bit her lip as though clamping down on words she didnt want escaping he got hurt in the rodeo hes in a wheelchair now daddad is here and in a wheelchair i froze mark stood halfway down the stairs he mustve been on his way down for a snack i glanced at sister she wasnt looking at me id figured shed tell mark not me but there was no backing out now having just seen his father i was newly shocked at the resemblance between trey and mark where sister and i are fair marks got his fathers jetblack hair and dark complexion there was much of trey in his face the set of bones that made him look cagey and clever the insouciant walk trey had at marks age the tough hands with stubby fingers today he was resplendent in his latest fashion statement a faded rem tshirt id bought in boston black jeans and red converse sneakers mark had recently renounced cowboystyle clothing sister prayed this was a temporary phase at least today he wasnt wearing a baseball cap backward a trend that for some reason irritates me he came down the rest of the stairs and stood before us he stared at his mother and she stared back at him finally she turned to me what did he say sister found her voice shed pulled her feet up under her and her posture reminded me unpleasantly of a fetal position i tried to choose my next words carefully we didnt talk for long i was more interested in telling him off id been waiting six long years to do that sister and mark were silent then mark said you said he was hurt he got injured bullriding he doesnt look good he cant walk but i dont know if his conditions permanent i assume hes come home to recuperate i paused now for the worst part he has a woman and a boy with him shes got family here but the boy mentioned theyd teen living in beaumont she looks like the type of woman who might work at the rodeosort of sturdy and weathered her name is nola kinnard her boys name is scott hes about marks age sister was unconcerned with treys accessories i saw the effort she made to keep her voice calm well what did you say to him what did he say to you i spoke my mind i told him to stay away from you and mark why why would you say that mark demanded the anger in his voice in his stance reminded me of seott kinnard defending trey in the library his hands curled into fists if i wanna see him i will thats not your choice mark go upstairs sister said in a flat tone no wheres he staying how bad is he hurt i want to know mom i should know his voice softened maybe hes come home so he can see us i want to see him i dont think thats a good idea sweetie pie you should really let mom handle this okay you go upstairs i need to talk with uncle jordy alone this isnt fair mark shouted he sought an alternative to dismissal can i go over to terrys house no you cannot you are too upset please mark just go upstairs and well talk in a minute sisters voice did not brook further discussion mark made a frustrated grunt and ran up the stairs stomping against them as hard as he could and slamming his door for extra effect goddamn trey sister said softly she covered her face and began to cry why did he have to come back why couldnt he just have stayed away like a dead man does her sobbing broke entirely free then and she leaned hard against my shoulder and i cradled her while she wept my hand nestled in the thick blonde hair above her neck i dont know how long she cried finally she pulled herself up said nothing more to me and went upstairs to talk to her son i called candace and told her sister wasnt going to return to help with dinner there wasnt much of an evening rush probably because of the cafes failure to offer a global menu and when i told candace the latest family trauma she forgot about the intricacies of restaurant management and fretted about sister and marks wellbeing i assured her sister would be okay sister has her faults but she is a titanium magnolia made of sterner stuff than most folks mark was a tough smart kidsurely hed be okay but i still ached for them both what about you sugar are you all right candace asked i have never wanted to hurt someone the way i wanted to hurt trey i wanted to beat the son of a bitch to a pulp i didnt know i had that in me i could see candace raise an eyebrow pummeling trey wouldnt have made you feel better just the opposite i just want him far away from sister and mark hes hurt them enough hes hurt you too jordy arlene told me once how close you and trey used to be she said yall were like brothers i closed my eyes thats ridiculous i dont care about any stupid friendship i had with trey he betrayed our whole family i paused its a bad joke isnt it be trey betray god i think im losing it this is killing sister well he better not show up around here ill chop his balls off and serve em up in the chili i managed to laugh thats one idea she said if sister and mark felt up to it that the three of us should come by the cafe and eat dinner i told her id let her know when i hung up i kept my hand on the receiver should i call my old group of friends and let them know trey was back in town maybe if they kept him busy hed stay away from sister and mark clevey ed and davis might appreciate knowing that trey was home maybe theyd pay him a visit and talk him out of remaining in town or quite possibly they could join me in a lynching at least they should know he was back and certainly junebug would be interested in knowing that sisters ex had returned if sister ever needed junebug itd be now the phone rang under my fingers jordy this is junebug his voice sounded grim hey junebug i have a question for you is tarring and feathering officially illegal or just frowned upon what the hell are you talking about i told him quickly about treys reappearance god almighty he finally said so if i want to run him out of town on the rails what are my legal options tying him into a saddle and then giving the horse a whack to make him run a fair distance couldnt get me in trouble could it jordy stop it junebug said im calling with some real bad news real bad you better sit down i couldnt call earlier cause his mama was in houston today and i couldnt call you and the others till we notified next of kin what who you know that emergency i got called out to this morning on old river road well it was clevey shivers someone shot him dead small towns have a ritual for death people gather as though drawn by a lingering spirit of the departed the relative closest to the deceased finds his or herself drafted into the dual roles of mourner and host for some reason large amounts of food are required although no one seems to have much of an appetite ive noticed that the men congregate on the porches no matter the weather while the women claim the homey territories of kitchen and living room children are banished to the upstairs or the yard as if grieving didnt become them my memories of mourning carry the smell of freshfried chicken the taste of a greenbeanandmushroomsoup casserole the odor of oldlady lavender water and talcum powder and the rough feel of my grandmothers porch swing as it creaked a slow and solemn dirge all of this activity is much much easier if the death is expected shortly after junebugs phone call i found myself driving out to mrs truda shiverss house down by the river on bavary road i hadnt eaten dinner i didnt have much appetite i felt terrible about leaving mark and sister behind but they obviously did not want to go and i sensed they wanted time to themselves the air felt heavy as though rain were just a breath away distant thunder sounded from the east and i could see a dark line of clouds swollen with grayness on the horizon wed have a downpour before morning i guessed several cars were already parked in trudas crushedgravel driveway when i arrived junebugs police cruiser was not among them he was busy starting the investigation into cleveys death i stopped the engine and took a deep breath steeling myself clevey one of my oldest friends was dead i waited for the sting of tears but none cameand that made me feel more miserable i shut my eyes and a torrent of memories came forward clevey and i wrestling in mud and getting spanked by our mothers because we were in our sunday best clevey and i as young boys going through confirmation classes at little st michaels episcopal church in bavary the shiveises were one of the few other anglican families in mirabeau cleveys terrified face staring into the storms darkness the night hurricane althea nearly killed us all the pit my stomach fell into when at fifteen clevey told me he was madly in love with gina fontenelle and id been frenchkissing her the night before at a party hed skipped but those were all distant memories id had only sporadic contact with clevey since id moved home hed been polite when wed seen each other but hed acted nearly as if he had a bad cold he didnt want to pass on id seen him twice in the past weekonce stewed to the gills at the bierhaus brewpub in bavary id hardly spoken to him he was drinking alone and didnt seem overly pleased when junebug and id joined him id seen him again only yesterday morning when hed stopped by the sitaspell to give sister and candace a thorough teasing about my eating too many free meals there it had been the closest to the clevey of old that id seen in years a bulletprobably from a had smashed directly through his right eye destroying brain and thought and reason i felt sick and there was no gun lying near cleveys body murder clevey was a registered owner of a but the gun was missing from his house junebug told me it was likely the killer had used cleveys own weapon against him i forced myself out of the car the promised norther had come and i pulled my denim jacket closer around me i steadied my grip on a peach cobbler sister had baked earlier at the cafe and that candaced given me to take to mrs shivers i walked up to the front porch where despite the cooling evening temperature and the occasional gust of wind the men had gathered true to form i recognized several of cleveys cousins from la grange our greetings were little more than nods from me to them and thanks from them to me for coming little ed dickensheets sat on a porch swing his eyes red from crying men dont generally cry in front of one another here and i thought ed had decently gotten his terns shed in private i went over and put my arm around his shoulder and he leaned into my denim jacket embracing me hard for a moment weeping silently i shook my head cleveyd nearly teased him to an early grave and here was ed solitarily shedding tears sorry ed said pulling away and blinking up at me eds fivefive so hes always looking up at folks i wondered how he kept from getting crushed by a big old gal like wanda when they were in the sack oddest things you think about in the midst of death im gonna make you drop that cobbler dont you worry ed how you holding up fine wandas in there with mrs shivers he nodded toward the weathered screen door where i could hear the gentle murmur of womens voices i suppose ed thought that id be as interested in wandas current coordinates as he was well i better get this cobbler in i said heading for the door davis said he was coming junebugs already been byhe had to get back to the station ed said as i went in i smiled to let him know id heard i suddenly wanted to see all my friends very badly the shivers house was old preworld war i built of whitepainted boards and native stone the comforting smell of cinnamon pervaded the rooms and in spite of myself i nearly smiled i could remember long afternoons when school was out watching tv here with clevey playing touch football on the cool green yard staying up late when we were older and blustering about the women wed have someday i found cleveys mother truda shivers sitting in the living room surrounded by many women she was always a polite gracious lady and she was not going to be undone by deatheven that of her son i marveled at her composure especially since shed already buried her husband and her one other child whod died in infancy when clevey and i were four cleveyd gotten his fieryred hair and bulk from his mama but gray heavily streaked her auburn perm she rose to hug me with her thick arms oh jordan sugar im so glad youre here seeing everyone who loved clevey is making this easier for me to bear and what a lovely cobbler her manners werent going to be dented by tragedy miz shivers im so terribly terribly sorry i whispered into her frizz of hair i hugged her tight shed always been really considerate to me and i remembered her many kindnesses since mama had gotten ill she didnt deserve this grief and for the first time i felt a hot anger overcome my shock i didnt want this kindhearted woman to feel the horrible pain of losing her child she pulled back and touched my cheek he was always so fond of you you made him laugh you know he made us all laugh miz shivers god i didnt know what to say id spent most of my childhood around clevey but a wall had gone up between us when id gone off to rice and hed stayed in mirabeau working at the paper a college degree not only opens doors it closes them but that had been cleveys choice not mine i didnt spend the time with him i had as a child but as grown men we were too busy to sit cuss and smoke in tree houses truda shivers leaned against me and whispered walk with me for a moment jordan she murmured a pardon to the other ladies one woman took the cobbler pan from my hands and i put my arm around trudas shoulders she guided me to a wall of photographs not terribly unlike the one my mother had created in our house a gallery of her familys lives various versions of clevey smiled at me from the wall she pointed at a photo of several of us boys from our senior year in high school the good old gang arms looped over each others shoulders posing in the back of cleveys battered pickup i sat between trey and clevey smiling broadly with my hometown brotherhood someone elses stetson perched on my head trey had one hand affectionately on the top of the hat clevey held a beer in one hand and crossed his eyes for the camera davis junebug and ed stood behind us brandishing beers and laughing i remembered the picture it was at a graduation party davis hosted when the drinking age was eighteen and we were all legal the hat on my head was treys and i recalled hed joked i never cared to wear a cowboy hat and damned if we wouldnt get a picture of me in one hed pulled off his hat and put it on me we all looked full of joy if not promise my breath felt heavy in my lungs and i looked away cleveyshe sighedsure did love high school i think it was the high point of his life yes maam i didnt know what to say holding mirabeau high as the pinnacle of ones time on earth saddened me truda saw my thought in my face it was jordan it was but thats okay my clevey was never what youd call a complicated boy she pointed at another photo clevey and i uncomfortable in suits with the bishop standing imperially behind us our hair combed smooth his holy hands on our shoulders guiding our little souls among the straight and narrow a picture from our confirmation eucharist i remembered the bishop smelled of peppermint and his palms were not callused like my daddys trudas hand tightened on mine those two pictures are the biggest helps to me right now she said finally crying knowing that he had true friends that loved him and that hes gone home to god she took a ragged breath and her broad shoulders heaved why why would someone kill my boy she sobbed hard into my jacket and i stood there awkwardly wishing to god i could just give her an answer that would help heal her heart but there wasnt one instead i just hugged her for a long while feeling the surge of her grieving breaths subside as she wept herself out after several minutes one of the other ladiesi thought she was mrs shiverss sister from la grangegently pried her off my shoulder and guided her into the kitchen i was left in front of all those images of clevey with a few of his other relatives sitting and not looking at me wanda dickensheets divested of her elvis accoutrements sat whispering with her mother ivalou purcell they were both bigboned ladies with egos and personalities to match wandas a few years older than ed and its starting to show with widening thick gray streaks in her hair ivalou has a pennanent pinch on her face like shes got gas and shes riding in a crowded elevator they quit whispering and favored me with what i considered wholly inappropriate toothy grins that portended conversation i quickly excused myself and retreated back to the porch davis had arrived with bradley in tow ed resumed his crying as i came back out on the porch and davis gave him an awkward hug cayla foradory daviss wife nodded curtly at me and went inside balancing a casserole dish shes a quiet rather unfriendly woman with fine blonde hair and a perpetual frown what davis sees in her ive never known hey jordy bradley called and waved running toward the house in a ragged gait is mark here bradley davis snapped lower your voice please sir remember what i said about minding your manners bradley jerked like he was on a leash thatd just been yanked minding my manners bradley repeated in a far softer tone i went over to bradley and gave him a hug he hugged back sorry buddy mark stayed at home but i bet hed be glad to see you if you want to come by tomorrow bradley and mark only two weeks apart in birth had grown up together mark despite his sauciness toward his mother and me had always been gentle with bradley maybe he found bradley impossible to stay mad at for long davis was accompanied by his cousin who i was delighted to see eula mae quiff was not usually the first person youd invite to a wake but she was sure to liven it up eula mae was our local celebrity a prolific and successful romance writer although shed been agonizing over her latest torrid magnum opus i hoped she wouldnt start bitching about writers block this wasnt the place of course eula mae considered the world her stage and cleveys death might just be a minor scene eula mae made her rounds embracing each of us she was about twelve years older than we were and viewed us like errant little siblings she saved my hug for last considering how much free advice she dispenses my way i suppose she considers me a special case jordy what a day youve had first that nogood trey slocum back in town and now poor clevey dead she patted her mountain of reddish curls with a ringheavy hand eula mae should not be allowed near open bodies of water while wearing that much jewelry howd you hear about trey being back i asked that dreadful gretchen creature called me as though she and i were ever friends especially after the hateful way shes treated you anyhowshe sniffedshe said something about you needing your friends now and she thought id like to know about what happened at the library with trey gretchen concerned about me the world was getting weirder by the hour how are mark and arlene holding up have they seen him eula mae asked taking a casserole dish from davis who was now having to comfort a onceagain weepy ed no they havent and i told him to mind his distance well sweetie im sure itll all work out i really must get inside and see how poor truda is hows she holding up as well as can be expected considering her sons been murdered actually i think truda is an amazingly strong excuse me a distinguishedlooking gentleman tall and lanky with silvering brown hair eased past the front door and came out onto the porch i moved aside to let him pass and found myself slamming into eula maes casserole dish her jaw was about to dent the saran wrap cover of her broccolicheeserice medley i watched her watch the gentleman walk to an unoccupied corner of the porch produce a pipe from the innards of his brownandtan houndstooth jacket and fill it with tobacco what marvelous hands eula mae breathed i wonder who that man is i dont believe ive seen him about i cleared my throat dont you have to go get that food to miz shivers eula mae recovered herself although i found myself wondering if her plot logjam would be suddenly splintered by the appearance of a dashing new character in his early fifties of course cmon davis lets go see truda she went inside ed watched them go blinking redrimmed eyes he took a long breath as if hed been swimming a distance and walked over to me he glanced around the porch making sure we werent overheard hey jordy we need to talk but not in this crowd you gonna stay awhile yeah i think so ed shook his head damn sorry business this is he went inside i made my way over to the pipe smoker studying him as i approached he looked educated wealthy and not a lick like any of the shiverses who kept a nice consistent gene pool that led to auburn hair smiling ruddiness and heft he wasnt watching me his blue eyes were locked on my group of old friends he turned slightly startled as i offered my hand hello i dont believe weve met im jordan poteet an old friend of cleveys hello his voice was fullbodied and soothing im steven teague i blinked i didnt know any teagues in mirabeau are you visiting from out of town never could say i wasnt nosy perhaps he was a distant relative who lived in austin or houston he puffed on his briar no im new to mirabeau were you a friend of cleveys not exactly he didnt seem inclined to talk i didnt press the issue and left him alone with his pipe i walked down the rest of the porch and one of cleveys numerous cousins stopped me hey you get anything out of that fellow no he didnt say a word aside from his name and that hes new to town well according to aunt truda he was cleveys psychotherapist psychotherapist why on earth was clevey seeking counseling oh i see i managed to say aloud i excused myself and approached steven teague again pardon me i understand you were cleveys counselor he smiled thinly wormed it out of the family did you mr poteet no his cousin just told me i didnt realize that clevey was in therapy he didnt want to discuss cleveys problems his face shut like a slammed door i felt i should come pay my respects i know that clevey was very close to his mother he produced a card steven teague lmswacp therapy and counseling services with a mirabeau address steven teague saw me trying to decipher the code dont worry im a licensed professional ive got a masters in social work and im an advanced clinical practitioner oh yes well i see i fumbled stillclevey in therapy hed seemed moody at times but he didnt carry himself as though he were burdened with problems if in the days to come you find yourself troubled by this horrible incident jordan and you need someone to talk to im available thanks i made myself say hearse chaser i thought but perhaps i was being uncharitable i didnt get much of a chance to ponder steven teagues clinical ethics eula mae materialized next to me smiling up at steven ed stood beside her poor truda is refreshing herself in the ladies room she murmured in a whispery aside to me ill just have to pay my respects later and you are i introduced steven to eula mae i decided to leave him to her tender merciesuntil i saw a truck pull up and park next to eula maes purple bmw i recognized hart quadlander as soon as he got out and i shouldnt have been surprised that trey was with him hart owned a big horse farm on the eastern outskirts of mirabeau and treys father had worked for him for years the quadlanders went back to some of the original german settlers in bonaparte county and theyd managed their money well if there was still a gentleman farmer left in central texas hart was it he was a fiftyish tall powerfully built man with a deceptively quiet voice and intense gray eyes i thought hart mustve had the patience of five saints to put up with trey and his daddy they were a pair that was always heading for some kind of trouble or aggravation louis slocum treys father drank himself to death five years ago still working on the quadlander place trey had not returned for the funeral i watched as hart eased treys wheelchair out of the truck and then carried trey and settled him in the chair trey steadied the chair on the gravel driveway and began to roll forward of course his arrival cleared the porch why not an old longgone friend returned to the fold during the death of another i watched rooted to the spot while ed called davis outside they jogged over to trey to say hello wished him well called him an old fart and scoundrel and commiserated over clevey thered been no loss of camaraderie there of course trey hadnt nearly destroyed their families i felt the gentle pressure of eula maes fingers on my arm you sure are tense she said dont let trey get to you i shook off her arm i wont trust me but look at them acting like his return is the second coming despite the sadness of the occasion there was the sound of muted laughter from the group once again trey was teasing ed suddenly the porch seemed very lonely theyre his friends you were once too eula mae said i turned to her noting that steven teague took interest in our conversation his eyes an odd indigo watched me intently once thats the key word were not friends anymore i said dont make a scene jordy please eula mae pressed my hand i wont i wouldnt im too upset about cleveys murder to let trey get to me the gentleman in the wheelchairis he trey slocum steven asked yes do you know trey i asked great another partisan for the slocum homecoming the famous trey i barely heard steven teague whisper to himself under his breath clevey had talked about trey in his therapy why steven teague forced a smile to his patrician face hed read my face oh yes generally old friends are mentioned during therapy clevey admired you in particular jordan he said he wished he could be more like you that stung id not spent enough time with clevey and now i had no time with him at all but he had hardly reached out to me i didnt answer steven teague the reunion moved up onto the porch with davis and hart carrying treys wheelchair up the steps trey saw me and he licked his lips quickly looking up and smiling at davis hart quadlander spotted me and nimbly moved to forestall trouble harts voice rumbled deeply as though hed caught gravel in it on the ride over jordy eula mae evenin how are yall even though i am a native texan i have never understood the constant need here to ask people how they are especially in the midst of sorrow im fine hart one of my childhood friends was murdered today treys come home how do you think i feel im awful sorry about clevey jordy hart tactfully ignored my sarcasm i didnt know him very well but i know yall were friends from way back please my sympathies he offered his hand of course i softened i was mad at trey and i felt shock over clevey and id taken it out on him i shook harts hand sorry its been a long day i just am not up to jordy trey wheeled himself over his face was ashen jesus im just sick about clevey i cant believe hes dead would you please wheel me in and go with me to see mrs shivers the silence on the porch was thick i didnt know what to say after my confrontation with trey this afternoon the last thing i expected was the olive branch of friendship i glanced away from trey from hart from my friends and blinked cleveys face flashing before me our friend was dead so i took hold of the handles of his chair before i could think further and gently pushed him through the open doorway sure lets go i heard someone with my voice say i felt a soft pat on my shoulder and the bump of rings told me it was eula mae mrs shivers of course was glad to see trey but was shocked over his condition she hugged his spare form a long time almost cradling him in his chair he described his accidentin more detail than hed given me it happened in beaumont the bull had thrown him then trampled over him he mentioned vertebrae i hadnt heard of before and that surgery wasnt going to be a help there was no selfpity in his voice and mrs shivers responded to that his troubles supplanting her own for the briefest of minutes i lingered for ten or fifteen minutes until i felt the need for fresh air i stumbled back out to the porch jordy got a minute hart quadlander was by my side i saw eula mae had once again cornered steven teague who was placidly eating a piece of pecan pie davis and ed squatted on the porch steps bradley softly crooned rock of ages to himself swaying back and forth on the porch swing to his own beat what hart i stepped off the other end of the porch suddenly feeling exhausted i was ready to go home i know seeing treys got to be hard on you its damned hard on me too hart removed his hat and ran a hand through his brownandgray hair his father was my best friend and that boy didnt even come back for his own daddys funeral now you know who youre dealing with i said treys no saint he must be the most selfish person alive you think what you want about trey but he has come home and i for one am glad he feels sick over not having been here for his daddy or his wife or child i quickly added okay he hasnt been here for anyone that cared about him but hes home now and hes hurting jordy more than just being crippled hes hurting cause he knows he did wrong he wants to make up for it well and good hart but dont you think that he ought to be the one apologizing not you im not apologizing for him im just saying what i reckons brought him back he faced death in that rodeo arena and its a damned scary sight hes come home to heal i want you to help him jordy home to heal thats rich he left gaping wounds hereand now he wants to be admitted to some emotional trauma ward well maybe he should talk to steven teague coddling trey just isnt high on my list of priorities hart pushed back his stetson look all im asking is oh no no i said as a car screeched to a halt in front of the house nearly smashing harts truck id have recognized that red hyundai anywhere sister had arrived and i could tell when she got out of the car she was in a killing mood arlene sugar how are you eula mae tried to intercept sister like a patriot missile but sister was not to be easily downed i saw her scan the porch then beeline toward me and hart quadlander i sensed hart tense up and i cant say i blamed him she barreled down on hart not even greeting him in this place of mourning where is my exhusband she demanded i surmised she was past her shock over treys return arlene hello hart really should have taken that foreign service test hes a natural diplomat i know you must feel awfully upset shut up hart and just tell me where trey is arlene snapped i dont want to hear from you now id be the first to note that sister can be a tad sharptongued ive been sliced diced and juliennefried by her more than once but rude thats never been her style i stepped forward and took her shoulder she slapped my hand away let me be jordan im not about to be patronized by you im not about to patronize you i shot back listen to me sister this is not the time or place for you to confront trey people are grieving here including me now if you have any common sense left or respect for the dead youll go on home how on earth did you know trey was here a little birdie named ivalou called me hes in the house shed ignored everything id said fine either you get him out here or ill go in there and fetch him your choice she crossed her arms and i could practically see the roots shoot out of her feet she wasnt budging hart remained silent and i saw the group on the porch had become still i leaned in close to sisters implacable face sister please dont do this please dont do this to mrs shivers for gods sake her boys been murdered youll embarrass yourself and our whole family her mouth crinkled but she wasnt to be diverted im only interested in one former member of the family right now jordy go get him please i knew from her tone that there was no arguing with her all i could try to do was minimize the damage i glanced at hart and headed up to the house under other circumstances trey might consider me fetching him a rescue hed been cornered by wanda dickensheets and her mother ivalou purcell ivalous not one of my favorite people she always sweetens you up with honeyed words but shes so mean her folks fed her with a slingshot i was not pleased shed decided to phone sister and stir up trouble when i came in trey had a tired indulgent smile on his face while ivalou bragged about the fortune ed and wanda were going to see from their new elvis emporium ivalou leaned in over trey and patted her helmet of tightly curled gray hair im so glad you could come see poor truda in her time of need of course its too bad you didnt get to see clevey before he passed away bad timing i guess anyhow i should go out and say hello to hart i havent seen him in several weeks probably because he saw you first i thought but didnt say ivalou was one of the more piranhalike of the local widows avidly seeking bachelor flesh to sink her teeth into trey glanced up at me clearly recognizing that he was caught between a rock and a hard place ladies i nodded to wanda and ivalou if yall will excuse us i need to talk to trey privately ivalou purcell kept her pastedon smile glued in place wanda took the hint and steered her mother into a conversation with cayla foradory ivalou followed her but not before sharing with us yes im sure you two boys have a great deal to catch up on seen your family yet trey she didnt wait for an answer she wasnt interested in one anyway i waited until ivalou was out of striking range before i leaned down to treys ear look trey arlenes outside and shes insisting on seeing you if i dont come back with you shes coming in here with both guns blazing and i dont want anything to upset poor mrs shivers any further so im sorry but youre going outside to talk with her i could feel tension surge through his body why whys she here now i dont know its your problem now not mine i wasnt about to get in between the irresistible force and the immovable object i pivoted his chair on its back wheels and rolled him outside his fingers white with strain gripped the armrests arlene wasnt on the porch she stood off a ways on the grass hart quadlander was talking to her but she ignored him her arms crossed against the cold i saw davis an arm looped around bradley eula mae acting fretful steven teague talking softly with ed who sat perched on the porch railing davis moved forward and helped me carry trey and the chair down the porch stairs i pushed trey toward sister the wheels rolling softly across the winterdry grass the ebbing breeze chilling my arms i couldnt look at trey as i wheeled him to his exwife despite the anger i still felt for him it smacked too much of serving the christian to the lion he was confronting the woman hed abandoned and there was no escape and i wanted her to give him the tonguelashing of a lifetime but at the same time i felt sorry for trey and no its not that men always stick together hed acted unforgivably but there was something so terribly implacable in my sisters face even as the wreck of the man shed loved was set before her i prayed candace never looked at me that way sister uncrossed her arms and put her hands behind her as i stopped treys chair she wavered for a moment seeing him was unnerving i knew that from experience this was not the trey shed loved and bedded and bore a child with and grew to hate this was some other man to her and i could see the confusion cross her face she looked at me i shook my head she glanced at hart who suddenly found a need to go up on the porch i didnt want to leave them alone although i knew i should trey spoke first hello arlene his voice was steady but not strong trey she got the one word out before her voice failed her she drew a deep breath you look awful i know you look great though pretty as a picture the compliment was ignored why are you back trey and why didnt you let me know i wasnt hiding from you arlene i wanted to call but i didnt think youd talk to me he maneuvered the chair so he could see both sister and me i hear tell youve got this wonderful new diner maybe we can leave cleveys family and friends to grieve and go over there and talk as much as it pained me i agreed with trey he was trying to defuse the situation and keep sister from humiliating herselfor him for that matter the inevitable tears and recriminations would be easier to mull over if they were displayed in private like photographs of intimate memories look trey sister said i just want to set the record straight i dont care that youre back in town i dont care that you got hurt all i care about is that you stay clear of my boy you do that and well be fine great i thought preemptive strike here at a house of mourning her shock mustve fogged her judgment im not staying away from my son arlene you dont have any rights to him you abandoned him you gave up any claim on mark and i intend to hold by that her voice was more sure now as though shed slipped into her prepared speech i didnt abandon him i sent you money every month for him theres more to being a father than sperm and loose change sisters hands balled up into fists im sorry but fatherhood isnt like the rodeo you dont pass on riding the bull if hes a little more ornery than usual you have to get through the whole ride trey you dont have a boy then leave him when hes eight then decide one day to come back she gestured at the chair is that what this is hoping for marks pity now that youre a cripple sister please i said her glance at me had an edge to cut a throat what are you afraid of arlene that hell want to see me trey smiled but without an ounce of warmth i think thats what youre afraid of baby doll youre worried hes gonna forgive me and like me just fine a boy wants a father god knows thats true bitterness tinged his voice and he stared down at the ground for a long moment then looked up ill bet you mark wants to see me thats what this whole little scene is about isnt it i still know you awful well arlene thats just like you you dont know me you dont know a damned thing about me she pointed at his chair youre not the same man you were when you left well im not the same woman im a whole lot tougher and smarter now trey ive had to be im not going to fall for any crap you give me about you wanting to be a father to mark if you cared about mark you wouldnt have come home with a new family to rub in his face nola and scott have nothing to do with mark trey said tightly theyre fine people and theyve been good to me but theyre not my family youre so wrapped up in yourself you cant even see how your actions hurt anyone else thats just like you trey her voice mocked him turning his words like a knife go go somewhere else where you wont be torturing your own child so finally you admit that mark is mine i have every right to see and thats when sister stepped in and belted trey not a slap but an honesttogod punch his head snapped back i heard hart say jesus and bradley cry out in surprise sister pulled trey back into an upright position by his shirt you get this straight you son of a bitch she was yelling now you come near us and ill get a restraining order on you doublequick mark is my baby my child you gave up any and all rights to him when you decided a bunch of stupid cowboys were more important than we were and i hope when you die god sends you straight to hell and lets a bull stomp on you for eternity she let him go and turned stumbling sobbing i chased her and grabbed her arm sister for gods sake i glanced back at trey his lip bled speckling his shirt he stared at sister with stunned dark eyes he buried his face in his handsi couldnt tell if in pain or in shame let me go jordy sister tried to pull away let me go home to my boy i dont think you ought to drive im fine to drive she shrugged off my arm she watched as davis ed and hart humed toward trey i see he still has his friends theyre bigger idiots than i was to care about him sister please listen to me i know you hate him i dont blame you but i dont think threatening him is going to do you or mark much jordy just shut up she examined her right hand the knuckles were beginning to swell it hurts i never hit anyone before i thought it was supposed to hurt them not you her voice sounded ragged please lets go home ill follow you in my car i steered her to her hyundai and got her inside davis ran up to me jesus is she okay yeah i think hart and eula mae tended to trey who wasnt looking our way ed shuffled his feet nearby shrugging helplessly at me i saw bradley on the porch mrs shivers standing by him gently holding his arm wanda and her mother ivalou took the scene in greedily carefully cataloguing each moment for later embellishments steven teague stood apart from everyone else watching with a clinically emotionless face cayla foradory smirked at me for one strange moment then went to bradleys side ushering him into the house see how trey iswhat his reaction to all this is i said to davis and call me later why look quit being a lawyer for a minute and be a friend i dont want him calling junebug and filing assault charges against my sister considering how junebugs sparking arlene i dont think theres much danger of that davis smiled guess not look i got to get her out of here sister was already revving the hyundai for all it was worth fine ill call you davis nodded i got into my car sister wheeled out and i followed peering once in my rearview mirror to survey the hornets nest shed stirred up lightning flashed across the pitchcolored sky its jagged edges cracking the vault of night time barely passed between flash and rumble the storm was here announcing its tumultuous debut the rain began a slow but building patter on my windshield my heart skipped a beat when i got home and a police cruiser was parked outside sister screeched into the driveway and i followed in my blazer she got out and stormed into the house not waiting for me damn it i yelled after her following her in the police were here but it was junebug sitting on the couch with mark watching tv mark stood when sister came in the house and was nearly knocked to the couch as his mother sobbing seized him in a bear hug mom mom mark complained trying to breathe she eased down releasing him covering his face with kisses good lord arlene junebug stood and took her bruised right hand in his what the hell have you been up to i wanted to tell him but i didnt think mark should know his mother had been beating up his father mom what happened to your hand mark asked then light dawned oh shit mom you didnt go belt daddy did you what can i saysister didnt raise no fool dont say shit sister sniffed through her tears its not nice she kissed marks forehead once more and then leaned her head against junebugs chest draping her arms over his shoulders and closing her eyes i could hardly miss the look of sheer bliss on his face from this endearment mark didnt care you punched daddy hes in a wheelchair for gods sake hes lucky hes not in traction now mark go upstairs i need to talk to junebug and uncle jordy go upstairs go upstairs mark mocked in a singsong voice mom you cant always send me upstairs im not a little kid anymore we got to talk about daddy go on up baby ill be there in a minute sister said marks eyes met mine i shrugged he went up not looking pleased i frowned id never interfered with how sister chose to raise mark but she was in my opinion still treating him like a toddler he was fourteen and while hardly grown up couldnt be dismissed from having his own opinionespecially as far as his father was concerned i sat down while sister told junebug what happened at the shiverses he shook his head gad arlene i understand why youd want to hit him but i wish youd just stay away from trey you both need to cool down this was not the answer sister wanted i dont suppose youd be willing to punch him for me junebug moncrief what with you being the law and all im not a mercenary arlene look lets get your hand doctored and you ought to get some rest he leaned down and pecked a kiss on her lips then on her bruised knuckles crazy gal they went upstairs and i lay on the couch listening to the noises of running water and slight laughter from sister at one point i turned off the tv and lay on the couch taking deep breaths and feeling the tremor of thunder vibrate the house eventually junebug came down alone wiping his hands with a towel your mothers asleep and arlenes talking with mark god what a day i closed my eyes i feel numb she belted old trey did she junebug sounded faintly amused i knew arlene was a spitfire when she got riled but i didnt think shed coldcock him im sure youre delighted that shes not running back to him with open arms i said my eyes still closed what is mark supposed to do pretend his dads not back in town hes already made it clear that he wants to see trey i sat up on the couch you want some decaf ill make a pot sounds good i want to talk to you about clevey too poor clevey hes a hell of a lot worse off than sister or trey junebug followed me into the kitchen and asked about mrs shivers while i made the coffee i told him whoall had shown up to render their sympathy ed said youd been by mrs shiverss place earlier i thought youd stop back by there when you got off duty i came by here first i thought arlene might need me more than yall did he seemed embarrassed and kept his eyes on the counter i already saw plenty of mrs shivers today i changed subjects did you know clevey was seeing a therapist a fellow named steven teague junebug shook his head well thats not exactly the kind of thing a man shares with his friends especially someone like clevey he shrugged im sure that he thought wed all tease him about it i watched the coffee brew thats unbelievably sad though isnt it junebug we were supposed to be his oldest friends why couldnt he come to us with his troubles get real jordy if you had a serious problem would you go discuss it with davis or ed or clevey he laughed i dont think i would still seems wrong to me you know its not like you went straight to all those fellows when you found out bob don was your daddy why didnt you i shrugged the coffee finished dripping and i poured us each a cup i dont know davis would have wanted me to sue bob don for back support i suppose ed would have given bob don a discount on his radio ads for being a friends dad or pointed me toward an appropriate elvis song clevey would have made some stupid crack about it and trey i stopped its funny maybe only trey would have understood but he wasnt here you said this therapists name was teague yeah steven teague i handed junebug the card and he pocketed it ill have to give mr teague a call find out what kind of problems clevey was seeing him for your privacy goes out the window when you die doesnt it i said he nodded lets talk about cleveys murder for a minute cleveys murder the possessiveness of those words someones murder has always struck me as odd as if the murder was something that could belong to the victim the final dignity as someone else emptied out his life you said he was shot yeah close range in the right eye one bullet we think a thirtyeight caliber i shuddered suddenly an image of clevey in second grade turning his eyelid inside out to gross out the girls appeared in my mind memory is both damnation and blessing who found him a neighbor she reported shed heard a sound like a shot early this morningaround sixbut didnt think it was anything more than some kid shooting off a gun down on the river she noticed cleveys car was still there in the driveway and thought hed overslept which he was prone to do she found the door open and clevey in the living room so why would anyone want to kill clevey was it a robbery i couldnt imagine the usually genial clevey shivers with an enemy but hed been seeing a therapist how happy could his life be something must have been amiss for him to seek help his place was ransacked but the tv the stereo even the money in his wallet was still there i dont think this was a burglary that got interrupted i aint sure what the hell to think junebug stared down in his coffee id known him long enough to see that a weight lay on his mind youre even more tense than id expect what is it whoever searched the house didnt hit the bathroom too hard i found this hidden in the bathroom taped behind the toilet tank he went over to his briefcase you cant tell anyone about this jordy im only showing this to you cause you got a quick mind and you can keep your mouth shut he handed me an envelope sealed in a plastic bag well i cant very well look in it what is it pictures and newspaper articles about rennie clifton he paused to let the name sink in i assume you remember her jordan you never forget the first time you see death i shivered despite the warmth of the coffee yes i remember her the girl who died in hurricane althea when we were kids i poked at the evidence bag why would clevey have this he sat down again and rubbed his face his skin looked sunburned despite the cool weather its not unusual that he might collect information on a tragedy that he was involved in maybe was going to write a newspaper story about it although i cant imagine for what reason but if he was why would he hide it on the back of the toilet tank what specifically is in it newspaper clippings from when rennie clifton died our pictures that awful group one of us the paper took after we found her body an interview with her mother a copy of the death certificatekilled due to a blow to the skull probably suffered from flying debris during the storm i sipped at my coffee but that was twenty years ago and she died from an accident maybe she did but clevey sure as hell didnt long sleepless nights are not my favorites especially when spent alone id called candace at home after junebug left shed closed up the cafe after a crawlyslow evening id told her i didnt feel i should leave sister and mark alone and she agreed i tried not to imagine how comforting her arms and lips and voice would be to me i showered pulled on a heavy robe against the cold and slipped into bed mark and sister bickered into the night their voices floated through the wall the thunder sometimes masking their words mark begged to see his father sister forbade him i didnt believe her approach was going to work mark sounded too determined he might look like his daddy but there was a lot of poteet in him i figured he was bound to get his way my domestic situation didnt do a lot to keep my mind off clevey i kept thinking i should weep for him but i couldnt not even in the dark privacy of my own room in the middle of the night it was as though some veil had been drawn across my eyes and sadness wouldnt seep through his death still seemed unreal although my friends and i had gone through the preliminary pantomimes of grief rennie clifton i hadnt thought of her in ages that beautiful girl unknown to me except in her death i of course would never forget the horrible day my friends and i nearly died in the eerie rage of the tropical stormor forget her eyes gaping at the greenish sky as altheas center passed over us clevey had run for daviss grandparents house to fetch help while the rest of us waited staring mutely at the body i remembered davis had thrown up the sour stench of his vomit reeking in the humid air for a brief while we were celebrities in mirabeau i never want to be a celebrity again when people asked what it was like to find a corpse rennies empty eyes would come back to me lifeless as pebbles my parents were terribly upset with me for sitting out the storm in a tree house but the girls death tempered their rage they knew it could have been me lying among the shattered trees staring blindly up at the fortress of clouds i remember my father spanking me then stopping and embracing me so tight i couldnt breathe in one of the wee hours of saturday morning i fell asleep and thankfully clevey and rennie stayed out of my dreams i awoke to a skyshuddering thunderstorm my skin feeling chilled under the comforters i absently reached for candace hell i hate waking up alone now i like to start my mornings with at least a kiss dragging the sheets above my head and trying to surrender to sleep didnt help i found mark downstairs eating a bowl of cereal and reading the austin paper he tested the lip of the spoon against his mouth and watched me as i fumbled for coffee wheres your mother i asked she went to the cafe said she didnt trust that breakfast cook candace hired shes not going to have much business today i peered out at the rain people who think texas is the arid plain portrayed in westerns need to come to mirabeau and see one of our drenching thunderbooming storms water pooled in our backyard the hanging plants sister kept on the back porch swaying in the wind it was a cold penetrating rain i wrapped my hands around a warm mug of coffee i usually didnt go into the library on saturdays but with both itasca and florence being out sick i mentioned to mark i might go after of course a stop at the cafe to enjoy a few minutes of candaces company itasca called shes feeling much better and shes going to open up this morning mark said watching me well maybe ill go in later i sat down with my coffee and began to read the sports section the lead story was a preview of the next days cowboys game i remembered with a jolt that the last game id seen at texas stadium was with clevey and ed ed had gotten tickets through a friend those seats are like gold bullion and wed made a road trip to dallas this had been right before i moved to boston to work for brooksjellicoe publishers and i remembered clevey saying thisll be your last chance to see real football i wondered how many other reminders of clevey lurked in my everyday life waiting for me to lower my guard do you think mom really hurt daddy when she hit him mark asked he adopted a nonchalant tone to the loaded question probably not i said although i figured it was a safe bet that trey had a split lip and a sore jaw this morning mark munched his cereal but not for long i could see him squirming in his chair screwing up his courage uncle jordy youd do anything for me wouldnt you his voice wasnt much more than a hoarse whisper it was the same tone i used to cajole my sister i looked up from the paper within reason mark why the floodgate opened i figured you would and i dont ever ask for anythinglike at least i dont ask for much but i need you to do something for me and i dont know how to ask you but mark what he took a deep breath i want you to take me to see daddy i leaned back in the chair oh thats not a good idea mark your mother would hit the ceiling but its not fair i should get to see him if i want to im fourteen dont i have rights or something look its not a question of rights its just that you need to let your mother calm down shes terribly upset right now and you visiting your father isnt going to help her never mind her what about me spoon clanked in bowl thats pretty selfish i said mildly so hes my father mom doesnt have to do diddly with him why does she have to decide for me i leaned forward mark why do you want to see him he left you without warning years ago he hasnt called he hasnt written he hasnt lifted a finger for you in all that time so whats the point mark stared down into his empty bowl thunder cracked like a giants bones over the house and the kitchen table trembled lightning struck and close the hair on the back of my arms felt electrified mark looked up at me with eyes sadder than a fourteenyearold should have i dont know i just want to see him isnt that enough he paused what about when you found out bob don was your daddy didnt you want to know him better mark thats totally different maybe so you had grown up with a father i havent his voice was soft and bitter then hop to it you know hes living at dwight kinnardsand old dwights in the phone book you could sneak over there you just got to be prepared for the consequences i didnt want to encourage him to disobey his mother but i knew the idea had already entered marks mind but i dont want to go by myself what if he doesnt want to see me he looked at me with his fathers dark eyes and thinlipped frown do you think he wants to see me that was a question id sooner not answer if i take you to your daddy your mother will skin my ass and make herself a wallet and shell do the same to you she doesnt have to know if you go with me she wont get mad at either of us i didnt quite follow that logic mark explained she cant stay angry im her son and youre her brother shed have to forgive us right pardon my skepticism i saw last night just how tightly she holds a grudge please uncle jordyyouve known daddy forever please go with me i closed my eyes id promised myself i wouldnt get in the middle of this feud taking sides was increasingly hard i couldnt forgive trey for what hed done but in the two times id seen him id sensedwhat remorse or something deeper that made me feel leaving his family hadnt been a simple jaunt in the rodeo maybe his accident opened his eyes to what was important and sister she had every right to be angrybut to forbid mark to contact his father was as much a punishment of mark as it was of trey if mark wanted to speak to his father how could i stand in his way i would give anything to see my daddy lloyd who had raised and shaped me i couldnt he was long dead now marks father had come back from his selfimposed exile was i going to be a bystander to marks painor a good uncle i got up and walked over to the phone before i could get all clever and analytical i found dwight kinnards phone number in the book and dialed trey answered hello hello trey this is jordan i saw the longing gleam in marks eyes how are you feeling today a moments pause fine your sisters got a hell of a right cross but ive been hurt worse and youve hurt others worse look i dont know why im doing this but im going to put my balls on the line not for you but for mark he would like to visit you i heard a hard long intake of hopeful breath on the other end he does arlene wont approve of that arlene doesnt know and she doesnt have to find out until shes calmed down do you want to see your son if you say no you son of a bitch dont ever speak to me again mark hovered near me and i held my breath yes god yes jordy thank you thank you the happiness in his voice was nearly physical when would be a good time i dont think hed feel comfortable around nola and her son and her uncle how about now theyre all gone scotts shooting baskets at that covered court over by the junior high dwight and nola are running errands arlened be at her cafe right treys voice boomed with excitement let me see if i can get a friend to sit with mama we cant leave her alone and im not taking her out in this weather give us a few minutes thanks jordy god bless you i knew you were still my friend i hung up without further comment mark watched me expectation in his whole face go get your jacket and ill call clo he dashed for the closet but found time to give me a quick hug on the way id been luckydepending on your viewpoint clo butterfield mamas home nurse was willing to come over for a short spell considering that shes well paid by bob don to help us with mama and that shes the best nurse in bonaparte county i shouldnt have been surprised of course it left me no final exit no avenue of escape mark and i ran through the rain jumping quickly into my car dwight kinnard didnt live terribly far away there are no vast distances in mirabeau and as i drove i watched mark out of the corner of my eye he fidgeted fixed his hair straightened his clothes uncle jordy do you think i ought to take him a presentsince hes been sick and all a present for the father whod abandoned him no mark trey ought to get you a present for being such a great kid like im so great mark snorted yes you are i gave his shoulder a gentle squeeze and he stared out at the raindrops sliding down the glass we pulled up moller street and stopped in front of the kinnard place mollers one of the older streets in town the pavement cracked and pitted cars on blocks didnt decorate the front yards but the grass was either overgrown or sparse from inattention backyards tumbled down to the overgrowth that surrounds the eastern bend of the colorado mark stayed close to me as we ran through the downpour to the front door i rapped gently no answer again the rain began a sharper patter on the roof and the thunder cried out against the wind trey its jordan and mark i knocked harder mark looked like he was going to wet his britches maybe it takes him longer to get around in his wheelchair mark ventured from our phone conversation i expected trey in the front yard raindrenched and waiting for us i tried the doorknob the door eased open trey i called sticking my head into the kinnard living room it was unkempt newspapers in an untidy heap by the door a pizza box and crushed beer cans tottering on the coffee table a winnie the pooh cartoon playing mutely on the ancient tv set the couch made up for sleeping with rumpled sheets daddy mark called the word sounding unfamiliar in his throat it wasnt much more than a whisper im not sure what impelled me forward the slightest sound of a groan or maybe the faintest smell of blood or gunpowder some atavistic sense kicked in and i hurried across the living room into the kitchen trey had dragged himself across the floor smearing a dark red trail on the dirty tiles he was pulling himself toward the open back door and his eyes dimming of life looked up at me blood streaked his face and his beard breath faintly gurgled in his throat mark collapsed by his father dad dad my god trey who did this my legs gave way and i knelt by him i saw three terrible red splashes on his back the stench of gunfire hung thick in the air a colored stain caught my eye on the faded striped wallpaper of the hallway written in blood were the words down hes shot hes shot mark moaned i stood and grabbed the phone i barked the address to the dispatcher telling them we had a man shot and needed an ambulance immediately the operator asked me to stay on the line i knew that the emergency headquarters was roughly fifteen feet away from junebugs office and i wished that my friend were here cradling the phone against my shoulder i hunched down by trey he rolled on his back his thin chest moving in ragged dance as he tried to draw air i swallowed when i saw the wounds maybe a lung maybe the stomach oh god where was the ambulance mark sobbed clutching one of his fathers bloodied hands in his daddy daddy daddy he mewled like a small child would rocking back and forth on his heels i leaned in close over trey his eyes sought mine pulling away from marks for a moment trey who shot you who i yelled into his face can you hear me who shot you his eyes flecked with blood tore away from mine and found marks one hand closed around his sons the other touched the tears on marks cheek muhmuh he tried the spittle and blood foaming on his lips who i cried again oh god this wasnt happening he wasnt going to die in front of us a distant siren grew closer mullmy boy trey coughed raggedly squeezing marks hand yes im here daddy please please hang on please mark wept trying to wipe the blood from his fathers cheek chin throat luhlove you mark trey grunted love you his head raised to look into the face so much like his own dropped to the cold kitchen floor and with those words he died mama sometimes said i didnt have sense enough to come in from the rain i was glad she didnt see her grandson and me standing out in the easing mist that morning i couldnt leave mark not for one second and i wasnt about to ask him to go back into that house of death the paramedics had arrived attempted their useless rituals and pronounced trey dead we waited on the scraggly unkempt front lawn a fine veil of uncertain rain kissed our skins mark stared at his hands his fingers daubed with his fathers blood my daddy always kept a handkerchief in his pocket and i wished id picked up the habit i tried wiping the blood off with the corner of my jacket thinking i must get treys blood off him i cant leave his hands like this mark looked up at me from his gory palms dark eyes welling with trembling tears why why he screamed i hugged him hard to me and let him weep feeling his heart pound through the thin fabric of his windbreaker trey told mark he loved him instead of telling me who killed him did trey even know who shot him i saw some of the kinnards neighbors venturing out onto the lawns drawn by the shrill siren of the ambulance and the police i dont know how long i held mark eventually his weeping subsided and he just took long slow breaths i didnt know what to say i didnt know what to do where is the survival manual for this sort of horror sister i thought mark needed sister i heard the pangpang of a bouncing basketball and looked up from marks shoulder scott kinnard stood there holding a basketball and staring at us in the fine rain whats happened why are you here scott asked me glancing at the whirling lights atop the ambulance wheres trey mark pulled his face from my shoulder the two boys looked blankly at each other scott whispered are you mark mark just kept staring i tried listen to me scott you cant go in there trey is the basketball fell from scotts fingers rolling on the rainsplattered pebble driveway he blinked at me and ran for the house scott dont i yelled but he paid me no heed he yanked open the screen door and barreled inside i bit my lip surely the police would escort him back out and then id have two traumatized boys to deal with i took a long fortifying breath after a moment junebug brought scott outside where mark had given a primal scream scott seemed choked into silence he pressed his hands into his face pushing his eyeglasses askew junebug gently guided him to the porch steps thats the boy he was living with aint it mark asked me in a dead voice yes his name is scott kinnard hes stupid looking mark observed watching the other boy begin to cry in short staccato heaves junebug glanced over at me a helpless look on his broad unshaven face i want to go home please lets go home mark begged i didnt like the tone of his voicetentative breathy like a small child whos just learned the words i knelt by him and turned his face to mine blood decorated his cheek like a swath of war paint and i remembered trey stroking his sons face in those final awful moments marks dark eyes were horribly vacant retreating from death looking inward for solace mark listen to me son well go home okay but i think that if you can you should help me and tell junebug everything we saw so we can catch whoeverwhoever did this to your daddy mark gaped at me as if i were speaking finnish i repeated myself and this time the words took hold okay talk to the police he said dragging the back of his hand across teary cheeks just like on tv right thats right mark just like on tv i squeezed his shoulder ill be there and your momll be there okay itll be all right i was babbling i knew i couldnt possibly be comforting to him but i didnt know what else to say jordan poteet he of the vaunted quick wit and sharp tongue and i was as dulled as a rusty old potato knife his hand closed on mine and i felt sickeningly the wetness of blood pressing between our palms i could see a garden hose entwined by the side steps that led from the house to the driveway i stood and started to ease him toward the house wed just rinse the redness from our hands the first step i thought the first step he refused to budge his grip tightened and his raincool fingers dug into mine no no okay i said wait here im just going to get the garden hose im not leaving your sight he nodded miserably i turned and jogged to the coiled hose turning it on splashing my bloodstained hands underneath the cool cascade of water and rain i watched the traces of trey wash off my skin staining the gray stones of the driveway i pulled a length of hose to take over to mark thats when i saw it and my heart really stopped beating for the day a nail stood slightly askew on the rickety bottom step not driven quite home by a sloppy carpenter a shred of fabric a long triangle of thin colored cotton in a muted brownandgreen batik print was tangled on the crooked nail dangling like a flag of the defeated it was just like a print on a pair of pants id given sister a month ago for her birthday she said they were the most comfortable britches shed ever owned i remembered her walking around the living room in delight modeling them for an amused me and an indifferent mama before my mind could calculate all the terrible implications my hand shot out pulled the scrap free and shoved it into my pocket i got up and glanced over at junebug he was still trying to comfort scott i brought the gurgling water hose over to mark and made him rinse his hands dad dad he whispered there was nothing to dry him with and i just let him sop his hands against my jacket i needed to get him out of here i needed to get out of here myself i took a long steadying breath trying to calm myself i couldnt crack now mark needed me i steered him toward my blazer lets go sit in the car he followed me without a backward glance at the house i got him into the passenger side and shut the door when junebug came up behind me i nearly hollered my hand still damp automatically went into my pocket shoving the scrap of cloth as far down as possible junebug gestured at mark who didnt seem to notice us on the other side of the window can you get him to the station can yall talk to us now while the details are still fresh yes i turned to face my friend junebugs mouth thinned good i know its hard jordy im so so sorry i looked past his shoulder scott kinnard lay in a fetal position still crying his dallas cowboys windbreaker looking too small on even his slight frame my heart ached for him but i could only handle one devastated boy at a time mark had to be my priority later id call and check on scott one of the kinnards neighbors a kindfaced old woman in a quilted nightdress whod been watching the proceedings from her porch hurried over to scott talking to him softly rubbing his back what about scott can you find nola i asked ill get hold of his mama somehow well take care of him junebug glanced back at the huddled boy still sobbing on the wooden porch god if this aint a real sows nest shit what in hells going on junebug my voice usually strong direct and a shade raspy quavered id kept it under steely control with mark but mark was in the car where he couldnt hear me anger and fear and sadness rose up in me hard and uncompromising someone shot him someone shot clevey why dont you know whats going on here why is this happening i suddenly remembered the bloodsmeared wallpaper two down what the hell did that mean can you drive junebug asked ignoring my question or do you need me to drive you to the station cant you take our statements at home i pleaded i suddenly wanted the warm comfort of my house a cup of coffee with a jolt of brandy in it and my armchair i wanted to talk to my sister not just because her boy needed her but because i wanted to ask her why material from her pants was stuck on a nail outside the house where her exhusband died of course she couldnt commit murder i told myself shes your sister for gods sake but at the same time i gave myself that scant reassurance i realized i did indeed presume she could have killed trey otherwise i would have left that tatter on the nail wouldnt i the selfish part of me wanted to hand mark over to sister so i could be alone with my grief grief my mind cried out i had to be kidding myself mourning over a man who i wanted out of town yesterday a man i felt was worthless a man who had cruelly abandoned my sister and my nephew a man whod once been my best friend i sagged against the car life plays you some odd hands doesnt it i wasnt going to grieve over someone as rotten as trey slocum not when mark needed me to be strong jordan are you listening to me junebugs voice was steel authority and i raised my head submissive for once this is a murder investigation id surely appreciate it if you and mark would come down to the station ill get scott squared away get my people started on this case and well leave in a few minutes please get in the car and wait i nodded mark said he would talk to you but i dont know if hes gonna be able to help he will cause im gonna find the son of a bitch whos killing my friends he turned and stomped back toward scott whod pulled himself up to a sitting position i saw the boy fix me with an expression of utter misery as if a specter of death had brushed his heart in taking its leave people should be where theyre supposed to be in times of great crisis its only considerate phoning sister made my throat dry i imagined the conversation hi sister got some news for you your exhusband is dead yes shot to death how did you know hope you dont mind but i ignored your wishes and took your son over to visit trey mark got there just in time to see his father die itll probably warp him for life oh thats okay no need to thank me perhaps youd care to tell me which pants you wore this morning i made myself dial the phone my finger trembling sitaspell cafe what can i do you for the hoarse voice of suzie tumpfer one of the waitresses blasted in my ear i asked to speak to sister arlene aint been in this morning jordy my throat felt coated with coarseness i coughed is candace there naw shes run over to the restaurant supply store in bavary you wanna leave a message for either one theres what could i say would you have them phone the police station if they get back in the next hour or so youre at the police station suzies voice softened you okay yes im fine and so is mark but they need to come down to the station all right please dont forget suzie naw i wont i didnt think she would since shed be broadcasting it to the rest of the sitaspell staff in short order i hung up the phone and went into the mens room i washed my hands and my face i returned to junebugs office mark hadnt asked for his mother he faced junebug like he was a plague to be suffered i did not mention that sister wasnt at the sitaspell my heart stumbled again at thoughts i couldnt permit myself to have you cannot think this of her you cannot think this of her but you are admit that youre wondering where she is and why shes not at work children have an uncommon bravery that we adults dont always appreciate mark although still shocked and savaged by what hed witnessed managed to answer junebugs questions completely i wondered if it was because once the initial shock was over trey was still a stranger to him or perhaps maybe because mark was such an extraordinary young man watching him holding up his head keeping his voice steady i suddenly came aware with a surprising tightness in my heart of how much i loved this boy before i returned to mirabeau i probably loved mark in an abstract way he was my sisters child so of course i loved him youre supposed to but when you share a house share the terrible responsibility and knowledge of a loved one losing her mind share the struggle of barely getting by without fraying each others nerves those abstractions turn into solids mark bowed his head when junebug asked if hed seen his father before today and for the first time since we got to the station tears brimmed in his nightdark eyes i swore to myself right then right there that nothing else was going to ever harm this boy not while i drew breath no i hadnt seen my father i knew he was in town but my mom didnt want me near him i asked uncle jordy to take me over to see him if he would i mean if dad was willing to see me and was your father willing yes i didnt talk to him but uncle jordy did he asked us over to that house hehe was staying in junebug glanced at me with cops eyes but you yourself mark you didnt speak to your dad mark shook his head i thought i would when we got there talking on the phone seemed kind of funny we never did that before the questioning went on in the same vein another police officer stuck his head in the door to say that theyd found nola and her uncle dwight kinnard you want her shes mighty upset right now im sure she is show her into the interrogation room and ill be there presently the officer nodded and withdrew a moment later i could hear nolas voice coming down the hall shrill and ragged i can tell you stupid bastards who you need to go after his goddamned whore of an exwife shes crazy you gotta and the noise died as a door was slammed marks face might have been made of marble i felt an itch on my thigh right where a ribbon of batik rested can we please go home mark needs some rest junebug nodded listen mark could you wait in the dispatchers office for a minute i know you want to get home son but i need to talk a second with your uncle jordan is that okay buddy mark stood yeah he moved slowly like a puppet on guided strings i could not believe that he was so calm not after the violent surge of emotion hed shown it made me uneasy what was normal for mark under these circumstances the door clicked shut behind him jordy where the hell is arlene junebug didnt waste time on preliminaries my tongue dabbed at my dry lips all i had to say was what i knew for sure and even that wasnt appealing i dont know suzie at the caff said she hadnt been in goddamn it goddamn it junebug fumed at the floor what the hell am i gupposed to do jordy ignore that shes conveniently disappeared while treys shot dead wait a second you cant think she did this hypocrite dont pretend the thought didnt cross your mind look i have to consider every suspect arlenes his exwife and shed publicly feuded with him i cant cross her off the list just because you and i know she couldnt do it i turned away from him what kind of sorry brother was i thinking even for a nanosecond that my sister could be a killer of course it was ridiculous i took solace in that thought the shock of seeing trey dead had made me imagine the worst of course sister was incapable of killing a man in cold blood there had to be a reasonable explanation for both her absence and the cloth perhaps the cloth came from someone elses pants although i thought that unlikely id ordered the trousers from a store in boston id frequented during my publishing career and i didnt think it likely another pair of trousers with that unusual fabric was haunting mirabeau perhaps shed gone over to see trey again this morningwhy to apologize for hitting him possible but unlikely to warn him off her son again probable to kill him i made myself turn back to junebug not telling was lying wasnt it i knew it was i kept my voice calm someone wrote two down in treys blood cleveys murdered the day before do the math dummy dont you think you ought to follow that angle instead of worrying about where my sister is maybe maybe not junebug sank into a chair clevey and trey hadnt been in touch for years what could they have in common whyd anyone want to kill them both we dont know that they hadnt been in touch i said slowly i dont think clevey would have told me if hed been talking to trey i would not have taken that news well he had all those clippings on rennie cliftons death junebug said clevey was there when we found her body so was trey maybe he had been in touch with trey researching an article on rennie and found something worth getting himself and trey killed over where the hell does that leave you and me and ed and davis this is idiotic junebug rennie cliftons death was an accident she got killed by flying debris maybe maybe not cant you find three other words to overuse i snapped dont get mad at me jordy junebug said okay lets say that those hidden notes clevey had about rennie clifton had nothing to do with his death or maybe theres no connection between cleveys murder and treys murder but someone still wrote that message maybe theres been another murder we dont even know about yet thats crazy maybe maybe not junebug said just to irritate me take your nephew home jordy and if i were you id lock the doors call me if arlene shows up or ill call you when we find her it was a horrible end to a horrible conversation what do you do with evidence in a murder casewhen youve decided turning it in to the police isnt an option and here i always considered myself a good citizen by the time i got a silent mark home that scrap of batik was searing a hole in my drawers and if those fibers had a voice they were whispering in my ear you should give this to the police you know you should those mystery shows where the town busybody doesnt tell the police what he knows you hate them so why arent you telling and my answer was because shes my sister i pulled the car into the driveway the rain had ceased leaving a wet cool day in its wake clouds lingered overhead gray with weight promising more inclement weather mark had been silent all the way home markmy voice sounded raspier than usuali want you to know something i love you i love you very much and if you want to talk to me about any of this if you want to cry if you want to get mad whatever im here for you i reached out and touched his shoulder im not a huggy person by nature but i felt his need for human contact or so i imagined mark shrugged off my hand thanks but i dont need any help im fine i got a history test on monday to study for a test yeah american history he opened the car door not my best subject you know who cares about all those dates and stuff unbelievably he grinned at me i guess you care about it since you used to edit those history textbooks you dont got any pointers for me do you uncle jordy i managed to unstick my tongue from the roof of my mouth no mark i dont look lets not worry about your exam right now i dont think youll be going to school on monday anyway he swallowed why wouldnt i go mark look i was upset at first about dad it was pretty awful seeing him shot like that but you know i like hardly knew him he didnt even look the same all thin and with that stupid beard and being in a wheelchair it wasnt like he cared enough about me to call me or to be a part of my life but you begged me to take you to him i gotta study uncle jordy he got out of the car and loped along to the house i turned off the engine and sat quietly for a moment well id decided trey wasnt worth mourning over apparently so had mark but trey was his father and considering the avalanche of emotion mark had shown this sudden freeze didnt bode well it was as if the do not disturb sign had been hung out on marks face while his minds room was being tidied up i went inside mamas nurse clo butterfield was reading a twodayold newspaper to mama who rocked back and forth humming tunelessly with a smile on her face clo folded the paper with a snap mark didnt say how it went with his daddy i went to the phone not answering her and dialed the cafe neither sister nor candace had returned i asked suzie to tell them to come straight to the house when they got back mama was once again exploring the unnavigable frontier of her own mind so i briefly told clo what had happened i omitted the bloody score painted on treys wall and the remnant of sisters clothing id found at the scene horror filled her dark face my god that poor child but he seems a lot calmer than i thought hed be he was wailing like a banshee an hour ago now hes acting like nothings happened marks always been a kid who showed what he felt uncle jordy mark peered at me from upstairs just glancing above the railing youre right i dont feel much like studying can i ask bradley over to watch tv sure mark but let me call the foradorys he smiled vacantly and went back upstairs i turned back to clo well thats a good sign at least hes not doing schoolwork like its a normal day maybe seeing bradley will help quit deluding yourself jordy clo coughed he was smiling like a gameshow contestant who dont know the answers he shouldnt be smiling he should be crying hes not people grieve in different ways clo he hadnt seen his father in six years maybe this is normal i wasnt doing a good job of convincing myself she touched my arm with the same gentleness she used on mama its not just that his daddy died jordy his daddy died in front of him his dying words to mark were i love you i think marks just not wanting to deal with any of this you got to get him some counseling i remembered steven teague he would know about grief counseling id call my friends to tell them of treys death first then call steven thats an excellent idea clo thank you she patted my arm again i tell you what ill stay and help you okay i would have kissed her but she would have hated that so i didnt clo was innately kind but she kept nearly everyone at an arms length life hadnt always been kind back to her what about the funeral arrangements i dont know whos supposed to be making those us nola kinnard and wheres arlene at shes running errands or something for the cafe i said perhaps a little too brightly clo watched me her dark eyes surveying the twitchy territory of my face and then she pushed the phone along the kitchen counter toward me i think you better make them calls now jordy i picked up the receiver and dialed davis foradorys house when davis answered his voice sounded broken like a pane of glass starred and cracked by a blow huh hello davis i heard the noise of flesh on flesha long slow drag of his finger across his lip yeah jordan hey how are you for a moment i wondered if davis had been drinkinghe sounded dulled i told him briefly what had happened excluding again the bloodscribed words on the wall i didnt think that i should jump to any conclusions about what down meant he was silent a long while they say these things come in trees jordan trees his words were slurring together and i couldnt understand him threes you know death comes in threes davis didnt have a future writing sympathy cards for hallmark thats not exactly a comforting idea right now davis are you okay you sound sick im just stunned over what youve told me god first clevey now trey we got some serial killer running around here i dont know listen marks not in the best shape hes playing the tough guy right now he asked if bradley could come over and watch tv just hang out with him well i dont know i heard movement and a brief recounting of treys death from davis his wife cayla came on the phone jordy my god this is horrible i am so sorry how are arlene and mark distance colored her voice more than sympathy each word seemed forced from caylas mouth as though concern was an unpleasant exercise to be completed coping i answered i wasnt about to get into a discussion with cayla foradory our local ice queen about how my family felt over treys death cayla would it be too much trouble to let bradley come over mark could sure use his friends right now cayla hesitated yes i suppose that would be okay ill bring yall some food too i thought of saying no but when youve had a death telling mirabeau people not to bring food is like trying to say no to breathing air i thanked her instead i cant believe it two murders in two days whats happening to mirabeau i dont know cayla her tone gave me the creeps jordy one moment let me speak to arlene i pressed my lips hard together what to say she cant come to the phone right now cayla the coolness in caylas voice deepened of course i understand tell mark well be over shortly thanks cayla i paused then decided to ask her a question is davis okay there was the slightest of pauses davis is fine jordy youre sweet to ask about him i think hes still in shock over cleveys death and this latest tragedy is just hitting him very hard of course see you in a bit cayla i hung up the phone not entirely convinced she was being frank with me davis foradory didnt sound like the selfassured lawyer i knew i rubbed my temples as if i didnt have enough to worry about i was ready to take on daviss imagined problems i finished making my phone calls grief and shock do not lend themselves to originality nearly everyone i called said the same empty words oh my god i cant believe it or how terrible or an occasional well i didnt know he was back in town i had my own set speech telling them that i didnt know quite yet what the funeral arrangements were going to be and that yes mark was bearing up okay that i didnt know about but what else could i say and that why yes i was fine people promised to stop by i kept hoping sisterd be back by then i checked on mark he was lying on his bed light from the window casting a dim square on his shirt he stared at his ceiling listening to an rem song that advised him to try not to breathe his cheeks were dry and his eyes although reddened from his earlier outburst werent damp mark you okay sure fine bradleys coming over shortly that still okay with you yeah mom home yet no mark not yet shell be here soon i just hope nothing happened to her the way it did to dad ice coated my throat oh mark im sure shes fine shesshes just out running errands or something okay he turned away from me let me know when bradley gets here he got up and pulled a box out from deep in the chaos of his closet a dusty battered cracked box with chutes and ladders in faint print across the front he smiled thinly at me its a fun game want to play maybe later mark the fourteenyearold i knew would sooner have bamboo shoved under his fingernails than play a kindergartners game i tried to convince myself he just wanted to do something simple that bradley could enjoy i couldnt shake the dread that mark was in serious retreat i left him alone and crept to sisters room feeling like a thief i closed the door behind me and opened her small closet pants and jeans hung in neat lines draped over hangers sisters never been a slob i rummaged among the selection the batik slacks werent in there i quickly checked her dresser drawers feeling like a pervert as i pawed through her undergarments and other apparel no trace of the missing pants likely she still had them on but they were of thin material and this was a cool day why would she wear them in the november chill i went to my own room and put the scrap in a small blue stationery envelope and after a moments hesitation hid the envelope in a thick book on texas history i then stuck the book in the middle of the tower of books by my bedsidemy evertottering toread stack i promised myself some time to contemplate before i mentioned that shred of cloth to sister or to junebug i went downstairs still uneasy over mark and sister peoplemostly older womenhad started arriving bringing food and sympathy truda shivers and eula mae quiff had been among the first folks id called and theyd resummoned the cavalry some of the callers still wore the looks of solicitude id seen at trudas house last night it seemed unreal to have them here lamenting a man who hadnt set foot in this house for six years but regardless of what had happened between him and sister he was still marks father and to these fine bighearted women this was still a house of mourning in need of support in the form of tender hugs plum cakes buttermilk pies and broccolicheeserice casseroles there were seven ladies lingering dithering over mama who didnt seem too confused by the presence of these friends she used to know and nodding remorsefully at clo as she talked oh honey dorcas witherspoon came to me and hugged me shes one of mamas oldest and dearest pals im so sorry how are mark and arlene are they upstairs i dont like lying if i confessed sister had gone missing theyd panic i could hardly announce that she was here theyd demand to see her and courtesy would require her to make an appearance even if treys death had left her prostrate with grief marks coping and i think my sisters going to be okay its surely a shock to everyone that was neutral enough to toe the line between truth and fiction jordy truda shivers came forward and pressed my hands having abandoned one house of loss for another im so sorry truda thank you for coming but you shouldnt have i know how hard it is for you right now what with clevey and and thats when sister chose to make her appearance hie front door flew open the hinges squealing in violated dismay and sister followed by a somber junebug stormed in her face wore the same mask of shock that mark seemed to find so comfortable except for her blackened eye her countenance shushed the gathered women to silence not to mention the foreboding presence of our police chief wheres my boy sister demanded of me without preamble hes upstairs what happened to your ill deal with you later jordan michael poteet i understand that because of you my child saw his father die i hope youre goddamned happy with yourself you bastard she shoved past me and sprinted up the stairs two at a time since etiquette didnt require a response to her attack i stood there with mouth open staring at her and staring at the batik pattern underneath the muddy smears on her trousers i covered my face with my palms its hard to know that even for one instant your sister hates your guts i glanced over at junebug who nodded toward the back porch the assemblage of mourners discovered several reasons to either leave or retire to the kitchen where clo had prepared coffee i followed my old mend out to the back porch a miserable look on my face the rain had returned playing an arpeggio of pitters on the roof the wide emptying branches of the live oaks swayed in the mounting coldness that promised a hard winter and the leaves from the trees had begun their wet descent to the ground the sky was leaden with clouds that looted like ashy bolls of cotton i suppose if thunder had ominously rumbled it would have only completed the scene where was she is she okay i asked junebug shes fine i found her down on mears creek where it divides off the river she was just sitting in her car where the hell had she been she says she needed time alone his lips thinned who gave her that shiner she claims she stumbled against a tree while taking a walk but i dont believe her oh god this isnt happening i turned to him with pleading eyes junebug you have to get to the bottom of this two oftwo people weve known forever get murdered and my sister goes missing and turns up with a battered face you got to do something i am jordy im taking myself off this case why i felt like hollering my throat raw but i kept my voice under steely control we need you junebug i cant jordy i got to turn it over to my deputy i cant investigate when arlenes involved its a conflict of interest do you think she did this you know she couldnt have hypocrite my conscience piped up in my head why dont you go get him that scrap im waiting of course she didnt do it junebug said he stared off into the rain coming down harder driving the remaining leaves down to sodden grass i dont believe for an instant that she killed trey he heaved a long sigh when i told her he was dead it was as if all the life went out of her i hadnt expected that not after what happened between them he turned back to me his face miserable she still loves him jordy i could see it in her face youre dreaming you didnt see the cold hate in her eyes last night you didnt see how she hit him i nearly bit my tongue off id spoken recklessly too stunned by recent events for much coherency perhaps i could write down the list of reasons sister had to kill trey it would surely make questioning her more convenient for all concerned whats the old saying its a fine line between love and hate he put his hand on my shoulder once it had set in i wasnt foolin her she screamed like a wounded wildcat she broke into tears and just kept saying no cut me to the bone he shook his head i dont think arlene loves me i think even after all these years all her yellin all her warnings to trey to stay away that she loved him still arlenes not the type to hate you know shes not happy with me right now is she i asked half to myself he doffed his stetson tossed it on the chair and ran a callused hand through his damp brown hair sorry about that of course she asked if you and mark knew i had to tell her about yall finding him she got a lot quieter then shell get over being upset at me i said i hope junebug didnt look too concerned about my placement on sisters top chart thunder rumbled above me he kept watching the curtain of rain i chose my words carefully of course the most compelling reason to know that my sister had nothing to do with treys death is that two down that was on the wall sister might have had reason to kill trey but she sure didnt have reason to kill anyone else i watched junebugs broad back tense theres no other explanation junebug the same person got rid of both him and clevey so theres no reason to suspect my sister i know tonights going to be rough for you jordy but id like you and the other boys to come over to my house i assume by the other boys you mean davis and ed he nodded because of the papers about rennie clifton we found in cleveys house the papers mention the six boys specifically now two are dead the remaining four of us need to have a little chat but you said you were taking yourself off the case off treys case im still investigating cleveys murder be there at eight oclock and tell arlene ill call her later he spun on his heel and left the murmur of feminine voices the only sound as he went back into the house i felt cold as though rennie cliftons longdead hand had risen from the ground and closed around my ankle did down signal a finale to bloodshed or was it the first note in an even more gruesome coda jordy i turned candace i should have run into her arms instead i froze baby for gods sake she hurled herself at me nearly crushing me in her embrace and im a foot taller than she is i held her running my hands up the firmness of her back her lakeblue eyes wide with shock looked up into mine im so sorry jordy so sorry she hugged me again whispering into my chest what about i stroked her hair but i didnt feel the usual ache of tenderness when she was in my arms it was almost as though i wasnt truly me and she wasnt truly her the entire day had taken on a quality of unreality im sorry because trey is dead dummy whats wrong with you she leaned back staring at me as though id lost my mind i didnt respond those clear blue eyes bored into me like a beacon cutting a swath across darkness i suddenly felt ill at ease in her arms how are mark and arlene she asked sisters terribly upset mark freaked out completely now hes acting like nothing happened i stepped back from her she regarded me with a critical gaze and how about you fine i mumbled i mean granted it was horrible to see him the like that but ill be just fine one of her hands reached out for mine she ran a fingertip along my unshaven jawline cmon babe he was your best friend at least when you were growing up who told you that she blinked well good lord everyone says how close yall were that was years ago what does it matter i pulled my hand free and walked to the end of the porch the little garden plot mama used to plant every spring was barren and muddy dank elongations of water lay in the shallow hills between empty rows i watched drops strike the surface their tiny impacts spreading a circle of water until the next bead of rain fell why are you being so pissy to me jordan she asked my back im sorry i turned to her holding my palms out fingers spread you dont understand candace theres no point in me being upset you said trey was my friend well the emphasis is on the past tense he was an unforgivable asshole she gave me her patented doubting candace look and crossed her slender arms i see and since he was such an asshole youre not at all affected that he practically died at your feet i shook my head in frustration i feel terrible that mark saw that ill never forgive myself for taking him over to that house but at leastat least trey told mark that he loved him i stared out again at the rain i dont know candace maybe mark didnt need to hear that maybe it would have been better if trey had just died and he wasnt anything more than a memory to mark mark shouldnt have seen that blood that death hes just a kid if i hadnt thats not your fault so we should all only be concerned about mark youre perfectly fine entirely unscathed by losing two old friends in two days her tone was arch one i recognized from when a fight was brewing between us i will mourn clevey i said realizing i was gritting my teeth but what do you want from me should i scream tear my hair not over trey slocum not over that worthless son of a bitch now if youll excuse me i have to call steven teague mark is going to need counseling maybe my sister too i have to take care of them and i havent eaten anything since breakfast and i need some aspirin and maybe a nap i was tired of the ceaseless rain tired of the moist smell of wet dead leaves tired of talking nonsense i headed for the screen door for the warm comforting smells of casseroles and the lowered voices found in homes that death touches she didnt stop me im not good at mourning the rest of the afternoon went in a haze sister wouldnt talk to me id tried once knocking on her door the sobs on the other side made me feel i was knocking on her heart later was all she would say mark played a childrens game in my room with a hushed bradley foradory i watched their pieces slide and rise in the fortunes of the gameboard mark was treating chutes and ladders like grandmaster chess he only answered in monosyllables when i talked to him bradley favored me with a confused smile i mussed his hair told him to take care of mark who didnt want to acknowledge my presence and left them alone i fended off unneededand unwarrantedconcern from eula mae clo truda cayla davis and a score of other wellintentioned neighbors even my nemesis gretchen youd think after all our battles shed have known me well enough to leave me alone ed and wanda dickensheets appeared fresh from a saturday peddling memories of the king wanda didnt bother to change out of her elvis getup that was her working uniform and for the first time i wasnt inclined to laugh at her ed moved like a man on tranquilizers of course mark and sister were indisposed in their grief so i took the proffered pity for treys death i accepted kisses on my cheeks squeezes of my hand murmured expressions of sympathy for our loss i cast my face in sorrow and nodded quietly a great deal acting as the family spokesman and the cynics say theres no ironies in life candace stayedbut she stayed away from me every now and then she caught my eye and i saw the forgiving concern in her face i always broke contact first i felt bad i couldnt react the way she thought i was supposed to but she was presuming i sustained some kind of affection for trey slocum i knew she meant well i knew she loved me i just wanted her to let me be for a while my father bob don was in las vegas at an automobile conference i missed him i thought he at least would understand he wouldnt expect me to shed tears over a man i loathed finally the bearers of food and succor departed leaving me clo eula mae and candace sitting at a table overflowing with pies casseroles and sandwich makings i made myself eat but nothing had taste not even eula maes mirabeaufamous plumandwhiskey cake clo took trays to sister and mark she came back and told me they were sitting together in mamas room talking quietly mama did not appear to be participating in the conversation she according to clo kept asking when hawaii fiveo her favorite show would be on was mark crying i asked clo she shook her head thats not natural i muttered candace coughed but i ignored her ill be glad to stay tonight jordy clo offered i nodded as candace spoke clo youve already been here all day you must be exhausted and i know youve got your granddaughter to look after why dont i stay and you can spell me tomorrow when i have to go to the cafe i smiled at her i did want her here i just wasnt going to get dragged into an argument over whether or not i was dealing normally with treys death thank you i said candace if youre going to stay why dont you run home and get whatever you need for tonight i checked my watch junebug is expecting me junebug eula mae demanded eds going there and cayla mentioned that davis was too her eyes shone bright with curiosity only vaguely muted by the pall that hung over my house excuse me ladies i said quietly boys we have to talk junebug said he poured me a whiskeynot my first of the evening and resumed his place on the sofa the four of us gathered around the squat coffee table in junebugs den as uneasy a group of mourners as id ever seen davis downed jack daniels into his big football players frame looking morose junebug frowned funereally solemn and ed dickensheets walked restlessly his shock and grief propelling him like a ceiling fan turned up a notch too high he paced around the table crossing and uncrossing his arms goddamn it ed youre making me dizzy sit down davis insisted he rolled whiskey in his mouth and for one moment i thought davis was going to spew the booze at ed on his next orbit i cant ed retorted if i sit down i feel like im gonna throw up let him be hes not bothering you junebug said quietly davis shrugged and sipped some more of his whiskey i held a glass of bourbon and water in my hand but id left it untasted i felt bone weary junebug stood glass aloft heres to clevey shivers and trey slocum boys may they rest in peace and meet us in heaven the others stood and for one brief moment i thought of not joining in but it was for clevey too and i felt heartsick that i seemed to be forgetting about him i saw his easy smile his laugh the noticeable gap between his front teeth that would have kept him looking boyish at forty i stood and clinked my glass against my friends the ringing of crystal brief and discordant we sipped at varying speeds davis quaffing his in a gulp his eyes averted junebug sipping slowly ed and i barely tasting ours davis was a little drunk and wasnt done toasting clevey our friend and a fine reporter he said hell dig up all the secrets even if it sends him to hell damn old clevey ed said his pug face puckering up in a frown i always thought he was gonna be the meanest old fart in the nursing home he wouldve been the ugliest davis muttered i feel bad for trey ed said suddenly hed just gotten to see us all again silence fell and we sat in its shadow no one spoke for several minutes i gazed into the amber shallows of my glass for a while and then looked up junebug like me was hypnotized by the eddies of liquor around ice davis slumped in his chair examined the ceiling for points of interest ed stared at his feet this is how men grieve i thought we feel this terrible heavy sadness but we pretend its not there we dont look into each others face for fear well see another mans tears or worse he will see ours we talk about the things that mattered least in the lost life and when words fail us we down our drinks and turn glazed eyes to the carpet our laments are silent i sipped at my whiskey you know what kind of guns killed em davis asked his tone distant and solemn junebug looked up from his drink both shot with thirtyeights but we havent determined yet if it was the same gun trey had a thirtyeight registered to him and its missing no one spoke did trey say anything before he died jordan davis wanted to know jordan cant talk about that junebug interjected i shrugged i dont see what difference it could possibly make he told mark he loved him he didnt say anything else he just looked at me then he died i put my glass to my mouth but didnt sip damn it jordan you were told not to say anything about the case junebug slammed his glass down on the table im already hiding evidence surely thats worse than running off at the mouth i didnt share my ruminations with the group why are you having a fit you took yourself off treys case that true junebug ed asked the ice rattling in his glass id really prefer not to discuss it ed junebug said especially with the media ed coughed hey i just sell airtime for the station i dont fill it with news reports youd have to talk to mr boss man foradory here about getting on the airwaves davis shrugged let it go ed lets change the subject his voice sounded weary anger kept ed going hell no our friends are dead and now youre not investigatin what the hell is that i leaned forward ed junebug had to take himself off the investigation of treys murder because my sister is a suspect there i said it ed raised his chin slightly looking at me with his dark eyes a half smile played along his face and he eased back in his chair youre kidding right junebug surely cant believe arlene shot anyone why not davis ventured sorry to say it yall but arlene looked like she was in a killing mood last night mood and action are two different things davis i retorted the idea of my sister murdering anyone is ridiculous regardlessjunebug kept his voice measuredly calmi felt it best to turn over treys case to franklin bedloe hell be the lead officer ed shook his head i bet ol arlene really appreciates that vote of confidence junebug you wont be getting any more free coffee down at the sitaspell youre not funny junebug said in a low gravelly voice he glared at me for having ventured into topics he didnt want to discuss dont get mad at ed for pointing out the obvious i snapped you said a minute ago we had to talk so lets talk i felt a warm flush of frustration redden my face whether or not my sister is an automatic suspect in treys death you think that the same persons responsible for shooting trey and clevey why dont you share your reasoning with everyone junebug stood went to the bar and refilled his drink i dont want whats discussed here leaving this room is that understood im speaking as an officer of the law not as your friend yall hear me silent assent greeted this statement and he sat down again he then told the others about the peculiar evidence the newspaper clippings about rennie clifton and the down written in blood on treys wall my lifelong friends traded uneasy glances finally ed said i dont understand if clevey knew something about that girls death why hadnt he told i mean he was a newspaper reporter he would have written about it davis wet his lips maybe he didnt have enough evidence you cant just write an article without having all the facts papers get sued for inaccurate reporting clevey might have discovered something about rennie cliftons death but not had enough to go to press with but enough to get killed over i pointed out what could trey have known what connection would he have davis asked well he was with all of us when that storm hit ed murmured all of us did yall know clevey was in therapy i asked suddenly the looks on davis and eds faces said no what for davis asked helping himself to another dollop of whiskey i dont know do yall have any idea what his problem was ed scratched his chin aside from his mean streak junebug frowned thats not treatable ed davis swished whiskey in his mouth clevey seemed perfectly healthy but i dont think he would have confided a personal problem to me i abandoned that tack okay then back to the newspaper lets say clevey was working on a story about rennie clifton and it got him killed why would anyone then kill trey he hadnt been in town in years as far as we know he and clevey hadnt been in touch for years what would trey know that clevey knew we dont know for certain that clevey and trey hadnt been in contact treyd already been here a day before clevey died right davis said slowly they could have met maybe the two of them did know something maybe thats why trey came back to town after all these years he came home to recuperate i said tonelessly so he said davis shrugged we better hope that its something only the two of them knew ed added because what if the killer thinks that the rest of us know it too if any of you boys know something you aint telling junebug said softly now would be a real good time to spill the beans no one answered i sipped again at my whiskey letting the smoky taste fill my mouth i got a question why would clevey even start digging into the past he wrote that article last summer the twentyyear anniversary of hurricane althea ed said slowly remember it came out last august maybe in writing that he found out something about rennie cliftons death and now hes dead no one spoke for a long moment maybe we should all get out of town ed blurted i mean if someones knocking off our circle of friends i say we all take our money get the hell out of dodge and go party in vegas or something davis snorted im not about to be chased away on a whim ed and leave my radio station my law practice and my family get real you got a business to worry about too i dont think its worth dying over ed squeaked davis laughed i agree ed i wouldnt die over wanda and i dont expect youll have your ridiculous elvis emporium much longer so if you want to vamoose like a scared rabbit go ahead the institute of elvisology is not ridiculous celebrity collectibles are a growth industry ed shut up i snapped i pressed fingers against my aching temples i wasnt in the mood to discuss the comparative economic gains of peddling elvis trinkets look none of us knows anything that clevey or trey knew right wed admit it right nods of assent went around the room so were not in any danger right unless the killer thinks we know davis said then it doesnt matter what the truth is god sometimes i dont like lawyers sister was curled in a fetal position on her bed when i got home her quiet come in was barely above a whisper i sat on the corner of her bed afraid to touch her nearly afraid to speak i just got back from junebugs i said he sure is worried about you the clouds didnt let much moonlight through her window but there was enough where i could see fresh tears on her face junebug god he thinks i did it he thinks i killed trey in cold blood of course he doesnt he has to take himself off any case where hes got a personal connection crap hes got personal connections with half the town he did it so he wont be the one to arrest me when they finally issue the wairant he doesnt want to put the handcuffs on the woman he claims to love where were you today sister i told you i told him i needed quiet time so i went for a long drive out on the roads between here and la grange and bavary i went down to mears creek you know thats where trey proposed to me dont you that was our place who gave you the black eye then i told you i stumbled against a tree she shifted her face into the pillow and i knew this phase of the conversation was over i want mark to see steven teague i started but she didnt let me finish who hes a therapist a counselor i think mark needs help dealing with what he saw jordy i know you have good intentions but id made it clear i didnt want mark to be around his father you had no business interfering im sorry i felt miserable im sorry he saw what he did i know youre pissed at me but at least he got to know that his father loved him sister gave a shuddering sob i couldnt tell if it was anger or despair that racked her body sister im sorry i hit him im sorry he didnt get to see mark as mark really is why why did he have to leave us she cried in the six years trey had been gone id never heard her ask that question of course i had no answer instead i took her in my arms she cried for a while then pulled her face away from my shoulder stupid crybaby she sniffed wiping her face with her robes sleeve i should know better his leaving never made sense to me i pushed an errant lock of hair out of her face god now hes gone truly gone sister stared at the moonlimned clouds in their dreary dark parade southward a part of me always believed hed come back isnt that the most idiotic thing you ever heard no its not silence hung between us for a minute sister yeah did trey send you moneysupportfor mark treyd alluded to that twice once at the library once at truda shiverss but both times id been convinced it was a lie to salve his ego sister lowered her eyes yes every month for the past six years sometimes hed miss a month but hed always make it up and always with a money order the letters were postmarked from all over i let my breath out and id called trey a liar why didnt you ever tell me i dont know i put most of it in an account at the bank i want mark to go to college sometimes i had to tap it when times were hard but most of its in that account so trey wasnt entirely a deadbeat dad sisters tone grew cold he wasnt here money doesnt replace a fathers love thats what i dont understand okay our marriage wasnt perfect there were times that we fought but leave mark how could he abandon his own flesh and blood in that last phone conversation with trey i could hear the joy the anticipation of seeing his son i dont know i only know that he loved mark even if he wasnt here to show it she threw herself on the pillows i dont want to talk about him now go to bed jordan weve both had horrible days while she was in this state of honesty i wanted to ask about the batik scrap id found but i couldnt not without it sounding like an accusation i wasnt ready to make i got up and went back downstairs candace had gotten mama down for the night and was sipping a ginger ale and watching the news from austin thanks for staying over i went and kissed her on the mouth she kissed back for a moment you want me to sleep with you or in the guest room she asked softly i never stayed here since weve been dating it cant make any nevermind to mama but for marks sake itd be best if you slept in the guest room she didnt take it as rejection all right babe you doing okay i looked down into her cool blue eyes i wanted to say no i wasnt doing okay i was scared shitless by the two options that seemed to be looming before me either my sister was a killer or my friends were being murdered for some hidden reason from boyhood days death has a long shadow my grandfather used to say and i never appreciated what he meant until now i wanted to explain this to candace but instead i kissed her again and said i was going to bed it was only after i pulled myself between the cold lonely sheets and lay back on my pillow that the most disturbing thought of the day came to me what if trey had been killed simply because hed come home not like that trey scolded me you always always get on a horse from the left not the right he yanked the reins out of my hand and patted the horses side well excuuuse me i retorted i was on the left not your left the horses left trey took me by the shoulder and led me around to the proper side you didnt say that i said indignantly trey pushed back his black cowboy hat and shook his head in smiling resignation he was fourteen but he already looked sixteen filling out and growing more quickly than i had i still looked like a scrawny little kid next to him i swear jordy you are the most impatient person ive ever met now let me tell you what to do and wait until im donehere he fixed me with a steely gazesos you dont rush off and kill your fool self i nodded he went through the steps again placing the reins over the horses neck and grasping them in his left hand putting his left shoulder against the horse facing its tail and gauging his weight against the horses brown shoulder finally he turned the stirrup from back to front before putting his foot in it he stressed this step to me so i wouldnt twist my leg wrong once i was up in the saddle he demonstrated by swinging gracefully into fafnirs saddle his whole body an exercise in control and power the huge horse obeyed the boy without a tremor see aint so hard youre gonna do fine trey assured me dismounting and giving fafnir a pat i went for a second try fafnir regarded me with disdain the smell of my fear was probably palpable to him treyd said hed teach me to ride if i helped him with history and now i was thinking id gotten the raw end of the deal the horse moved uneasily as though unwilling to give me a chance at mastering him remember what i told you okay first take the reins over his neck and take hold of them real firm i did now get your left shoulder against the horse and look down toward his tail i did okay now move back toward fafnirs shoulder i did thats when the script went wrong and fafnir suddenly moved and a sharp pain jabbed my butt i hollered like a stuck pig and jumped forward letting go the reins i thought for sure the next thing id hear was treys hysterical laughter at his horse biting me in the ass instead trey stood there shaking his head and not laughing while i rubbed my jeans where fafnir had nipped me fafnir regarded me without an ounce of pity and snorted stepping away awkwardly whatd i do wrong i muttered nothing fafs being particular he took the gelding by the reins and walked him around the barn murmuring to him and patting his shoulder i watched wondering what you said to an ornery horse when trey led fafnir back up to me i fidgeted i dont know trey he doesnt like me much he just aint used to you hes a good horse and youre gonna ride him today a faint smile touched his mouth less youre too sore to sit in the saddle now shut up i took the reins again faced the horses end turned the stirrup and swung up and into the saddle fafnir didnt budge i sat in silent amazement for a moment forgetting what i was supposed to do next trey smiled and i let myself bask in the glow of his approval now there young master jordan werent so hard was it once we got the assbiting out of the way no i observed yeah i just hope ol faf doesnt the from that bite hes probably been poisoned if he broke your skin very funny if he does it again im calling the glue factory hes gonna be just fine sore you trey rubbed fafnirs shoulder with real affection i decided not to make any further gluefactory remarks trey walked alongside me showing me how to urge fafnir into action once i was in the saddle fafnir proved willing enough and he didnt give me much trouble he was a good horse like trey promised i surveyed the springtime peacefulness of hart quarlanders horse farm the live oaks that dotted the banks of grunewald creek swayed with their laden branches in the brisk breeze and the grass gleamed that peculiarly strong green that always follows heavy spring rains the air smelled fresh and clear and ripe with horse the world looks a little different from up here dont it though how come you never mentioned wanting to ride before id have taught you long ago i coughed my daddy hates horses he got thrown by one when he was little and broke his arm he wont let sister or me near em but youre riding today what daddy dont know wont hurt me i laughed dont you worry if he finds out ill tell him it was my idea daddy and trey got on like a house afire treyd sweettalked me out of more than one escapade by conferring with daddy mama remained somewhat suspicious of trey but mamas are like that too bad arlene didnt come today trey said taking in the overarching blue sky i guess shes too snooty to take a riding lesson from a freshman shes sweet on billy kiblett i shrugged she spends all her time with him billy kiblett cant do jackshit cept throw a football yeah but in mirabeau thats a highly prized skill you know that bastrop kicked our asses last year cause holy billy kiblett couldnt connect with his receivers whats so special about him hey trey you act like youre in love with her if he could tease me about getting my butt bit i could retaliate with the suggestion of amorous intentions toward my sister who would wriggle more naw i aint in love with arlene shes a pain in the neck he looked off at the line of live oaks near the creek and straightened his hat when youre a better rider well go for a ride along the creek its real his voice broke off i turned to where he looked a man staggered out from the trees in the creek weaving and walking as though yanked every few moments by invisible strings hatless he kept one chambrayed arm over his eyes against the springtime brightness he shuffled along toward the main house barely staying on his feet i saw a leaf tangled in the mans dark hair and suspected that if i was closer id smell cheap whiskey i didnt say anything i stared down at the saddle horn fafnir snorted trey never mind jordy there was ice in his voice shit and it aint even noon yet i watched treys daddy yank open the screen door to the quadlander house and totter inside sitting on the horse made me feel bold why does mr quadlander put up with it trey why do you he might have punched any of his other friends for such bluntness but instead he looked up into my eyes and then quickly averted them harts a good man and daddy only gets drunk some of the time it aint always i remembered when mamas uncle buell drank too much at christmas a few years back and then was gone from town for a while sister and id finally found out hed gone to a rehab place in bryan where he quickly dried out and found a new addiction to jesus well better that than whiskey sober and sanctimonious was preferable to drunk and disorderly trey listen to me for a minute there are places your daddy could go help he could get get off the horse jordy i got to go tend to daddy he stared at the house trey look i know you mean well i do but this is my problem it aint yours his bottom lip vanished into his mouth and his face couldnt hide the anguish please i swung down from fafnir im sorry i just want to help you i dont need your help jordy go back to your perfect father and let me tend to mine he took fafs reins from my hands whywhy dont you just wait out here ill get faf situated and ill call your folks to come pick you up i could help you with your daddy i said softly i could brew him some coffee i remember when uncle buell i dont want your help he screamed at me and fafnir whinnied eyes rolling in panic at the noise the horses reaction brought trey back please i can take care of my own problems i dont need anybodys help just wait out here all right i turned toward the oaks and creek i wondered how many bottles of whiskey louis slocum had emptied sitting between the gnarled roots of the trees then i heard the gunshots i whirled around the world shimmered with unreal light the farm was gone the grass was gone fafnir was gone there was only trey a grown man dying lying with three wounds in his back staring helplessly at me through a mask of blood i snapped awake in bed the gasp of horror caught in my throat dim moonlight silvered my bedroom long shuddering breaths emptied my chest the november chill pressed against the window and i felt the uncomfortable dampness of sweat cooling the sheets i pushed the bedclothes away and pulled on a robe i sat by my window and stared out at the crescent moon hanging like a cut nail above the fingers of the trees the clouds had scudded away to take rain and darkness south toward victoria and corpus christi i put my face in my hands the dream had been eerie in its exactness more like a halfwaking memory than some jungian exercise in symbolism why on earth would i remember that incident now it had teen the first real time id gone horseback riding the first of many happy hours riding with trey itd also been the first time treyd spoken openly of his fathers drinking the drinking that had finally put louis slocum in his grave five years ago nearly a year to the day that trey walked out of all of our lives i thought over the dream again smiling faintly at the memory of fafnirs bite and treys gentle coaxing of the horse what had happened to that boy why had he turned into such an irredeemable loser i glanced at the clocknearly three am i thought of creeping down the hall waking candace telling her about my dream but i didnt think shed understand besides what was there to say finally i crawled back into my bed pulling the sheets around me they made a thin cocoon against the night i slept late and when i came down i found candace and clo sitting and drinking coffee at the kitchen table mama sat in the living room watching the morning news chatter with the sound turned low the way she liked it i stood for a moment watching her and feeling a ridiculous resentment here was our family grieving nearly paralyzed by the past two days and she sailed through the rooms of our house with nary a thought for the rest of us for our bereavement life went on for her in its neverending cycle of forgetfulness and for one brief moment i resented the hell out of her then i envied her then shame welled up in me and i went over and kissed her cheek she smiled faintly at me like a queen to a footman for a simple service performed well and her gaze went back to the television good morning clo hi sugar i leaned down and pecked candace on the lips sorry if i have morning breath you do but thats okay clos coffee is very strong and should wash away even jordan poteet industrialstrength fumes i permitted myself a smile as she teased me how you doing this morning did you sleep okay im fine i said i wondered if that answer was starting to sound like a litany are sister and mark still asleep no arlene decided to follow your advice she called steven teague this morning and he offered to make a special appointment for mark theyre at his office now thats good i poured myself some coffee maybe today would be better than yesterday it had to be candace pursed her lips and glanced over at clo who was sitting as silently as a sphinx actually i talked to mr teague after arlene called him he suggested to me that maybe the whole family should attend counseling i froze the last thing i wanted was to divulge my feelings about clevey and treys deaths to some sympathetic social worker with a bunch of consonants behind his name but if it would help mark ill consider it it would probably be helpful for mark and sister okay she said softly i could feel her watchful gaze on my back then she shifted the subject im not opening the cafe today it didnt seem appropriate mirabeau can survive a day without arlenes chickenfried steak i began to sip coffee without further comment today was sunday and the library would be closed my dallas cowboys would be playing i could take refuge in the game i glanced at candace she still favored me with that imworriedaboutyouanddontyoupretendyoudontknowit look piercing me like a needle if i stared unflinchingly at the screen for every second of all four quarters including timeouts and beer commercials it would drive her nuts and shed leave me alone maybe mark would have lost interest in playing games hed shunned for nine years and want to watch the cowboys with me wed cheer troy yell for emmitt call for moose and applaud bill bates wed pretend we had normal lives for just a while unfortunately the game wasnt on till midafternoon clo and candace watched me i began to read the austin americanstatesman sports section with extreme concentration it didnt work truda shivers called early this morning candace said ignoring that i was obviously reading an article of great importance she wanted to know what the funeral plans were for trey she suggested that since trey and clevey had so many of the same friends that we might consider a double funeral at stgeorgesontheriver i set down my cup on the paper i couldnt hide i shouldnt hide what about nola she might have plans for his funeral we dont even know how long he and nola have been together candace said i think that mark has more of a right to plan his fathers funeral than nola kinnard does the doorbell rang i hurried to answer it i found hart quadlander and scott kinnard together on my porch scott looked much better than the last time id seen him fetally huddled on the rainsoaked porch of the house trey died in he wore faded jeans sneakers and a threadbare plaid shirt that needed mending a ragged knapsack hung over one bony shoulder his brown hair was neatly combed but redness rimmed his hazel eyes he looked tired hart stood behind him ill at ease he was nattily dressed in a dark jacket jeans and a stiff white buttondown shirt looking every inch the gentleman rancher hart id expected to see he was a friend of treys scott i hadnt considering how his mother had been railing against sister in the police station i wouldnt have thought shed permit her son within ten feet of our house hi scott how are you doing i felt a sharp pang of regret id promised myself id check on scott after i took care of mark i hadnt nolas ranting voice in the police station hadnt made me feel like i could call up her kid and see how he was but i shouldnt have ignored scott because his mother was a nutcase he shrugged i guess okay i havent slept real well since trey died he glanced up at hart quadlander ii told mom i wanted to go out and see the horse farm but i really wanted mr quadlander to bring me over here can i talk to you a minute uh sure i said opening the door hart would you like some coffee or pie were about kneedeep in pies and casseroles scott can i get you something no scott looked at the tables full of food he blinked solemnly at me yall must have a lot of friends only one lady brought any food to our house and it wasnt very good tuna casserole my heart felt like a stone even if nola and her son were strangers in town mirabeau should have reached out we hadnt well would you like something to eat he shook his head im not hungry thank you harts eyes met mine scott has something to give you jordy maybe we could talk in private scott asked i nodded and ushered him toward the back of the house i meant to introduce him to clo and candace but he walked straight past them with such singular purpose that i just followed him the air on the back porch felt cool and fresh as though the long days of rain had scrubbed it clean i treated myself to a deep cleansing breath this is a nice house he said i miss having a regular house mom and i tend not to stay in one place long it struck me then that scott seemed more like a shrunken adult than a growing boy his eyes took in the details of our home with a mature detachment as opposed to youthful enthusiasm maybe all the zest was gone from scott right now i remembered how id seen him crying to break your heart and id done nothing would he have let me help him i watched scott sensing he felt uncertain of how to begin now that we were alone i take it yall traveled around to the rodeos i gestured toward a white wicker chair and he sat nervously on the edge of the cushion yeah sometimes we got to see a lot of places mostly texas and louisiana and oklahoma sometimes mississippi sometimes i go with her sometimes not where do you stay if youre not traveling with her wherever she dumps me his eyes didnt hold bitterness about the statement until trey came along he made mom take me with them he glanced around your uh sister shes not here is she no shes not she and my nephew are out well okay mr quadlander said her car wasnt in the driveway so i thought maybe itd be okay if you and i talked he fished in his knapsack i found these actually trey showed them to me a while back i dont have no use for them so i figured yall would want them back he handed me a stack of photos i started sorting through them my mouth feeling dry a wedding photo of trey and sister both of their faces aglow with the expectation of a life to be lived together sister looked beautiful and happy pictures of mark at least ten of them in various stages of childhood crawling toothlessgrinned baby waddling toddler graceful boy smiling into the sunshine shading his face with the flat of one hand a baseball mitt on the other an old photo of sister trey and mark together when mark was barely a year old the pictures were worn with handling the final two photos were surprises a picture of mama and trey from some vaguely remembered fourth of july family celebration mama caught unawares by trey and smiling broadly into the lens trey hugging her close i recalled suddenly vividly taking this picture myself as id lowered the lens trey had kissed mama loudly on the cheek saying you just got to share her with me plum since i dont got a mama of mown he and sister were newlyweds then and trey was drunk with the joy of having a family that consisted of more than an inebriated father i remembered the blush that had crept up mamas cheek at his words and the nearly solemn way shed hugged him the final photo was of me it was a picture made when id come home from houston during college i stared at the photo for a long minute it showed me drinking a beer in the backyard daddy in the distance coaxing flame from a grill i looked heavier from a diet of college food and cold beer and i looked irritated as though i couldnt be bothered having my picture taken i remembered treys words as he took the photo smile like youve gotten smart at school plum my grin solely for the camera looked forced and blank trey and sister were married by then and i was going to prestigious rice and never coming to live in mirabeau again my snotty attitude showed clearly on my face that was what he had to remember me by i turned the photo over our scoler plum was written in treys close scrawl in faded black ink never could spell cat to save his life i felt a tinge of nausea and stood thanks scott thanks for bringing these by it was thoughtful of you i dont have no use for them he said quietly scott i waited till his eyes met mine i want you to tell me why trey came home he stared at the weathered boards of the porch scott did you hear me he came home to get better okay i dont know anything else he got up a flurry of activity what do you mean anything else what else is there to know look mr poteet i brought you the pictures okay i didnt have to do that i dont want to be involved in whatevers going on here he glanced at me over a shoulder and i could see he was close to tears i cant do nothin to help trey now i wish i could but i cant mom and i are leaving soon i just wanna forget we ever came to this stupid town do you know something scott because if you do you better tell the police right away practice what you preach i scolded myself again thinking of the fabric safely tucked away upstairs yeah right scott huffed my mom says the police chief dates your sister and my mom thinks your sister killed trey im sure your mother must be very upset i could tell she cared about trey she loved him okay he was good to us never hit her never hit me he acted nice he wiped burgeoning tears away with his sleeve i guided him to a chair and made him sit i went back to the screen door candace could you do me a favor could you get a glass of milk and a piece of that pecan pie for scott she hollered back her assent and i went and sat down again with scott i dont want no pie he sniffed itll do you good unless youre diabetic eula maes pies require an insulin chaser he managed a vague smile where are yall staying at scott i couldnt imagine they were still staying at nolas uncles house with its pervading air of death well last night we stayed at this neighbor ladys place but shes got a ton of cats and it makes mom sneeze so were moving this afternoon out to mr quadlanders farm soon as the police let him uncle dwights moving back to the house he said he dont care bout no one getting shot its his house mom and ill probably head back to beaumont scott glanced through the window at hart quadlander deep in conversation with clo mom likes mr quadlander hes a nice man yes he is you know trey and i used to ride horses out at that farm when we were about your age trey taught me to ride he looked at me grieving he was gonna teach me when it got warmer he never explained how he was gonna do that from a wheelchair though im sure he would have found a way candace brought out a generous slice of pecan pie and a tall glass of milk and set it on the end table by scott i introduced them and candace shook hands with scott rather gravely she sat down giving me a cautious glance scott ate his pie in steady bites without talking i filled the silence with nervous chatter explaining to scott that candace owned the sitaspell cafe and telling candace that scott was staying at harts farm thats good scott said around a final mouthful of sugar crust and sticky nutty filling my mom isnt much for baking stuff like pie less it comes out of the freezer nothing like homemade pie well give you some to take home scott candace patted his leg scotts hazel eyes widened oh no mom doesnt know im here shed kill me that was a nice gesture bringing us those pictures i glanced at candace im sure your mom wont be mad at you he ignored the napkin candace had brought with the pie and dragged the back of his hand across his mouth the crumbs on his plate seemed to hold undue fascination for him i glanced again at candace she touched his shoulder gently hon is there anything else you want to tell us men have always responded to candace beauty can drive men to distraction but real kindness will snare them every time especially if life hasnt always been kind combine them like candace does and the mixture is potent theres a quality in her voice a commanding trust that you cant help but answer unless youre just plain stubborn scott wasnt a mulish kid he looked up at her like his heart was breaking my mom you dont think your mom had anything to do with treys murder i blurted and candace shot me a look that ricocheted from between my eyes i shut my mouth god how could i have suggested that to a kid oh no mom wouldnt hurt anyone and she loved trey i wanted to point out that love and hurt were not mutually exclusive states but another pointed glance from candace stilled my tongue its just that moms real sure that your sister killed trey and if she thinks im suggesting different shed be pissed at me scott im sure your mama wants the killer brought to justice regardless of who it is candace said softly im sure she wouldnt want arlene to be charged if she was innocent i guess scott didnt sound very convinced he seemed to be holding something barely in check his eyes flickering between candace and me gauging us on a scale of trust i kept my mouth shut silence seemed to compel scott to speak its just that what with that other fellow dying and he came over to the house not long after we got to town clevey clevey was at yalls house i interrupted a sharp pinch on my knee not from scott silenced me again let scott tell his story jordan please candace said we got in thursday morning trey made a couple of phone calls and this other guy clevey shivers comes over to the house redhaired loud funny he smelled like beer though even in the morning he and trey went into the bedroom to talk and mom and uncle dwight went to go run errands i was watching tv but uncle dwights got crappy reception so i went back to my room to read comic books and i could hear them arguing arguing i leaned closer i could see scott steeling himself i heard mr shiverscleveytelling trey he was years late laughing at trey saying hedscott wrinkled his brow in memorymissed the gravy train trey told him to shut up clevey laughed some more trey said they werent going to talk about what theyd seen trey told him what was past was past he wasnt interested no more and clevey saidclevey said that trey better keep out of his way said the gravy train might go slow on the bend and he could climb on he paused and rubbed his eyes isnt gravy train like a dog food candace and i exchanged looks above the boys head once the story started scott didnt seem to need further prompting i got scared clevey kind of said the last part real mean like but trey yelled back at him saying that clevey was nothin but a cheap con artist and a crook trey told him to get out and clevey told him to think about it some more once trey got some more of them medical bills hed be begging clevey for help scott licked his lips his voice deepening in imitation then clevey said you do anything to fuck this up slocum and youll be in worse shape than you are now revenge is sweet if you give it half a chance trey didnt say anything and clevey left the house shook when he slammed the door i just lay on my bed id figured they thought id gone to the store with mom and uncle dwight so i didnt even move i heard trey wheeling himself around in the bedroom talking to himself it sounds stupid but i crawled out the window and made a lot of noise coming back in the house i didnt want him to know id heard why candace asked i dont know i didnt like the way that clevey fellow talked to him it was scary one minute sounding mean like hed just as soon spit in your face the next minute sounding like he was your best friend ever if someone had told me treyd be murdered in a couple of days id have said for sure that clevey would have been the one to do it but he couldnt have he was already dead himself scott shook his head i dont like this place i dont know why trey wanted to come back here this is an unholy mess hart quadlander shook his head at me candace had taken scott in finally plying him with an offer of a more substantial lunch and hart had lit a cigarette i saw his fingers tremble slightly the smoke swirling around his hand treys death has you unsettled doesnt it i asked him more than youll know hart answered i liked him he was one of the last remaining icons of southern gentility to be found in mirabeau he was tall striking dark graystreaked haired grayeyed with a textured deep drawl that should have done public readings of the works of padgett powell or larry mcmurtry being the last of the quadlanders counted for a lot in mirabeau and hart wore his position like a mantle it was hard on me hart said halfway to himself when trey left town id grown real fond of him over the years and of course it just killed his daddy louis had always had a drinking problem but it just got worse when trey left i reckon we can be thankful louis aint here to see what became of his boy trey sent my sister money i said hart digested this news drawing on his cigarette and breathing out a plume of smoke i hate to say this jordy but the town gossips have arlene pegged as the prime suspect none of us can ignore her belting trey at trudas house its not helping her that junebug pulled himself off the case you dont think that do you my stomach sank hart quadlander was highly respected in mirabeau his opinion could influence others i dont believe in assessing guilt before you got all the facts maybe someone else had a reason to kill trey he stubbed out his cigarette in the ceramic ashtray we kept out on the porch for our smoking guests and looked at me frankly jordy i cant think of a soul other than arlene with a motive hed been out of town for a long while what about when he left town can you remember anything that happened then maybe he got killed cause he came home over the years hart and i had wondered about treys reasons for leaving but i had to ask he shook his head he was here one day gone the next he must have been planning to run out on arlene and mark and his father after all he took those pictures that scott found the pictures bothered me they suggested a man who still cherished his family not an abandonee and something niggled at my mind regarding those pictures you sure you cant think of anything hart shook his head and lit another cigarette son ive gone over that time again and again louis was still drinking a little too much but he was trying to stay off the juice course when trey left he started boozing all over again drank himself to death over that boy i still stung from the intimation against my sister so where were you when trey died hart shrugged and didnt seem offended by the bluntness of my question saturday morning i was over in fayette county at the running creek horse farm looking at some ponies to buy i didnt hear about treys murder till i got home that afternoon at three did trey tell you why he showed up in town again god no hart rubbed his chin a half smile on his face and that just about shocked the bejesus out of me i never expected to see that boys face again he showed up at the horse farm with young scott and that nola gal asked to talk to me alone he shrugged i was awful glad to see him i dont know if i would have felt that way a few years back i blamed him too much for pushing louis back to the bottle louis poured out his own death i snapped perhaps a bit more bluntly than i shouldve louis slocum had never been any good hed been a sorry father to trey louis made his own choices in life not confronting his alcoholism was one of them yes i know its a disease a treatable one thats easy for you to say now jordan hart said with heat in his voice you didnt have to see your best friend drink himself into a grave i didnt answer trey gave you no reason for why hed left six years ago hart rubbed his forehead with his fingertips none and he offered no apologies he told me that he wanted to see arlene and mark again that he was tired of being away from home that the accident hadhad changed his viewpoint on many things on people that hed cared about too little too late i murmured to myself not only for those hed left behind but for himself he was awful sickly looking hart said i wondered if hed been honest with me about how bad his injuries were maybe he came home to die and i saw the horror dawn on harts face as he realized the double meaning of his words i shook my head did he mention clevey shivers hart stared out at the rain for a moment then stubbed out his cigarette no he didnt mention any of his old friends i dont think i told him you were back in town i told hart about the down scrawled in blood on treys wall i hope no one intends to add to that score the story obviously jolted hart his jaw worked as though he were chewing unfamiliar bitter food ii dont understand whod want them both dead candace appeared in the porch door um jordy arlene and mark are home now you want to come in it was more of a demand than a request and i suddenly remembered scott kinnards possibly disruptive presence in the house i hurried in followed by hart silence reigned in the kitchen sister and mark stood near the refrigerator ill at ease in their own home i was surprised to see steven teague hovering behind mark scott was halfway through a hearty plate of roast beef broccolirice casserole copperpenny carrots and rolls mama sat next to him quiet as a mouse candaee was in the middle a forced smile on her face wanda eula mae and bradley stood together on the other side of the kitchen mark and scott stared at each other uh hi sister mark i gestured toward our young guest this is scott kinnard trey was staying with scott and his mother scott this is my sister arlene and her son mark scott had the wide eyes of a trapped rabbit sister pursed her lips and stepped forward offering her hand hello scott its nice to meet you sister could be a spitting hellion at times but mama didnt raise her to be rude to folks i however was fair game jordan may i speak privately to you she asked explanations were in order scott brought us some pictures sister pictures that trey took with him before he left town scott thoughtfully returned them to us sisters face softened slightly as she glanced back toward scott well im sure that was very nice of him thank you youre welcome maam scott emboldened by her kindness looked to mark again hi mark im glad to finally meet you your dad talked a lot about you why would he do that marks voice sounded wooden scott coughed fumbling for words i dontwell he always said he was real proud of you proud of me thats a joke how could he be proud of me he wasnt here for me he didnt even know me mark stumbled back stepping on steven teagues immaculately loafered foot scott looked helplessly at me confusion on his face course he knew what you did it was in his letters he blinked at our blank stares trey used to get letters from mirabeau from some lady named anne he didnt tell me who she was they stopped about two years ago scott glanced from mark to me but my gaze along with everyone elses in the room went to my mother she was tunelessly humming and drawing pictures with a fork on the canvas of her mashed potatoes suddenly aware that she was the focus of attention she smiled brightly at us if mama wrote him he mustve written her if he was moving around like scott said he would have to tell her where she could reach him sister fumed as she paced up and down the back porch mama never threw a thing away in her life ever were gonna find those letters were going to tear the house down if we have to i can easily see mama destroying any letters trey wrote her i interjected she might not have wanted you to see them how could she how could she carry on a correspondence with the man that deserted me and my child look we dont even know why he left town of course we do he was a coward jordy he was tired of the responsibility of a wife and a child all of a sudden without warning why would he do that sisters eyes narrowed that woman nola kinnard maybe he was seeing her on the sly she used to spend her summers here as a kid hart says shes got family here maybe he met her when she was visiting them they had an affair and he left me for her then why would he write mama why would she write him back she shook her head maybe scotts lying why would he well he brought back those pictures why doesnt he produce these socalled letters i asked him he said he doesnt know where they are maybe trey didnt keep them god sister collapsed in a wicker chair her hands balled into fists i dont know anything anymore goddamn him she looked up at me her face pale the blackened eye like a smudge of ash that her tears couldnt rinse away i cant take this jordy this is killing me i always was strong i had to be for mark and then i had to be for mama i just dont think im strong enough for this i knelt by her and took her in my arms she tucked her head under my neck with her face still pressed against my shoulder she performed a typical sisterism and changed the subject from one unpleasant to her to one unpleasant to me i asked steven teague to come talk with you after his session with mark i think it would be useful for our whole family to have some counseling well i didnt know what to say i guess my first question for our family session is howd you get that black eye sister she jerked back from me i told you i ran into a tree sister i said it softly and i saw her lip tremble dont lie to me if youd hit a tree the bark would have left abrasions or cuts now who hit you no one why on earth are you protecting him or her a thought dawned was it trey did he hit you and you dont want anyone to know because it might make you even more of a suspect i could see the scenario unfold sister and trey arguing at his house he grabs and belts her he could still do that from his wheelchair she runs tearing her pants on that stray nail on the stairs trey didnt hit me no one hit me i dont believe you arlene i dont care what you believe jordan it was serious business if wed stooped to christian names her voice was as icy as a frosted pane of glass in the dead of winter now will you come to family counseling maybe maybe not i turned away from her she got up and went back inside after a moment i followed her whats your prognosis on my nephew i asked steven wed offered him some lunch and he and id taken it out on the porch to talk in privacy i stuck a tender piece of pot roast in my mouth and watched mark showing scott his favorite pecan tree to climb i couldnt hear what the boys said to each other in their hushed tones maybe scott was telling mark whatall mama had written about mark in those six empty years hes a smart kid but hes been through hell steven said buttering a roll and balancing the plate on his lap mark would like to pretend that his father never died in front of him that it just didnt happen the meat was tasteless in my mouth can you help him steven he paused chewing he took a long sip of iced tea before answering yes with time your sisters done a great job of raising him but he has a lot of unresolved issues with his fathers leaving him he patted at his mouth with a napkin your sister suggested that your whole family attend some of the sessions i think it might be productive i understand you were once very close to trey i was once we were no longer friends when he came back i put my plate aside my appetite had deserted me yes so arlene said my plan is to have several individual sessions with mark we need to get him a certain stage past the trauma of his fathers death before we tackle the other he didnt get to finish junebug came out onto the porch exhausted and a little peeved hello jordy well mr teague you certainly turn up in the most unusual places his voice sounded tired and he sat heavily in one of the porch chairs excuse me chief i finished reading the case file on clevey you had to turn over junebug said and ive got a number of questions to ask you do you mind coming down to the station with me steven pointed at his heaping plate may i have my lunch first chief lunch what a concept junebug muttered eyeing the meat gravy and vegetables im not so dense i dont know a plea for an invite junebug weve got plenty why dont you and steven have a bite and yall can talk here if you like go on and get a plate i stood ill leave yall alone and ill make sure no one bothers you thanks jordy would you mind fixing me a plate junebug asked your sisters wearin war paint instead of makeup as far as im concerned she didnt look too happy to see me give her time shell cool off i went back inside where i found eula mae sister and candace all speaking in hushed tones in the kitchen i silently took a plate from the cabinet and began ladling food onto it second helpings for you sister asked archly no for your boyfriend i invited him to lunch he and steven need to have a little privacy out on the porch to talk about cleveys case some boyfriend he is supposing i couldve killed trey he had to take himself off the case because he believes youre innocent dont you see that he couldnt be impartial in his investigation sister made a noise that indicated logical arguments were not welcome i didnt respond nabbing a glass of iced tea i took junebug his food he thanked me and dove heartily in yall help yourselves if you want more i left them alone on the porch solitude sounded good to me i avoided any further skirmishes with the female contingent and went up to my room i lay down on my bed and tried to nap but the image of trey collapsing dying staring into his sons face with the final glimmer of life kept me awake and the air felt dense in my lungs the room having been shut so tightly during all the recent rain i went to my bedroom window which faced out onto the backyard scott and mark had either gone round to the front or gone inside i tugged the window open hoping for a little fresh air and i resent this chief moncrief stevens voice was tight with anger ive given you my case file youve read it i really dont want to be grilled about my therapy with clevey i read it but i dont understand half of your mumbo jumbo and you dont have a choice mr teague youre not a psychiatrist youre not under the same legal obligation to confidentiality your lawyers already advised you to cooperate fully with me i suggest you heed his advice junebugs voice fainter than stevens floated up to me past the backporch roof i saw a bluish puff of smoke from stevens pipe drift up from the porch steps shut the window i told myself but i didnt curiosity won out over good manners so much for my southerngentleman merit badge i leaned down slightly from the window junebug muttered something i couldnt catch another miniature cloud of pipe smoke wafted from the porch as steven didnt answer junebug spoke again he was murdered he was my friend id like to think that if hed had a problem he would come to his friends i know you want to find who killed him steven please dont help this killer get away there was a long thoughtful silence then stevens unaccented polished voice ive never discussed a patients therapy before never youve never had a patient murdered i assume no i havent steven answered there was another pause and then he spoke his voice sounding resigned and not a little bitter have you ever read steinbeck chief moncrief east of eden in particular no but i saw the moviewith james dean right about the perfect son and the bad son clevey was both he wanted to be good someone liked and respected he envied you he envied davis his other friends that he saw as successful but he enjoyed being bad for lack of a better term he thought there was a certain glamour in breaking the rules but he was driven to make up for bad actions by doing good he was like a moral pendulum swinging from anger and bitterness to piety and kindliness back and forth it made him a very unhappy man i heard junebugs distinctive snort i dont know who youre talking about but it certainly wasnt clevey wasnt it didnt you ever see him be cruel to someone then be desperate to make amends again and again and again that phrasing put a different spin on it clevey torturing ed with truly meanspirited teasing and the next moment being eds best friend apologizing and treating him to lunch raking junebug over the coals in the newspaper for a flubbed case then rallying support around him out of friendship id noticed it always in him but perhaps id dismissed it as a quirk of personality id grown up with him i thought i knew him steven continued chief i tried to help clevey see the value of moderation in his judgments realizing that if he made one good judgment that didnt give him permission to make a bad one and if he made a bad choice did something he regretted he needed to let go of it and move on with his life clevey was eternally making amends because he was eternally doing something wrong wrong like he was committing a crime junebug demanded a pause ensued and i could imagine steven sucking at his pipe of course not at least he didnt confess to me clevey was a manipulatorbut he specialized in manipulating himself he was his own worst victim he made himself miserable he paused again i glanced around wondering if any of my neighbors would wonder why i was sticking my head out the window for so long i think he would have been much happier if hed just tried to be a saint or a total son of a bitch but not both do you think you helped him junebug said i wouldve asked that myselfi didnt like the thought of clevey dying a tortured soul always doing wrong and forever trying to make up for it assuming that stevens portrayal was correct i knew of no reason for him to lie i dont know maybe if i had he wouldnt have died he wouldnt have hurt someone so much they killed him this swinging back and forth between good and evil junebug said how did it manifest itself what was he doing i dont know i think you must know steven how else did you arrive at this diagnosis the wind whipped through the dripping trees i heard the tap of stevens pipe against the rail of the porch i think he said slowly that this conversation is over i still respect my clients memory even if you dont and im not going to answer any more questions without my lawyer present good day chief i heard the back door shut and junebug cuss softly then go inside i pulled the window closed the air smelling like waiting rain and i went downstairs to tell junebug about the argument between clevey and trey that scott had overheard that afternoon we completed treys funeral arrangements mark and sister agreed with truda shivas that a double funeral for clevey and trey would be appropriate hart said he would speak to nola he thought she would agree sister told hart to tell nola she could pick out the burial suit we would select the coffin hart left with scott sister excused herself and i could hear her up in mamas room opening and slamming drawers looking for letters i didnt join in her search i watched mamas serene face as she watched the beginnings of another rainstorm patter on the grassy yard and wondered how she could have truly exchanged letters with trey why would she and why wouldnt she have told sister a thought made my mouth go dry what if she had told sister the only one who could say that mama definitely hadnt told sister was mama herself and she was in no condition to remember what if sister had known all along where trey was what he was doing where he was living she said she didnt knowbut was she being entirely honest that didnt make sense what reason would she have for pretending now that she hadnt known i couldnt think of one but then i couldnt think of a reason for her to have that shiner sister found nothing in her search candace ran home for a while and clo left to tend to her own family mark and i desultorily watched part of the cowboys game they stomped their opponents taking away any distraction for us junebug whod gone back to the station after steven bolted called to tell me that they hadnt made much progress on the case he sounded tired he didnt ask to speak to sister but he asked me how she and mark were doing theyre fine junebug and how are you i wish everyone would quit worrying so damn much about me im perfectly all right just tired hey i found some old pictures last night in my daddys scrapbook junebug said his father the same sob whod christened his son with an insectoid nickname had fancied himself a photographer and endlessly annoyed you at any social gathering by sticking a lens down your gullet theres a couple of real funny photos of you and trey remember at eds twentyfirst birthday party we all got tight and nearly decapitated each other swinging at that stupid pinata his mama got him i remembered id nailed trey in the shoulder blindfolded with a soft cotton bandanna and with a sixpack in me he was lucky i hadnt brained him hed wrested the stick from me and swatted me hard on the ass wed gotten into a wrestling match that ended when davis finally whacked the pinata and the damn thing dumped pounds of candy on us try to keep fighting when a bunch of squealing pretty girls fall on you grabbing sweets out of your hair and face oh and one of you and clevey and trey when you went fishing with daddy and me on lake bonaparte you didnt catch squat you ought to see all the fish on treys line man that boy could fish you never had the patience for it jordy i didnt want to remember i gotta go ill talk to you tomorrow i hung up i saw candace look up from a magazine mama snored softly in her chair mark had retired to his room sister had taken to bed claiming a bad headache all of us straying to our separate little compartments except for candace junebug i shrugged toward the phone he likes to jabber so he does her voice was strangely low how you feeling i kept from making a face fine im fine i smiled and stuck my hands in my jeans pockets but im tired i think ill go to bed you dont have to stay over i know but ill stay in the guest room if you dont mind arlene might need me arlene she was staying for my sister not for me i blinked i loved this woman but i was conscious of how id been pushing her away shutting her out from all the confusion i felt about treys death that wasnt fair to her i knew it she wanted to help me wanted me to need her now but i couldnt i didnt know why im glad youre here i said it sounded empty even to me sleep well babe i wished her a good night and went to my room i lay facedown on the bed breathing in the scent of clean sheets and the smell of rain that pervaded the old house order i decided just like at the library i needed to get my thoughts in order i fetched a legal pad off my desk and began writing after a few minutes id scribbled down a list of questionssome horribly obviousthat i wanted answers to questions why did trey leave mirabeau in the first place had mama really been corresponding with trey all these years if so why didnt she tell us if she kept treys letters where are they who gave sister the black eye why is she protecting that person or is it that shes afraid of someone why was clevey hiding all that information on rennie clifton nothing there that isnt public record what did clevey and trey argue about that scott overheard what did clevey mean revenge is sweet who did cleveyor treyneed to revenge by himself on what did clevey mean by gravy train are davis and ed hiding anything why did davis sound so numbed when i talked to him what does down mean painted in blood on treys wall what motives would anyone have to kill either trey or clevey who had opportunity to commit the murders why is steven hesitant to talk about cleveys therapy is it just ethicsor something else i read over my list then added another why did trey really come home that seemed the key to me hed been away for six years hed sent money to his exwife hed possibly exchanged letters with my mother this status quo had been maintained for a long long while even with his injuries he could have recuperated elsewhere what suddenly urged him back to a town where hed be shunned as a cowardly father i rubbed my eyes my head throbbed pained with memories and with doubts i contemplated going downstairs to talk with candace but i preferred my own company for the moment i didnt know what to say to her i doused the lights and fell into fitful sleep vaguely hearing the distant roll of thunder as i drifted off sounds like rains coming trey stared up at the stardotted sky he propped his booted feet on the cab door of his battered truck and folded his hands behind his head i lay next to him trying to count the stars through a blur of beer not this instant i said too far off we wont get rain for a little while glass clinked as he reached for another beer he sat up and took a deep swig from the longneck youll get a lot of rain in houston jordy youll be walking to classes in kneedeep water it floods there all the time his voice sounded as far away as the thunder did dont tell mama shell buy me waders i sat up and opened another beer the crickets chirped through the night air sounding their brief trumpets before the approaching storm drowned them out whoever said nights in the country are quiet dont know what theyre talking about the air felt humid as languid as a girls caress and in the purplish darkness i could barely see trey sitting next to me i could see him tip the bottle to his lips the moon reflecting off the curve where label ended and glass began you aint gonna have no horses to ride in houston he observed no ill have to come back here for that and you aint gonna get cooking as good as your mamas i bet that university kitchen dont make good biscuits and cream gravy on sunday mornings probably give you something nasty like yogurt probably and marcia tatum aint gonna be around case you get a tad horny i laughed no marcia wont be in houston course shes not too pleased im going away period i dont think shed be granting me her favors even if i stayed shit trey scoffed your first weekend back shell be as hot for you as you are for her he stood and stretched and walked to the back of the truck his boot heels made an eerie clang against the metal face it jordan you aint got many reasons to come back here houstonll suit you real well youre smart therell be a lot of new things to hold your attention you wont need mirabeau again dont be stupid of course i still need mirabeau my familys here my friends are here i paused youre here man you think im going to forget about you for the first time in your life youre going to be around a lot of people that are as smart as you are or even smarter the people you meet at rice are gonna make the rest of us look like dipsticks future doctors and lawyers and such thats crap trey quit saying that youre not smart he laughed and sipped at his beer i dont say im not smart the teachers say im not smart the teachers here are stupid then brave words from the valedictorian all im saying is go go out there and make what you can of yourself dont look back dont be an idiot i said uncertainly i didnt care for the way this conversation was going the thunder sounded again closer wilder of course im coming back home and do what what are you going to do with your fancy degree here in mirabeau young mr poteet be a lawyer in your crazy uncle bids practice you cant stand him become mayor you aint exactly a politician teach at the school wont pay you diddly to clear them big student loans or maybe youll just end up serving dr pepper floats at the sitaspell his voice had grown harsh i stared up at him in the darkness why are you doing this i dont want you to think that mirabeau is the whole world like our numbnut friends do i dont want you to waste the chance you got ill come home if i want ill live here if i want i stood and the wind surged making me feel unsteady trey seemed an indistinct figure in the night why are you being so shitty to me i hollered because youre gonna do all the things in life i wish i could because youre the brother i never had lightning split the sky and i saw the trey standing before me was not the trey of our careless eighteenth summer drinking beer with me on the nexttothelast night before i left for college he was the trey that had died his face gaunt and drawn and bearded in the momentary white light then help me tell me who killed clevey tell me who killed you killed me he asked yes youre dead who killed you i screamed into the wind he collapsed against me and my hands felt the warmth of his lifes blood his voice creaked like a coffins lid you are youre killing me jordy a cry caught in my throat as i wrenched up in bed i slapped the palm of my hand over my mouth and bit my fingers nightmares sweat adhered the sheets to my body and i kicked them away they felt like shrouds i staggered to the window another storm swept over mirabeau headed for the gulf and the glass felt cool against my palms what was happening to me why did i feel like this world was the dream and those memories with trey were the reality i shut my eyes and took a long sobering breath i shrugged into my terrycloth robe and sat again on the bed listening to the quiet of my house many nights mama was restless in the wandering way alzheimers patients sometimes are but tonight she was still i heard the remote ticking of the grandfather clock downstairs like a colossal heart apparently i hadnt called out the houses silence pushed oppressively on my ears i hungered for a comfort food i didnt want to stay in my bed it was nothing but a trap full of memories i remembered all the pies downstairs my sweet tooth pulsed and i tiptoed down to the kitchen i turned on all the lights i didnt like the dark anymore the pies looked tempting pecan peach buttermilk and apple but i didnt want a slice only two images from my dream could make me smile marcia tatum and dr pepper floats marcia had been my senioryear girlfriend a buxom funny slyeyed brunette and shed served up the best dr pepper floats in the world at the old sitaspell cafe trey had kidded me plenty that id had more dr pepper floats after school than any other boy in mirabeau history hed follow me to the cafe and chatter at me and marcia as she made my favorite fountain concoction while i watched her with vasteyed devotion he loved to tease i pulled a gallon of blue bell vanilla ice cream from the freezer give him an extra scoop now marcia trey would say eyeing marcias own scoops under her bright pink uniform i found an icy cold can of sugary original dr pepper in the back of the fridge and popped the top dont you be skimpy with that dr pepper marcia jordy needs all the sweetness he can get dont you jordy i pulled the icecream scooper out of a drawer and rinsed it with hot water i found a thick tall glass in the cabinet and set it on the counter marcia sugar you ought to give jordy a large float but charge him for a small one dont you care none about this poor boy dragging the scooper across the pristine plain of ice cream i pared free a globe of white sweetness i jiggled it above the glass and the scoop fell in leaving a creamy smear along the side again another scoop a small one to top it then the dr pepper the fizz of its pouring the only sound i heard as it frothed above the ice cream the can felt like a deadweight in my hand ah thats his favorite there miss marcia he likes those floats even better than he likes you or me jordan candace standing nearby watched me im making a dr pepper float i announced and my voice broke candace looked sort of blurry i can see that honey her voice was cottony soft you okay youve spilled it everywhere i glanced down at the kitchen counter the soda can was empty and my glass sat in a puddle of bubbling brown i looked back up at candace and i could see her heart breaking hes dead i heard my voice hes really really dead trey is dead god a sob escaped from me like air long trapped underwater then bursting to the surface i felt her arms close around me i didnt want to cry no not in front of her i didnt want her to see me that way i put my fingers over my face and they were wet and sticky with dr pepper why why i dont know baby i dont know why he died she murmured into my chest not him dying why did he leave us i buried my face against her disarrayed hair he left me i was like his brother and he left me he left sister and mark and mama and daddy and his own father but why did he leave me i pulled in a badly needed breath we were as close as brothers what could have happened that he couldnt tell me if he was going to run away from here why didnt he come to boston i would have helped him no matter what the trouble was didnt he know that what did i do wrong whyd anyone want to kill him why why i was conscious of her taking me to the sink washing the soda from my hands and my face toweling me dry she led me back upstairs to my room and laid me on my bed she held me in her arms and i talked i babbled like a mute just given speech telling her all the idiocies and kindnesses that trey and i had done in our reckless vanished youths our time when we thought we were immortal it didnt make im sure for a cohesive monologue but she laughed at all the funny stories and she smiled sadly at our tragedies she stroked my hair and kissed my face and gave me all the strength in her heart i took it like the precious gift it was i never loved her more in my life i told her so and she kissed me gently i felt her fingers lightly brushing my hair you know what she whispered i think you loved him very much i think he loved you too and its okay to say that and its okay to be sad its normal you sound like one of them therapists on tv i rasped sticking my face in my pillow i dont care what i sound like im just glad youre grieving she said i opened one eye at her she ran a finger inside the cup of my ear im serious i was about sick of watching you pretend that trey slocums death hadnt affected you in the least it wasnt natural not to someone that cares as much as you do i was about ready to kick your butt if you didnt start acting like a human being i watched the translucent blue vein in her wrist as it moved barely above my face i was mad at him for so long i didnt know how not to be mad at him i closed the one eye id opened now i cant tell him im sorry he cant tell me if hes sorry for what he did im starting to wish id known trey slocum he mustve had some virtues thrown in with the vices i wished she had too i felt exhausted as though id run a marathon with a weight on my back i pulled her to me feeling a sudden intoxicating need for her candace responded her lips seeking mine her fingers tangling in my hair my hands framed her face like a precious treasure the phone rang shattering the three am silence i jerked in surprise candace rolled over grabbed the receiver murmured a quick hello poteet residence and listened oh my god oh no her face crumpled with shock as she handed me the phone its the police station junebugs been shot ice water in your face is a sobering slap id had two friends die by violenceand id tried wrapping myself in denial like it was one of my grandmothers quilts a cocoon against the sharp pain of loss id stumbled along hardly like myself numbed and slackjawed ruminating at a snails pace now my eyes were wide and clear and fueled by hot anger i wanted to catch whoever was destroying my friends and strike at them with viciousness i felt restless and shivery as i paced the hospital hall the mondaymorning hours found sister mark and me sitting in a large crowded waiting room at mirabeau memorial clo had volunteered to stay with mama and candace had gone to open the cafe it was now eight in the morning and we hadnt been told anything by franklin bedloe the acting police chief except that junebugd been shot twice was out of surgery and was still unconscious junebugs mother barbara moncrief a bigboned woman with a heart to match was in with her son well over a dozen of the moncrief clan and their friends were crammed into the chairs talking quietly mindlessly turning pages of back issues of people while we waited the rest of the mirabeau police force seemed to be patrolling the hospital their faces set in sorrow and anger and i wanted to scream at them why arent you out catching the asshole that did this but i didnt i am always amazed by the strength of women i dont think i ever appreciated it until mama got sick and her vitality ebbed away in cruel fashion sister has that same vigor i watched her cast her face in iron as she waited for barbara moncrief to come back so she could go in and see her man she held my hand her fingers twitching occasionally as we sat we didnt talk id tried to comfort her with reassuring words but she turned monosyllabic on me and i retreated after a while she got up and paced fiercely as though the excess energy in her would explode if not given release davis and ed had appeared after id called them their voices still creaky with sleep both looked exhausted and pained i felt the same way as though id been pummeled in the stomach for the past three days except i felt ready to punch back they sat in the far corner of the lounge i couldnt decide if they were avoiding me or they were trying to give us privacy davis was impeccable in his lawyers suit as though nothing of consequence had happened and it would be another day pushing wills and realestate closures around his desktop unshaven ed looked rumpled in wrinkled khakis and a patty loveless tour tshirt he looked like a confused child tumbled out of bed i felt nearly sick looking at ed of us all he reminded me most of those longago boys every now and then his eyes met mine asking the unanswerable question as to why our friend lay struggling for life i tried to talk to franklin bedloe the acting police chief but he brushed me off to return to the crime scene down had been the message at treys murder scene had another profane scorecard been left as junebug lay on the bloodied porch i desperately wanted to know but franklin didnt have time for me and i didnt try to detain him he had a killer to catch and i had a friend to stand watch over a heavyeyed peggy godkin stumbled into the room lugging a satchel peggy is the editor of the mirabeau mirror and possibly the only workaholic in town shes certainly the only achiever in the large godkin clan that permeates every part of bonaparte county most of the godkins shuffle by on a daytoday existence peggy got the recessive puritan workethic gene put herself through college started as a cub reporter for the mirror and had moved up to editor in record time she was now in her fifties a handsome woman with dark hair marred by a thick lacywhite streak that ran back from her forehead peggy nearly always played a witch at the highschool halloween haunted house it was definitely casting against type she saw us and waved i gestured back feebly sister stopped wearing out the carpet and moved toward peggy arlene jordan im so sorry how is he wheres barbara sister shook her head hes out of surgery the bullet grazed his skull barbaras with him now peggy gave sister a fierce hug sister hugged back what exactly happened peggy asked i told her what little we knew apparently junebug had been working very late at his office had come home and while putting the key in his lock was shot franklin bedloe hypothesizedbased on the trajectory of the wounds he said and i shudderedthat the gunman crouched waiting in the bushes on the far side of junebugs porch one bullet creased his skull the other one tore into his big frame narrowly missing his heart a neighbor awakened by the shots phoned the police franklin had called barbara moncrief and then our house peggy shook her head my lord two murders in as many days and now an attempt on junebugs life what the sweet hell is going on in town i stood i dont know peggy lets go down to the cafeteria and get some coffee sister mark yall want anything they said no peggy gathered her purse close to her and walked along with me when we got to the end of the hall i glanced back marks face was buried in his hands and sister was watching me intently the cafeteria was sparsely populated i got two steaming cups of coffee and sat across the formica table from where peggy had parked herself she sipped at her brew im so sorry about trey jordan i didnt know what to say to arlene and mark my policy is stay silent till youre sure whats going to come out your mouth were all trying to deal with it she closed her eyes smoothing out the laughter lines around them and poor clevey i still cant believe hes dead im sorry i didnt get a chance to really talk to you at trudas house i got cornered by his aunts she hesitated for a moment then plunged ahead i saw the argument between trey and arlene i mightve been tempted to whack him one myself but im sorry treys dead i sipped at my coffee and considered how to proceed peggy i wanted to ask you about clevey ill be blunt be blunt back could he have been researching something for the paper that mightve gotten him killed shock registered on her face my god jordan what a suggestion what do you think she saw my seriousness no he was working on his usual assignmentsthe city council the bookreview section and he was researching a feature on domestic violence i thought of the hidden files on rennie clifton and her tragically short life no other special assignments peggy gave a tired sigh clevey honey it was all i could do to get him to finish his regular work it sounds terrible to say now and id never want his mama to know but i wasnt far off from firing clevey may i ask what was wrong i dont think i should say peggy i knew clevey his whole life i wont repeat it and what you say wont hurt him now peggy stared down into her coffee his work had become substandard he was missing deadlines more and more were a small paper jordan and everyones got to pull their weight i dont have the resources to keep a layabout on the payroll clevey was irresponsible she shook her head and ran her hand along the pale streak in her hair i didnt understand his attitude he was so enthusiastic about journalism for so long and he was talented was when did this downhill slide start she shrugged last summer my patience was at an end i want to ask you some questions but off the record i said peggy leaned forward what a change im usually the one conducting the interview ill answer your questions if youll answer mine deal did you ever hear clevey mention a girl named rennie clifton her brow furrowed sounds familiar but i cant place the name and you never heard him mention anything about trey no never that for sure i would have remembered after the awful way trey left your family i leaned back damn whos rennie clifton peggy asked it was no point in telling her to forget it id rather have peggy godkin on my side than snooping on her own and plastering a story across the front page i told her about the longago hurricane and the girl who died peggy propped her face in her hands i remember that now hurricane althea clevey wrote the twentiethanniversary special report we did last august werent you writing for the mirror when althea hit yes she frowned unfortunately that was the week i took a vacation and visited my college roommate in dallas biggest story to hit mirabeau in years and i missed it did you ever hear anything unusual regarding the hurricane or rennie cliftons death she closed her eyes in concentration her reporters mind flipping through the enormous rolodex of facts that resided in her brain no sorry nearly everyone was busy picking up the pieces thanking god they were alive rennie wasnt i said clevey had developed a new interest in the case i thought maybe he was writing a story about her she shook her head he wrote the retrospective on hurricane althea and he wrote a brief piece on the clifton girl i wonder why he got interested again in that case peggy shrugged newsfolk love to write about themselves maybe he wanted to revisit the great trauma of his childhood speaking of trauma did you know that he was seeing a psychotherapist a man named steven teague lord no i didnt know he was getting counseling she tapped her nail against her lip a meditative gesture id seen her use while covering library board meetings steven teague i know that name i frowned he just moved here recently very urbane polishedlooking fellow he said i stopped for a moment feeling i was breaking a rule by discussing what id overheard if it got back to junebug or steven id be in serious trouble but clevey was dead and his murderer walked free steven says that clevey was troubled that hed done serious wrong and was trying to find ways to rectify it what kind of wrong he wont elaborate but he does say that clevey was determined to do better for himself cleveys work didnt reflect that peggy said gods gonna slap me for speaking ill of the dead she sighed clevey mustve been performing his good deeds elsewhere you said this therapist is named steven teague yeah well he probably took out an ad and thats how i know his name i wonder if hed give me a group therapy rate for my family now for my questions like you agreed are you sticking your nose into police business again yes and its my own business now it has been since trey died in front of me and mark peggy leaned back you know jordan some people criticize private citizens who take it on themselves to investigate crimes im one of them i only answered your questions because youre an old friend of cleveys most private citizens dont have three friends shot in as many days i kept my voice low i dont care if people in mirabeau think im a magnet for trouble i didnt ask to find a body in the library last spring or nearly get blown up last summer but i will no longer stand idly by while my friends are picked off like targets in a shooting gallery no i dont suppose you would maybe thats why i like you you sorry fool peggy finished her coffee and patted my hand i better see if i can get one of junebugs doctors to talk to me then head on over to the police station and see if i can just say a hello to barbara she gathered her satchel close to her terrible business isnt it jordan peggy accompanied me back to the waiting room which was only a little less crowded than before davis had left ed sat with mark and with steven teague sister wasnt anywhere to be seen hello jordan steven teague said in his refined tone he was well groomed and dapper in gray corduroys and a charcoal tweed jacket your sisters in with chief moncrief so i offered to stay with mark i dont need nobody staying with me mark announced crossly he looked exhausted and i wondered what kind of gruesome toll the past couple of days was exacting i introduced peggy to steven hoping she wouldnt start a grilling session of her own she simply said she was glad to make his acquaintance and shook his hand franklin bedloe came out of the mens room down the hall and excusing herself peggy headed toward him i turned back to my nephew mark let me take you home theres no point in you waiting here youre dead on your feet well call you as soon as we know anything no uncle jordy he said with firmness not petulance i want to stay if im tired ill take a nap im not leaving till we hear about junebug i sat too weary to argue with him steven teague however was another story howd you know we were down here steven i asked he smiled tightly your sister called me she was concerned about how your family would handle this latest difficulty i offered to come down and see if i could be of assistance he glanced at mark whose lips were pressed together in tension mark doesnt want to chat right now though i appreciate your concern for mark marks been through a horrible ordeal steven ruffled his patients hair mark stood suddenly i want a doughnut or a muffin uncle jordy will you come down to the cafeteria with me i lumbered to my feet my body crying out for sleep time alone with mark sounded good for some reason the tailored sureness of steven teague irritated the hell out of me especially since hed refused to answer all of junebugs questionsand now junebug might be the killers latest victim mark ambled along beside me quietly until we got to the cafeteria i offered to buy him breakfast he got a glass of orange juice and an enormous muffin studded with blueberries he kept glancing toward the cafeteria entrance as he ate i watched him munch down the muffin and drain the glass of orange juice youre handling all this well mark yeah he asked i guess im worried about mom what do you mean did she love dad or not id expected a discussion about junebug trey was still tender territory thats a hard question i rubbed my chin its probably safe to say that she loved himthe him that she marriedbut she didnt love what he did she didnt love the man that left her and left you he was silent and emboldened by exhaustion i went on your father was a very good man in many ways he was my closest friend growing up but he left you and your mother and the rest of us without a word or a reason thats cowardly mark and i never understood it because i didnt think your father was a coward he looked up at me with inkdark eyes bloodshot with fatigue for the first time in a long while i looked at marks face he stood on the verge of manhood now the peachy sheen of whiskers starting along the jawline his adams apple becoming more prominent in his thin throat his voice vaulting through fee gymnastics of change and the first light in his eyes that perhaps he knew a vast and frightening world lay waiting he tore off a chunk of muffin and rolled it into a doughy ball between his fingers i think i know who killed dad he said i found my voice after a brief search excuse me who well scott told me he overheard something his mama and her uncle dwight were saying shed been talking about how she hadnt wanted to come back to live in mirabeau well i would think not what with all of treys family here and listen again uncle jordy she said come back to mirabeau shed been here before her uncles from here mark i explained patiently im sure she visited here before yeah she did mark said she said that she didnt want to be here because of ed dickensheets ed good lord what does he have to do with it and why didnt you say something before mark shuffled his feet under the table avoiding my stare me and scott dont got no proof and eds a friend of yours and a friend of moms i dont think he could kill anybody but scott sure thinks he did i breathed deep did scott say what had gone on between his mom and ed mark shook his head but i bet he was her boyfriend she looks like she might have been pretty once i tried to jog down memory lane id thought nola kinnards face was familiar for the most fleeting of instants when shed introduced herself in the library i sure dont remember ed dating a girl named nola maybe it was when you were at rice did he go off to school he stayed here and took some courses over at bavary junior college i said slowly then he went to st edwards over in austin but he got thrown out he partied too much and his grades bottomed out so he came back and started working at kbav i looked at mark again the earnestness in his face this was clutching at shadows mark this is ridiculous ive known ed dickensheets my whole life and he wouldnt ever kill a soul much less your father besides ed wouldnt have a motive right i told myself happily married to a bossy elvis impersonator and her colonel parker mother wanda and ivalou were a potent combination to set a man straying to an old girlfriend why hadnt ed mentioned to me that he knew nola kinnard marks jaw set alls im saying is what scott said he thinks ed killed dad he shook his dark head scott hasnt thought it out though i mean if he thinks ed killed dad to be with nola it hasnt occurred to him that nola could have killed dad to be with ed i did not get to see junebug the doctors didnt want many visitors and i wasnt about to try to usurp barbara moncrief or my sister i left a message for sister that i was headed home and left i took mark home turned him over to clo and ordered him to bed for some badly needed sleep tomorrow was his fathers funeral and hed need his strength i sorely ached for a nap myself but i knew rest would be elusive stopping by the sitaspell i ate with candace the breakfast bachelorandwidower crowd was sparse shed get much more business at lunch smudges darkened the skin beneath her pretty eyes she didnt mention my breakdown last night and i was grateful shed already eaten and she sipped coffee while i wolfed down a cheese omelette hash browns grits and toast smeared with plum preserves i slurped coffee and made a face good lord flavored coffee i dont think mirabeaus quite ready for that its hazelnut and theyll develop a taste for it i could see candace was still on her diversifythecuisine crusade if sister didnt get back to work at the cafe soon itd be the sitaspell sushi bar or bait shop depending on your opinion of raw fish as an entree candace you are not going to get a fellow in a fishing cap to quaff down hazelnut coffee oh really whats that on your head ace i removed my mirabeau bees baseball cap with a smile we were bantering like it was a normal morning i tried to remind myself it was only seventytwo hours since id sat in this same booth watching wanda do her elvis impersonation in the street while poor ed hung their pitiable sign it seemed a decade ago candace surprised me with a kiss on my forehead and i updated her on junebugs condition she frowned the shootings are all anyone in the cafes been talking about speaking of gossip quietly i told her of marks suspicions of ed dickensheets oh thats crazy she said eds devoted to that wife of his i dont see what he sees in wanda but if hes willing to keep that witch ivalou as a motherinlaw it must be love and even if ed killed trey why would he kill clevey maybe were dealing with two killers i shook my head that occurred to me but then how do you explain what scott overheardthe heated discussion between clevey and trey there was something going on between those two and now theyre both dead you cant dismiss what scott heard and the message written in treys blood so how do you explain junebugs shooting hes been investigating cleveys death while franklin bedloe investigates treys death maybe junebug got too closefound some information the killer didnt want him to have the killer decided to eliminate him candace ran a hand through her thick mane of hair now what franklinll find out who the hells behind this and lock him up forever junebugll get better well bury clevey and trey and try to get on with our lives i poured milk in my too fancy coffee and watched the white cloudy swirl and then maybe you and i can take a nice long trip far away from all this im wornout and i want to be alone with you her smile was tender and sly get me alone and you will be wornout thats a promise maybe the bahamas out of my wallets league what about galveston well talk i could foot a trip to the bahamas candace had money aplenty from her family but i didnt want her doling out cash for us foolish male pride i suppose but no one ever accused me of lacking that particular virtue well talk i said smiling at her galveston wasnt at all bad id just convince her of that i got to the library and savored the quiet of a monday morning since were open saturdays were closed mondays i like when its just the books and me i headed for the back issues of the mirabeau mirror we havent gone to microfilm yet although i have repeatedly begged the city council for the money and so the chronicle of life in mirabeau still exists in paper form i decided to start my search in august two decades back the mirror comes out once a week but i remembered theyd done a special edition in the immediate aftermath of hurricane althea i started with that yellowing issue three dead in corpus christi one dead in victoria two dead in mirabeau one dead in la grange all due to twisters or flash flooding those merciless twin bridesmaids of hurricanes althea had cut a brutal swath up from the defenseless gulf coast through the river lands between houston and austin there was a main article on the aftermath of the killer storm then separate articles on each of the mirabeau dead the first casualty had been an elderly man on the outskirts of town killed when his ramshackle trailer disintegrated in a smaller twisters path the second article was longer possibly because the death was more tragic rennie clifton was only sixteen a school picture of her smiled out from the newsprint her hair straightened and dark her smile wide and appealing her eyes beautiful and compelling and intelligent i had never seen rennie alive so the picture was the only fragment of her days i could compare against the empty shell wed found in the woods the county coroner ruled shed been killed by a blow to the head probably from flying debris propelled at gods own speed by the violent winds the article outlined how she had been found in the woods near the foradory farm a somber picture of us six boys was below the text since wed found the body we all look like weve had the stuffing scared out of us except trey who always maintained a cool demeanor anywhere near a camera clevey ranked a quote on how frightened hed been you see scary things out in a storm like that but we never dreamed wed find a body i kept reading the story rennie had been a student at mirabeau high where she participated in h and the student yearbook her teachers described her as quiet intense about the subjects she was interested in a girl with a future she worked parttime at the mirabeau florist and was described as a good worker by her employer ivalou purcell my eyes froze on the last two words ivalou purcell who i have mentioned i dont care much for was eds motherinlaw shes bossy nosy manhungry and just generally unpleasant i remembered the avid interest shed shown during sisters fight with trey at the shivers house id never had any idea that rennie clifton worked for ivalou purcell i scanned the rest of the article rennie was survived by her mother thomasina clifton who cleaned houses her father ernest clifton had been killed in vietnam the final sentence mentioned services at the ebenezer baptist church on aldrus street her funeral a sharp memory made me wince my mother had insisted that we go id felt like an interloper a blondheaded greeneyed boy amidst all those dark faces the church smelled of flowers and sweat the fury of althea had scraped the sky clean and the day they buried rennie was cloudless and clear i remembered mrs clifton as a large woman who bore her sorrow in silence i remembered my mother making me hand a flower to mrs clifton and her nearly crushing me in a kind embrace another woman apparently one of rennies grandmothers had wailed lamentations like a woman possessed i didnt try to give her a flower i leaned back rubbing my chin howand whyhad that girls death come back to haunt us what if i was entirely off track what if rennies death had nothing to do with the carnage visited on our lives i closed my eyes casting back into my memories for someone who might have a terrible grudge against our group of friends i sat in silence had we been unthinkingly cruel to some kid that harbored the deepest of grudges had we done some innocent act to nurture hatred in a hidden heart no rogue or villain presented themselves for inspection our lives had been delightfully dull free of illwishers best i thought to concentrate on the strongest possibility than to idly search for nonsensical explanations i began sorting through papers from the weeks previous and subsequent to rennies death mirabeau was just as boring then as it is now i perused articles on the city councils eternal squabbles the drowning of a skier on lake bonaparte a picture of hart quadlander with a prizewinning horse and the visit of a jowly congressman to give a speech i was reading a paper dated three weeks after rennies death when i turned a page and a twentyyearsyounger version of steven teague stared back at me his lips splayed into the same half smile hed given me and eula mae and mark when we spoke to him there was a short article underneath free clinic closes dr edward barent and steven teague announce the closing of the mirabeau free clinic on mayne street effective september dr barent a general practitioner said that federal cutbacks are forcing the clinics closure the mirabeau free clinic opened barely two months ago funded primarily through private donations and government grants dr barent refused to comment on any further reason why the clinic could not remain in budget mr teague a psychotherapist with a socialwork background was unavailable for comment the rest of the article went on about how rural areas suffered the most in federal cutbacks but that since indigent services were already available at mirabeau memorial residents should not expect much curtailment of free care i didnt care much about curtailment of free services at the moment i was just remembering when id met steven teague at cleveys moms house and hed said hed just moved to mirabeau not that hed lived and worked here before but new to town perhaps he hadnt wanted to mention that hed worked for a failed enterpriseor perhaps he had something to hide hed been living here when rennie died hed come back and we had two murders i started folding the paper when i heard a loud tapping at the window and i nearly jumped out of my skin having three friends shot since friday morning will do that to you i was suddenly conscious of how very alone i was in the library if id been mark id have been scared to death ed dickensheets stood at the library doors haggard and tired i paused on the other side of the glass i was alone with someone my nephew alleged had a motive to kill trey i felt a little tremor of fear then dismissed it id known ed my whole life id be damned if id let myself be scared by a friend a sudden thought occurred that maybe ed had come straight from the hospitalwith bad news i forgot my fears unlocked the door and yanked it open junebug i asked no change can i come in i stepped aside and regarded ed who was not a regular library patron were closed and if you ever gave me any business youd know that i said with a teasing tone another quaver of uncertainty had hit me as soon as i opened my mouth and i was determined to banish it with banter i also felt sick relief that he wasnt the bearer of bad tidings ed forced a smile to his worn face hed always been the smallest of us and now he was bent with fatigue i didnt think it was just the exhausting effect of recent days ed lived a life i couldnt endure dealing with wandas eccentricities and odd schemes enduring a motherinlaw like ivalou who could test the patience of several saints trying to launch a business that had the life expectancy of ice on a warm summer day and people say i have a tough home life its nothing compared with eds i know the librarys closed butthead but you got a minute for a friend he asked sure i said you want some coffee i considered locking the doors behind us but decided against it no reason to really i told myself ed nodded and i went to the little kitchen in the back and revved up the pot when i came back he was ambling around the library like a tourist in a museum pausing to examine the shelves the posters the magazines on the shelves on the periodical table i froze i hadnt put up the paper id been perusing it was still laid out on a table ed didnt seem inclined to notice it much though as he took the plasticencased latest issue of sports illustrated down and began idling through it dont suppose you have playboy he asked while reading sorry the city council just wont approve every request i make i folded the paper without hurry and tucked it back in a desk for some instinctual reason i didnt want ed to know i was casting an eye back twenty years i headed to the back to check on the progress of the coffee when i returned with two steaming cups ed collapsed in one of the easy chairs in the magazine section his legs splayed out he was rubbing his forehead im tired jordy he took the offered cup and sipped cautiously at it not bad we got the worst coffee in creation down at kbav whats up ed geez cant a fellow come see an old buddy he answered rather sharply i seem to be running short on friends with each passing day hot anger flushed my face thats not funny ed i dont mean to be funny i told you i wanted to talk at cleveys mamas house but your sister came and made that scene and i didnt get my chance he was righthe had mentioned he wanted a private chat id forgotten in the avalanche of events the past two days had brought i forgot ive had a lot on my mind you aint the only one ed said slurping his coffee again its about clevey i eased down onto the ratty couch the city council doesnt believe in buying new couches until the old ones disintegrate what about clevey this stays between you and me okay you always had more sense than the rest of us and i need some advice but i dont want this blabbed all over town okay ed he took a fortifying breath i dont wanna say this but i think clevey was a crook excuse me the cup stopped halfway to my mouth ed despite his fatigue got up and paced he was planning on buying into kbav as a partner you know how much money that takes i set my cup down the steam still roiling past the rim howd you know this he told me about a week ago said once he had a vote in station business hed see about making me general manager ed shrugged i didnt buy it at firstyou know how he was one for fibbing and jokingbut he insisted he was serious when i asked him where he was gonna get the money he said hed had an uncle die out in louisiana and leave him a ton of loot but he didnt want anyone to know he was going to give some to local charities and use the rest to buy his partnership i didnt say anything immediately clevey had a windfall of money good and bad steven had said giving some of the money to charity and the rest for himself i suddenly wondered who stood to inherit cleveys money now that he was gone he probably hadnt made a will he had an exwife who lived in little rock now but no children ed continued but there never was an uncle in louisiana i askeddiplomatically mind youcleveys relatives when we were all at his mamas house that story of his was pure fiction so where was he getting the money from why are you telling me all this ed he studied his coffee cup look i told junebug all this when he started his investigation it bugs me that money coming out of nowhere i thought youd maybe know since you spent so much more time around him than i did i havent really i said remorse tingeing my voice id been weighed down with my own problems and i hadnt made much time for clevey in the past months had he wanted to turn to his old friends for help the hearsay of his last days presented a confusing collage seeking help from steven teague bitterly telling trey that revenge would be sweet claiming financial independence to ed i paused was there a connection between whatever revenge scheme hed tried to get trey involved in and this alleged windfall of money but who on earth would trey or clevey want revenge on his life was like a coin flipping in the air the dual sides of head and tails flashing in the sunlight his vicious demands to trey his announced charity donation to ed his lying about where this alleged money came from his seeking help for his problems i dont know what to tell you ed i thought i knew clevey i cant claim that anymore i repeated what scott kinnard had told me about cleveys heated discussion with trey ed shook his head and i saw a flicker of fear in his eyes and they both end up dead ed shivered and massaged his temples that scares the piss out of me scott claimed trey was resisting whatever clevey was proposing trey didnt want to get involved i leaned down toward ed what does that suggest to you who could he have been getting money from how could trey have been involved did clevey ever mention anything about being in touch with trey to you no i puzzlement made him frown well not that he was in touch with trey but he and i went to have beers a few weeks back and treys name came up i dont remember howsome old story we were dusting off clevey said hed been the last person in town to see trey before he left he laughed about it laughed about it what was so funny embarrassment colored his cheeks i suspected hed wandered onto ground hed just as soon surrender i dont know i asked and he got tightlipped he just said treyd left and blown his chance to live easy the rest of his life i felt cold in the fluorescent flicker of the library lights why didnt you mention this before it never came up jesus he was drunk and you know what clevey was like ed no i dont neither do you he was more of a stranger than any of us are ready to admit look i just told you what hed told me i thought you might be able to make sense of it if you cant thats fine id just as soon not discuss clevey and trey anymore he picked up his scruffy denim jacket prepared to leave i grabbed his arm have you been by to see nola kinnard yet he jerked as though id poked him in the ribs no i heard she was an old girlfriend of yours that came as quite a surprise you certainly hadnt mentioned it ed slipped into salesman mode unruffled by my blitzkreig so i havent seen her in years i didnt even know she was back in town i recalled what mark had said regarding nola she didnt want to be back in mirabeau because of ed dickensheets why was nola afraid of him or was that merely a cover maybe she was afraid of wandaalways a distinct possibility too many questions my head was starting to spin i needed sleep okay ed i shrugged i didnt mean anything by it he softened nola and i were a hot item once but that was years ago ive wanted to go by and visit pay my respects about trey but ithings didnt end well between us i didnt know how to see herhow to say i was sorry for everything she went through and i dont think wanda would take too kindly to me calling on exgirlfriends whatever ed i stood and stretched but we still dont know where clevey was planning on getting this money well jordyhe fidgeted againif hes left the money to his mama do you think we could talk to her maybe shed be interested in investing in the station or maybe in my elvis shop now i saw why i was eds new confidante id always been closest to mrs shivers she and i had a rapport that went back decades ed wanted me in his corner to get his hands on cleveys alleged fortune oh ed for gods sake her boys just been murdered this isnt the time to hit up the poor woman about investments leave me out okay okay his smile was immediate and conciliatory but think about it all right maybe you can suggest when a good time would be im sure shed listen to you jordy an acrid distaste permeated my mouth suddenly i just wanted ed out of the library out of my sight okay fine ill talk to her with you id say anything now to get him to go he saw the dislike in my tone the turning away of my face his own countenance set in stone fine talk to you later call me if you hear any news and he was gone i sank down in the chair staring down at my feet feeling dirty as though ed had spat on my shoes in leaving he didnt give a rats ass about clevey or trey he was only worried about the money clevey had claimed to have i wondered if those were crocodile tears he shed at cleveys wake so much for friendship choked by the root of all evil some old white folks still call the far south side of the railroad tracks in mirabeau the colored part of town i dont bother to correct them because they arent going to edit their language and although the name may offend for the most part the unofficial segregation still holds true a few blacks have moved riverward into the more prosperous north side of town but most descendants of slave and sharecropper that call mirabeau home still live in the flatlands trailer homes and small houses dot the landscape some homes immaculately maintained others choking in weedy neglect the cottage i pulled up to was tidy and neat the small lawn freshly raked and a mound of damp leaves waiting to be bagged by the porch a giant live oak towered above the eaves like a sentinel a tire swing rotated slowly in the wind a rusted flamingo leaning precariously in a wintersere flower bed gawked at me i stared at the painted name on the mailbox clifton id come here on a whim and now i was feeling like an intruder these people had already suffered agony once i had no desire to reopen the old wound of having lost a daughter but this i told myself was where it all started rennie clifton was the key quite possibly to why clevey and trey had died and for the attack on junebug i forced myself out of the car and up to the porch i could hear the tinny rattle of television applause on the other side of the screen door someone was home presumably i knocked silence for a moment then a highpitched creaky voice beckoned come in the door was unlocked and i opened it gingerly mrs clifton the room was dark small and cluttered the dim latemorning sky wasnt offering much additional illumination but the glow of the tv lit the room in staticky bonecolored light i could see a worn blue sofa draped with a colorful crocheted afghan a scattering of newspaper across the carpeted floor walls decorated with painted bible scenes and a large dark woman nestled in an easy chair not largehuge her girth wedged her into the cushions her clothes stretched taut across a globe of a stomach her fingers pudgy with fat rustled idly in the emptied papers of a box of chocolates her eyes regarded me without the slightest bit of fear who you she asked her voice a squeak i dont want no magazine subscriptions im not a salesman mrs clifton my name is jordan poteet do you remember me i flipped on the overhead light she squinted against the sudden brightness like a mole venturing out after a winters nap in the ceiling lights glare i could see she was well over two hundred pounds her face a melon shape of tissue smears of chocolate outlined her lips she blinked at me names familiar she said her voice shifting in slow recognition i havent seen you in many years i started but she didnt let me finish yes i remember you you were one of those boys that found my girl yes maam i wondered if i could talk with you for a minute she wasnt looking at me but at the boy id been yes you were the pretty blond one gave me a flower at rennies funeral and aint you grown up to be a handsome fellow i felt a hot blush creep up my neck thank you maam take a seat she gestured toward an afghanshrouded rocking chair saw the candy stains on her hands and coughing pulled a tissue from the crevice of her cleavage and wiped her hands and her mouth pardon me i was just having a little snack while watching my show she pointed to the tv you ever watch the reverend coleman i glanced at the television and the strutting highhaired evangelist that shone on the screen a number at the bottom promised prayer in return for a donation no i havent hes a good man i dont send him any money but i sure enjoy hearing him preach her eyes intelligently shrewd were back on me what can i do you for mr poteet you like something to drink a drink sounded agreeable my throat had dried like an autumn leaf yes please maam thatd be nice you dont mind getting it yourself do you i got some koolaid in the fridge i dont got no cokes or tea cause my daughter aint doing my shopping till tomorrow less you want water to sip no koolaid sounds fine i stood cups are above the sink i stepped out of her den around the corner to the kitchen it was clean but cluttered a stack of rinsed dishes in the sink a fridge covered with vegetableshaped magnets that pinned pictures of smiling grandchildren to the metal i found two glasses and the pitcher of cherry koolaid i carried the glasses and pitcher back to the den and poured us each a drink thank you she said sipping at the punch i tried to keep from making a face it tasted disgustingly sweet as though it had more sugar than powdered mix in it i forced myself to swallow i i didnt know where to begin i guess youre surprised to see me i took a deep breath as if i were diving for the cool bottom of lake bonaparte and plunged in thomasina clifton watched me her head tilted to one side with curiosity i wanted to discuss rennie her death why have you heard about the two murders in town since friday thomasina clifton nodded yeah on the radio those murdered men were also two of the boys who found your daughters body her eyes narrowed in the folds of flesh but she remained silent clevey shivers and trey slocum clevey was on the staff of the mirabeau mirror i suspect he was writing a story on rennie after he was killed the police found notes on rennies case old newspaper clippings hed hidden them behind his toilet i dont understand why i dont know did clevey shivers ever come and talk to you about your daughter she didnt answer at first and i took another gulp of the dreadful koolaid wondering if itd rot my teeth he came by a couple of months ago he was writing an anniversary piece on the hurricane he asked me all about how much i missed rennie she offered the box of chocolates to me i declined she popped one in her mouth and chewed thoughtfully aint that the stupidest thing you ever heard asking a mother if she misses her child that clevey fellow just kept saying how sorry he was about her dying did you ever think that maybe her death wasnt an accident i asked i know the coroner said it was i know what that coroner man said she answered gruffly she glanced at the pitcher pour me some more would you my throats dry i refilled her glass she sipped rennie was trouble then and shes trouble now that seemed a heartless way to refer to your dead child but mrs cliftons voice was anything but callous mournful and bitter i sat again do you know why on earth she would have been out in the middle of a hurricane thomasina clifton didnt answer me right away when she did her voice was lower in pitch like shed chalked her throat i dont know finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow she was gone a lot of the time without explanation i couldnt control her easy it wasnt an answer it was her own grief speaking i stayed silent maybe she was gatherin flowers for that lady she worked for mrs clifton shifted in her chair the premise was ridiculous but it was an opening and i went for it ivalou purcell how did rennie get along with her not well that purcell woman was jealous of rennie jealous of how young and pretty a girl she was i thought of ivalous sour face the pinched way she looked at people envy seemed right up her alley could you be more specific you got to understand what kind of girl rennie was mrs clifton said sipping from her sugared drink headstrong did what she pleased and everbody else be damned lord she was a handful to me willful at times if she didnt get what she wanted and what did she want i shouldnti shouldnt talk about my child this way she stared up at a picture on the tv an old grainy color photo of herself with three young girls thats rennie in the middle my other girls still live here in town theyse married with they own kids now i dont want to talk about rennie i knelt by her and took her hand mrs clifton i dont want to dredge up unpleasant memories for you im sorry if i have but two men have died a thirds been shot and i think it might have to do with your daughters death please wont you help me before someone else gets hurt her ample fingers closed convulsively over mine her bottom lip trembled she was pregnant when she died mrs clifton whispered i begged them to keep it out of the papers i used to clean for old dud schiller who was the editor then he kept it out of the news she was only six weeks along my baby was pregnant she began to cry short heaving sobs i held her hand and rubbed her shoulder till she was still im so sorry i said it mustve been a horrible shock that she was pregnant not so much as you think she was always stringin some boy along thomasina clifton mopped at her tears that was part of the reason that ivalou purcell hated her so she thought rennie was after her daughters beau wandas boyfriend it didnt make sense until i remembered that wanda was about four years older than ed that distinction hardly matters in your thirties but when ed and i were twelve wanda would have been rennies age yeah a football player that wanda was sweet on named glenn wilson he died a few years back in a car wreck he was seeing rennie secret like she thought i didnt know but i did she sniffed a white boy and a black girl couldnt really have dated out in the open then but i saw em kissin on the porch one night god it made me mad i tried to tell her she had no business datin a white boy but she didnt pay me no heed she always went for fellows she thought she couldnt have i remembered glenn wilson hed been a big likable guy easygoing popular in town hed played football for sam houston state and married a college sweetheart i even remembered hearing about when he and his wife had been killed three years ago driving back to houston after the labor day weekend everyone said what a terrible shame it was had he gotten rennie clifton pregnant had wanda or ivalou found out how would they and why still was she out in the middle of that storm did you know rennie was pregnant before she died mrs clifton shook her head no she didnt tell me i guess she knew though her period was always real regular maybe shed seen a doctor maybei remembered the clinic did she ever mention a fellow named steven teague mrs clifton furrowed her face in thought not that i recall whos he a psychotherapist who lived here around the time rennie died she shook her head dont recognize the name rennie was a handful but she sure werent crazy i knelt by her again did you ever think that rennie was murdered mrs clifton she took several deep breaths i didnt want to i wanted to believe it was just god callin her home when they told me she was with child i thought that glenn had killed her when hed found out but that didnt seem right he wasnt the kind of boy to kill that wanda though she left her sentence unfinished there wasnt no evidence shed been murdered the coroner said it was an accident i couldnt argue i didnt was there anyone else you suspected i asked no no one else wanted to hurt my girl she didnt have many friends she kept to herself she worked at miz purcells and she helped me out some with my work she helped you with your housecleaning yeah she sometimes helped if i had a big house to clean who were you working for when rennie died she scratched her chins and began rattling off names grayson kucerak hubbert montgomerynames that didnt connect to the case i didnt bite my lip till she mentioned hart quadlander i parked the car in my driveway noting automatically that sisters car was still gone and neither candaces nor clos car was there i only hoped that mama hadnt been left to her own devices i rubbed my eyes id left thomasina clifton forlorn with her oversweet koolaid and a load of terrible memories to mull over i was a jerk no doubt about it the limp body of rennie clifton rose through the currents of my memory as clearly as when id first seen her corpse and i tried to force her out of my mind treys body replaced hers and then cleveys face smiling in a rictus of death the gagging cherry taste of the koolaid came back into my mouth and i swallowed hard i needed food and sleep and some quiet to think i thought id get those restoratives right away until i opened the front door and saw my house had been ransacked your tie is crooked i said straightening the dark knot at marks throat does it matter he squirmed under my ministrations yes it does matter you want to look nice for your fathers funeral no onell care he wouldnt have mark twisted away from me knocking his tie further askew i surrendered and watched him storm off hed passed from pretending that he hadnt seen his fathers life leak away on that cold kitchen floor to anger toward treyand toward the world and i friend to his father bore the brunt of most of marks wrath the back door slapped against the frame as he bolted onto the porch i settled on the couch the house had returned to a semblance of order after id found it in disarray yesterday afternoon at first id figured wed been burglarized but nothing was missing drawers were pulled out papers scattered books yanked from shelves pictures wrenched off the wall a hurried frantic search had been made mama first in my thoughts turned out to be enjoying a visit to candaces cafe with clo mark had been out for a long walk with scott kinnard i found that highly interesting but mark volunteered no details i didnt pry if those boys could be friends share memories of the man theyd both wanted for a father i wouldnt interfere no one had been home no one had been hurt id called the police and reported the breakin apparently accomplished by knocking out a pane of the backdoor window and had started a desultory cleanup by the time sister got home a good nights sleep had done wonders for my constitution now i reclined on the couch watching mark stare out at the yard sister came downstairs dressed in a black skirt a white blouse and a black jacket she didnt have a proper black dress and i felt a pang that maybe i dont provide enough for her and putting in her earrings her eye remained discolored shed applied makeup to the bruise but a purplish half circle still shone beneath the cream not much makeup is going to do for that shiner i observed she didnt break stride as she went to the window to watch mark i tried to hide it but im stuck with it ill wear dark glasses who hit you sister i might as well try again i told you no one she glanced at me in irritation i know youre lying and i know you were at treys house the morning of the murder i stood i wasnt going to stand there and smile like a wimp at her prevarication her jaw worked what on earth are you talking about i found a shred of fabric on a nail on the kinnards back steps right after trey died it was from those batik print pants i gave you you were wearing them that morning her shoulders gave a slow heave as if creaking out from under a heavy burden sister turned away from me to look out at mark and what did you do with this scrap give it to junebug is that why he took himself off the case no i hid it maybe thats what our burglar was looking for i dont think so no one knows i have it and what are you going to do with it when were you planning on giving it to the police my throat felt dry i thought when i confronted her with my shred of evidence that there would be protestations of innocence pleadings denials possibly a full explanationanything except this calm discussion she was implacably set on her own unknown course and nothing i said swayed her for gods sake tell me did you kill him with quivering hands she put on her sunglasses its nice to know your own brother thinks youre capable of murdering someone she turned away and went outside on the porch putting her arms around her boy they held each other lost in their own world of bereavement and betrayal i stood and watched them until it was time to go like nearly everyone i dont like funerals although for some reason i find the mirabeau cemetery peaceful and oddly reassuring perhaps i take comfort in knowing where my bones will lie mirabeaus new episcopal church stgeorgesontheriver had been finished just a few months ago to much fanfare it was the first new church in town in fifteen years we local anglicans whod been raised in churches in bavary and la grange took great pleasure in its opening although clevey had strayed from the flock truda shivers had remained a steadfast episcopalian trey although baptized did not have a steady faith according to nola since hed been married in the episcopal church a service at st georges seemed appropriate for him as well the church not large to begin with was packed the celebrant father greene preceded the pallbearers wheeling the caskets into the church the families of the dead men followed like hushed sheep my arms around mark and sister i walked down the aisle with them faces leaping out at me from the crowd davis his wife cayla their son bradley looking awkward and fidgety in a suit ed and wanda who had fortunately decided to bypass her elvis regalia ivalou purcell frowning at us steven teague a look of professional sorrow on his face standing with eula mae one corner held my library contingent of itasca florence and even gretchen and i felt touched they were here candaces parents sat in a row near the family reserve junebugs clan was absent still maintaining their ceaseless vigil at the hospital when we settled into our seats the front left pews were full of shiverses from near and far while the right front pews held sister mark me assorted relatives of ours candace hart quadlander and the kinnards i saw nola shoot sister a particularly venomous glance at one point but sister didnt notice nola caught me looking and defiance crossed her face she stared down into her lap a lock of loose brown hair dangling over her forehead i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord father greene began as we joined in prayer books in hand those not used to the service fumbling to the correct page i mumbled along trying to convince myself i was actually saying these words for trey and clevey my throat felt moltenthis was the beginning of goodbye o god whose mercies cannot be numbered accept our prayers on behalf of thy servants clevey and trey and grant them an entrance into the land of light and joy in the fellowship of thy saints father greene implored and i thought trey will find the fellowship of saints quite dull a cousin of cleveys rose and stepped to the pulpit to read the usual passages from isaiah and lamentations the lord is good unto them that wait for him he said and i thought of minutes stretched into hours into days into years that we had waited for trey mark sat between sister and me my arm around him my hand on her shoulder she held her purse stiffly staring straight ahead ignoring both prayer book and bible her sunglasses hiding her marred face i couldnt see if tears moistened her eyes marks neck felt rigid against my arm i watched truda shivers she sat between her sisters her head held high she would see her son off in dignity i risked a glance over my shoulder hart quadlander had a comforting arm around nola kinnard who was dabbing at her tears with a wad of tissue and making snuffling noises scott held her hand and his eyes met mine oddly he smiled shyly then looked down again at his mothers lap it suddenly struck me that they had known an entirely different trey than i had a man with a family hed abandoned a past hed just as soon not acknowledge i wondered if he was happy with them or if he was ever lonesome for his own child when he played with scott or missed the soft press of his wifes arms when he hugged nola they were probably decent enough folks but i didnt think they were worthy substitutes for sister and mark i admit to personal bias hart caught me looking and i turned back toward the pulpit while psalms were read i thought again about what thomasina clifton had told me hart quadlander was one of her clients and she remembered at least one time when rennie had gone out to the quadlander farm to help her clean i wondered if he knew the girl or remembered her but then wouldnt trey have known her hed always maintained rennie was a stranger to him we stood for the gospel and were duly told that in our fathers house are many mansions i didnt pay much attention to the service having gone through it by rote too many times i felt guiltily glad sister and the shiverses had declined to have communion at the service before i knew it we were standing ready to continue the service with the committal at the grave sites we stepped out into kind sunshine a welcome break from the drizzly rains of the last several days cleveys burial came first i hung back from the crowd conscious of davis and his family near me i listened to the calming tones of father greene and tried not to think about the gaptoothed carrottop id grown up with who would lie moldering in that casket i started when the dirt hit the coffin slowly people walked toward their cars to head to the quadlander farm louis slocum treys father was buried there and wed arranged for trey to be buried next to his father louis slocum had been interred near the creekside oaks where hed gotten riproaring drunk so many nights i sometimes wondered if hed favored the quiet company of the leaves and the breeze and the trees more than of people he had teen terribly neglectful of trey and id always thought him a low fellow because of it now trey was coming home and would share his fathers company forever death conducts every final reunion we stood again by a grave the second ceremony seeming like an eerie echo of the first as though cleveys burial had been a dress rehearsal and treys was the true performance thou knowest lord father greene intoned for the second time that day the secrets of our hearts shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer the secrets of our hearts i glanced at sister with her terrible secret her bruised face a badge of deception why wouldnt she tell me the truth who could she be protecting candaces hand closed around mine and i squeezed it the sun shone bright the clouds having retreated to a bluishgray smudge near the horizon but the day was still chilly i saw mark shiver as father greene cast earth upon his fathers coffin mark did not look at his mother or at me he stared down into his fathers grave like it was some distant mirror candace leaned against me and i wrapped my arm around her feeling her comforting warmth this was the legitimate goodbye i thought the goodbye to trey was never said before because he walked away from us was he watching us now a slight smile on his face that his wife and his son were bitch a voice softly said barely breaking the drone of father greenes somnolent voice i had almost thought id imagined it until the word repeated harder more forcefully you bitch you killed him at one corner of the grave nola kinnard stood her hands clenched into fists her upswept overmoussed brown hair not moving in the breeze tears mottled her angry face she was too close to the edge of the grave and a rain of pebbles and muddy clods rained down on the casket nola for gods sake hart seized her arm and pulled her back from the open ground she wrenched free from him i cant stand here while the bitch that murdered him stands there and watches him put in the ground look at her look at her face scott seized his mothers arm and tried to hush her mom please dont dont we all know you did it you hit him you told him to stay away from your precious brat and when he didnt want to when he wanted to see his boy you killed him you killed him she broke into heaving sobs cradling scotts head in her arm as he struggled against her hart shot me a look of distress and tried to steer nola and scott away from the grave she jerked away from him releasing scott and launched herself at ed dickensheets burying her face against his shoulder embarrassed he held her awkwardly trying to stroke her hairsprayed helmet of hair in comfort wanda gaped at nola not knowing what to do under these funereal circumstances ivalou was more inventive yanking on nolas arm calling her a meanfaced little hussy in a sharp whisper i turned to my sister she stood statue still i couldnt see her eyes behind the midnight dark of her sunglasses mark pressed against her side watching the spectacle of nola with horror candace embraced sister from behind murmuring comfort i tried to speak but i couldnt those dark lenses were boring through me what was i supposed to say this morning id made the same suggestion although not quite so aggressively as nola nola perhaps realizing the focus of attention had shifted from her broke away from the redfaced ed shoved her way past an outraged ivalou and stormed toward sister i interceded hearing a dismayed father greene begging nola to calm down moving in front of her as she stepped over the corner of treys grave listen here you just stop this right now i demanded and she slapped me once smartly across the face i seized her hand and she slapped me with her other i seized it as well my cheeks red as christmas cherries and i shook nola in fury stop it shut up i screamed in her face and she wrenched away from me trying to kick me in the shins she would have toppled into the grave if i hadnt had hold of her suddenly davis was on one side of me hart on the other pulling nola away she flayed me with a look of pure poison as i released her and hart hurried her toward the house she stumbled once but did not look back at us steven teague followed at a respectful distance probably ready to provide vast amounts of psychotherapy shock silenced the crowd except for a sudden screaming keen as bradley foradory sank to the ground that candace offered as i poured her a cup of coffee was a hell of a service she maneuvered me gently against the kitchen counter and planted a kiss on my cheek i dont believe youve sustained any permanent damage of course a more thorough investigation will be called for later i smiled at her teasing her sweet way of coaxing me back toward everyday life i needed days empty of tragedy and sorrow i needed days with candace time with her time with my family i returned her kiss tasting the spot between her eyes ill look forward to that sweetheart i fetched a second cup down from the cabinet and filled it with fresh coffee let me take this to sister see how shes feeling the living room was finally empty the mourners had returned to both our house and the shivers place for the traditional postfuneral gathering to eat and drink and converse in hushed tones our house was undoubtedly the greater social attraction no one had called truda a murderer during the funeral id forced myself to maintain a placid air as people crowded and jostled each other on our porches in our living room cayla and davis foradory had phoned their regrets in we just cant make it jordy cayla said in a forced tone poor bradley was just so upset by the funeral its best he stay home you do understand dont you of course cayla may i speak to davis for a moment she coughed well davis is getting bradley settled how about i have him call you when things calm down sure cayla please give my best to arlene and mark and truda of course i hung up the phone slowly feeling the tinge of unease i always felt after talking to cayla bradley foradory might be retarded but he was hardly highstrung generally he was a happy fellow smiling and likable yet the funeral had thumped some horribly raw nerve to set him screaming and crying like that what was wrong with bradley although bradleys outburst generated a certain amount of talk it couldnt hold a candle to nolas dramatics id caught ivalou purcell murmuring to her daughter well arlene showed more restraint with that nola than she did with trey she didnt hit her id forced myself not to stop and chew the old bitch out there had been enough unpleasant scenes today now sister sat alone with mama in the living room mama had not attended the funeral but clo had dressed her in a dark robe always one to get an early start on the holidays mama was humming the tune of away in a manger which shed plucked somehow from the quicksand of her memory sister didnt appear to be noticing still wearing her dark jacket and skirt her sunglasses finally off her hair a blonde tousle around her shoulders i sat down and handed the fee coffee she accepted it wordlessly took a sip and said i have to get down to the hospital and see how junebugs doing dont you think youve done enough for today i said im sure barbara or the doctors will call us if theres a change you need some rest there have been two men in my adult life ive loved jordy i buried one today and the other one may not make it out of the hospital i dont think i can sleep any youll make yourself sick sister spare me the worriedbrother act you practically accused me of killing trey this morning im sorry i dont believe you killed him but i had to know for sure you still didnt answer my question she rubbed her eye i didnt kill him then tell me were you over there that morning fatigue had won out against her defenses yes all right i stopped by on my way to work even with it being a cold day i wore those stupid pants cause it gets hot in the kitchen and theyre comfortable what happened her voice took a distant tone as she spoke he was there alone he let me in said he was even glad to see me as long as i wasnt there to blacken his other eye she sipped at her coffee and closed her eyes oh he looked bad jordy youd seen him he was a shell of the man hed been hed had so much energy so much power in his body that man in the chair had nothing she shivered i apologized for hitting himand said i hoped he wasnt gonna press charges he laughed and i started to cry he said i looked wonderful to him he said hed missed me i took a long breath while she paused and what effect did all this sweet talk have she shook her head part of me wanted to belt him again part of me wanted to tell him to never darken our door part of me wanted to hold him stupid huh no i squeezed her shoulder he asked to see mark i explained i thought that was a bad idea that mark needed more time to get used to the idea of his father back in his life before he saw trey facetoface trey said i was stalling he begged jordy he begged to see mark and i kept saying no so whend you get the black eye sister paid me no heed i finally asked him why hed come home after all this timewhy hadnt he just stayed away he wouldnt look at me for a while then he said that hed finally stared death in the face and it had made him a man i said that was crazy and he said youd understand i eased back on the couch famous words from trey from the tree house itd been his argument for our foolishness that longago day so sister continued sniffing he said abandoning us was the most terrible mistake hed ever made he wanted to come home more times than he could count but he was too ashamed and he said he knew i wouldnt take him back and he was afraid mark would reject him it wasnt till after that bull nearly killed him that he decided to come home i didnt say anything i saw candace standing at the kitchen door tears in her eyes her fingertips on her lips sister looked up at the ceilingor perhaps past it toward god and heaven he said he still loved me hed never stopped loving me and he wanted to be a father to mark i told him it was impossible it could never be like it was before he pleaded with me and i ran out she started crying again i dont understand when did you get the black eye oh she said wiping tears away i handed her a tissue she dabbed at her eyes i stumbled when i fell down the stairs i hit my face sister got up and retreated to the kitchen she looked back at me now you know everything jordy happy if youll excuse me im going to get something to eat take a shower and go to the hospital she ducked past candace who regarded me with concern shell be okay jordy she just needs time i didnt say anything i just sat back down trey had neglected to tell sister the most important point of all just why had he so regretfully left mirabeau in the first place franklin bedloedrummed his pencil against his pad as i finished talking well youve been busy he said i couldnt tell quite yet if he was angry or not id invited him to stop by and when he arrived basically id spilled my guts what id found out from ed from scott from steven teague from thomasina clifton from hart the only item i omitted was that dogged bit of sisters pants shed told me what i believed was the truth about her seeing trey and there was no need to tell franklin about it at least in my judgment i could pinch a penny if i gave him a pound well we had been talking to mr teague about his treatment of mr shivers franklin began uncertainly then stopped i waited politely junebug had always told me franklin was a bright fellow with a future i hoped he was right but i wondered if having been shoved into the role of acting chief had overwhelmed him look i really wasnt trying to snoop franklin i know junebugs told you i have a propensity to stick my nose in i cant help it if information comes my way thats why im sharing it with you you do with it what you think best franklin jotted a final note and shut his book well all this is real interesting jordy but im not sure how it bears on the case especially the rennie clifton connection but that stuff you found in cleveys house we dont have an explanation for it yet he said calmly and im in the business of evidence not conjecture you havent shown me one shred of evidenceonly hearsay about both clevey and trey i opened my mouth to speak and shut it promptly he was right id built a house of cards and he was the wind then im sorry if ive wasted your time franklin i just feel so angry about what happened to junebug i thought jordy listen i do understand everyone at the stations determined were gonna catch this bastard i appreciate the information youve given us well take it from here he stood and we shook hands when i showed him to the door hart quadlanders truck was pulling into the driveway franklin gave hart a polite nod and drove off in his cruiser trouble with the police hart asked as i let him and scott in the door i helped them off with their coats and hung them on the pegs scott eyed mark nervously as i ushered them into the living room mark im sorry about my mom shes just really upset but she still shouldnt have said what she did scotts eyes held real apology i dont know what else to say im sorry she hit you jordy hows she doing i made myself ask i thought nola kinnard needed a good rest home but i wasnt about to suggest that in front of her son shes okay steven teague talked to her for a while and he got dr meyer to prescribe a tranquilizer for her hart squeezed marks shoulder it was unforgivable what she did at your fathers funeral mark i am terribly terribly sorry for the way nola behaved so is scott he wanted to come over and make amends i hope youll understand that nola is just very griefstricken i think shes going to be ashamed of herself when she has a little time to consider her actions mark shrugged it doesnt really matter to me what nola does she doesnt bother me none my mom shes not a bad person at all scott tried again and i could see the pain in his eyes he had to be horribly humiliated by nolas antics but you probably dont believe that mark shrugged again my moms done goofy things when shes upset uncle jordy says women are like that i did not i bristled i was glad candace wasnt around to hear that little divulgence anyhow just so everything could be cool i brought you this scott pulled a swiss army knife out of his pocket and held it out to mark like i said im sorry about all the fuss with my mom i hope you and i can still be friends mark blinked taken aback by scotts generosity finally he reached out took it and started a detailed examination of the gift wow its a nice one thanks youre welcome thank you scott thats very kind i said you want some pie mark offered slipping into the role of host and pocketing the knife scott nodded and the two boys headed off to the kitchen i sat down heavily after hart declined my offer of coffee im beat i told hart youre still hosting the kinnards hart shook his head i cant say i care much for nola scotts a good kid but that woman is a trial shes one of those ladies who doesnt quite know how to manage without a man in her life im afraid she mustve leeched onto poor trey shes already casting about for the next victim are you a candidate i asked boldly he laughed softly his voice richtimbred it was a good laugh the kind my dad had used hardly i made that clear to her right quick but shes sure sniffing around old ed dickensheets stupid of her to be chasing after a married man he says hes not interested i said would you be lord that womans a sight thats a shame scott seems rather lonely i think he needs a family and friends i was there when he found out about trey he took it like his heart had been ripped out i feel for the boy hart said but i imagine you wont have to concern yourself with him too much longer i dont think his mama will be staying in mirabeau if she doesnt land ed or some other fool as her next conquest may i ask you something entirely off the subject of nola he nodded do you remember a girl named rennie clifton i saw it in his face sudden shock at the names mention good lord yes that poor girl that died in the hurricane when you and trey were little boys her mama used to clean house for me what on earth has brought her name up jordy i postponed answering his question did you know her he shook his head not well i remember meeting her a couple of times when she came to help her mama out but i cant say i knew her better than to say hello to she didnt always come with thomasina why i just wondered if you remembered her her name came up when i was reminiscing with davis today talking about other tragedies our group of friends has faced i really surprise myself with my facility for fibbing sometimes its good i have an honest heart we were trying to remember who her friends were in town he shrugged fraid i never knew the young lady well enough to answer that speaking of davis what spooked his boy today at the funeral i dont know that certainly wasnt typical of bradley ive never seen him act that way death makes us all act odd jordy bradleys no exception maybe a boy with a delicate mind like his he just found two funerals overwhelming it sounded good but i wasnt convinced there was more to bradley foradorys dismayed scream than grief a call to sister at the hospital revealed no improvement in junebugs condition he was still breathing on his own his heart pumping stronglybut he was still asleep and wasnt waking up i wondered what wed do if he never roused it was a thought i didnt want to dwell on candace had gone to tend to business at the sitaspell and mark was upstairs watching television i fretted about him being alone but he seemed fine and i decided to respect his privacy i remembered after my daddy died id needed time alone intervals without wellmeaning folks hovering over me like flies swarming above honey i could hear the drone of the little blackandwhite tv in his room i felt restless despite my exhaustion and i opened a cold beer and paced around the living room someone had broken in and searched my house for something damned important to them and i thought i knew what it was one event as far as i could see had triggered two murders and the attack on junebug treys arrival home regardless of whatever side issues might be attached to this case treys homecoming seemed the hub that the entire case turned upon the firecracker thrown into the crowd to stampede them into action so the ransacking of the house had to be related to treys return the only link i could see was scotts shocking claim that trey corresponded with mama the people present when scott made that announcement were my family candace eula mae quiff wanda dickensheets hart quadlander steven teague and bradley foradory the only reason i could think of for a burglary where nothing was taken was that someone was looking for mamas correspondence with treyperhaps because a letter of treys might have very well mentioned why he left mirabeau and that secret too long in shadow and threatening to be brought to light might have been the reason for his and cleveys deaths so i reasoned our burglar had to be one of those presentor someone theyd told with a vested interest in rinding the letters bradley might have mentioned scotts news to his parents wanda could have told her mother ivalou or her husband ed i doubted that hart would have told nola that hed brought scott to our house but perhaps scott had finally told her about his burgeoning friendship with mark it didnt do much to weed out the suspect list suspect list i thought in some disbelief because not only had i been prepared to believe that my sister had a hand in murder i was now ready to accuse people id known my entire life i set my beer down on the table ridiculous i told myself youve watched too much murder she wrote but the house had been searched that was undeniable i could pare the list down further i thought by bringing rennie clifton into the equation who could have had motive to kill her twenty years ago id found that shed worked occasionally for hart quadlander and regularly for ivalou purcell shed secretly wooed a boy wanda dickensheets claimed and although i couldnt discern a connection between her and steven teague hed left town shortly after her death if her alleged white beau glenn was still alive id have wondered about him as well but hed already gone to his reward the phone ringing interrupted my mental ramblings it was candace sounding overly polite and none too pleased get your butt over here right now jordan poteet whats wrong never you mind you and i are going to have a conversation arent we doing that right now no get over here please look im not leaving mark and mama here not after our house was broken into yesterday whatever bee had gotten in her trousers was going to have to just buzz fine well be over in a bit just as soon as i close up she slammed the phone down before i could answer we it turned out we meant candace and the estimable miss ludey murchison the noted reader during the librarys story day presentations for the poppets of mirabeau miss ludey appeared resplendent in mismatched galoshes the rain had abated yesterday as ive already mentioned white athletic socks that peeked above her inclement weather footgear a full denim skirt with a rodeos lasso embroidered across it a blouse that could only be described as peptobismol pink and a houston oilers baseball cap she greeted me with her usual friendly smile helped no doubt by her dentures candace had a smile for me tootight and annoyed i quickly made miss ludey comfortable in the living room with a glass of iced tea and a slice of buttermilk pie miss ludey had said shed prefer pecan pie but told usin gratuitous detailof the shoddy adhesive qualities of her denture sealant and she didnt want to risk gumming a nut i on the other hand was quickly made to squirm by candace miss ludey says candace began that youve been snooping again pardon i said faintly you went to see thomasina clifton and grilled her about her daughters death i had a talk with her i would hardly call it a grilling we had koolaid damn it listen to me jordan this is a case for the police to solve not you stay out of it why do you insist on sticking your nose in where it has no business wait a second two of my friends are dead another may never wake up my nephew and my sister have been put through hell someone broke into my house and its not my business i turned to the inoffensive miss ludey who apparently had already heard all candaces complaints against me whys candace bothering you miss ludey as miss ludey had her mouth full of buttermilk pie candace deigned to answer for her miss ludey stopped in for dinner i dont cook much since the kitchen fire miss ludey offered through halfswallowed pie crust i didnt ask for an explanation of what incendiary event she referred to and she and i had an interesting chat did you know that thomasina clifton used to clean for miss ludey theyre still old friends mrs clifton told miss ludey all about your visit well i demanded whats your point jordan candace said you have an unfortunate habit of playing detective you shouldnt youve managed to get yourself involved in two murder cases and both times you narrowly escaped with your life i want to keep you safe her voice rose in pleading i truly hate to see candace beg but i smiled anyway she was worried about me it was sweet but i was not going to be deterred by baseless fears look im perfectly capable of taking care of myself and im not investigating franklin bedloes doing that im just asking questions i considered it prudent not to mention to candace my perusal of old papers my discussion with ed over cleveys plan to buy into kbav or my hiding of the scrap of cloth sister left at the crime scene those activities didnt exactly fall under asking questions candace regarded me with a raised eyebrow please dont insult my intelligence jordan you fancy yourself a regular bloodhound well i think its time for a leash how would you feel about new orleans huh i adore new orleans miss ludey piped up i met a sailor there once who could thats nice miss ludey you can tell us all about it in a second candace patted her knee kindly to avoid any detailed discussions of miss ludeys past nightlife i think you could do with a change of scenery jordy my brother and his wife would love to have you for a visit ive already talked to peter and he said their house is open to you excuse me im not about to leave mirabeau while junebugs in the hospital someone candace said her usually calm voice growing strident put bullets in trey clevey and junebug presumably that same someone broke into your house youll excuse me if i prefer my men bulletfree candace beggings never been my strong suit she said her voice steadying but now im pleading please get out of town for a while go to new orleans you and peter can party on bourbon street and drink at pat os and take in a saints game have a wild time drink and leer at women i promise i wont mind just go i am and i made sure i enunciated clearly and calmly not leaving mirabeau my sister needs me my nephew needs me junebug needs me and while i appreciate your concern im perfectly capable of taking care of myself this is not cowboys and indians jordan this is real life you could be a target and i wont just stand here and if you ask me miss ludey interjected it was that nutty niece of mine excuse me i asked wanda the crazy one miss ludey leaned forward talking in a conspiratorial whisper shes not quite right in the head havent you seen her gallivanting around town dressed like elvis presley its downright embarrassing i didnt think miss ludey should be casting fashion stones but i declined comment my mind was on the odd interconnections that sew this town together miss ludey was kin to wanda and ivalou i hadnt known that wandas your niece candace asked her chastisement of me momentarily suspended greatniece i mean that in a genealogical sense shes never been that wonderful of a relative miss ludey picked a fragment of pie crust out from between her teeth miss ludey did you know rennie clifton i asked candace shot me a look i was after all daring to investigate right in front of her but she remained quiet well sure i did i knew her mama and i met rennie when she was in school i used to substituteteach sometimes this was another unknown episode in miss ludeys history and i tried not to think of her shaping young minds even on a transient basis she was a very pretty girl she could have had her pick of any of the colored boys but she was sweet on glenn wilson and wanda was dating him i prompted oh yes wanda wasnt dressing like elvis then but she was still a peculiar girl she told me that she and glenn were bound to get married after they graduated from school and theyd go off and work at disneyland she wanted to be snow white and greet people in the park it was certainly a fascinating career path that wanda had planned for herself but it wasnt what i was interested in and wanda was aware of the attraction between glenn and rennie oh yes i heard her and her mother talking about it once wanda said she wasnt going to put up with a nigger taking her man away miss ludey sniffed i have always found wanda to be rather offensive in her choice of language i should have read to her more when she was little and how did ivalou feel about all this after all she was rennies boss she could have fired her oh wanda insisted on her mother firing rennie but ivalou pointed out that if she kept rennie busy at the flower shop then rennie wouldnt have time to be out sparking with glenn and ivalou told wanda she needed to learn how to keep glenn from straying just howd you know all this miss ludey candace asked a trace of skepticism coloring her tone i overheard them at ivalous flower shop not long before rennie was killed wanda and ivalou were arguing about it in ivalous office on a day rennie wasnt working id come in to order flowers my mamas birthday was coming up and i always put flowers on my mamas grave for her birthday and for christmas your memory seems rather keen on the details candace said not unkindly my dear miss ludey answered with a dose of asperity how many times do you hear two relatives discussing a black girl who is about to steal ones man it wasnt a conversation i was likely to forget candace was quiet glancing at me you said this was right before your mothers birthday miss ludey how long before hurricane althea was that barely a week miss ludey answered without hesitation i found it a trifle disconcerting that wanda and ivalou had that discussion about rennie and then the poor child ended up dead you didnt think one of them candace began when ivalou said she wasnt going to fire rennie wanda stormed out of that office and shoved right past me without even saying hello she had the fire of hell in her eyes and when i walked into ivalous office she looked downright icy i asked her what wanda had her panties in a wad about and ivalou just said it was business she meaning ivalouwould have to take care of for wanda ivalou didnt know id heard as much as i had but rennie clifton died in a hurricane miss ludey candace said i shook my head at her some people are still clinging to outmoded notions in mirabeau maybe maybe not miss ludey said our whole family had decided to wait out the hurricane together at my brother ralphs house and ivalou and wanda both didnt show up until after the storm was over ivalou got there about an hour after the storm had passed and wanda showed up about three hours later ralph was frantic about them both but all i know is rennie clifton was dead and glenn wilson broke up with wanda less than a week later i sometimes wonder if that poor boy didnt suspect i bit my lip thoughtfully candace was not so trusting in miss ludeys veracity and why didnt you say anything twenty years ago she demanded well dear one doesnt like to think that ones relatives could be murderers miss ludey said i could well understand her attitude having been caught in that same moral dilemma in recent days and everyone said that rennies death was an accident i didnt have any proof i still dont yet youve decided to speak up now candace pressed note i didnt intervene in her investigating well i dont want to sound selfish ivalou and wanda are my closest living relatives and they want to put me in a nursing home honestly me and im as sharp as the day i was born they just think im nuts cause i dont care if my clothes match and i like to papiermache my walls miss ludey snorted derisively at this lack of perception among her kinfolk i figure if those two got skeletons in the closet nows the time to air em out i dont think they could put me in a nursing home from prison do you i stuck my face in my hands how much of this ludeyesque tale to believe shed just frankly admitted to a strong motive to belittle wanda and ivalou and claimed detailed memories of conversations that were two decades old so why dont you tell this to the police candace demanded miss ludey gave my beloved a disapproving look the police arent investigating rennie cliftons death jordan is do try to keep up dear is there anything else you remember miss ludey i asked not looking toward candace for fear id crack a smile she thought no except that wanda suggested that if ivalou didnt fire rennie maybe ivalou could get hart quadlander to fire rennies mother to teach em a lesson what sway did ivalou think she had over hart my dear ivalou has been chasing unsuccessfully after hart quadlander for years hart is kind to her but doesnt encourage ivalou in her pursuit of him i shuddered yuck neither would i you havent painted a very kind picture of wanda miss ludey candace crossed her arms you must not care for her at all miss ludey stiffened i didnt choose to be related to wanda and i dont mean to shock but its not a lie to say i consider her and her mother most unlikable the phone rang i dove for it a thunder of feet on the stairs told me mark was coming down he peered expectantly at me from the staircase i listened to my sisters voice holding my breath i told her id be right over its junebug i told the others hes awake he lay in a tangle of wires and tubes machines bleeped at his bedside monitoring vital functions a massive bandage covered one side of his shaved head i leaned close to his bristly face peering down into his angry eyes shot me junebug whispered at me son of a bitch shot me yes i know i leaned closer who jordan dont tire him barbara moncrief ordered he doesnt know who it was and thats whats making him mad id gotten to the hospital to learn junebug had been conscious for nearly an hour had started speaking coherently in short order and after being repeatedly fussed over by doctors had seen his officers his mother and my sister and had asked for me sister was of the opinion that he wished to make sure i was not in trouble i was surprised that the physicians who tended to hover and speak in acronyms allowed me to see him but in a small town being police chief counts for a great deal lord knows it wasnt me wielding the frightening scepter of being town librarian that got me in among the ivs and glowing screens to see my friend you i said have scared the living hell out of me youre going to be okay arent you he grunted at me have to bekeep you out of trouble dont tire him jordy barbara repeated hes so weak bullshit mama junebug murmured but he closed his eyes i felt a vast flood of relief he would be okay now surely barbara certainly seemed to be optimistic i wanted to find a doctor and get a definitive report or find sister i thought no doubt she had wrested an opinion from every medical practitioner in bonaparte county arlene junebug whispered shes just outside dear barbara assured him dr meyer doesnt want you having too many visitors at once but i want you to tell her to go home and get some rest shes been by your side nonstop she smiled at me arlenes a good woman told you so junebug said a faint smile on his face mama go get some coffee i want to talk to jordy alone for a minute barbara dithered at this request but finally acceded i leaned down close to him you want me to bring you in some books on tape when youre feeling better or shall i have miss ludey come in and read to you he managed another smile oh that hurts no want to talk to you the smile faded trey and cleveythe funeralim sorry i missed it should have been there gee comas about the worst excuse i ever heard i tried joking please dont worry about that of all things arlene neededto be there for arlene i know now she couldnt have hurt trey she would never have hurt me tell her i put my mouth near his ear and quietly told him what had happened between sister and trey maybe i shouldnt have maybe i should have left it to her but i wanted him to know he was right and telling him about the scrap of fabric from her pants made me feel immensely better you still got that fabric he asked yes throw it away its just litter he closed his eyes again listen before my mother comes back yes shot meknow who shot me dont want to talk about itin front of mama told franklin i held my breath who he grimaced with the effort of speech his voice sounded like a boys whisper ed i think it was ed i left the hospital in a state of shock id walked out of junebugs room to find barbara moncrief and sister lingering near the door consumed with joy over his awakening and his chances for full recovery i tried to extract a promise from sister that she wouldnt stay all night that shed come home and get some rest he needs me sister answered thats all that matters dont tell me you wouldnt be here every minute if candace was here since candace seemed prepared to put me in the hospital if i continued my sleuthing i hoped shed camp out in the waiting room while i recovered i kept my thoughts to myself wished barbara well kissed sister on her forehead and headed home i didnt go straight there though i swung by the dickensheets house it was now nearly ten at night but the porch light was still on and a police cruiser sat in the driveway franklin bedloe was following up on junebugs theory i slowed but didnt stop and took the next turn to head home ed shooting junebug seemed highly improbable but junebug had heard a voice call to him as he opened his door hed paused and the gunfire cut him down the voice had sounded like eds nasal whine and hed seen a short shadowy form in the bushes i thought immediately that a killer was likely to squat in the bushes looking shorter but i kept my mouth shut he said he remembered nothing else until he came around in the hospital his mama squeezing his hand till he thought the bones would grind together it seemed little to go on to me but junebug was a trained experienced policeman i couldnt question his hypothesis much especially in light of what miss ludey had told us frighteningly a scenario unfolded before my eyes ivalou or wanda having a direct hand in rennie cliftons death clevey uncovering evidence to back the claim and ed taking action to silence clevey and then trey must have somehow learned about it but then why the attack on junebug he claimed hed discovered no new information of value in his investigation perhaps no information he realized was of value but if the killer believed that junebug was closing in on him three down i took a long hard look at myself in the mirror as i parked in my driveway what if candace was right i could be setting myself up as the next target if i kept poking into shadowy holes i felt a gentle smile come on my face as i thought of her concern she was furious with me i knew but it was because she cared because despite the difficulties involved in putting up with me on an ongoing basis she loved me i didnt know if i kept up with my investigations whether shed lose patience and affection for me but if she didnt know me know that i wouldnt abandon my friends or stand idly by while they were killed she didnt truly know me at all candaces mercedes was still parked in front of my house despite her anger at me shed kindly offered to stay with mama and mark id dropped miss ludey off on the way to the hospital i had a feeling that candace had been overdosed with miss ludey this evening and i was glad to take the lady home shed wished me well when i left her promising to gargle with salt water to take care of her throat so shed be set for the cycle of hans christian andersen tales she planned to read as christmas approached candace was watching the local news out of austin mark exhausted had retired early mama had taken her medication and fortunately was fast asleep how is he she asked i think hes going to be okay hes coherent and he seems strong could he say anything about what happened i debated telling her i knew candace wouldnt repeat anything i said knowledge to paraphrase a wise person is about the most dangerous commodity around i didnt want her to be in peril but she ought to know yeah but obviously dont repeat this he thinks ed shot him candaces eyes widened ed dickensheets oh thats ridiculous eds a little goofball and wouldnt hurt a fly unless maybe his family was threatened kind of puts an interesting spin on what miss ludey told us she opened her mouth and then closed it with a click of her teeth an angry flash filled her eyes and she crossed her arms i prepared myself for the lecture about miss ludey dont you think she manufactured that whole tale to get back at ivalou and wanda for dying to ship her off to the nursing home i shrugged maybe so in fact if it hadnt been for what junebug said about ed i dont know if id have taken what miss ludey said very seriously not turning up at someones house during a storm is hardly evidence you committed a murder and she could have manufactured the whole story about the heated discussion between ivalou and wanda that she claims to have overheard i think though that i ought to tell franklin bedloe about it candace agreed and i called and left a message for franklin at the police station he called me back fifteen minutes later sounding tired and ragged i relayed miss ludeys story to him my god if that aint a corker franklin sighed so whats the deal did you question ed yeah and he claims he was with wanda when junebug was shot as for the times when clevey and trey were killedhe claims he was alone at that elvis store of his taking stock in the back i could nearly see franklin shrug i havent arrested him yet cause i dont have sufficient cause junebug cant say with certainty that it was ed dickensheets that shot him ed dont even own a gun i think you and i both know if you want to get hold of a gun in this country its not that hard and both guns used to kill clevey and trey are missing franklin cleared his throat true enough but im not convinced that the attack on junebugs connected to the other two murders why do you say that think about it jordan junebugs arrested a lot of fellows in his life men that have beaten their wives or gotten drunk or vandalized property itd be easy to see one of em holding a grudge against him i tend to think thats where well find our culpritout of junebugs background in law enforcement odd that some old enemy would rear his head now i commented right after two friends of junebugs are killed coincidence franklin said listen jordan im in sore need of some coffee thanks for the information that miss murchison gave you ill be sure and follow up on it i thanked franklin for his time and hung up i felt dismissed and uneasy i wasnt quite so ready to accept franklins theory about junebugs shooting a vague tickle of apprehension nagged at me whatd he say candace wanted to know i smiled thinly hes got it all under control candace dont worry im sure hell make an arrest soon and thisll all be over you can quit worrying about me good she eased against me in a hug i hugged back thinking that christmas would be approaching and perhaps tomorrow i should start my shopping early after all mama always was a big elvis fan the next morning i called the hospital junebug was continuing to improve sister had spent the night there but came home around six to collapse onto the couch i sternly lectured her that shed make herself sick if she didnt get some rest and then would be of no help to junebug but she was too busy softly snoring to pay me any heed i carried her up to bed put a quilt over her and told clo that i didnt want her disturbed for any reason the dawn brought rain again leaving mirabeau dank gray and muggy clouds veiled the entire sky not offering a glimmer of blue the suns outline barely glowed through the haze offering scant warmth it was a day to crawl into bed with a good book or a ready lover and while away the hours after getting sister settled i drove a rather quiet mark to his counseling appointment over at steven teagues medical office i felt uneasy about mark seeing steven but i really had no reason to put the brakes on marks therapy plus i thought i could deal with steven with one wellplaced sentence to show him jordan poteet was no fool mark surprised me as we drove do you think im a shit uncle jordy good lord i said as i turned into the small parking lot where stevens office was he and a dentist had converted an older victorian house into office space with steven occupying the first floor why on earth do you say that i dont seem to want to be around folks much bradley keeps calling wanting to come over and i just think hed be awful tiresome to deal with mark ran his finger along the condensation of the car window im tired my stomach hurts and i cant sleep good but bradley its like dealing with a baby sometimes he doesnt understand you dont have to tell him youre not up to company if he doesnt understand davis or cayla will explain to him mark stared out the window then theres scott hes always trying to be nice to me but its like hes trying to be too nice it makes me feel weird hes always wanting to go off on long hikes in the woods even in this crappy weather and he keeps wanting to tell me about these terrible nightmares he has about dad i really dont want to talk about dad much with scott look i made him turn his face toward mine scotts a good kid but hes been through a lot like you have i think he tries to deal with it by hanging around people you seem to want to be alone more its just different ways of dealing with grief mark neither one is right or wrong my last session i told steven that i felt jealous of scott he got all that time with dad that i didnt i ought to hate his guts but i dont he looked earnestly at me i sometimes think maybe scotts jealous of me i dont get it when he had dad in his life and i didnt oh mark i drummed fingers against the steering wheel wondering how to respond it may be hard for you to see how lucky you are if you put it in those terms yes scott had time and more with your father but scott couldnt ever be treys son and he doesnt have the most stable life hes been moved all around and hes got nola for a mother i know hart says shes just grieving but i think shes a little erratic to say the least youve got a family and roots and while your mother and i may be driven nuts sometimes were not likely to create scenes at funerals i nearly amended that sister had created a doozy of a scene at cleveys wake oh well maybe nola wasnt so nuts after all scotts nice to bradley too mark mused one way to decide if i like a kid is how he treats bradley some people arent so nice to bradley yknow i thought of the particular viciousness children display to one who is different and i squeezed marks shoulder well then im glad to know scott likes bradley speaking of bradley you dont know why he reacted the way he did at the funeral do you mark shrugged i guess nola upset him he doesnt like violence kind of makes him jumpy i agree with him listen i have an errand to run so im not going to sit in the waiting room while you have your session with steven that okay yeah but youll be there when im done wont you absolutely lets go in or well be late i want a word with steven before you talk to him the entry hall on the bottom floor served as a common area but the waiting room for stevens patients was thoughtfully private it was the former dining room of the old house oversized chairs and coffee tables covered with scattered back issues of national magazines and the mirabeau and bavary newspapers provided a sense of coziness i told the receptionist that mark slocum was here for his appointment she said that steven was not yet in but she expected him any moment mark slumped in a seat while i paced nervously see no crazy people here but us mark said his voice sounding scratchy youre not crazy at all i said forcefully after what youve been through youd be crazy not to see a therapist you havent he noted well i am crazy havent you ever noticed yeah ill be okay dont worry about me he was quiet for a moment looking into my face for traces of insanity whats wrong i asked he paused embarrassment coloring his face welli dont want to make you feel like a goob tell me i heard youthe other night when you were talking to candace about dad i didnt answer for a moment well mark i was upset you know that your fathers friendship meant a great deal to me yeah he looked at me with eyes that were twins of treys i ruffled his hair affectionately and he ducked away from the attention embarrassed at his stupidly sentimental uncle he picked up a tattered sports illustrated shifted his gum to the other side of his mouth and flipped the pages the picture of a perfectly normal kid except he was a kid that might have a hurt so deep so penetrating that hed never be whole again impatiently i paced the room this is a habit that candace finds particularly grating as if i do it to annoy her i wandered near the window and saw a harried steven teague parking his rainspotted black volvo finally i didnt want to keep mark waiting teague stepped out testing the air with his hand to see if the drizzle demanded an umbrella he decided not and slammed his car door suddenly nola kinnard was there pressing herself against him speaking to him with undeniable insistence she had hold of his coat her head shaking her eyes wild in her face he put her a step back holding her shoulders talking to her shaking his head she shook hers in answer and the tight painful frown on her face suggested she was near tears i moved closer to the window mark ignoring me completely steven shook his head again this only agitated her further her hands clawed on his shoulder and she broke her head hanging rain or tears wetting her face i couldnt see his face only hers but he leaned close to her speakingi could see the outline of his jaw moving i hoped he was telling nola not to make such a spectacle of herself those apparently werent his words she leaned in closely quickly and drew him into a kiss he either savored her lips against his for the first moments or was so surprised that he couldnt move his face was away from mine the kiss broke when he pushed her gently but decisively away he said a few more words then turned and headed toward the front door nola stood there in the windblown mist staring after him her eyes were dark hollows in her weathered face pensive and wanting she was still standing there when i quickly resumed my seat steven came in smiling broadly attired in raincoat and tweed and looking every inch the polished counselor he mopped at his lips with a handkerchief and i saw a smear of red he ran a hand through his grayshot hair good morning mark why hello jordan its nice to see you as well im marks ride today i smiled but i wonder if i might speak privately with you for a moment certainly mark why dont you go on into my office and ill join you in a moment see you mark said to me and went into stevens office shutting the door behind him hows mark doing i asked steven spread his fingers expansively he was one of those people who talked as much with his hands as with his voice he hasnt wept yet in therapy he still has a lot of anger a lot of denial to work through he doesnt want to be around people much he says so himself marks doing his best to live up to what you and your family expect from him strength resilience dealing with his own emotions he says he wants to be alone being around other people even boys his own age seems to make him uncomfortable marks feeling as though hes different from everyone he knows hes been through a terrible experience that he feels others dont share im concerned about how this may isolate him if he doesnt express his grief his shock it can turn in on him painfully i didnt feel reassured by his prognosis what can i do to help him make him understand its okay to have these feelingsthe grief and the rage he straightened his eyeglasses i think mark is very much like you in some ways jordan strong determined to be independent he doesnt want to need anyone right now let him know that youre there for him i will yes i could do that for mark steven cleared his throat obviously ready to go treat his patient i thought about asking him why nola was all over him like a cheap suit but decided against it perhaps her campaign to win ed was withering and steven was a backup if not nola as a topic this house is very nice i like it better than your old office in mirabeau pallor crept across his face excuse me you used to work at that mirabeau free clinic didnt you i remember it from when i was a boy i was sure id seen you somewhere before i saw the fight for control on his face and then the mask of vague distance that im sure he wore with his patients fell into place you have an excellent memory jordan i spent so little time in mirabeau before i didnt expect that anyone would remember me long memories in little towns steven i smiled its nice that you chose to come back well i was er sorry that the clinic didnt work out i um always thought id try to come back to mirabeau to live its a delightful town he seemed rather anxious to return to his office i wont keep you from your session with mark ill be back shortly to pick him up excellent yes very good steven sputtered forcing a smile he retreated into his office for a moment i worried about leaving mark there i chided myself for overprotectiveness steven teague had lived in mirabeau before very briefly and failed to mention it that wasnt a crime when id mentioned it he hadnt denied it just expressed surprise that i knew he might just be a very private person about his past there was after all nothing to tie him to rennie clifton or to trey nola was probably an idle flirtationand instigated by her hed been cleveys counselor but that vague connection was his only one to the nightmare of recent days nola had vanished from the parking lot when i stepped out into the rainy morning i left feeling better but not entirely at ease time to visit elvis theinstitute of elvisology was open and ready for business when i parked in front of its garish neon sign that offered all that made the king special flocks of adorers though hadnt materialized to beat the institutes doors down i ventured inside the door chiming the first strains of love me tender instead of jingling bells i didnt see anyone gyrating forward to take my business so i wandered for a moment surveying the offered wares elvis videos from his earliest movies to later performances ranged one wall albumsin vinyl cassette and cd formatsfilled bins decorated with a montage of elvis record covers a bookshelf filled with biographies of the king stood against a wall that was decorated with tabloid headlines that suggested that mr presley still walked among us a beautifully framed family photo reproduction of elvis priscilla and the baby lisa marie hung centered over the cash register easels displayed an assortment of de rigueur black velvet paintings of elvis in various settings my favorite was elvis as mona lisa and a middle display area contained a variety of merchandise elvis key chains elvis cigarette lighters elvis bumper stickers elvis refrigerator magnets elvis clocks one with his hips swaying on alternate seconds elvis calendars and the allimportant elvis glassware clothing racks held jackets tshirts leggings sweats all adorned with the presley icon and on a far wall a rack of metal shelves held the greatest oddities of all a fingernail clipping floating in some jelled preservative carefully catalogued locks of hair an unchewed stick of gum mounted on a board like a captive butterfly and labeled with the date and the hotel room elvis had allegedly left it behind in apparently this was elvis dna centralid have to alert the cloning researchers they could start here hello a voice trying to be deeper than it actually was bellowed from the back i stepped away from the holy relics wanda dickensheets appeared from the back storeroom apparently dressed like elvis had in one of his early films hiphugging pants silk shirt cut jacket her hair was plastered close to her head and she was carrying her elvis wig in one hand i presumed that i too would revisit old girlfriends if candace started dressing like a man most of the time if wanda was worried about nola i could assure her that nola seemed to have shifted her sights off ed well hello jordy she greeted me her voice not particularly welcoming you dont mind me not being entirely in costume here do you i peeked out and saw it was you i know you aint exactly a big elvis fan so i didnt think youd care i like elvis presleys music as much as the next redblooded american but it was true i wasnt a devotee of the magnitude of wanda dickensheets possibly elvis himself wasnt you look great wanda quite a setup youve got here well thanks im right proud of it she gestured expansively i do like to think that elvis himself would feel at home here i didnt know the likelihood of thatbeing in a store where your face grinned back at you from every item of merchandise would be disconcerting its very nice i said politely is ed around her face darkened no edll be in later hes tired he had a late night i wondered if eds late night was due to the mirabeau police id nearly hoped ed would be absent i wanted to talk to wanda alone it was not to be good morning jordan a frosty voice greeted me also from the back ivalou purcell came forward her improbably tinted hair stacked high and her dark lips set in a frown her face was a carefully sculpted homage to makeup a cloud of cheap citrusy perfume wafted about her and i tried to keep from stepping back as she approached hows your mother doing ivalou asked obliquely to be polite i always find the question wellmeaning but bordering on tiresome what answer do people expect that shes getting better ivalous reedy voice didnt better my mood i forced a mannered smile to my face shes fine thank you i answered i wondered how i might get wanda alone to talk without her battleready mother im glad to hear that although i think that you should really spend more time taking care of the poor woman and less time gossiping with the mentally deranged ivalou pronounced in a half sneer excuse me ivalou smirked not a pretty sight i had a fascinating conversation with franklin bedloe today my aunt ludey has been circulating the most ridiculous stories and when i confronted her on it she confessed she said shed told you her fabrications concerning my daughter and me and rennie clifton so much for subtle inquiry miss ludeys failure to keep her mouth shut had eliminated any chance of gently worming information out of these two i determined however not to go on the defensive miss ludey simply shared her opinions with me and you promptly shared them with franklin bedloe i suppose you would it might shift suspicion off that temperamental sister of yours ivalou folded her twiggy arms like a schoolteacher daring a misbehaving pupil to contradict her i wasnt intimidated my sister isnt a suspect in junebugs shooting ed is unfortunately maybe arlene should be a suspect on the police shows they always look to the victims lover ivalou sneered the word lover like it was a synonym for venerealdisease carrier if she wanted to play snotty fine by me maybe thats why they should have looked hard at glenn wilson when rennie clifton died it scored the hit i wanted but i felt a pang of regret for the dismayed look on wandas face ivalou glared fiercely at me and one of her longnailed fingers jabbed at my face get out of here ivalou snapped mother ill thank you not to be barking orders out in my store wanda ridiculous in her attire managed a quiet dignity as she faced her mothers taunting glare she turned back to me i dont know what silly ideas youre nursing jordan poteet but i can tell you that glenn wilson had nothing to do with that girls death her death was an accident did you know she was pregnant when she died i asked wanda actually reeled she took three sudden steps back against the counter as though my words had shoved her with physical force she found her voice no i didnt but it dont matter glenn couldnt have killed her hehe was with me during that storm of course glenn wouldnt be available to confirm that claim i watched ivalou who had gone a shade of plum in her cheeks her eyes narrowed to slits and where were you ivalou thats none of your business you asshole get out of my daughters store fine im just asking what franklin bedloes bound to ask i heard that hes reopening rennie cliftons file as a murder case i hadnt heard any such gossip but the beauty of rumor is that you can invent it on the spot since you were her employer im sure hell be questioning you but of course if youve got something to hide i was stuck at home waiting for wanda to come back from wherever she was i didnt know she was off gallivanting in the storm with glenn she calmed herself with a long gift of breath make you happy now jordy not that either of us have to answer to you you didnt go to where your family was meeting ivalou if you were so worried about wanda id think youd make a beeline to the most likely place shed be fine mr smartass i wasnt at home the whole time she squared her shoulders i went out to the quadlander farm i was worried about hart wanted to be sure he was okay yes youve taken a lot of interest in hart over the years i parried but he wasnt there just that disgusting louis slocum getting drunk on cheap whiskey smelled like hed bathed in it when i asked him where hart was he just started crying and said hed gone where that old drunk didnt know he leered at melouis slocum always was a leering thing and i never could see why hart kept that goodfornothing aboutso i turned around and went home ivalou purcell glared at me with utter loathing you think youre smart dont you jordan youre not she shook her head smiling meanly to emphasize her point you come in here making snide accusations against my family you have no call speaking badly of decent people not when i know what you are she took a step forward as though to herd me out of the store youre nothing but bob don goertzs bastard i froze how did she know it was known only to me and a few close friends but then keeping secrets is often hard in a little town not impossible just hard i wasnt going to insult bob don by ignoring the charge i couldnt ignore the hot flush in my neck and the disdain in her voice and face i dont see what that has to do with rennie or ed nothing but a common bastard ivalou began her voice a taunting singsong ignoring wandas shocked pleas that she stop my daughter at least grew up knowing her daddy was really her daddy i didnt sleep around on her father and i maintained myself as a respectable widow only because i retorted hotly hart quadlander wouldnt give you the time of day much less a poke how many years have you chased him without results ivalou i pulled myself into my raincoat im sorry wanda im sorry that you have to put up with this woman tell ed ill talk to him soon wanda acted like she hadnt heard me staring at her mother with a dazed expression i dont generally insult my elders but i wasnt about to let her slur meor my parents i turned and started to walk out bastard ivalou purcell screeched at my back bastard bastard bastard i consoled myself as i stormed out into the rain that there were much worse things to be called i was cussing at myself by the time i got my blazer started id totally mishandled ivalou and wanda and now getting them to talk about rennie clifton would be impossible i didnt like that id let myself be a blunderbuss when subtlety might have worked i prided myself on being a gentleman and id let a trashmouth like ivalou purcell egg me into being a jackass i felt a sick pang that somehow the gossip chains of mirabeau had told ivalou my parental secret now that i was firmly etched on her shit list i supposed shed broadcast it all over town i had no plans to be ashamedmy birth was beyond my control bob don was so inordinately proud of me that no amount of vicious rumormongering would cow him i felt queasy relief that mama was beyond caring what anyone said about her however i was likely to deal with any fool stupid enough to reproach my mother to me with a sharp tongueor a sharp jab to the jaw depending on mood and reproacher i found mark sitting on the porch steps huddled against the rain when i got back to steven teagues office he looked like a cold miserable puppy in the fine mist i walked up to him and he looked up at me with darkly haunted eyes im ready to go now uncle jordy can we just go home whats wrong what happened he clomped through a muddy puddle with total disregard i caught up with him as he jumped in on the passenger side what the hell has spooked you i demanded pulling his door open again youre getting me wet he said i just want to go home okay i shut his door and went around to the drivers side i forced my sour mood out of my face and my voice mark was burdened enough right now and ivalou purcells snide attack on me wasnt going to color the way i dealt with him how did your session go i asked hoping hed feel comfortable enough to talk about it lord only knew what i was going to do though if he wanted to have a real discussion about his therapy i lived in mortal fear of sticking my foot in my mouth around him he gave a tortured sigh okay but i dont have to keep going to see steven for very long if i dont want to do i mark what youve been throughi think you have to give it some time to see if you start feeling better its like if you broke a leg and had to go through physical therapy you wouldnt quit that before it was done because you wouldnt be able to use your leg as well my metaphor sounded sorely strained but i didnt know what else to say what was i suggesting that he had a sprained heart and soul we cant exactly pretend that you and i didnt see your daddy die youre not going to therapy mark said i hate it when a teenagers right no im not not yet candace and your mother would no doubt maintain theres not enough therapy in the world to make me normal i paused as i turned back onto our street do you want me to go to your sessions with you nooooo he said his tone uncertain he abruptly changed subjects davis was at stevens too after you left that was a surprise but it was important i considered to make mark feel that consulting steven didnt automatically qualify one for the big scarlet c well then thats good that davis is getting help bradley was with him oh hows bradley i asked mark didnt answer right away i pulled into the driveway and switched off the engine as i reached for the door handle marks fingers touched my arm i think his daddy beats him i froze what i went to the bathroom after my session i heard davis come in the office he was talking real loud at steven saying that steven had to help him he couldnt go on with how stuff was mark shifted in his seat avoiding my astonished gaze steven tried to calm him but davis sounded really upset his voice was all squeaky like i waited till i heard stevens door shut and then i opened the bathroom door bradley was sitting in the waiting room hed been crying his eyes were all bloodshot he was making this freaky groany noise and he looked at me like he didnt know me mark you better not be joking why do you think davis is beating him my throat felt scratchy with tightness i saw the marks on his arms like someone had grabbed him really really hard and squeezed thin bruises and his face was red like hed been slapped i tried to get him to come outside with me but he just started moaning sort of and didnt want to leave the couch did you ask him specifically if his daddy had hit him no but i did ask him whod done this i told him id kick whoevers butt it was for him and he just started kind of whining and getting upset he was having trouble not slobbering and that always means hes upset mark ran a finger under his nose looking miserable my god davis upset seeking a counselor with a bruised bradley in tow i tried to picture davis beating his son and the image came easily davis losing patience with his son that could never realize his dreams striking bradley perhaps even before he knew it bradley had let out a scream to chill blood at treys burial no i amended not at the burial not at any given momentbut right after nola kinnard had doubleslapped me i felt a quiver in my stomach wondering if bradleys cry was because hed seen or felt slapping lately what are we gonna do mark asked clearing his throat i dont know we dont know for sure that davis is beating bradley i cant imagine that cayla would put up with itunless hes abusing her too the rain pattered on the car roof while i gathered my thoughts the air felt clammy and marks suspicions made my stomach do clumsy somersaults i dont know what we can do lets say davis is beating them hes asking for help by going to steven but what if it dont work mark demanded we got to get them out of there uncle jordy its not that simple mark i felt like a cornered lion tamer sans chair and whip i had enough of my own troubles to contend with and selfishly i didnt want to tackle the problems of the foradorys i dont know what we can do without some proof and if davis tells steven hes beaten bradley or cayla then steven can contact the proper authorities but what if he dont mark pressed we cant leave him there just for his daddy to whomp on him its not right this couldnt be happening i thought id cast my childhood friends into certain statues and now cracks crept up from their bases harmless funloving clevey as a vengeful guiltridden manipulator who was never at peace the unredeemable trey as a man whod perhaps been forced into a hellish choice and now our rock of propriety davis suggested as a man who couldnt keep his fists off his own child the thought of domestic violence happening with people id known for years was eerie and domestic violence suddenly i saw peggy godkins face bleary in the cafeteria light on the morning junebug had been shot telling me about cleveys reporting assignments on the paper he was working on his usual assignments the city council the bookreview section and he was researching a feature on domestic violence and at junebugs davis hoisting a toast to our dead friend clevey our friend and fine reporter hell dig up all the secrets even if it sends him to hell no it couldnt be if clevey in researching his story uncovered battery right in the home of one of mirabeaus most prominent lawyers hed do something to help cayla and bradley right eds voice whispered in my ear clevey was going to buy an interest in kbav said hed gotten the money from a louisiana inheritance uncle jordy marks voice sounded distant as though i was fathoms away under the sea drowning while staring up at the far glimmer of the sun i found my voice well call cayla see if everything is okay you can call bradley and see if hes all right but i dont think we can do much else why not mark insisted maybe because davisd kill us did he kill clevey my musings made my temper short because you just cant mark not without proof you only have conjecture right now conwhat conjecture we dont have any proof his arms were bruised that could have been an accident or another kid picking on him ive known davis my whole life and im not about to think hes a batterer on the most circumstantial evidence i remembered when id called him about cleveys deathhis voice was dulled nearly stuporous why shock over what hed done brains rattling due to firing a gun in an enclosed space seeing a boyhood friends lifeblood seep out okay if hed killed clevey why had he killed trey had trey known about davis how clevey had told trey that revenge was sweet what revenge was there to get on davis i lurched out of the car i needed to talk to candace to junebug tell them this outrageous theory and let them dismiss it for me i stumbled up the front steps and saw nola kinnard sitting primly on our porch your maid wont let me in nola said by way of introduction she stood brushing dank bangs back from her forehead she was dressed as id seen her at steven teagues office snug jeans a blue faded sweatshirt with a napping kitten on the front a weathered tan down jacket splitting at the seams red rimmed her mascarabare eyes i dont have a maid i said mark tensed beside me the black lady whatever she is so i waited out here get out of here mark suddenly demanded he stepped forward we dont want you around i guess you dont honey nola dug a pack of marlboros out of her purse but i aint here to see you i came to see your uncle she extracted a cigarette from the crumpled pack and delicately placed it in her mouth you gonna talk to me or tell me to hit the road he dont want you here mark sputtered but i put a hand on his shoulder mark go inside he bristled at the order but he didnt argue with me he stomped to the screen door and swung it open mark nola called i saw him pause not looking at her i understand youve been real kind to my boy scott she coughed her throat raspy with smoke i appreciate that mark wavered on the doorstep torn between the manners his family had instilled in him and i suspected a strong desire to tell nola to kiss his ass youre welcome he muttered and slammed the door she sat back on the rocking chair that had once been mamas favorite place to sit gossip and snap green beans nola seemed out of place and she knew it fumbling in her purse she didnt look at me i dont suppose apologizing to him would have done much good he wouldnt have listened you dont know that i sat next to her sure i do he looks like his daddy dont he i figure hes like him in mind that man wasnt one to listen to an im sorry she flicked her lighter regarded me for a brief moment then returned to contemplating her cigarette you want one no thanks i dont smoke used to though didnt you i saw the gleam in your eye when i lit up she drew on the cigarette and blew smoke out in a long and luxurious breath tastes real good i was suddenly shockingly aware of sexual tension between us the coy posture she leaned back in the assured way she looked at me as though i were an apple for her to pluck the cool consciousness she showed of her own body and under the wet smell of rain and the pungent smoke the vaguest pull of an animal scent on the basest level i wanted her and i was unnerved that i did she saw the truth and smirked i gritted my teeth and crossed my legs what can i do for you nola i take it youre not here just because my porch is a scenic smoking spot i wanted to talk to you say im sorry for the way ive behaved i was pretty horrible at treys funeral i had no call to say the things i did about your sister and im sorry i hit you she drew on the cigarette what should i say apology accepted arent you a gentleman you sure look the part she laughed a sandy sound im not used to men that fix up as nice as you i refused to play in this eatandmouseinheat game of hers really steven teague dresses real well and you seem kind of used to him if i scored a hit it didnt show she wore too much armor behind the veil of smoke whatd he tell you nothing i saw you with him in his office parking lot this morning she laughed pretty sad hes not a bad fellow just doesnt know how to treat a woman he didnt seem interested in what you had to offer nola shrugged and contemplated the burning ember at the end of the cigarette nope hes got too much on his mind for a little fun what did trey see in you i thought and had my answer nearly immediately sex she was the kind of woman who would be a quick firecracker in bed not perhaps the one youd befriend for life and tell your deepest secrets to but one that a mand never forget even when toothless and bald and blind the memory of passionate moments with her would be easily found on your minds shelves but maybe that wasnt entirely fair to her shed stayed with trey after hed been hurt probably unable to be her lover nola tilted her head back regarding me i bug you dont i you cant quite put your finger on me look your apologys accepted maybe you just should go i dont think my sister would appreciate you being here but you appreciate it youre sort of glad i came by i didnt like having my response to her rubbed in my face i dont fancy being anyones third choice now that ed dickensheets and steven teague have declined your charms who said they have oh i was curious to kiss steven that a crime you looked more like you were arguing with him you looked like you were crying her eyes frosted he wont do something for me i sure wish he would but thats neither here nor there eds been very kind to me since ive come here frankly he didnt look like he was that enamored of you at the funeral and neither did wanda or her mother course he didnt i embarrassed the hell out of him and i absolutely could not care about that manwoman he married or that bitch of a motherinlaw hes got she stood and walked to the end of the porch thumbing her spent butt into the bushes i dont think your sister killed trey anymore the rain pattered on the porch roof picking up in intensity do you know who did no but i think hart knows hart good lord if he knew hed tell i stood he practically helped raise trey he sure as hell wouldnt shield his killer i forced my voice back down to an acceptable level why do you think he knows she didnt answer me until shed lit another cigarette and took a fortifying hit from it when we got back to mirabeau trey made us drive first to harts farm even before we went to my uncles house he said he had to see hart before he saw anyone else in town aint that weird what with his own child here she shook her head i loved trey but he was an odd fellow i saw the boy trey cockily setting back his black cowboy hat and charming my skeptical mother with a smile the friend staring up at the stars with me picking out the ones to wish on to ensure hed get a date with arlene poteet the man holding his newborn son with wonder and shock on his face odd fellow i murmured what did he and hart have to say to each other strangest thing nola said we stopped the car short of harts house and trey insisted on wheeling himself up to the porch i honked the horn and hart came out he nearly died with shock when he saw treyyou could just see it in his face trey just said to him hi hart ive come home ive missed you can we go in and talk simple as that hart was practically in tears he went down and real shy like shook treys hand they spoke to each other for a while i couldnt hear what they said but i know hart wanted us to stay there with him instead of my uncle id have liked that but uncle dwight was expectin us i dont find anything odd about this nola harts always considered trey family i aint done we went into the house for iced tea and talked a bit then trey said he wanted to see his daddys grave hart said sure louisd been buried out by the creek trey told me just he and hartd go out there and theyd be back soon so scott and i turned on the tv i went back into the kitchen and trey and hart hadnt gone down yet they were outside on harts back porch talking i wasnt trying to overhear em but i couldnt help it trey was upset he said to hart that ifand she closed her eyes in concentration it hadnt been for daddy i wouldnt have had to leave i dont want to talk about it i just want to forget it all no one knows do they and hart said just steven teague she opened her eyes and looked at me i was stunned into silence waiting for her to speak again nola shook her head it aint nothing arlene or mark did that drove him out of here it was something to do with his daddy i thought yall ought to know why didnt you say anything to the police because i was sure your sister had killed trey she shrugged im sorry im telling you this because i thought maybe you and arlene should know he left town because of something his daddy did not anything yall did if you want ill tell the police if you think it matters i sat back in my chair thank you i managed to say the only noise for a minute was the splatter of rain i dont expect yall to ever take to me nola looked at me with complete candor but im gonna stay in town for a while even if ed wont leave that stupid sow he married thisd be a good town for scott and i thought if he and mark are gonna stay friends i ought to mend fences wait a second not that its much my business but why are you picking up with ed and steven when treys barely cold in the ground i thought you loved him i did i do ive cried and cried till i aint gonna cry anymore but i dont like being alone i need to feel needed dont you know that feeling i didnt answer i didnt understand how she could woo another man so quickly unless grief propelled her and ed or steven or any other fellow was just a temporary substitute for trey a comforting imitation suddenly i felt deeply sorry for her but i didnt offer my sympathy or condolences she just would have misinterpreted it you said you thought hart knows who the killer is i dont understand she stubbed out her cigarette on the porch crushing it under her rainspotted shoes whatever reason trey left hart knows what it is steven knows what it is and i think that reason is why trey was killed and maybe clevey too is that why you were kissing steven she smiled wanly no stevens a nice man but not nice enough scotts been having awful nightmares since trey died hes jumpy and nervous and im worried about him i wanted steven to counsel him yknow talk to him but i dont have the money for it i hoped hed give me credit he wont im sorry scotts having a hard time i am too scott came here he told us that trey and clevey had argued that clevey wanted trey to take part in some revenge scheme theyd make money out of trey wouldnt have done anything like that nola protested you find out exactly why trey left and well know why he died i watched her drive away shed been the last real companion of treys life as different from sister as possible outwardly at least i believed they both shared a core of unsuspected strength that made them both survivors in a world that had been less than kind shed given me plenty to consider some secret involving louis slocum mirabeaus best horse trainer and drunk something that steven hart and trey were all privy to had clevey found out as well he mustve he had to have known and it got him killed hart couldnt have killed trey first he cared too much about him second he had an airtight alibi that junebug had already confirmedchecking out horses on a farm miles away in fayette county but in our talk out on the back porch hartd denied knowing why trey had left six years ago hed lied and just how the hell did clevey fit into this and the attack on junebug ive never been a swift thinker i stopped dead in my tracks my hand reaching for the door steven teague if nolas story was true and shed correctly interpreted the conversation shed heard between hart and trey knew the reason for treys leaving and here he was counseling mark giving me pithy advice on how to handle the trauma thatd nearly destroyed our family while knowing all the while why trey had forsaken us and how the hell would steven knowhe wasnt even living here six years ago someone had told himperhaps clevey who he was counseling god that had to be it my face felt hot and a slow throb of headache started a surging pain in my temples my mind felt dizzy trying to trace the web of treys life i stepped inside and shut the door clo sat with mama in the living room avidly watching a talk show with the sound turned real low mama doesnt like noise much anymore clo glanced up at me i wasnt about to let that white trash in this house she proclaimed be mad at me if you want im not mad at you wheres mark she jerked her head toward the kitchen back porch i think howd his therapy go he feeling better i didnt answer her heading out to the porch it was empty the rain the only sound tapping like fingers on foil hes not there i called back to clo stepping into the kitchen well he called bradley foradoiy and chatted with him a minute then he said he was going out on the porch and listen to the rain bradley oh god and mark was so singleminded about discovering what was going on at the foradorys i phoned daviss number one ring two rings three rings an answering click and then the screams i ignored the stop sign at the intersection of heydl and fifth where the foradory house sat screeching to a stop and spraying water marks bike lay sprawled in the yard glistening wetly i ran across the grass vaulting his bike and leaping up the steps in two jumps the front door was unlocked and i shoved it open hollering for mark i heard a piercing cry from the back of the house i tore through the immaculate living room ignoring the muddy trail i left in my wake i burst through the kitchen which opened up into a breakfast nook and ran into a scene i hadnt quite expected mark grimacing was trying to drag a struggling bradley back toward the porch door bradley kicked at the tiles scuffing them with his cowboy boots wailing and flailing his arms the phone receiver still off the hook dangled above the floor and slowly revolved on its cord cayla foradory her eyes wild and her hair straggling in her face held a metal broomstick in her hand blood dotting one end of it she was whacking the hell out of something on the floor it was only after id taken four more steps in that i saw that she was beating the tar out of davis curled in a fetal ball on the kitchen floor uncle jordy help us shes gonna kill him mark screamed at me i rushed toward cayla and davis he didnt appear to be moving i came up behind cayla and grabbed the broomstick when she brought it back to have another go at her husband i yanked it away and she spun toward me her eyes filled with such blinding fury that i took a shocked step backward she swung a fist at me and nearly connected with my jaw stunned with surprise i seized her arms and shook her hard cayla stop it its me jordy she struggled against me like shed never seen me i shook her again and she calmed the berserker rage fading she took a long hard shuddering breath and gasped get out get out of here what did he do to you did he hit you hit bradley i glanced at her son but he seemed more upset than injured crying and mewling in marks arms hit her bullshit mark screamed she hits him she beats him marks words oozed in i glanced over at davis slowly like a snake awakening to warmth he uncoiled himself i saw bruises on his forearms his neck and a vicious cut above the left eye his tortoiseshell glasses lay broken by his elbow he looked at me like a whipped dog awaiting the next kick this wasnt my friendthis was someone else someone i didnt know get out cayla rediscovered her voice get out of my house right this minute i pushed her away from me and knelt by daviss side he flinched away from my touch burying his face in the crook of his arm get my boy out of here take bradley and go he muttered into his arm his voice barely audible please i dont want him to see me this way shes crazy uncle jordy mark hollered bradley wrestled free from him and crawled to his fathers side i blinked up at cayla she didnt look at any of us except for her son she tried to take him by the arm gently but he squirmed away from her holding his fathers hand bradleys face was contorted with tears his lips curling in anguish oh god what had this boy seen in this house you stay away mom bradley cried stay away cayla straightened up and without a word turned and stumbled out of the kitchen i saw it all mark gasped squatting by me she was whaling on him with that broomstick and also tried to hit him with a skillet you want me to call the cops no no police davis seized my arm pressing hard promise me no police davis you have to tell me whats happened here i told you uncle jordy mark please let davis talk davis couldnt look into my eyes he ran fingers across his head and left a trickle of blood in the thinning blond hair um nothing really it was just an argument for gods sake davis she was about to beat you unconscious now what did you argue about what did you do to her nothing i wouldnt hurt her please just take bradley and go please i took bradleys frownlocked face in my hands bradley listen to me what happened here bradley blinked back more tears his breath came in ragged aching gasps his chin wobbled against my fingers spittle smearing my hand he wouldnt look me in the eye finally he found his voice and whispered aint supposed to tell mom said never tell never tell never tell never tell you can tell me bradley you know you can i kept my voice low and soothing if violence held sway in this house god only knew what this poor kid had witnessed bradley fixed his eyes on the floor the unspeakable secret weighing hard on his heart after a long minute he spoke his fingers drawing nervous patterns on the tiles mom she gets mad she hits daddy she hits him and she hits him again he raised his face again anguish painting his features i aint supposed to tell he collapsed against mark who looked at me with an accusing glare mark take bradley back to our house i said wont go daddy bradley protested son do as jordan says davis still wouldnt look at me slowly mark got bradley to his feet and led him out of the kitchen bradley was bent with walking his feet shuffling like a prisoner fettered at the ankles i felt thoroughly sick davis look at me how long has this been going on he like his son stared at the floor he rubbed at a spot of his own blood that had dripped from his nose to the tile more blood leaked between his teeth i seized his jaw and turned his face toward mine hot with anger toward him davis damn you answer me how long has she been battering you he closed his eyes shamefaced since we found out bradley was retarded i guess about thirteen years what she cant help it you know what a temper shes always had she just gets upset when bradley messes up and she well she can take it out on me his voice sounded soft reasoning the tone of long justification of terrible wrong for gods sake takes it out on you she was going to beat you to a pulp davis well she couldnt hit bradley could she davis said i closed my eyes in nausea but mark saw bruises on bradleys arm she got upset with me last night bradley tried to stop her and she hurt him she hurt him for the first time he finally looked at me his blue eyes were streaked with bloodshot sorrow i couldnt believe she hurt him so i figured it cant go on i cant let her hurt my boy so i went to go see steven teague i thought hed know what to do what i could do to make her better oh davis jesus you cant fix whats wrong with cayla she has to do that we got back and bradley told her hed seen mark cayla wanted to know whered we been i told her i went to teagues office and she went crazy he made a horrible snuffling sound of sickness and sadness long buried davis why didnt you leave her i cant i love her i dont understand you at all my own voice sounded near the breaking point why didnt you defend yourself fight back whyd you let her do this to you i was so mad so frustrated i wanted to shake him myself good god you dont hit girls jordan i could never hit cayla he shook his head i couldnt let anyone know hell you dont think i see how you look at me right now a man that lets a woman beat him its wives that get beaten not husbands what kind of man do you think people would say i was if this was his reasoning and logic he was a far sorrier lawyer than i ever suspected i would have respected you for getting out of this hell davis he buried his face in his hands im so ashamed so ashamed my boy listen to me well get you and bradley out of here you can stay with us as long as you need well see if we can get cayla to go to counseling no one has to know whats happened davis foradory turned away from me no people will know theyll find out like clevey and your sister sister she knows about this i managed to keep my jaw off the bloodspecked tile but it wasnt easy she came overthe morning trey was shot we had been having breakfast and bradley spilled his milk all over the table all over the paper cayla got upset with me about it she was hitting me telling me that bradleys clumsiness was my fault i shouldnt have put so much milk in his glassand arlene walked in she tried to stop cayla and cayla belted her gave her that shiner im awful sorry about that sos cayla oh god have mercy your wife hit my sister yeah knocked her to the floor cayla got upset and ran upstairs so i took care of arlene she was so surprised she could hardly say much although i could imagine sister being shocked i could hardly picture her at a loss for words she told me shed fallen down some steps and blackened her eye i begged her not to tell i said cayla didnt mean it she just had been awful upset she was hankering to go wallop cayla but i talked her out of it for bradleys sake i dont understand why my sister was here davis sniffed she wanted me to be her attorney get a restraining order against trey keep him from mark he wiped his dripping nose with the back of his sleeve the carefully cultured lawyer gone i told her if she didnt tell about cayla id represent her for free i sat back down on the floor free legal services for her silence and shed done it knowing that a boy was in an abusive household suddenly i wasnt real happy with my sister he saw it in my face oh she dont know the whole story jordan dont be mad at arlene please i made her promise i told her it was the only time that cayla hit me and clevey he knew didnt he you said so davis nodded misery clouding his face again he found out about a year ago he saw a bruise on my arm when we were out at lake bonaparte fishing he kept at me about it and i finally told him i confided in him he kept his mouth shut for months but then he wanted money davis quivered with rage how much money oh god thousands davis leaned against the wall face contorting in pain id been so floored by this series of revelations that i hadnt even thought about getting him to a doctor i made him sit went to the sink and dampened a washcloth i handed it to him and slowly he cleaned his face blinking at his blood on the cloth clevey said if i didnt pay hed feature us in a story he was writing about domestic violence davis stared at me eyes rolling i couldnt let that happen oh no itd ruin me id have lost my law practice and if i lost that id have to sell my partnership in kbav i held my breath did you kill him davis did you he gave a shuddering breath no i didnt i wanted to god i even thought about it but i was too scared and he promised that the money would be just that once i could get on with my life as though you could i thought davis couldnt get on with life while cayla beat him he and his son would forever be caught in a loop of bitterness and twisted love manifested with fists and clawing fingers and clevey would have taken his place at kbav the humiliation would have been utter you believe me dont you jordan i swear im not a killer no i didnt think davis was he hadnt roused himself to flee the hell his house had become he wouldnt have shot clevey shivers in cold blood i had to get him to take action now though never mind clevey now were gonna get you and bradley out of here no he shook his head violently i cant leave my house how do i explain it well say you and cayla are just having some problem people dont have to know the specifics then why wouldnt bradley stay with his mom kids stay with moms folksll know theyll find out and im ruined his voice rose in a whiny shriek listen to me god yelling in his face was probably not the way a trained counselor would handle this but i was winging it your life is already ruined you cant live this way you cant pretend that this is normal get yourselves out of hereif not for your sake for bradleys his life matters more than any stupid overblown reputation of yours i clutched at this straw of persuasion and kept pressing him davis you said yourself she hurt him last night thats the start dont you see what happens when she starts getting mad at bradley are you going to stand by and watch him be beaten i he faltered unable to speak you took the first step you went to get help from steven teague you dont have to do this alone okay im here to help you and mark and sister and junebug and hart and ed your friends will help you now come with me he dragged the back of his hand across his bruised and cut face but im supposed to be in court this afternoon never mind court im sure the judge will understand in fact we can call the courthouse from my house why dont we go do that now the air in the foradory house felt dense oppressive i wanted to leave badly he nodded finally and stood he was in obvious pain i wondered how many injuries hed sufferedand silently healedover the years i helped him toward the front door i need clothes he started the first excuse not to leave i didnt brook it for an instant well get them later or you can borrow some of mine we walked slowly davis leaning on me from the kitchen through the pristine living room as we neared the entry hall i could see cayla foradory sitting frozen on the leather couch her head bowed she might have been a statue for her stillness davis did not look at her i walked him onto the porch and got him to sit in a brown wicker chair bradley and mark were nowhere in sight the rain had abated and the sun was doing its damnedest to peek through ill just be one minute i said davis hardly seemed to hear me i stormed back into the house pushing the door hard so it banged loudly against the wall i wanted her to know i meant business cayla still hadnt moved and she didnt look up at me cayla no response cayla look at me her head inclined slightly but her eyes were obscured by strands of dark lank hair she sniffed hard gulping air bradley and davis are at my house dont come over dont come near them and if you ever come near my sister again or bother anyone in my family ill have your sorry ass slapped in jail so fast you wont know what hit you tell davis she started sobbing tell him im so sorry so very sorry it wont happen again and no i wont tell him your garbage youre a liar its been happening again and again and again you want your son and your husband back get yourself some help cayla if youll do that well all help you but you got to get yourself some counseling i dont need a goddamned shrink i just need davis and my boy find some other punching bags i said i know i sounded cruel but i wasnt particularly inclined to kindness toward her bradley needs me he needs his mommy she cried i didnt want to listen to her anymore ill be back in a while for their clothes i might bring the police with me you better behave yourself cayla she didnt answer she just kept crying i left and out on the porch where davis still sat subdued i breathed in fresh air like it was a longdenied pleasure i got davis home clo examined both of them and ordered davis to see a doctor he refused at first till i placated him by getting dr meyer our family physician as well as the foradorys to make a house call one of the benefits of smalltown life is that your doctors treat you like a person not a number davis had suffered grave bruises a loosened tooth and a broken finger but nothing worse bradley was also examined and except for the ring of bruises pronounced fit davis declined to tell dr meyer the source of his injuries but i had no such compunctions i did davis the courtesy however of telling dr meyer in private good god call county social services they deal with battered women all the time hes ashamed he thinks no ones ever heard of a battered husband he says peoplell treat him like a freak dr meyer huffed he did not suffer fools that aint the worse thing in the world better that than being beaten hes trying after she slapped bradley around he did go to steven teagues office for help dr meyer snorted that dandified city fool dr meyer is of hardy bavariancolonist stock and has only a tidbit of patience for people whose families havent been in bonaparte county since texas was a republic well i suppose it was a step anyhow ive given him a tranquilizer he needs to sleep ill come back by tomorrow but you or clo call me if you need me he zipped up his medical bag goddamn and they say you have to go to the big city for the interestin cases id begun to feel yanked in nineteen different directions on top of all else id adopted davis and bradley and their hornets nest of difficulties i took a deep breath and called candace at the diner explaining to her whatd happened good god almighty she said when i was done cayla gave arlene that eye hell i think arlene could clean up the floor with cayla foradory thats one option i concurred so where are you going to put them candace asked bradleyll bunk with mark and well put davis in the guest room unless clo has to stay over if mamas having a tough time then ill take the couch and davis can have my room your application for sainthood is hereby approved or i could propose a notsosaintly alternative sleeping arrangement my bed is always open to you at least how reassuring actually i could use a kiss right now and another kiss and then maybe a yes darlin i get the picture ill come over after work how about i have one of the cooks here fix up a big fried chicken dinner and ill bring it over we wont have to cook and the foradorys wont have to face going out your application for sainthood is stamped thanks jordy yeah id never hit you well only once we said our goodbyes and i hung up thank you god for giving me a candace and not a cayla next i called sister she was in junebugs room and told me he was continuing to improve hed felt good enough to argue with a doctor today he nearly had company in the hospital i caught cayla foradory beating the tar out of davis this afternoon there was dead silence on the other end of the line my lord yes davis and bradley will be staying with us for a while shed taken to hitting bradley too what sister gasped but davis said i know what he said and you and i are going to have a little chat about when you choose to keep your mouth shut sister and i dont want a single word of complaint that theyre staying here i could hear her give a long sigh you wont im glad hes away from that crazy woman tell em to make themselves comfortable and if that cayla even looks crosseyed at me im gonna punch her into next week i said a terse goodbye and dialed steven teagues office his receptionist answered perky and sharp mr teague please im sorry hes gone for the day may i take a message this is kind of an emergency maam im jordan poteet it concerns one of his patients i can have him return your call she said primly fine he can reach me at home tell him it involves davis foradory she repeated the message and wishing me a good afternoon hung up i went back to the foradory house to collect clothes for davis and bradley i took daviss keys thankfully cayla was nowhere about i quickly packed a suitcase for each of them threw in a wornlooking teddy bear for bradley and came home after putting their suitcases in their rooms i took a nap late in the afternoon i went back down to the kitchen to fix myself a pimentocheese sandwich to tide me over till candace came home with dinner scott kinnard had come over to visit and the boys were up in marks room davis slept in druggy oblivion and clo sat chatting with mama who apparency thought clo was a newly made mend and was telling her about her two delightful children arlene and jordan clo smiled wistfully at me anne and i are having a nice chat you want to join us no thanks i think ill hello mama said brightly have we met i couldnt stay i didnt want to be reminded of the trauma in my own family after seeing the foradorys fall apart i excused myself to the porch with my plate i like a little solitude now and then and with this house busting at the seams i wasnt likely to get much privacy in the next several days i sat down to enjoy my lunch and allow myself some quiet time the sky indecisive for the past few days finally offered dryness the sun was edging below the horizon and the air felt brisk and cool the clouds had scudded toward austin pushing in from the gulf and finally shoving past mirabeau i sat on the chair and thought about poor davis hed been through hell and clevey had been one of the devils poking him with a hot trident i felt deeply disappointed in clevey now i had the proof of what hed been up to victimizing a childhood pal for his own selfish reasons hed shown himself to be a blackmailer just like scott had suggested i chewed but what did daviss troubles have to do with trey blackmail over daviss beatings couldnt have been what clevey was coaxing trey to get involved in why share the profits and was davis the gravy train that clevey alluded to my mind went back to what nola told me trey and hart talking trey asking if anyone else knew their secret hart saying steven knew just how did steven teague fit into this town hed worked here once hed left suddenly hed returned twenty years later not exactly encouraging people to prod their memories and remember his brief residence hed lived here and rennie clifton had died carrying a lovers baby hed come back and clevey shivers and trey slocum died it was time to confront hart assuming nola was truthful hed known why trey left and lied hed apparently let steven in on the secret if i stayed here id be nothing but a nursemaid to davis he needed time alone and i needed to take action to find closure for the giant rip my life had become i finished my sandwich and went back into the living room mark was hanging up the phone scott kinnard and bradley sat at the table sipping cokes and munching chips bradley didnt look at me dont ruin your dinners i muttered automatically the chomping of chips continued hey jordy scott greeted me softly mom said she came over and made up with you today she did scott she did i could see some of nolas strength in his face i think i understand your mom a little better now we moved this afternoon he didnt look at me out of harts place were renting a little apartment over off bluebonnet street i knew the apartmentsthey were small and unkempt well i hope that everything will work out me too id like to stay here scott said were gonna see about getting me enrolled in the school ill be in marks class he gave a satisfied smile mark spoke up that was hart on the phone he said we might be able to go riding later if we wanted to come out and visit him i glanced at bradley well see mark i dont know if bradleys up to horse riding bradley didnt acknowledge my reference to him he seemed mesmerized by the ice cubes in his glass surrounded by fizzing soda thought it might get his mind off stuff mark said shrugging scott looked at mark and nodded the boys suddenly made my throat catch bradley looking like a younger davis mark the image of trey and while scott didnt look like any of my boyhood confederates he had the aching for acceptance that reminded me of ed i wondered if theyd stay friends for years if theyd watch each other grow and change and leave mirabeau i hoped if they kept the bonds of friendship strong that they would never have to be tested the way my friends and i had been tested these past dark days so harts at his house i said good i need to pay him a visit i bade the boys farewell and headed out toward the horse ranch dusk was here and a chill breeze made the damp air smell dank as a dungeon i barreled along the road toward the quadlander farm ready to talk truth with hart and find out why treyd felt compelled to leave all those years ago if it hadnt been for the flat tire i would have just zoomed up to the quadlander place and things would have been different perhaps truth would have hidden for a while longer and i dont like to think about what mightve happened it might have been worse than what did happen trey once told me long long ago that you had to stare death in the face to become a man that autumn night i stared too long the tire blew a galumphing popping sound about a quarter mile from the gate that marked hart quadlanders property i pulled over to the side cussing a blue streak thats allowed when candace isnt around the tire had picked up a nail and being old and somewhat bald had given quick surrender i popped open the back of my blazer and pulled up the carpet staring at the flat spare nothing to do for it i slammed the door and started the hike up to harts horse farm i opened the gate that blocked the road up to his property and closed it behind me looping the wire back over the post to hold the gate in place i was careful to secure it i had to help trey chase a horse down once thatd bolted past the gate and i wasnt eager to repeat the experience night had fallen by the time i walked the half mile up the hill to the old house the home treyd lived in all those years didnt face down the road directly it stood at an oblique angle turned slightly so that it faced the scenery of the creek the dense growths of live oaks pecan trees and loblolly pines and farther the watery smudge of the colorado river i noticed the sleek volvo that was steven teagues parked in the gravel drive why was he here id tell steven about the developments at the foradorys but i wasnt done being suspicious of him a light shone brightly in harts kitchen and i headed toward it i saw harts head move past in the lit window and then move back as he walked from his fridge the window was closer than the door and i paused for a moment trying to see if steven was in there with him oh he was in the fluorescent glow i saw the two men standing together laughing at some private joke at ease and then steven moved close and kissed hart i felt nailed to the ground the kiss lengthened grew in heat and stevens arms went around harts neck pulling him tighter in esurient need i stood not breathing until their kiss broke hart ran a finger gently along stevens lips and moved to pick up a beer on his kitchen table he said something and i heard the distant tone of stevens laughter i turned and hurried away embarrassed and shocked i stumbled along toward the creek just go back and ring the bell i told myself pretend like you saw nothing but my feet didnt obey and i staggered down toward the sodden creek the mud smearing on my boots there was no dry spot to sit so i squatted among the heavy cablelike roots of a live oak and leaned against the rough bark hart and steven hart gay and id never known id known him since childhood and hed never told me hell i suspected hed never told anyone in mirabeau had they seen me stumbling into their private moment no one burst from the house so i assumed not i caught my breath and in the beginning of moonlight saw two distant markers among the trees a pair of marble crosses gleaming like silver louis slocums grave and next to it treys grave cold and moldering in their muddy tombs i closed my eyes hart was gay fine okay whatever had louis known in those years hed lived here in a drunken stupor had trey ever known nolas voice but treys words repeating to me what shed heard trey say to hart if it hadnt been for daddy i wouldnt have had to leave a glimmer of a scenario pulled at my thoughts hart had a terrible secret to keep ivalou purcell who had just redefined barking up the wrong tree said hart wasnt around when shed come here in that longago storm what had she said that drunken louis was crying and saying hart was gone oh god where had hart gone why would he be out in a hurricane why would louis be upset over hart being gone and the corollary question the one that i stupidly should have known was the key what the hell was rennie clifton doing in those woods during a storm why would she be out there why would anyone be out in those woods perhaps looking for a bunch of stupid boys sitting out natures fury in a rackety tree house knowing that their leader was your drunken friends son that was one good reason and if a cleaning girl who maybe learned your secret was out there too thomasina cliftons wry scratchy voice came to my ear she always liked having a man she couldnt have and nola telling me about trey and harts conversation where trey had asked does anyone else know and hart answering only steven teague i felt ill voices sounded in my head not giving me concrete evidence but trying to pull together the tangled threads of now and then i felt a tightening in my throat as though the connecting strings of rennie and clevey and trey and hart and steven were strangling me the door to harts house opened and in the sudden brightness i saw steven teague step out he and hart talked briefly then steven stepped away and jaunted toward his volvo there was no parting kiss on the porch of course notthis was mirabeau i leaned against the tree shielding myself from the light stevens car purred into life and he turned the headlights sweeping the broad tree id hidden behind and then tore off down the road i stayed put peering around the trunk only to see the hesitation of lights as steven got out unlooped the gate drove through halted again and shut and secured the hasp then his volvo turned and tore off toward town its lights flickering as it passed through copses of trees hart went back inside back inside his safe warm home while near this creek trey lay dead but hart had a clearcut alibi for treys death i shuddered in the evening chill i stood anger and confusion coursing through me i needed to head back to town get franklin bedloe tell my suspicions to junebug but i didnt have a shred of proof and i didnt have transport home and i wanted to deal with hart quadlander on my own terms i hiked back up from the trees only glancing once toward the cross that marked treys body i carefully cleaned my boots scraping the mud off on a heavy gnarled root that looked like a demons finger i felt a huge hot anger in me but my movements were calm and measured before i knew it i was pressing the doorbell it felt warm beneath my fingertips and i froze a smile into place hart looked surprised to see me but his face broke into a grin hey jordy how are you i made myself sound hearty and slightly annoyed well hart fair to middling but ive gotten a flat tire down near your gate could i borrow your phone hey sure cmon in he said and opened the door wide i hope im not interrupting your dinner i said nah not quite yet i was gonna throw a steak on the grill in a few minutes though i was just gonna have a drink and turn on the tv you want a drink id followed him into the nicely furnished expansive den preternaturally my eyes absorbed each detail hard wood floors polished to shine a stone fireplace with a blaze roaring merrily away a comfortable couch its upholstery decorated with indian totems and a matching armchair a james michener novel facedown on the ottoman a glassfront bureau with rifles lined up in it like sticks a secretary of glossy wood an empty ice bucket cans of soda and a bottle of bourbon and a bookcase topped with photos of harts parents shyly smiling louis standing soberly by a prize stallion and trey as a boy cowboy hat jaunty on his head grinning with mock innocence jordy you want a drink hart offered again i glanced at the secretary hed converted to a dry bar nothing cold therehed have to go to the kitchen id like a beer please sure coming right up he sauntered off to the kitchen keeping up a running chatter about town and country that i ignored the key in the bureau was old but it rotated easily you dont live out in the country and make your firearms hard to grab i yanked out the first rifle and cracked it open to check it was loaded it was thank you god i was about to have a shocking talk with someone whod been guarding secrets for decades i needed something more persuasive than my winsome smile when hart came back into the den laughing and talking about some idiotic story about nola kinnard going shopping i had the rifle firmly and steadily aimed at his chest he jerked as though id already shot him dont move i ordered he froze the bottle of beer slipped nervelessly from his fingers and shattered on the wooden floor jordy good god look what you made me do is this a joke harts eyes were wide with shock no its not i shook my head slowly put your hands up and dont make any sudden moves move away from the door sit over here on the couch jordy i know how to use this hart rememberyou taught me my own daddy didnt cotton to hunting but trey did and you took us out when trey and i were fourteen you taught me how to shoot my voice dripped with bitterness it didnt sound like me talking but some stranger whod stepped into my skin okay okay he moved slowly toward the couch keeping his hands still and sat down now whats got you so upset just your recent activities hart oh and some ancient pastimes too like killing poor rennie clifton he took a long steadying breath i dont know what you mean i aimed the gun at his crotch he tensed yeah you do you killed her you killed clevey you killed trey you shot junebug no no fright made his breathing hard dont you lie to me hart dont you go pretending all these years that youre an upstanding southern gentleman when youre a goddamned liar and murderer i stared at him along the sight i didnt just now get here trey i saw you and steven teague exchanging endearments he shivered his dark eyes open pools of shock listen jordy i dont know what you think you saw i moved the rifle and fired a vase five feet to his left shattered into powder the bullets percussive scream deafening in the room ill give hart credit thoughhe didnt scream his eyes were tightly shut but he opened them slowly i pumped the rifle silence hung between us for long seconds i dont care about your sexual orientation hart truly i dont but i have a theory about what might have happened in this house twenty years ago im going to share it with you youre going to listen you were a happy family here you and this man named louis you hired and his son trey three decent fellows except louis had a bit of a drinking problem he wasnt a fellow to take much responsibility for his actions and when a pretty girl caught his eye when she came here with her mother to do some work he decided to have her hart didnt move a muscle so louis and rennie had a little affair she got pregnant you found out that put a crimp in your plans because you and louis were already lovers jordy hear me out hart oh you dont have a choice about that i forgot i smiled tightly its just a guess but im trying to think why you might have reason to kill rennie clifton lets say you and louis were lovers your devotion to his memory has always been unusually strong and he was a roughandtumble man whod take pleasure in something and not feel much guilt over it or maybe he didand that fueled his drinking and it might explain why youd keep a drunk like louis on your payroll for so long but louis liked women too after all hed produced trey and so he took another lover maybe in an effort to prove something to himself he picked rennie shed told her mama shed gotten involved with a man she couldnt have her mama thought that meant a white man but it meant more than that it meant a man who loved another man i shook my head how did you keep trey from knowing did he no hart spoke so softly i could barely hear his eyes never wavered from mine no trey didnt know he didnt know about me or rennie or his daddy so rennie is pregnant with your lovers child now youll have to help me out here hart the hurricane comes louis is drunk you get suspicious that treys pulling a stunt somewhere in the storm maybe at his favorite treehouse hangout so you go out to the woods and get rennie to come along with you and you kill her thats not it he croaked put the gun down please jordan weve known each other forever please the rifle didnt budge my arm shouldve felt tired but it didnt i felt strangely perversely alive his life was in my hands and i felt sickly drunk with power i wanted this to be over tell me hart his voice broke and he spoke slowly the truth rising to the surface like a pustule rennie found out about louis and me louis told her when he was dead drunk i didnt know she volunteered to go with me to look for trey and you boys when we got out to the woods away from louis she told me she knew what i was and that if i didnt drop louis shed tell the town i panicked she was vicious horrible said shed make sure everyone in townd know about me theyd all hate me for what i was his face pained with the memory before i knew it id picked up a heavy branch and i hit her with it i just meant to scare her let her know she couldnt mess with me i wasnt even trying to hit her in the head just scare her i swear she fellso totally so suddenly i couldnt believe id killed her i just wanted her to shut up to leave louis and me alone so i left her out in the storm i hurried back to the farm louis had passed out from drink he didnt remember that rennie and i headed out together two thin tears ran down his face i eased my hold on the rifle now that hed confessed the tensiond leaked out of the room like air from an old balloon and clevey did he see you out in the storm no his voice was wooden but he told me he decided to investigate rennies death he was a strange man doing rotten stuff one day trying to make up for it with kindness the next he wanted to make up for blackmailing i already know clevey was a blackmailer hart he started but i said nothing further no need to drag poor daviss name into this fascinating conversation hart swallowed thickly so for penance he wanted to find out if rennie had been murdered he said he got suspicious when he was writing the anniversary piece on the hurricane and he found old notes on her file at the coroners that indicated she was pregnant when she died and of course there was never any reason given for her to be out in the woods during the storm i felt ill clevey was not the person i thought he was but then few people of my extended acquaintance seemed to be these days so how did he make the connection between rennie and you why would he share these suspicions with you hart i dont know he didnt look in my face this didnt make sense i tightened my grip on the rifle clevey told trey that revenge was sweet if he gave it half a chance clevey wanted trey to participate in some blackmail scheme i think trey didnt he told clevey the past was past you know anything about that can i have a drink please jordy no you may not i answered politely you killed clevey to keep him from blackmailing you didnt you hart anger colored harts face keep him from it hed already bled me dry over six years jordy i couldnt do anything else most of my moneys gone all ive got left is the farm the last time i gave him money he bragged he was going to make what hed done to me right by exposing whoever killed rennie he didnt know yet it was me i felt confused he hadnt suspected about rennies death for six years the past six years thats when trey left so whyever trey left clevey knew about it too yes yes hart yelled in frustration as the walls long built around his secrets continued their inexorable tumble what happened hart i remembered eds comment in the library clevey said he was the last fellow to see trey in mirabeau hart stared at me with weary eyes not hateful not bitter youve gotten so smart what do you reckon happened i didnt speak for a moment and the only sound was the logs crackling in the fire you and louis he found out about you worse hart stared at the bright orange embers of wood burning into ash trey and cleveythey walked in on us he fell silent in bed i ventured do you want me to draw you a goddamned picture jordan louis and i had argued wed gotten drunk and made up we were in the kitchen trey walked in and i was in his fathers mouth clevey saw too got the picture now i took a long bracing breath and thats when he left us left my sister left his boy hart wiped the tears from his face with the back of his hand yes he turned around without a word and walked out i didnt see him again until he and nola and scott drove up to the house last week hed forgiven me he didnt want to hate anymore what treyd told sister rang true hed left on terrible impulse for the wrong reasons and hed been too scared to come home afraid we wouldnt want him afraid to deal with his father for a man like trey what hed seen represented the ultimate in betrayal and pain and clevey knew all this he never told that hart said slowly would have cut into his profit margin i had no money left to give him and i had treys forgiveness clevey said hed take the farm i said no he said yes so i shot him and your new lover was cleveys therapist how convenient clevey was busy trying to justify the rotten things he did booze and therapy seemed to be the easiest ways for him he never told steven he was a blackmailer though but i had so steven kept nudging him toward stopping the blackmail it didnt work steven left here after rennie died howd he fit in i knew him from austin ii used to go to austin sometimes and drink in the gay bars id met him there wed fooled around and he moved out here but he couldnt take the pressure of being closeted in a little town i was trying to work out my relationship with louis so steven left i ran into him again several months ago and he decided to try mirabeau again hes not involved in any of this not directly he doesnt know that i killed clevey or rennie i thought of stevens unwillingness to discuss cleveys case with junebug i bet he suspects you killed clevey just leave him alone but steven knew why trey left how did you know that nola has big ears how nice that steven has been counseling mark over his fathers murder when he knows more about trey than mark does i made myself quit gritting my teeth are we done you can go ahead and shoot me now no i want to know how you killed trey i didnt i told you i was over in fayette county yes weve heard your alibi how much did you pay off the horse dealer there to back up your story you shut up hart yelled youre not so smart jordan no matter how bright you think youve gotten since youve aimed a gun at me listen to me i didnt kill trey do you really think having gotten rid of one blackmailer id put myself in a vulnerable position of paying someone in fayette county for an alibi that wouldve just been an invitation to get more money extorted out of me he had a point i wasnt sure i was buying it tell me how you did it hart whyd you keep score in treys blood i didnt goddamn it jordan i didnt shoot junebug and i didnt kill trey why would i why would i kill trey hed forgiven me nola told you as much hed come home hed come to see me he wanted nothing to do with cleveys schemes hed nearly died and he didnt want to be away from the people who had loved him hart stood and i motioned him back down with the rifle no he yelled in defiance go ahead and shoot me do it for me you dont think that ive wanted to kill myself for gods sake i didnt enjoy killing rennie clifton i didnt even mean to and killing clevey was horriblei used his own gun on him he begged me not to he said he was sorry he cried for his mother and i still forced myself to shoot him im a quadlander for gods sake i killed a girl and paid money to a scumball because i didnt want anyone to know that a quadlander was gay but ive made myself into something truly awful a murderer so just shoot me now shoot me now he sank back onto the couch broken i lowered the rifle he was right about trey his motive to kill him had vanished with treys forgiveness look at me hart he glanced up seeing me and the rifle lowered you believe me yes i managed thank you im sorry about the girl and im sorry about clevey im glad you know i wouldnt have hurt trey i didnt answer motive opportunitythink and a collage came to me like the lightning thatd thundered over mirabeau the past week cracking through the veiling clouds fragments of repeated conversations photos passing through my hands a cryptic message scrawled in blood that i had placed far too much reliance on and treys begged request to my sister before she fled his house it pointed horribly to one person realization hit me with the brute force of a punch i nearly dropped the rifle hart looked at me like he thought i was having a heart attack oh god let me be wrong jordy wheres your phone he pointed i dialed home two rings three my heart stopped and started four hello poteet residence clos voice moderately cheerful a little breathless clo wheres mark he and bradley took off with scott i forced breath into my lungs whered they go over to scotts i believe clo listen this is very important if they come back make sure they stay put the boys must stay where theyre at okay jordy sure fine ill be home shortly i hung up and dialed information please god let nola have a phone already the operator had just come on when i heard a knock at harts door and a timid hello hart sweetie its nola i slammed the phone down hart and i looked at each other i kept waiting for him to scream out a crazy man was holding him at gunpoint he stayed quiet watching me with old eyes nola bounded into the den smiling at hart not seeing me and the rifle at first hey there sugar pie you dont mind a little company for a while her voice faded as she saw me with the rifle hooked under my arm the haggard hart the bulleted vase what the hells this nola where are the boys she pointed at my rifle you answer me first whats that for never mind where are mark and scott she pointed over her shoulder they wanted to go down by the creek down by the graves i bolted past her shoving her out of my way and dashed into the dark night cloying mud pulled at my boot heels as i ran from the house mark mark get to the house i screamed hoping he could still hear me the clouds scudded over the moon darkening the night into pitch the porch light from harts house provided hardly enough illumination to see my own legs as i tore across the gravel road down the creekside to where two generations of slocum men lay in eternal slumber one in murdered sleep i couldnt let it happen again branches tore at my face as i ran through the woods down to the creek i stumbled over a ropy mass of roots and cussing skidded into the mud tumbling head over heels the rifle flew out of my hands and slid into the darkness still yelling marks name i pulled myself to my feet trying to spot the rifle and a bullet exploded into the tree next to me spraying bark and oak i went back down to my knees and scrabbled behind the tree i could see vague outlines near the graves of louis and trey two maybe three boys who else was there uncle jordy mark hollered stay back stay back scott you asshole dont shoot its uncle jordy scott listen to me listen you dont have to do this lets talk scotts voice when it came back was petulant i dont want to talk dont run at me in the dark you scared me sorry i called back of course i wasnt but while scott kinnard was blasting away at trees he wasnt hitting human flesh lets talk okay tentatively i stood and began to walk down toward their voices wondering if each step would be met with a bullet i needed the rifle but i couldnt spend minutes searching for it the night held quiet scott let me within ten feet of him and as moonlight dimly slid along us as a cloud parted i saw mark standing over his grandfathers grave keeping a trembling bradley an arms length behind him go away jordy scotts voice was toneless not scarednot crazedand that was more chilling he sensed his control and he had a childs smugness the in his hand was rock still i kept my voice steady and assured no scott i wont go away if youre going to kill mark you have to kill me too and your mom and hart are up at the house i dont think you can make this look like an accident kill me i heard mark repeat softly i couldnt see his eyes but the realization charged the air between us he wants to kill me scott listen to me this wont work i know you killed trey what i heard mark sputter thats a lie i loved trey scott shrieked he was pointing a gun at me hed killed a man but he still sounded like a child an angry temperamental boy whod lashed out with rage at a wish denied you loved him too much i started hearing nola and hart rushing toward us in the undergrowth nola calling her sons name you loved him but he wasnt going to stay he wanted to go back to my sister and mark and you couldnt stand that you couldnt stand that he was going to be like your moms other boyfriends and leave you so you shot him dead scott didnt speak mark seemed frozen in horror nola breathless managed to grab at my arm youre lying lying scott wouldnt hurt anyone then have him give you the gun i said calmly and well go back up to the house and talk about it nolas fingers tightened on my arm the moon glimmered from behind a wall of cloud and i could see her weathered face staring at her son in abject shock scotty honey give mom the gun she took a step forward no stay back mom please go back to the house honey no not after i did it for you for us he waved wildly with the pistol that seemed too big for his hands for us nola repeated cold shock edging her voice scott hush up right now you dont know what youre saying scott harts voice solid commanding the voice that had lectured trey and me on shooting guns and riding properly stop this foolishness right now son put that gun down you shut up scott demanded he turned entreating eyes back toward his mother i had to mom i had to he didnt want us no more he wanted arlene andhe moved the gun in a vicious swath toward markand he wanted you you i was the one that was supposed to be his son not you anger made his voice ragged baby please nola entreated scott ignored her i glanced at mark he still seemed transfixed by scott like the injured bird gazing steadily at the slithering cobra he attempted to step back and stumbled into bradley who cowered behind him stay put scott ordered him you stay right there scott i said quietly he swung the gun back toward me quick and sure if only one of us could get at himi prayed wed still be able to talk him down you tell me how did you know scott demanded why so you can shoot me too youll have to shoot us all scott and i dont think you want to do that i dont really think you want to hurt anyone anymore i will his voice broke with tension i have and i will why dont you ask that stupid police chief of yours i swallowed you were the only one who heard clevey and trey argue you were the only onebesides hart that knew they shared any sort of dark secret in their lives before either of them died and that saturday morning you came home early from the basketball court so when you heard trey pledge his undying love to my sister and say he wanted her and mark back you decided to kill him and you decided to make it look like hed died because of some connection to clevey you heard the conversation between him and my sister but they didnt know you were in the houseat least my sister didnt and when she left you got treys gun and shot him in the back then you painted that down in blood to suggest that treys murder was part of a pattern that started with cleveys death then you shot junebug to keep the pattern going no one would look twice at you that way although a man you loved as your daddy was about to drop you and your mother no nola moaned no please scotty no mama i couldnt let him hurt you anymore scotts voice broke tearfully we were gonna be a family you decided youd pretend to be friendly to our family friendly in particular to mark become his pal spend time with him you brought back those photos you hinted that treyd corresponded with my mother knowing full well that shes sick now and couldnt say she had or hadnt written trey but there was no way in hell that she would have been writing trey in secret not my mother i should have seen through you then but maybe i wanted to believe that trey still cared about our family you wanted us to trust you like you so maybe when you got your revenge on mark when you killed him or hurt him it would look like an accident hart coughed and i glanced at him you broke into our house hart looking for those letters you couldnt take a chance that scott was lying you had to see if there was any written evidence about what trey had seen between you and his father hart nodded mutely i turned back and my heart stopped scott leveled the pistol directly at marks head mark pushed a crying bradley back and stared at scott with hate if trey wants you so bad you can just go to him now scott shrieked and i rushed forward yelling at scott the cold eye of the s barrel swung at me and a strong arm shoved me to one side diving for the gun light exploded in the night nola screamed bradley screeched birds burst from the trees in a spinning wheel of caws i pulled my face from the mud scrabbling madly toward scott he was on the ground wrestling with mark for the gun both had their hands on the weapon and i reached between them yanking it away you killed him you killed my daddy mark screamed into scotts sobbing face pounding him with his fists adrenaline powered me hard and i jerked mark away with one arm getting myself between him and scott nola collapsed to her sons side cradling his sobbing form in her arms oh my baby oh my baby she cried why did you have to do this i swung around holding mark tight to me bradley knelt by hart lying flat on the ground i hurried to him and saw the blood gurgling out of the horrible wound in his chest he looked at me life ebbing in his eyes i shoved mark toward the house call run hurry mark turned wordless and sprinted away hart hold on help is coming i begged him no mark marks okay hes okay you saved him mark tell him sorry his daddy all these years my fault no it wasnt i squeezed his hand tight it wasnt your fault now you have to hold on you have to he pressed my fingers in answer the darkness of the night became the darkness of his eyes the breath ceased i stayed kneeling in the mud by his side nola held scott tight knowing he would soon be pulled from her arms he did not try to run but he stared at me with eyes of ice i sometimes hold it half a sin to put in words the grief i feel for words like nature half reveal and half conceal the soul within alfred lord tennyson in memoriam the january wind blew cold as i stood on the porch staring out across the pasture and down to the river harts family had really planned right all those years ago turning the house just the right angle so that on a gloriously clear day you had a panorama of shapeless woods and squared meadows and a ribbon of river i leaned against the cold wood of the porch the wind gusting moved the dry grass in the fields and carried the lonesome cry of a migrating bird far in the sky they were familiar sounds and i could nearly imagine that the wind also sustained the whinnying of excited horses the thunder of hooves the laughter of a young trey slocum and jordan poteet as they rode across the pastures of harts farm marks farm i corrected myself the words sounded odd to me i turned back to the door to see just what was taking the young squire so long through the door i could see him talking quietly on the cordless phone i tapped and he held up a finger just a minute i turned back and watched the bare branches of the trees sway in the wind that night six weeks ago seemed horribly close the cutting wind feeling like deaths finger on my face the ambulance and police cars roared up the roadid sent bradley to open the gate for them but for hart it was minutes too late the bullet had been too cruel scott had surrendered without struggle he was in a nearby juvenile detention facility since he was only fourteen scott would be tried as a juvenile since he was under fifteen and obviously a child whod suffered terribly due to a lack of role models i spat in the grass hed killed two men and nearly killed a third scott seemed hardly childlike to me id gotten to where i could hardly stand to watch his grandstanding attorneys on the nightly news other adjustments werent easy either thomasina clifton finally learned the truth about rennies death id sat with her while junebug and i relayed harts confession her eyes slowly had filled with tears and i wondered if it was the first time in many years that shed wept for her lost daughter her other children had closed around thomasina like human armor and id stayed away leaving her to her rediscovered grief knowing that her daughter didnt have to die that rennies toying with louis and harts life had gotten her murdered was a fresh agony its a hard thing to hear that about your child it was much worse telling truda shivers about her son davis ed junebug and i had talked about it and we went over together to tell her what would come out at the inquest of harts death junebug did most of the talking and it was possibly the most horrible conversation id ever heard in my life as he detailed the moral and legal crimes of her son you arent talking about my boy truda had finally said her voice a faint whisper my boy wouldnt do such things her denial of cleveys rottenness was thickly impenetrable after a while we gave up shes a woman i still care about but i know better than to bang my head against a wall in her mind trudas constructed a heroic end for her boy as the dedicated reporter and none of us are allowed to edit it i felt bad for both those mothers losing their children we sometimes forget that everyone was once somebodys little baby cooing up at a smiling parent from the warmth of a crib one person not cooing at me at least for a week was candace she didnt appreciate me runmng off to confront hart or my faceoff with scott after she chewed me out thoroughly i got a long hug where she made sure i was okay im forgiven for the momentand were heading out on a caribbean cruise to patch up any existing wounds in our relationship part of my penance is letting her pay the way mark came out onto the porch carrying one of the wreaths sony that was bradley he wants me to come over for dinner this week hows he doing davis and bradley had finally moved back into their home cayla was deep in treatment for her anger over bradleys condition and her tendency to beat the stuffing out of her husband davis claimed he wanted to make the marriage work but i thought the statement rang hollow a few weeks not walking on tiptoes around his wife had been nirvana hed seen there was a life outside of abuse bradleys fine mark shrugged he says hes supposed to go talk with steven teague this afternoon hes embarrassed though some kid was teasing him about seeing a shrink male pride never ends it had kept hart a slave to blackmail and turned him killer made clevey an avaricious criminal who fumblingly attempted to make amends for his own selfesteem driven trey away from a family that loved him kept davis in bondage to a sick woman and made scott believe murder was a solution i didnt have much male pride left but id vowed not to let it shape my life im sure steven will be able to make him feel better i pointed at the wreath i got the others here lets go mark followed me off the porch and i saw that as always he had to turn and look back at the house i still cant believe it that this is mine it had been the final shock after several days of catastrophes harts will was short and to the point all his worldly possessions were left solely to mark slocum grandson of his longtime friend louis slocum despite harts claims that clevey shivers had bled him dry quadlander pockets still went deep the land the house the horses the equipment stocks and bonds and enough cash squirreled away in a houston bank to make you choke mark was now quite possibly the wealthiest boy in bonaparte county of course my name was in harts will as well he named sister and me cotrustees for marks money until mark attained the age of twentyone when good sense would allegedly prevail the next seven years might be long ones i considered well it is yours mark and its a responsibility the horse farms not just a home its a business a business thats expensive to run i know but theres money to run it isnt there to hire people to run it for us ii dont want to sell it id feel funny about selling the land that daddy and hart and papaw slocum are buried on okay we hadnt talked so frankly about his inheritance since mark learned he was an unexpected legatee we dont have to sell it then lets talk about the house he stopped for a moment getting a better grip on the wreath he carried and brushed his dark hair out of his eyes for a second he was the image of his daddy walking these fields and woods twenty years back i didnt want him to sell the land either we could live out here mark suggested slowly i didnt answer for several seconds mamas house is ours too mark sister and i grew up there i dont know how id feel about moving here couldnt we give it a try mamaw might like it out here and its nice in the country we could ride whenever we want to and harts housei mean my houseis bigger than our house as ive mentioned before i hate when teenagers are right and wouldnt it be a special challenge to live in a house that a teenager owned we stopped our discussion our walk had taken us to the three graves that lay in the woods a healthy distance above the creek louis in the middle trey on one side and hart on the other today would have been harts birthday and sister had quietly suggested getting his grave a nice wreath women always remember such kindnesses men generally dont mark had pointed out that a wreath just on harts marker would look odd so we got big wreaths for his daddy and papaw as well mark carefully placed a wreath on harts tombstone securing it into the ground so the gusty winds wouldnt topple it he helped me put the laurels on the other two graves the stone markers felt icy cold against our fingers we stood together for several silent moments only the wind spoke a low gentle lament finally mark asked whyd hart do it uncle jordy whyd he the to save me whyd he leave me everything i put a hand on his shoulder well hart cared about your granddaddy and your father very much and he cared about you too i think he felt bad for you that you didnt have them around when you were growing up and he didnt have family to leave this to so he left it to you but to die for me i turned mark to face me he wanted you to live very badly thats all that matters ill forever be grateful to him i turned my face into the cooling wind why did hart live the way he did in secretiveness and sadness why had he never given the townor at least the people who cared about hima chance to accept him as he was i wondered how very very different events might have been if hart had thought his friends more generoushearted or had we given him reason to fear our rejection with unthinking jokes or comments or slurs mark leaned down and gently touched the turned soil on the grave it was a gesture of timid tenderness id seen him make on top of mamas head happy birthday hart thank you for my life his voice broke and he stood turning his face against my jacket i watched the top of his dark head then stared at treys grave my teeth clenching together we stood for a few more minutes till the dropping temperatures ushered us toward the house we walked back my arm around marks shoulders the sun shone brightly as we went up the porch steps mark held the door for me as i went into his new house kind of funny mark said never to have lived here he glanced back across the land and the big empty sky because it feels like coming home
