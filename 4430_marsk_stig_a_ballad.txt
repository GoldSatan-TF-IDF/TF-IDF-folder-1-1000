action high shall never die whatever dastard lips may say twill wake up bold from out the mould and boldly speak on the judgment day then speed thee knight with thee is right avenge the heart which loves thee dear on earthly shore though we meet no more we shall meet again in the sky so clear part iii theres many i ween in denmark green who all to be masters now desire to ribe old their course they hold and there they buy them strange attire there they prepare such clothes as wear the holy monks of orders grey and this theyve done in the hope alone their liege and sovereign to betray they watchd him sly they watchd him nigh whether the king went down or up but best they sped in the hour so dread when the king would ride to tinderup the cause of the same was an injurd damebold stig the marshals lovely wife with ranild a plot she up has got which cost king erik his youthful life ranild the loon her sisters son ranild who servd king erik near tells him with art of hind and hart and of silvan game to the hunter dear to thee i can show both buck and doe within the bonny green wood that play with greyhounds tried we forth will ride sir king not distant is the way then erik he bade his serving lad to saddle him straight his good grey steed to jutlands ting will ride your king and see how things in jutland speed and he order gave to his courtiers brave that they should before to viborg hie no thought he had that ranild the lad was brooding a subtle treachery but ranild rode by a secret road and he bade the monks themselves prepare i tell to ye for a verity that ranild practisd cunning rare now after the hart and hind they start and after the nimble roe as well the long days space endurd the chase till murky night upon them fell then in faultering guise the king he cries for his heart i ween was full of dread god help us now and saint gertrude thou we fairly out of the path have sped then about he spied and about he pried amid the bushes so dark and drear till sight he got of a little cot where fire and light were burning clear and into that house king erik goes his luck the monarch there will try and he was aware of a damsel fair no fairer ever had met his eye and her to his breast the king he pressd and kissd her oft with fond delight my lovely may i beg and pray that thou wilt sleep with me this night then answerd and said the woodland maid with a burst of laughter wild and loud in mind i keep how thou didst sleep with ingeborga fair and proud answer i pray and fairly say how many maids hast thou sir king deserted and left of fame bereft for that will death upon thee bringif that thou know fair maid i trow that thou canst tell much more to me now tiding give how long i shall live and say how many my foemen be with solemn air said the maiden fair hark thou to me and believe my word for life thou must look to the little crook whereon doth hang thy trusty sword the knobs on thy belt of tough tough felt the foemans number will tell i ween beware i say of monk hoods grey concealing warriors stern and keen to catch the maid the king essayd his heart was bent yet more on learning then slipped away the woodland fay suddenly into vapour turning as long as stayd with him the maid both light and fire his sight did cheer but as soon as soon as she was gone with ranild he stood in the bush so drear then the king for advice to ranild cries and ranild the traitor answerd thus from out this place our way well trace for here no moon can shine on us if i be right a hamlet hight grey tinderup not far doth lie this night wed best in tinderup rest my liege i think for a certainty and thither well ride and there well bide until the moon has risen on high by marys might no mortal wight will do thee any injury so they ride away to tinderup grey and loud for lodging lodging shout but they came so late that every gate was lockd and fires and lights put out then their steeds they turn to tinderup barn no mortal knew that they were there to the king i wot the thought came not that he was now to his end so near but eriks breast was not at rest and thus to ranild the lad he cried o make the door both fast and sure i fast and sure in thee confide do thou the door with a stake secure ive ever found thee faithful yet in mind i hold that stig is bold and oft i think upon his threat ive driven a pin the floor within and placd a balk against the door by mary bright no mortal wight to move that mighty balk has powermarsk stig is hot i deny it not and wondrous words he thunders out but be of good cheer my master dear he oer his table sits no doubt the lapwing bird each spot can guard upon the face of the verdant field except alone the knoll whereon its nest the bird is wont to build no pin or stake did ranild take he was i wean a lying cheat i tell to ye for a verity he only took two straws of wheat and for all his talk twas no thick balk he placd for the doors security but a wheatsheaf light which the gust of night from the door removed instantly scarce on the groun had they laid them down on the groun of the barn so cold and hard when of ingeborg dame the avengers came spurring amain to the peasants gard into the yard came riding hard the fatal monks of orders grey no pause they made to the place they sped where well they knew that the monarch lay upon the door their blows they shower with faulchion struck they and with spear come out come out sir king they shout the dame has sent to greet thee here to them in reply did ranild cry and thus the ranild youth began no king is here no king is near no king nor any such a man then swift and fast sir ranild cast over his lord both straw and hay but points with his hand to the inrushing band the spot where the hapless monarch lay they extinguishd straight the wax light great that burnd the head of the monarch oer then round the king they stood in a ring with blades athirst for his dearest gore o ranild hear my servant dear if thou wilt only fight for me my sister bright to thee ill plight and she thy wedded wife shall be then he hewd for his lord on the broad broad board and on the balk he hewd so brave he hewd hither and he hewd thither he fought for his master like a knave full in the breast their stabs they addressd as near to the heart as well might be with wounds so sore forty and more miserably murderd the king was heat him they bored with spear and sword no rest to him the monks allowd when done was the deed each took his steed and away with frantic fury rode this happd on the night of cecily bright the season it was so bright and holy the king is dead his blood is shed but ingeborg still is melancholy now who will bear to viborg fair the corpse of the king across the green and who will go with the tale of woe to skanderborough where sits the queen then ride would none to viborg town and attend the corse across the green but rose up amain a little swain and he would ride to the danish queen uprose amain the little swain and not long idle i ween he stayd he tore from the grey the saddle away and that on the back of the white he laid hail gracious queen so fair of mien who sittest clad in scarlet red a traitorous train the

fills my heart with grief and pain but thee ill prize for thy advice and clothe and feed thee whilst i reign it happd on the night of cecily bright in that sweet season blest and holy vengeance has sped the king is dead but ingeborg still is melancholy part iv there were seven and seven times twenty that met upon the verdant wold say what emprise shall we devise now denmarks lord is stark and cold our lord weve slain a corse he lies the band of peace we thus have riven within the land we can make no stand from land and friends we now are driven but we will ride to skanderborgand a visit to the queen will pay well see how fares amid her cares the dame ere we depart for aye it was her wont to jeer and scoff but now therewith she must have done the fire is come to the scorners home and pity her i ween can none marsk stig he into the saddle sprang for his daring deed he felt no sorrow he spurrd his horse and bent his course with his armed host to skanderborough it was the danish queen so fine she lookd from out the window high o there doth ride marsk stig she cried with his knight in iron panoply ha welcome stig thou selfmade king mayst quickly meet the guerdon due if god doth spare the youthful heir full bitter fruit hell make thee chew lady i am no selfmade king although it please thee so to say but i can name the knight of fame who last with thee fair lady lay
