william dietrich dark winter chapter one sometimes you have to go into nothing to get what you want that was the jed lewis theory anyway west texas oil patch saudi the north slope hadnt worked for him yet but one kind of extreme had led to another one kind of quest to its polar opposite sometimes life patterns like that when you keep changing your mind about what it is you do want so now hed come to the very end of the world and was peering over its edge too late to turn back hoping that in the farthest place on earth hed finally fit in atone to himself for his own confusion of purpose belong maybe the pole jim sparco had seduced him feels closer to the stars than anyplace on earth its high desert a desert of ice and the airs so dry that it feels like you can eat the stars bites of candy the climatologist had gripped his arm the south pole lewis its there you realize how cold the universe really is the money had almost been secondary theyd understood each other sparco and he this longing for the desolate places a place uncomplicated pure except for their rock of course that raised questions it was their pebble their tumor their apple the world is round but it has an edge a cold crustal wrinkle called the transantarctic range runs for more than a thousand miles and divides antarctica in two on the north side of the mountains is a haunting but recognizable landscape of glacier and mountain and frozen ocean an ice age world yes but still a world our world to its south toward the pole is an ice cap so deep and vast and empty as to seem unformed and unimagined a vacuum a blank the white clay of god lewis crossed in the sinking light of an antarctic autumn he was exhausted from thirty hours of flying constricted by thirtyfive pounds of polar clothing and weary of the noisy dimness of the lc military transport plane its webbed seats pinching circulation and its schizophrenic ventilation blowing hot and cold he was also entranced by beauty the sun was slowly dipping toward sixmonth night and the aqua crevasses and sugared crags below were melodramatic with blaze and shadow golden photons bouncing off virginal snow created a hazed fire frozen seas looked like cracked porcelain unnamed peaks reared out of fogs thick as frosting and glaciers grinned with splintery teeth attached to blue gums it was all quite primeval untrodden and unspoiled a white board on which to redraw yourself the kind of place where he could be whatever he made himself whatever he announced himself to be the transantarctic range is like a dam however holding behind it a plateau of twomilethick polar ice like a police line braced against a pressing crowd a hundred thousand years of accumulated snowfall a few peaks at the edge of the ice plateau bravely poke their snouts up as if to tread water but then farther south relief disappears altogether the glaciers vanish so do ridges crevasses and theatrical light what follows is utter flatness a frozen mesa as big as the contiguous united states when the airplane crossed the mountains it entered something fundamentally different lewis realized it was then that his excitement began to turn to disquiet imagine an infinite sheet of paper no not infinite because the curve of the earth provides a kind of boundary except that the horizon itself is foggy and indistinct with floating ice crystals suspended like diamond dust so that the snow merges without definition into pale sky there was nothing to see from the tiny scratched windows of the national guard transport no relief no reference point no imperfection when he thought he saw undulations in the snow the load master informed him he was merely looking at the shadow of cirrus clouds far overhead when he thought he saw a track across the snow left by a tractor or snowmobile perhaps the load master pointed to a contrail being left by an outgoing transport his track was the shadow of that dissipating streak across the sky lewis moved among the pallets of cargo from window to window waiting for something to happen nothing did the plane lumbered on cold slithering along its fuselage he checked his watch as if it still meant anything in a place where the sun went haywire and looked out again nothing he looked out a different window no movie would start on the blank screen below no progress could be discerned he searched a sky and plateau that seemed blank mirrors of each other vainly searching for some rip some imperfection some reassurance that he was someplace nothing he sat on his web seat and chewed a cold lunch after a drag of time the guardsman cuffed his shoulder and lewis stood again looking where the sergeant pointed far away there was a pimple on the vastness a tiny bug a freckle a period with a white runway attached to make a kind of exclamation mark amundsenscott base named by americans for the norwegian who got there first in and the hardluck brit who froze to death weeks later after seconding at point zero lewis made out a bottlecap of a dome that sheltered the south poles central buildings and an orbit of smaller structures like specks of sand from the air the human settlement was remarkable only for its insignificance the buildings fit in a circle about a mile wide altogether the load master shouted to him over the roar of the engines doesnt look like much does it lewis didnt reply you staying the winter he shrugged glad its you and not me they buckled in the snow seeming to swell up to meet them lewiss heart accelerating during that disquieting gap between air and ground and then with a thump and a bang they were down swerving slightly as the skis skidded on the ice the plane shuddered as it taxied continuing to vibrate when it stopped because the pilots didnt dare shut down the engines lewis stood stiff and apprehensive he was the only passenger the last arrival of the season an antimigrant swimming against the tide of humans fleeing north well his timing had never been the best the cargo ramp opened to a shriek of white and the cold hit him like a slap it was palpable like a force you waded into we had a fly stowaway from new zealand one time the load master shouted his military mustache almost brushing lewiss ear the propellers were still whirling so the hubs wouldnt freeze and the national guard sergeant needed this intimacy to be heard buzzed like a bastard for three thousand miles when we opened the doors it flew to the light and made it three feet three feet then the fucker dropped like a stone the man laughed dizzy lewis walked out he couldnt get a proper breath there was a crowd of orangeparka people at the edge of the runway waving but fidgety anxious to get away the last of the summer crew going home snow from the prop wash blew over them hazing them as if they were already being erased awkward from his duffel and enormous white plastic polar boots lewis staggered toward the group in seeming supplication a figure detached from the crowd to meet him the mans hood was up and all lewis could see were goggles and frosted beard framed by a ruff of fur lewis had been given the same governmentissue parka hed been told it cost seven hundred dollars and a sacrificial fox jed lewis it was a shout above the noise a nod his own goggles giving the pole a pissyellow tint the man reached not to shake hands but to shoulder the duffel he turned to the others lets move people lets get this cargo off so you can all go home his goggles rotated across their rank taking mental roll wheres tyson there was a long moment of silence goggled heads turning a few smiles of unease and amusement in their cold weather gear everyone looked alike except for strips on their coats with blockletter name tags sulking someone finally called lewiss greeter stiffened there was another silence beneath the drum of the engines someone shrugging his guide sucking in unhappy breath well someone go the hell and find him and tell him to get the damn sled up here so we can get this plane off hes got eight long months to sulk the others shifted uncomfortably the man turned back to lewis not waiting to see if anyone followed his command this way they set off toward the central aluminum geodesic dome half buried now by drifting snow their pace briskly impatient lewis looked back parts of the orangeclad group now breaking off to troop to the plane then ahead to the dome an upended silver saucer dramatic and odd like surplused flotsam from a worlds fair hed read the dimensions fiftyfive feet high a hundred and sixtyfour feet in diameter an american flag snapped at the top its edge ragged its gunshot stutter audible now above the idle of the plane streaks of snow dust curved across the top of the dome in neatly drawn parabolas lewiss nose hairs had already frozen the cold ached in his lungs his goggles were fogging up and his cheeks felt numb hed only been outside a few minutes it was worse than hed expected they descended a snowy ramp to a dark garagesized entrance at the base of the dome lewis mincing in his frankensteinsized boots so he wouldnt fall and slide on his butt his guide paused to wait for him and let their eyes adjust to the dimness inside the door two cavelike corrugated steel arches extended into gloom to his left and right biomed and the fuel arch that way generators and garage over here lewis had a shadowy impression of walls and doors of plywood and steel unpainted and utilitarian before he could peek into the arched tunnels he was led straight ahead the dome where were quartered is this way the overturned bowl shielded the core of the south pole base like a military helmet keeping warmthsucking wind and blowing snow off the metal boxes where people lived three of these boxcarshaped structures colored orange sat on short stilts under its shelter since the base was built on snow the powder didnt stop at the entrance but formed the dome floor drifting over wooden crates and mounding against the orange housing units dirt and grease had colored the snow tan like sand it never melts his guide said scuffing at it the ambient temperature in here is fiftyone below lewis tilted his head back there was a hole at the top of the dome that let in pale light from a remote sky the entire underside of the uninsulated structure was covered with steelgray icicles pointing downward like a roof of nails it was beautiful and forbidding at the same time you didnt finish the roof ventilation someone bumped lewis and he staggered to one side it was another winterover rushing a crate of fresh fruit to the galley before it could harden in the cold sorry freshies are like gold they followed the hurrying man to a freezerlike door and opened it for him to get inside you pulled a metal rod sideways and tugged at a slab like a wall lewis realized that the freezer wasnt inside here it was the outside anything not carried into the orange housing modules would turn hard as a brick they followed the fruit bearer there was a vestibule hung with parkas and beyond it a galley of bright fluorescent light warmth and the excited chatter of more people saying goodbye their duffels were heaped like sandbags people were packed to go his guide let lewiss gear drop with a thud and pushed back his goggles and hood rod cameron station manager hi lewis tried to fix the face but the men in their parkas looked alike he had an impression of beard chapped skin and red raccoon lines where the goggles cut lewis was wondering about the absentee at the plane someone not show up for work cameron frowned he had a look of rugged selfconfidence that came from coping with cold and administration and a hint of strain for the same reason the pole wore on you egos in kindergarten he shook his head my job is to herd cats and im having a bad day we had a little alarm last night alarm the heat went off oh we got it back on oh the station manager studied the newcomer lewis still looked smooth sandyhaired and tanned with the easy tautness of the recreational athlete it would pass you got your file lewis dug in his duffel and fished out a worn manila envelope with employment forms medical records dental x rays and a list of the personal belongings hed shipped to the pole in advance of his own arrival his new boss glanced inside as if to confirm lewiss presence with paper and then put the folder under his arm ive got to go back outside to see this last plane off cameron said ill show you around later but right now its best to just sit and drink lewis looked around the galley in confusion i mean drink water the altitude you feel lousy right its okay fingies are supposed to fingie fngi fucking new guy on the ice thats you lewis failed at a grin latecomer just new everybodys a fingie at first we know were lucky to get you last minute like this jim sparco emailed about you like the second coming i needed a job yeah he explained that i think its cool that you quit big oil cameron gave a nod of approval thats me man of principle lewis had a headache from the altitude course we need their shit to keep from freezing down here not from a wildlife refuge you dont and you just walked out they werent about to give me a helicopter ride that took some guts it had to be done cameron tried to assess the new man lewis looked tired disoriented chest rising and falling half excited and half afraid they all started like that the station manager turned back to the door impatient to get away and considered whether to say anything else ive got to go get the plane off he finally said again you know what that means dont you what that you cant quit down here a stream of people followed cameron out some looking at lewis curiously and others ignoring him the winterovers going to offload the supplies and the last from summer flying home the pole had a brief fourmonth window when weather permitted incoming flights and then in february the last plane left fleeing north like a migrating bird in winter it was too dark to see too windy to keep the ice runway clear and too cold to risk a landing struts could snap hydraulics fail doors fail to open or close the sun set on march the equinox and wouldnt rise again until september from february to october the base was as remote as the moon there were twentysix winterovers who retreated under the dome to maintain its functions and take astronomical and weather readings eight women and eighteen men this year it was like being on a submarine or space station you had to commit the galley had emptied and lewis took a place at a formica table the room was lowceilinged bright and warm a bulletin board was thick with paper a juice dispenser burbled and in the corner a television monitor displayed outside temperatures it was fiftyeight below zero near the runway the breeze lowering the windchill to minus eightyone the reading was an abstraction except for the freezer door hed come through that was old and cold leaked around its edges to rime its inner face with frost the frost reached all the way across it in stripes like fingers the pattern reminded lewis of a giant hand trying to yank the door away drink as much as you can best cure for the altitude lewis looked up it was the cook bald except for a topknot that hung from the back of his head his skull looked knobby as if knocked around more than once and he had a gray mustache and forearms tattooed with a bear and eagle here was somebody easy to remember it doesnt look high thats because its flat youre sitting on ice almost two miles thick our elevation is ninetythree hundred and the thinning of the atmosphere at the poles makes the effective altitude closer to eleven thousand walking out of that transport is like being dumped on the crest of the rockies your body will adjust in a few days i feel hammered the short walk from the plane had made him ill youll be racing around the world before you know it around the world around the stake that marks the pole he sat down wade pulaski chief cook and bottle washer best chef for nine hundred miles i cant claim any farther because cathy costello back at mcmurdo is pretty good too mcmurdo was the main american base in antarctica located on the coast jedediah lewis polar weatherman he shook jedediah your parents religious more like hippies i think when it was a fad but its biblical right youre a prophet oracle of climate change by temporary opportunity rockhound by training and its actually just another name for solomon beloved of the lord so youre wise his head was pounding i take my name as gods little joke what do you mean by rockhound geologist thats my real job so you come to the one place on earth where there arent any rocks doctor bob will have a field day with that one whos doctor bob our new shrink nasa sent him down to do a head job on us before they plant too many people on the space station hes wintering over to write us up while we mess with each others minds he thinks were all escapists lewis smiled rod cameron just told me we cant quit thats what i told doctor bob its like being paid to go to prison and yet we volunteered im on my third season pulaski stretched out his arms in mock enthusiasm as if to claim ownership i cant stay away if the generators stop like they did last night weve got maybe a few hours but we always get them running again whyd they stop some moron turned the wrong valve rod went ballistic which meant nobody was in a mood to confess this morning but it was a stupid annoyance not a threat and youre going to learn that as long as you dont freeze to death things are really good down here especially now that the last of summer camp is leaving and the bureaucrats are ten thousand miles away i give you better food than youd get back home and theres no bullshit at the pole theres no clock to punch no bills no taxes no traffic no newspapers no nothing after today everything calms down and this becomes the sanest place on earth cozier than most families and after eight toasty months you come out with your head straight and your money saved its paradise man lewis reserved agreement you got any aspirin sure the cook got a bottle from the kitchen and brought it back you feel like shit right now but youll get better i know you even acclimate to the cold a little i know pulaski went to the counter where food was passed he bent under it to get a commissarysized soup can its label stripped and its inside cleaned to a bright copper here your arrival present whats this for lewis realized he felt stupid from the altitude youll drink all day and pee all night this first night its your body adjusting to the cold and altitude this can saves you about three hundred trips to the real can a chamber pot welcome to planet cueball fingie chapter two lewiss room was windowless and just ten feet long he could span its width with lifted arms his fingertips brushing each wall it was one of a row of cells on the second floor of the science building another orange metal box that claimed its grandiose title by virtue of having a small computer lab downstairs his room looked every day of its quartercentury age scuffed faded and leaking the insulation had become soaked and frozen on the outer wall and there was another mold of frost inside a white reminder of how thin their protective shell was a few inches inside the wall the temperature was kept near seventy degrees by a blowing heater the air was very dry and smelled faintly of fuel from the base generator the mechanical drone was like being on a ship the dreaded ice room said cameron whod brought lewis here after the plane left the station manager looked tired but was trying hard to be welcoming being on the end of the building sucks but last come gets last pick lewis put his hand against the wall the clamminess cold as aquarium glass what if my butt freezes to this during the night we bring a blowtorch every time youre late for breakfast there was a pause for timing just dont roll over the other way lewis dutifully smiled sometimes you go to prison as a means of escape he thought sometimes the very worst places offer the most possibility now we call this floor upper berthing jargon left over from the navy days its perfect for you since youre a beaker you can crunch your data downstairs beaker was polar slang for scientist lewis had already encountered this caste designation in new zealand where he was issued a punchingbagsized duffel of cold weather gear at the american warehouse in christchurch you get the shitty nylon because youre a beaker the clerk had informed him handing him insulated bib overalls the workers get carhartt this alternative looked like tough canvas scientists are workers lewis had protested scientists dont spend twelve hours fitting pipe you get the nylon now his place in the hierarchy had dictated assignment of a room like a runt piglet jostling for a teat he was on the outer end also growing out of his orange box were appendages that included an electric substation hydroponic greenhouse and closet full of firefighting gear fire was the most feared enemy at the pole homey he offered a leaking derelict cameron corrected the whole base had a life expectancy that expired five years ago and its slowly falling apart a recent inspection turned up two hundred safety deficiencies which means we really have to stay alert just to stay alive the national science foundation wants to replace everything in summer they fly in congressmen like a dc shuttle so were under pressure here to show some results practical benefits from basic research youll find people are under a little strain still the good news is that the ice room is warmer than outside half private your one neighbor will still hear more of you than they want to and the government is past complaining about tape or tacks on the walls just dont put up a centerfold were politically correct now you admit you werent his question was wry it was so macho that the navy guys had nudes laminated into the tables only way to remember what females looked like gone with the wind man and better for it things are more civilized now that we have women what happened to the tables theyre still in the old base abandoned in when they built this dome its snowed over and slowly being crushed by the ice unsafe and strictly verboten but a fascinating depository of cultural archaeology beer cans frozen hot dogs america at her zenith but youve seen it winterovers have been known to explore big brother left on the last plane you know except for moi which reminds me cameron beckoned him down the hall and pointed toward the shared bathroom our biggest shortage is melted water that means the most onerous rule concerns the showers no more than two a week two minutes of running water each you wet turn it off soap turn it on rinse off were sitting on seventy percent of the worlds fresh water but its so hard to melt we might as well be in the sahara its rationed he stopped listening they could hear the clumping sounds of someone inside no shower for three or four days lewis leaned back in exaggeration its so cold and dry you dont sweat much here he was talking to lewis but his attention was on the door he sounded distracted or if you do people get used to it splendid the door opened and a lumbering bear of a man shambled out naked except for a towel around his waist his hair wet he was bearded hairy and huge a veritable sasquatch he stopped in surprise at their presence whats this a line to pee the voice was deep the eyes hard and squinty just rising to join us buck camerons look was of dislike the man scowled just cleaning up after trying to make some room for all the crap that came in we had trouble getting the plane off on time it got off were both stuck here now i need you on time it got off and i need you to stop nagging and let me do my job the two men held their gaze for a moment a mutual glare and then the big mans slid away and he looked past the station manager whos this the new guy jed lewis getting the tour another beaker fingie great he didnt offer a hand you getting the ten commandments from ice prick learning how to fill out work requests there was an undercurrent of resentment that lewis felt unsure how to respond to what was the beef of this guy just looking well dont look the fuck at me the man pushed past them lurching down the hall his fist clutching his towel to maintain some dignity buck were on a team cameron said after him lewis here is part of the team the bear turned it aint a team its a caste and its beaker glory on ga frostbite if i could have waved goodbye to this zoo i wouldve been on time for that he sized up the newcomer who was wondering what ga meant and pointed a stubby finger you watch your ass around here lewis because its cutthroat island among the beakers whenever someone throws grant crumbs our way you got any sense youll look out for number one and dont pay any attention to all the brownnosing middlemanagement asskissing bullshit either his finger swung to cameron ill take a fucking shower when i fucking want to he went in one of the rooms and the door slammed the station manager was looking after the man unhappily his mouth working as if he were still deciding what to say who the hell was that that was tyson our mechanic it was a mutter the guy they said was sulking dont pay any attention to him cameron shook his head unhappily he fought to get hired down here and has bitched about it ever since hes a malcontent and a loser the station manager frowned at his own candor hell come around cameron glanced at his watch suddenly losing interest in the tour listen ill finish showing you around tomorrow including where you work youll be up for it then for now just take it easy try to get used to the altitude get over the jet lag and unpack okay is that guy having a bad day or what every days a bad day for him lewis went back to his room sat on his bunk and scratched the frost watching a strip peel off under his fingernail pulled into the path of heat the crystals began to melt welcome fingie he decided to remain philosophical first of all hed volunteered for this walked out of his oil patch job and straight into unemployment in a fit of righteous environmentalism and selfdoubt it was a miracle hed met jim sparco and fit his emergency need for a polar research assistant a miracle hed been given a purpose again there was no question he was meant to be here expertise desire and opportunity had all neatly fit and second he knew sailors inmates and astronauts had certainly endured worse despite the spongy outer wall his room was toasty enough except that he couldnt use the word toast that was antarctic slang for burnout that lateseason time when the monotonous lack of color and smell and sound and variety left a winterover with an antarctic stare the mood of the condemned and the social skills of roadkill theyd warned him about it at the headquarters of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in boulder the agency that employed him toast toasty toasted crouton not a nice thing to be so lets just say warm cheery anticipatory nervous and someday even if not toast perhaps depressed bored loopy horny hungry sleepy and dopey theyd warned him of all those things the list sounding like a casting call for snow white at least he had his own room a polar luxury the winterovers had cheered and whooped when that last lc roared away its engines burning so rich in the cold that they left four black streaks of soot on the snow the departure meant independence room a tiny cell of privacy lewis understood the reaction they were beginning the plane lifting off left him feeling both trapped and satisfied newly secure hed made it all the way to the south pole every problem hed ever had was temporarily gone lost across a nomansland of ice every relationship was a fresh start with just twentysix souls every person was important vital even that grump tyson lewis had an important job with clear parameters unique opportunity and no everyday hassles for the next eight months no escape either no backing out he liked the finality of it my fellow fingie someone new filled the door of his room smiling cleanshaven but a skull as distinctive as the cooks closecropped stubble except for a darker mohawk streak on top despite this bizarre choice he was a handsome man a decade older lewis judged late thirties with bright blue eyes that flicked curiously around the barren chamber like a detectives nothing much to see yet of course so they came to rest on lewis robert norse he put out a hand recent arrival and resident shrink the two men had to stand at the foot of the bed in the cramped quarters squeezed too close jed lewis he took the offered hand hard and dry norse pumped vigorously he looked fit muscular his frame erect with an almost military tautness there was an intense energy to his friendliness his teeth were perfect his eyes assessing his smell of aftershave the scent made lewis realize how little there was to smell at the pole besides what people brought with them by the end of the winter hed know everyones smell he supposed their voice ticks expressions inflections and flaws their past and intended future it had to be a psychologists paradise except everyone calls me doctor bob nicknames are endemic here and youll get one too i only arrived a week before you lewis looked pointedly above norses brow a psychologist so explain the haircut doc norse smiled running a hand along the crown of his head i got this at mcmurdo on a dare polar plunge sort of thing supposed to add to solidarity im hoping it helps me fit in be one of the gang isnt that the kind of thing you do in junior high people try to fit in from preschool to the mortuary without exception instinctually basic monkey behavior everyone wants to belong without ever asking why you do want to belong dont you i guess lewis thought about his answer i want my life to stand for something im willing to join a team to do that an idealist norse grinned and you think before you talk a selfexamined man he nodded im impressed maybe he pretended to consider the issue or are you simply a joiner a conformist a follower is the way to selfrealization through society or inside yourself ive got a feeling youve got the answer i came down here to get the answer and being a shrink is like being a cop or a priest or a journalist everyone tenses up so i have to adopt camouflage he knocked the top of his skull a haircut and unlike tattoos this goes away well probably tattoo each other too the cook said weve volunteered for prison norse nodded then the philistines seized him he suddenly recited gouged out his eyes and took him down to gaza binding him with bronze shackles they set him to grinding in the prison but the hair on his head began to grow again say what norse was quite the gabber story of samson ever read it i think i caught the movie instructive story watch out for delilah he winked is there something religious about this place the cook asked about my name oh no just literate lewis sat on his bunk to get some space the guy seemed friendly enough but he didnt know what to make of a psychologist especially one who so blandly gave himself away i heard about you i was told youd want to analyze me norse took half a step back as if exposed really analyze what that im a geologist in a place with no rocks a geologist on an ice cap norse nodded sagely considering and then leaned forward like a mock confidant im sure the freudians would have something to say about that so why are you in a place with no rocks because it has no rocks except it did of course but norse didnt need to know that i see norse mulled this over makes perfect sense like a shrink in a place with no complications youre quite sane arent you id appreciate a professional opinion ah that will cost you and i didnt bring a couch so he thought do you have a piece of paper lewis looked around wait i think ive got one norse pulled out a sheet of folded paper from a pocket inside his sweater it was blank i carry this around to make notes dumb idea because it scares the hell out of people when you do anyway sign your name instant handwriting analysis lewis was curious and did so handing the paper to norse the psychologist studied it oh dear my quick and dirty judgment is that youll fit in with our group quite well lewis smiled so what are you doing here doc me im using us all as guinea pigs for a future trip to mars the pole is like a spaceship nasa hopes communal also confined hostile and dark months of isolation how does that make us feel i feel nauseated thats the altitude took me three days to adjust some never do i think it was your predecessor who rotated out a few weeks back and mentally im still adjusting will be for eight months i suppose thats why i dropped by antarctic veterans have one perspective newcomers another im hoping youll share your observations as the winter goes on observations of what whatever goes on lewis shook his head bemused i heard the power went out somebody goofed which was great for me because it injected a variable norse smiled its like having a lab where i didnt have to build the rat maze i was planning a briefer visit but i got delayed in new zealand and then the medic nurse nancy said she could use some help over the winter i had a sabbatical leave an opportunity to observe the fates conspire no so thats whats to blame yes destiny norse said what lewis had just thought destiny and free will a little of both i think and were the two newcomers here you and me right i guess so norse nodded so jed i want to be your first friend lewis met most of the others at dinner a confusing blur of fresh faces twelve scientists and technicians and fourteen support workers to keep them alive lena jindrova their greenhouse grad student was the youngest at twentythree the oldest was the man lewis had been quietly sent by sparco to meet sixtyfouryearold michael mortimer moss the astrophysicist wasnt in the galley and no one seemed surprised mickey mouse is determining the fate of the universe an astronomer named harrison adams told lewis when he asked far too important to eat with we mortals so he takes twinkietype crap out to the dark side and broods the god on olympus it will all sound ennobling in his autobiography mickey mouse nickname adams chewed we call him that behind his back because hes pretentious not a bad guy really but the saint michael stuff gets a little old when you have to work with him although i will concede hes the quintessential oae oae old antarctic explorer decades of ice time jim sparco knows him lewis said seems to admire him told me i should meet him yes you should mickey moss built this base he made it all possible as hell remind you at every opportunity but jim sparco doesnt have to hear those tiresome reminders like i do or compete with him for grant money like carl mendoza does or put up with his bullying like our dear ineffectual station manager rod cameron does or jump to his orders like our gas do someone else used that ga i mean general assignment assistant grunt serf supporter except you never find one when you need one theyre the people who really run this place its like officers and noncoms we outrank them in everything except what really counts i detect some worldly cynicism you detect polar realism youve joined a family jed and like all families ours has some history am i going to regret it not if you fit in lewis got some food taking a tray and nodding at the cook pulaski was being helped by a plain but friendly woman named linda brown she looked at the tiny helpings on his plate and laughed firstnight fast she patted her ample hips even i remember dimly he took his meager meal and sat down if adams seemed a bit sour the rest seemed to be laughing and joking everyone was exclaiming about the shipment of fresh food lettuce tangerines there was a vigor to the group a buzz of energy and camaraderie that lewis found appealing they were excited at the departure of the last plane which marked the true start of winter yet there was also a social sorting as they ate he noticed four of the women together in apparent defense against male attention other females mixed casually with the men scientists tended to congregate at one table maintenance personnel at another those at lewiss table made jokes about his pallor they remembered what arrival was like when do i stop being the fingie he asked knowing full well that no one newer was coming until october when youre so cold that your face is beginning to frostbite your balls have shriveled to peas and your hands feel like shovels carl mendoza an astronomer told him i think ive got an inside job i know what you do wait until you commute to work but you get acclimated right you get frozen so many times youre incapable of thaw mendoza pointed with his head like our russian aurora expert what cold alexi molotov said reaching for the butter or when you join the three hundred degree club said the medic nancy hodge she was in her late forties a thin and oncepretty woman with the kind of lines that suggested shed seen a little too much of life her welcoming smile had a twist to it no ring but a white mark where one had been whats that youll see the others were excited about the fresh food loud about their plans for the winter and excited by the new responsibility of being cut off lewis picked at his own food but as he tired he realized he couldnt fully share the mood he was exhausted from his journey and in his weariness the crowd became cloying and the galley air hot and steamy his appetite had deserted him and he couldnt concentrate the plan after the meal he was told was to watch the thing a perennial polar ritual it is this american movie about an outer space being infecting the bodies of polar scientists and killing them one by one molotov summarized with relish it is very funny they fight back with guns and flame throwers boom boom yet thishe held up a butter knife is as wicked as it gets at real pole he laughed everywhere else in life your body is taken over by bosses by advertisers by government by nagging wife here no yet you watch it anyway it is what you call it he made a squeezing motion on his arm with his fingers inoculation nancy hodge said yes yes inoculation against the fear the scare of being left here for the winter you know the veterans know all the lines by heart you will see it is lots of fun but lewis was so weary he felt in danger of falling into his plate of food the thought of enduring a movie appalled him after embarrassing himself twice with dull responses that made him sound like a halfwit he finally excused himself to bed the others nodded without surprise it took time if you wake up and you are the last one left molotov called after him dont be surprised then you know the outer space being the creature it is you chapter three lewiss sleep was ragged his body periodically jerking awake as he gasped for breath each time it did so hed have to roll out of bed to urinate ridding himself of bloat by morning his soup can was full and his breathing was easier he felt his body beginning to adjust his red blood cells multiplying but when he went to the galley all he wanted for breakfast was toast and coffee the maintenance worker sitting next to him looked at his plate with disbelief youll starve on that bird feed the man shoved more food into his mouth talking as he chewed george geller ga im serious you gotta eat more geller was consuming a fouregg ham and cheese omelet hash browns two steaks a bowl of cereal and three tumblers of orange juice the gluttony renewed lewiss nausea how can you hold all that this hell i still lose weight in the cold you better have more than that man the pole devours calories you eat against it lewis put aside the last of his toast not today geller shrugged youll see im just not hungry you will be geller attacked his meal with a steady industry like a steam shovel excavating a foundation lewis was half hypnotized by it you came here for the food then the maintenance man broke his pace enough to smile pulaski aint that good i came here to get away from it all so did everybody the urban stress of turnofthemillennium life geller speared a piece of steak the minnesota stress of a fuckedup marriage nowhere job and pressing debt same problems as the guys who went with columbus ive got a visa balance too my creditors are a little heavier than that man he chewed truth be told this is the betty ford clinic for me cold turkey from the track and cards i had an affair with lady luck and the bitch dumped me so these loan sharks who looked like the missing link came calling and said highly disturbing things about accumulating interest down here they cant reach me ill make enough this winter to start over lewis nodded youre here for the money fuckin a geller nodded everybody needs money is the money good down here for you guys he shrugged same as a beaker a long work week and no expenses the wage scales no better than back home but its like forced savings theres nothing to buy i might even save enough to not go back keep my money for myself and chill out on some tropical island buy a boat who knows indeed the pole offered possibility cameron came into the galley and stood over them assessing his air of authority had come back but there was also a hesitant uncertainty to it lewis thought the betraying experimentation of someone new to command never quite sure how the others would react still caring what they thought cameron was in his late twenties younger than many of those he supposedly supervised hows it hanging the station manager asked didnt freeze lewis said you ate a little cameron looked dubiously at the toast fingies they all had to learn all right then looks like youre ready to see the homestead lets saddle up yippiekiyay suiting up to go outdoors was as laborious as donning armor heavy long underwear and two pairs of socks sweater fleece vest pants and insulated nylon bib overalls neck gaiter goggles stocking hat white plastic bunny boots glove liners mittens ski gloves in case dexterity was required and finally down parka with hood lewis felt as padded as the michelin man and awkward as an astronaut he was roasting up to a point theres no such thing as cold the station manager said just inadequate clothing up to a point if you put too much on when youre working you can actually sweat cameron said thats dangerous when you cool down or because of dehydration at the other extreme nothing will keep you warm when the wind comes up what do you do then tough it out up to a point i cant walk in these things lewis pointed to his boots inflated with air for insulation they looked like white melons youd be walking on frostbitten stubs without them dorky but they work lewis clumped along the floor like wearing weights one year some pranksters started pouring sand into a guys bunnies where the air goes little bit each day by the end of the season they weighed about seventy pounds pretty funny lewis shook a boot listening ha stepping out of the berthing unit into the gray light of the dome was like stepping into a freezer lewis was jarred again at the nearness of such cold just outside the door the icicles hung overhead from the dome as before and yet he was so hot from the dressing that the change felt good at first refreshing the snow ramp from the dome exit led upward to the plateau surface and a bright cold that was more telling this was a chill that wasnt confined to an enclosure but was the single salient fact of his new world he stood a moment letting himself adjust the sky was overcast the light flat even with a mild breeze he could feel the temperature sucking at him trying to drain him of heat the cold got into his lungs and palpated his heart he pulled his gaiter over his nose and mouth the moisture of his breath immediately starting a growth of frost goggles shielded his eyes and forehead his hood kept a thin cocoon of slightly warmer air near his face he took a moment to practice breathing as if he were underwater okay he wasnt going to die lewis looked around the snow was flat and beyond the cluster of human structures utterly empty nothing moved there was no natural feature to catch the eye first of all stay close to the base cameron lectured leaving his neck gaiter down so he could be heard clearly even when its not snowing the wind can kick up surface powder into a blizzard six or seven feet high the blowing snow is just high enough to put any human who isnt in the nba into whiteout conditions so if you do go somewhere sign out take a radio and take some bearings pay attention to where you are where we are start memorizing the layout people have died in antarctica a dozen feet from shelter temperatures can drop fifty degrees in ten minutes lewis nodded second were marking the most frequently used routes with flags he pointed to long poles with pennants on the end in the dark thats coming you just follow one flag to another to get back to a building one route goes to astronomy which the beakers call the dark sector because lights arent allowed out there it screws up their telescopes everyone else calls it the dark side another goes to clean air where youll work its away from the generators and any air pollution a third goes to summer camp which is shut down now he pointed at distant buildings summer camp was a row of koreanwarvintage canvas quonset huts a branch goes to bedrock those little blue huts there thats our emergency shelter if anything goes wrong in the dome goes wrong fire generator failure battery explosions well poisonings the usual he smiled cameron also pointed out antenna towers telescopes construction materials supply crates driftedover vehicles and random jetsam everything raw and jutting from the snow like the debris of some midair collision lewis thought the place looked like a dump but wasnt surprised all the treeless places hed worked in had the same look where could you hide the mess the chaos represented logistical evolution third pay attention to your body its sort of like being an astronaut where you pay attention to your air are you staying warm are you still alert are you losing energy if you start to feel frozen get back inside for a while capisce yeah common sense youd be amazed how quickly that can disappear around here lewis looked out at the foggy horizon how far can we see about six miles three in each direction a few more if you get up on a tower the sun was low a white disk behind fog like a dim headlight it circled the horizon every twentyfour hours each day settling lower like a marble rolling down a funnel on march it would be gone you been to the ice before rod four times so you like it i love it even the pole especially the pole its like no place else on earth come on ill show you they started walking toward the astronomy complex that squatted threequarters of a mile away crossing the ice taxiway just beyond was a stake jutting two feet out of the snow here it is go ahead walk around the world this is the south pole yep bottom of the planet when it gets dark i come out here sometimes on a clear night and lay down to watch the stars and the aurora sometimes i do feel upside down like im about to float off and drift into the sky its spectacularly beautiful then and the vertigo makes me high i thought the pole would look like something more in summer theres a ceremonial pole over there cameron pointed vaguely we took it down for the winter a couple weeks ago it looks like a santa claus pole you know with barber stripes and a silver globe on top we put the flags of the antarctic treaty nations around it and the vips who fly in for a few hours pose for pictures but this stake is the real pole the ice cap moves flowing toward the sea so every january we have to drive a stake about ten meters from the last one to keep pace he pointed out a line of older stakes marching away across the snow marking where the pole had been eventually the dome will roll right over it except maybe we can win funding for the new base and the dome will be dismantled everybody needs money lewis recited he trod a circle around the stake around the world i read that admiral byrd said it was the middle of a limitless plain you get here and thats all he said it was the effort to get here that counted that and getting away but byrd said that back in the s way before the base started in nowadays its the staying that counts were here for a purpose your job is important mine is important theyre all important scientifically politically were at a place that no single nation owns dedicated to knowledge i think thats pretty cool cool lewis brushed the frost on the ruff of his hood you know why people like it down here jed cameron was looking directly at him but with the goggles on the effect was odd like being looked at by an insect why because the purpose of life is to learn thats why we exist to learn thats my belief anyway thats why the station exists moss and adams and mendoza have the worlds best window on space jerry follett and dana andrews are deciphering the atmosphere hiro and alexi are trying to understand the aurora which is one hell of a show you do climate lena hydroponics it doesnt get any purer than this the hood against lewiss ears made everything like listening through a blanket so how do we tell direction down here we make our own grid the greenwich meridian is grid north the opposite way south mostly though we point theres nowhere to go so its like being on a small island disneyland come on lets go see where youll work they trudged toward the clean air facility a brown metal box a half mile from the pole it was elevated on stilts and festooned with instruments and antennas as they walked lewis felt as if hed gained a hundred pounds his feet felt hot and heavy and his lungs were unhappy with air that remained too thin too dry too cold his neck gaiter had become a muffler of ice scratchy and smothering he swatted at it breaking some bits loose but more clung to the fabric at the same time he realized he was sweating the snow squeaked as they walked dry and powdery a loose coverlet on harder bluewhite ice wind blew this skin into small shinhigh drifts that cameron called sastrugi alexi says its the russian word for eyebrows it was laborious to lumber over or through them whats his story theres no money in russia hes one of the top aurora experts in the world so we gave him a posting here he said he liked that movie the thing i think theres something in that film that gets to our excommie the fact that no one can trust anyone i think he was into some pretty heavy science politics in the old soviet down deep hes pretty serious you know kind of quietly ambitious hed love to accomplish something down here to bring credit to mother russia point of pride to bring out something new but hes also a lot of fun sos hiro they the only foreigners danas a kiwi and lena emigrated from the czech republic but nobodys a foreigner not down here antarctica is the only place on earth where you dont need a passport and you dont go through customs no single nation owns anything thats pretty cool too there was the distant chug of the generator but no other sound no bird call no rustling leaves no distant shout of children no drone of highway noise lewis pushed back his hood and pulled down his gaiter a moment to listen ignoring the bite of cold his exhalation a puff of steam there was a quiet whisper behind him he turned his head no one there they kept walking puffing over the drifts again the whisper lewis turned completely this time odd the snow was empty what the hell the station manager was watching him with amusement i thought i heard something its your breath fingie the moisture freezes as you walk and crackles behind your ear as it sprinkles down weird isnt it my breath the vapor cloud oh he puffed and listened as his exhalation floated away like fairy dust with an audible crinkle you notice the noise he conceded theres nothing else to hear just the voices in your head an outside metal staircase led up to the clean air facility perched on its columns like a heavy bird inside were instruments hed been briefed on at boulder by noaa windows looked out at the flat bleakness of the ice cap the elevated structure was here because air at the south pole was thousands of miles from human industry and hence the most unpolluted on earth lewiss primary job was to sample that air for evidence of global warming he actually had to keep track of thirtyfive separate measurements some of them automated and some requiring manual sampling of air snow sunlight and atmospheric ozone temperature carbon dioxide concentrations wind snowfall pollutants barometric pressure my job is important if the planet was heating it would perversely show up here first just like the ozone hole had if their ice plateau melted it would drown the worlds ports antarctica was a global trip wire warning humans if industrialization had gone too far jed lewis was this winters paul revere kind of cozy he commented indeed the elevated building felt like a tree house a boys fort youve got good duty cameron said your job forces you to get outside each day so you dont become a dome slug and you get some privacy and independence out here its the closest thing to a vacation condo this side of the kitkat club the what an old balloonlaunching shack we dont need it anymore because the balloons have gotten smaller and lighter a carpenter turned it into a getaway pad with carpeting heat stereo and vcr tv since then its seen more consummations than niagara falls not that we station managers approve of course theres a lot of nooks and crannies to this place arent there oh yes indeedy and this building is a rendezvous as well people come out to clean air sometimes to break the monotony and party carl mendoza is promising to cook up some domebrew hed better not spill beer on my instruments nah they spill it over here the station manager walked out on the platform ringing the building and pointed downward to a yellowstained cleft in the snow our grand canyon is the pee crevasse its a long run to the john in the dome so guys just piss over the rail here its quite a sensation when the winds blowing clean air dirty snow we dont take our drinking water from here needless to say storms cover up the evidence each winter what do women do cameron laughed who knows what women do you certainly dont a female voice said they turned a young woman about lewiss age was standing in the doorway nylon windpants over her legs but her feet in wool socks and her upper half clad only in long underwear which showed some nice shape to her she was holding a screwdriver and seemed oblivious to the cold we look for a leafy bush she confided to lewis the closest one was two thousand miles away hello abby cameron said hello pig she replied pleasantly you were hiding under one of your computers i was getting our planned obsolescence ready for our newcomer she looked at lewis please pay no attention to ice pick hes flunked every chance at being a new age sensitive type of guy since assuming his exalted post and all the women on station are preparing a lawsuit against him or maybe just ritual castration hey im sensitive and i like women exactly the problem cameron made the introduction this is abby dixon our resident computer nerd abby jed lewis our new weatherman they stepped inside and lewis shed his mittens to shake she had long slim fingers and a firm grip her hair was short and dark her features tomboy pretty her smile wide and welcoming not bad i didnt see you at dinner he said sometimes i eat on the job especially when we have fruit an apple a pc and me heaven you dont miss our companionship machines are good company especially compared to some of the alternatives she cast a mischievous glance at cameron abbys an elusive one the station manager said pretends to have some geek boyfriend stashed elsewhere in antarctica our isolation and my charm however are breaking down her reserve im positively gregarious compared to jerry she told lewis jerry follett youll work with him too his idea of small talk is atmospheric dynamics hell want some help launching his balloons but hes loud as a mollusk dont be put off by it so you work out here too just when you need me i heard youd arrived and thought id better get the busted one up and running its been on my list after your predecessor broke it i hope he didnt spill beer lewis said probably threw up on it had a tough time with the altitude she turned to cameron so we going to name this guy snowman too hes collecting it no everyone needs their own nickname polar tradition he explained to lewis im ice pick because i can be a prick when i have to be hes just fussy abby said picky he fails at being mean im just nuts from coping with twentyfive other eccentrics in a place that demands conformity everyone wants to make their careers in six months and solve their life problems while theyre at it when they dont its the station managers fault maybe we should call you pickedupon abby teased picked apart anyway cottonpickin crazy now he considered lewis abbys gearloose for her vast technical skills and you are maybe krill she laughed oh dear krill what does that mean zooplankton cameron replied smoothly a tiny translucent shrimp that makes up much of the marine biomass off antarctica vital to the ecosystem i look like a shrimp its worse than that abby said he means youre at the bottom of the food chain the new guy the fingie cameron said cheerfully nobody newer for eight toasty months i dont think so lewis said slowly how about something flattering not allowed the station manager said what about the grumpy shower guy tyson whats his nickname buck to his face because hes big and into knives but we spell it with an f behind his back and island abby said as in no man is every winter theres one guy so weird that he runs the danger of being ostracized tyson seems to crave the honor not me i came down to get along embarrassingly his stomach chose that moment to growl as geller had predicted he was hungry fiercely hungry and eat abby took pity dont think you look like a shrimp thanks i am almost six feet his stomach rumbled again in fact aside from his rude noises id call him an antarctic ten she smiled slyly head tilted judiciously they were still making fun a what an antarctic ten is a member of the opposite sex whod be a five anywhere else cameron explained ah very flattering great we all look better and better as the months drag on terrific you could be a six abby winked the women will have to vote ill look forward to that but krill is too cruel for him rod hes right maybe ozone maybe sediment he is a rockhead a what she asked geologist running from rocks rolling stone then lewis shook his head hed have to find his own name and if i could make six you could be an eight he judged watching abby laugh even a nine after a few months at the pole things were looking up a telephone rang and cameron answered it hello yeah hes here a pause okay mickey right ill tell him he hung up who was that lewis asked our estimable astrophysicist michael m moss poohbah of the pole hed like you to come by astronomy later today he pointed to the other building on stilts threequarters of a mile away you can do that after lunch his stomach growled again cameron was looking at lewis curiously mickey usually isnt this welcoming he cant remember half the names on the base but he asked for you im flattered its interesting that hed want to see you so soon maybe he likes fingies cameron shook his head no he doesnt hes a snob well lewis said enjoying finally knowing something the others didnt maybe he likes geologists chapter four ninetenths of the universe is missing lewis my job is to find it michael m mickey moss leaned back in his desk chair in the astronomy building and waited to be asked for clarification his hands making a tent in front of an expression both regal and watchful despite a disney nickname that had dogged him from grade school or perhaps because of it in compensation moss looked nothing like a cartoon he instead maintained an aristotelian aura with his mane of white hair and beard raw pink skin and eyes both bright with intelligence and as dark as obsidian marbles lewis was sure the look had been cultivated moss was the kind of scientist who could command the lectern of an academic gathering on appearance alone i wasnt aware wed misplaced the universe lewis said on cue playing straight man to the lecture moss would get to the point of this visit in his own good time exactly exactly the problem the scientist bounded out of his seat and theatrically pointed toward the ceiling people marvel at the sky all those stars and yet those trillions of suns represent only a tiny fraction of the matter that has to be out there judging from the rotational speed and placement of galaxies there should be ten times as much stuff a hundred times maybe so what else dim stars dark planets or something we dont even suspect thats what were looking for he pointed at the floor down there he smiled as if posing a riddle sparco told me youre building a telescope in the ice moss looked mildly disappointed at this shortcut in his lecture youre familiar with neutrinos never seen one the astrophysicist nodded wryly precisely far smaller than an atom so small that billions are passing through our bodies right at this moment without effect so small that a neutrino can pass through the entire planet without hitting anything the most inconsequential objects imaginable chargeless massless yet what if they do have mass however slight there are so many of them they could represent a substantial fraction of our missing universe if we could find and count them and tell where they come from it would bring us a lot of information its the finding thats the problem which youve done which were in the process of doing statistically a very few neutrinos do collide with the particles of an atom as they streak through the earth when this happens theres a tiny explosion of sorts a spark a kind of radiation a point of light if you will we cant see these flashes in rock but sensitive instruments can see them in transparent mediums such as tanks of water or ice tada lewis said drill holes deep enough and the ice becomes so compressed that all the bubbles and color are squeezed out of it ice becomes clearer than glass clear as diamond instruments can detect these flashes for a thousand feet in all directions weve drilled holes a mile deep to spot neutrino light its the best place in the world really if it works if it works theres been problems no not problems scientific realities impatience by funding agencies because they have no idea of the conditions down here no idea im staying this winter to try to keep things on schedule because we might find something so unexpected that it changes all our understanding of gravity matter energy you did find something unexpected yes again moss resented the prompting as a byproduct of a lifelong search a search here at the harshest place on earth the pole is pretty awesome youre privileged to be here men have been trying to decipher the heavens since babylonian priests climbed their ziggurats like pilgrims and holy men theyve gone to the mountaintops now theyve come to the farthest mountaintop the south pole the farthest place after this the next ziggurat is space and you have something from space lewis was trying to be polite but he was growing impatient to see what hed been sent for yes moss gave up on his preamble you have some expertise a little from college im not kidding myself about why jim sparco picked me i wasnt the best i was convenient and unemployed i was interested in his research and he thought i was principled which meant he thought i could keep my mouth shut yes im interested in your principles moss studied him youve signed on to look for global warming correct as part of the weather readings and yet youre a petroleum geologist right i was which contributes to global warming maybe no maybe about it oil also keeps us alive down here so you can find the universe conceded besides which i quit yes that intrigues me sparco told me the story when i emailed him about my rock im sure big oil paid well so youve made an interesting choice havent you everyone comes to the pole for something i came to help out i came to work for the good guys if i make some small contribution toward your discovery im excited moss nodded fair enough fair enough the idea of a fingie wanting a piece of michael mosss reflected glory obviously pleased him made sense to him i admire your dedication someday your help may be credited in the meantime however the need for discretion as you said is paramount no one knows of this discovery no one will know until i choose to tell them agreed lewis nodded its what sparco had told him to expect i havent decided what to do with it moss explained he nodded again slowly the scientist stood up moved to a file cabinet and opened a drawer its interesting how compelling a rock becomes in a place that doesnt have any ive touched this thing a thousand times wondered where it came from what might be inside he lifted his arm hefting a dull brown rock the size and shape of a large lumpy baking potato its remarkably ugly lewis took the stone dense and heavy eight ten pounds the rock was burnt and glassy on one side my god how many people know about this he asked no one really i confided in sparco because weve spent so much time down here together he persuaded me this might represent a lifechanging opportunity but i couldnt risk even transmitting a picture of it on the internet it was he who suggested finding someone like you to make an initial judgment i think hed already met you at toolik lake fortuitous no and you found it a few months ago when drilling hole b just happened to strike it dumb luck i admit about a thousand years down as measured in layers of snowfall and thought it might be a meteorite because why else is there a rock in the ice cap if theres a stone at the pole it has to have come from the sky lewis nodded looking at the tarlike crust evidence of heat from a fall through the atmosphere which meant he looked at moss the astronomer was watching him expectantly well superficially at least it fits lewis set it carefully on some papers on a desk then you think its from space probably he paused considering what to say as you said the fact that theres thousands of feet of ice between this and bedrock suggests it fell from the sky thats why antarctica has become a prime hunting ground for meteorites of all kinds they stick out like a sore thumb but all the others have been found on the surface around the transantarctic range where flowing ice hits the mountain barrier and breaks upward to carry buried meteorites to the surface the wind blows the last snow away to strike a buried one with your drilling is pretty lucky amazingly lucky it could have been salted by some joker i suppose moss conceded dropped down the hole when i wasnt looking but why no one has confessed and it looked like the real thing to me we use hot water to melt holes in the ice drilling downward with what amounts to a big shower head a camera showed something was sticking into one side of our tube i gave the crew a break paused to melt a bulb of water to free it and then hauled it up and kept quiet about your find i wanted to be sure you understand im no expert youre as close as we could find at short notice to come down here like this yes and as sparco suspected i dont think this is your average meteorite have you noticed its basaltic ive noticed its plain exactly said lewis now the lecturer in geology he wasnt the fingie compared to many of the metallic meteorites this looks boring to us ordinary thats because its a common kind of rock found on earth but a rare kind to come from space most meteorites have more iron and nickel they date from the dawn of the solar system this one came later in history after the place of its origin had experienced some kind of heating and melting and igneous rock had formed like the earths crust moss was nodding he was eager for confirmation that suggests it didnt come from the usual source like asteroids or comets lewis went on it probably came from the moon or mars blasted into space eons ago after a bigger meteorite maybe a mile across slammed into the red planet ejected and captured by earths gravity like the one they found in the allan hills the famous one they thought might have fossil evidence of martian microbes moss allowed himself a hint of eagerness could this one have fossils inside theres been no agreement they exist in the other one but this kind of meteorite is rare and even the remotest possibility makes it pretty valuable we cant be sure what this is at all of course not with me i dont have the instruments and i dont have the expertise the way they confirmed things in houston was by analyzing ancient gas trapped in the meteorite and finding it matched the martian atmosphere it may not be martian at all moss allowed he wanted more hope no only sixteen have been found worldwide but it looks possible to me lewis gave him an achondrite the kind of meteorite that would come from a planet or the moon sparco says you have a spectroscope down here and i brought some stuff to reduce a sample for a gasspectrum analysis i can also slice a small cross section and look at its composition under the microscope ill test for oxygen and oxidized iron isotopes check its magnetism which indicates how much ferric iron if its a simple plagioclasepyroxene basalt or maybe olivine it will be promising radioactive dating of a young age will persuade even more well need some photos and a statement to authenticate its place of origin and then you take it to houston or wherever moss nodded watching him yes wherever he hesitated jim told me i could trust another question to you lewis had been waiting for this its commercial value this opinion was sparcos price for his being allowed to come down here he was to assess and then keep his mouth shut hed wanted purpose and this was his ticket as another measure of its importance private collection of scientific artifacts is booming lewis said having a livingroom museum has become cool among the ultrarich the mere possibility this could be from mars will be enough for some buyers the chance it could hold evidence of extraterrestrial life trumps all that rock could be worth a lot of money how much money lewis had researched this pieces of mars have sold for twentyfive hundred dollars a gram which makes this rock worth several million dollars moss nodded solemnly pieces of the moon are even rarer and have fetched ten times that the apollo rocks turned out to be from a concentrated region of unusually high radioactivity so lunar meteorites tell us more about the moon than what the astronauts brought back theyve fetched twentyfive hundred times the price of gold astonishing moss said he didnt seem very astonished but everything here is the property of the american government right if they know about it the scientist said looking evenly at lewis its an american base american taxpayer dollars no one was allowed to hunt for souvenirs in antarctica lewis knew they told you that up front is it moss asked to you just stepping off the plane looking at that ragged flag i suppose it is but to me the scientist pointed to the wall above his desk it was papered with pictures of himself with a stream of celebrities visiting congressmen presidential science advisors adventurers network anchors movie stars foreign dignitaries mickey moss as polar landlord its not american land not american ice its nobodys ice except the people willing to come down here and pioneer it and you pioneered it exactly but at government expense right at personal sacrifice moss took a breath listen young man i know i look like an old egghead to you sitting here in my warm office surrounded by vinyl and plastic but i was doing science down here when you were sucking at your mothers tit i was doing science when we slept in plywood barracks and ate out of tin cans and didnt get a letter or a radio call for months at a time i did science until i was frostbitten so bad that when i came back inside it felt like my face was being held to a hot iron i understand no you dont you cant no one can who didnt do it and i gave the testimony that helped build this building i dragged the washington bureaucrats down here kicking and screaming and got them to see that this placethis godforsaken place was the best place for certain kinds of science in the entire world the pole was the ringside seat when that comet plowed into jupiter in its going to help us remap the universe decipher our magnetic field understand our atmosphere weve got telescopes out in the snow that can see in half a dozen ways the human eye is blind to because for half the year the sun never sets and for the other half we have a constant dark sky because i mickey moss showed them the way i think everyone respects that do they sure i used to think respect was enough he sat down looking at the rock theyll probably name something for you when im dead he picked up the meteorite they scoff at me now you know geezer mouse dont think i dont know theyre jealous academic rivalry they dont understand my project has to have priority priority to justify the pole to justify the new south pole station lewis waited im just saying that ive paid my dues im not arguing doctor moss the scientist turned the meteorite over in his hands ive made no decisions he said softly its just that im getting old i had to fudge my medical exam to get down here last time i dont have endless time anymore i havent put a lot away my family he glanced up are you surprised to find me human lewis no lewis shifted uncomfortably he was surprised actually it didnt fit his stereotype of a grand old man of science its just that jim sparco wanted a rough evaluation he didnt talk about keeping it nor have i nor have i he looked at lewis warily dont jump to conclusions dont start rumors that arent true ive got a reputation and in the end a reputation is all a scientist has thirty years in this place and thats all i have and then at the end a missive from space a stroke of luck why lewis couldnt answer well the first step was to get your opinion correct now weve got some thinking to do whats best whats right whats fair thats always the question isnt it the unanswerable one sometimes yet you must choose an answer moss stood and put the rock back in his filing cabinet the funny thing is therere almost no locks on this base thats why you cant breathe a word of this to anyone dont you want to kick this around with the other scientists no he looked depressed word would leak misinterpretations would be made theyre jealous like you said theyd use this against me i could be wrong about the meteorite you know i understand that it really needs some tests of course but in the meantime im going to put this where others wont find it he looked intently at the young geologist and then decide the right thing to do chapter five jed lewis had a theory about life life was hard complicated life was a long meandering slog up a very steep mountain and if you didnt have good friends to help point out the way it was pretty easy to choose the wrong path sometimes lewis didnt think mickey moss had many friends just admirers rivals and even after choosing you could go miles years before knowing whether your path was wrong or right moreover everybody had their own route and their own schedule so jed was slow to judge how people made it up the slope you didnt know where they were coming from couldnt know as moss had said didnt know where they were going lewis had examined the meteorite and would probably test it but the fate of the rock was really none of his concern let the old scientist make his own lonely way up the peak lewis himself was tired of being alone by the time he got back to the dome he was ravenous again geller was right the polar cold almost snatched food out of your mouth when lewis yanked open the freezer door and stepped into the galley vestibule he was salivating the galley was crowded and a table of beakers was almost full lewis curious to sample the stations social spectrum decided to sit with the some of the support staff who kept the place running he plopped next to geller who was working on another mountain of food next to him was a smaller quiet mouselike man hed noticed earlier keeping his head down as he ate a beaker joins the rabble geller greeted just trying to meet everyone and your appetites improved he nodded at lewiss tray stroganoff fresh green beans cobbler all heaped high pulaski and linda brown could cook i was on tour the cold really burns up your reserves that aint cold sitting out eight hours in the wind trying to fix equipment some moron beaker bustedthats cold are there always no scientists at this table lewis asked mostly we get along great but they tend to eat with their own we tend to eat with our own they bitch about us we bitch about them works better that way i thought segregation was against the law it aint segregation its fucking high school it was the growl of a new voice and lewis looked up the grump from the shower tyson he sat heavily spreading his arms and legs to claim a substantial portion of the table his manner was one of fingie instructor a heavily muscled forearm boasting a tattooed snake pulled his tray against his torso a fork was held upright in his other fist like a flagstaff hed unconsciously made a tiny fort of his food like the jocks and the nerds remember we got more cliques here than hot pants high i think youre exaggerating a little buck geller said mildly the hell i am you got us and you got the beakers and you got the smokers and you got the singles and you got the women the science side is all rank and showoff with knowitalls like mickey moss lording it over grad students and postdocs and then even the tweezer twits get snobby when they want something done yeah but everyone gets along better than anyplace ive ever been we gotta get along or we fucking die but that dont mean people dont cluster with their own look around this room planet of the apes man were monkeys the phrase jogged a memory hadnt norse said something similar buck tyson resident sociologist geller introduced yeah me and our new shrink he nodded to lewis we met at the shower yeah i remember that wasnt about you that was about ice prick not exactly an apology but not hostile either maybe tyson was okay you like to analyze i just see things like they really are my day job is master mechanic i make our gocarts go you need a snow spryte a d cat you come to buck tyson but at night i think about our loony bin me thinking for myself makes some of the beakers nervous you nervous how to respond to that you like doctor bob lewis deflected i like where hes coming from i like that he stays in shape i talked to him already and i think he sees through the bullshit like i do were into the same shit selfreliance the importance of numero uno and thinking for yourself hes got all these ideas from nasa about whether this place suggests what you need to make starship troopers its cool what hes trying to do not the touchyfeely crap of the other shrinks that come down to the ice he turned to geller you know what they did to a shrink at vanda over in the dry valleys no what ran over his gear with a tractor tyson laughed there was a silence the others digesting this i guess buck is your nickname lewis finally said whats your real name james geller quickly interjected jimmy you dumb fuck you know i hate james english faggot name james bond aint a faggot james bond is the biggest goddamned english pansy there is he carries a girls gun and dresses like a fucking bridegroom i like big guns and big guys i like guys who go it alone and kick butt like clint eastwood and john wayne and bruce willis and rambo and ahhhnold except he married the fucking kennedys everyone calls tyson buck because hes into knives geller explained and guns and commando crap and every other bit of militia weirdness no im not im into sufficiency which is more than a little important way down here tyson pointed his fork at lewis dont take this all for one and one for all crap too seriously because when its dark and blowing and people are freaking out you gotta know how to take care of yourself right the government likes to jabber on about our happy little commune but in fact its just a bunch of fuckedup overachievers they may have a doctorate but they manage to bring down every goddamn neurosis there is buck doesnt like people geller summarized thats not true im eating with you assholes i even like some of the beakers like crazy alexi our russian cocktail he tells it like it is cause hes out of the gulag man hiros kind of funny like a jap cartoon but some of them are humorless knowitalls like harrison adams harrison not just harry pompous twit or weirdos like jerry follett i watch my backside around that faggot or mickey mouse out there in the dark side our head rodent needs his ears pinned youre talking about saint michael geller said with humor pope moss can kiss my youknowwhat tyson turned to the other man at their table whod been eating silently and clapped him on the shoulder the one you want to stay friends with is this guy who runs the power plant we try to keep him sober and sane the small man looked up like a blinking mole he was balding with pinched features and a brushy mustache pika he mumbled as introduction what lewis hadnt understood pika geller said like the animal whats a pika sort of a rock rabbit tyson explained no one can stand to hang around with pika cause he whistles while he works like those dwarves remember them drives us all nuts like muzak his real name is doug taylor but we call him pika which is sort of like a marmot critter that whistles lewis slowly nodded got it pikas sort of squeak geller said but we liked the sound of the word makes sense to me see mickey moss can collect all the medals he wants to but what it comes down to is the guys like pika tyson said were at the outer edge of the envelope down here they dont like to tell us that but its true the generators stop and were dead the well gets fucked up and were dead a good fire gets started and were dead this place is the easiest place in the world to sabotage any of us could kill all of us in about three nanoseconds and then they send down a shrink how does that make you feel lewis tried to smile that i better stay friends with pika you better believe it some idiot shut off the heat the other day it was this little guy who got it back on tyson nodded in approval dont touch my machines the small man mumbled he didnt look at lewis just mildly kept eating his food lewis wondered what his story was okay just leave my machines alone it was quiet for a moment so youre the new weather dude correct tyson finally asked yeah so how do you like the magic kingdom its pretty interesting damn right its interesting absolutely fucking fascinating for about three days tyson snorted after that its groundhog day you seen that movie where they repeat the same day over and over ive seen it thats winter at the pole dont listen to buck too much geller said he whines like a mosquito i whine because that fucker cameron and the bureaucrats he fronts for wont get off my back have you seen our work schedule do this do that blah blah blah more work on that list than you could do in three winters give me a fucking break theyre just showing off buck believes the world is out to get him geller interpreted screw you it is out to get me carries a chip like a cross i carry the station man i do the shit you know how many people work here he asked lewis how many about half tyson laughed again so what are you doing down here lewis asked tyson whats that supposed to mean he took it like a challenge its volunteer right you wanted to come right hell yes its volunteer until they spend six thousand bucks getting each of us down here with no replacements in the pipeline then its like oh you dont care for our little utopia seems weve lost your return ticket until next october gosh golly darn have a great winter itll go faster with a positive attitude buck geller advised itll go faster when cameron lays off me man maybe i cant quit but i dont have to jump through his workschedule hoops either they may not like me but they cant touch me he grinned not down here pulaski had found them a pet by treaty animals werent allowed in antarctica in order to preserve its pristine environment unaware of this agreement a small slug had smuggled its way onto the continent in a head of freshie lettuce lena their greenhouse horticulturist adopted the creature and put him in a jar with clippings from the hydroponic tanks she called the slug hieronymus and announced he was good luck she was a botanist on green card from the czech republic and to her everything seemed charmed in this new world i feel that all the time i am on vacation she told lewis someone should have told you about hawaii and now we have a pet she enthused somebody said something about a dome slug he remembered those are people thats what you become if you dont get outside and if you do get outside then you are a popsicle she smiled at her own knowledge of the word with some ceremony the slug was designated the official mascot of the amundsenscott drill and dart team which designated itself the fighting gastropods twice a week the loose assemblage played a match with the new zealand winterovers on the coast keeping score by crackling radio the kiwis relied on their countryman dana andrews to keep the yanks honest as they reported score a caustically humored redhead with the build of a fireplug and an opinion on everyone dana complied the americans at mcmurdo lent their own monitor who hiked over to the new zealand base for the matches in return for kiwi beer lewis was invited to join were a classier team now that we have a mascot geller told him theres a real status to it now im not much on darts he sat down to one side as they shoved aside tables in the galley you cant be any worse than curious george coaxed another woman gabriella her name was and she was a more effective recruiter as sensual as dana was stolid she was slim darkhaired her skin the color of butterscotch her eyes large and her mouth arrested in a wry curl she moved with a selfconscious liquid grace not pretty like abby so much as alluring dangerously so i suppose not lewis agreed watching while geller put three darts wide of the bullseye the maintenance man was frowning at his own volley when gabriella brought lewis to the line geller gave them a knowing look i see youve managed to let yourself be drafted you found this dame persuasive the woman gave lewis a glance more so than you lewis allowed that isnt even a compliment gabriella complained i like the mascot thats no better i hope youre more adept with darts than words in truth lewis had never played the game but he was determined to socialize down here and so he threw managing to hit the board then he watched as gabriella toed the line and cocked her slim arm the dart balanced in her fingers like a feather she was a male magnet and knew it reeking of femininity and pheromones who is she he murmured to geller as they watched gabriella reid gal friday she does berthing assignments time cards records and all that administrative crap not to mention keeping men on red alert i heard that george she didnt seem very offended arching her body up on her toes as she threw we call her triplea geller whispered after she threw a near bullseye and went out of earshot to retrieve the dart anybody anytime anywhere ouch shell put out for you if you want looking for love in all the polar places easier to warm up than ice cream ice cream abby dixon we keep the ice cream here outside and it comes in so rockhard we have to microwave it to eat it the joke is that dixon needs thirty seconds in the box too she seemed friendly enough everybody likes abby shes just not as friendly as our teammate there abbys got a boyfriend somewhere and pretends it still matters at the pole gabriella took aim again she could tell they were watching her talking about her and thrived on it reids really a good kid funloving if youre looking for that kind of thing im still getting over altitude sickness geller laughed gabriella hit the bullseye again shes good lewis observed coordinated geller said loud enough for her to hear the woman pulled the dart out coordinated enough to keep my thumb out from under a hammer which is more than i can say for you george i know i worship you babe and im indifferent to your existence she winked at lewis what brings you to the pole lewis asked her gabriella considered that one more seriously time money fun its kind of a doover you know doover i was in a cubicle next to three thousand coworkers and not a single real friend none of it was real nothing i was doing counted nobody seemed genuine there was too much noise so i decided to see if i could get a new start down here quite a change i hope so everyone comes down here with a lot of baggage armor everyone knows theyre going home so some people are here but theyre not really here you know what i mean you can just wait the winter out if you want to i dont want to wait i want to live life here now how about you lewis shrugged i guess im still a fingie on that one not for long maybe she was flirting he decided on caution theres some interesting personalities at the pole oddballs you mean characters individuals it wouldnt be worth being here if there werent would it she held out the darts your turn again and why the pole lewis asked her toeing up to the line because its a powerful place where all lines converge point zero youre on sacred ground jed lewis sacred snow isnt it just give yourself the luxury of feeling their medic nancy hodge came in and was cajoled into taking a turn her stance was firmer legs apart head cocked back rigidly dead serious she missed the board completely and everyone laughed thats the way she gives shots geller called nancy pulled the errant dart out goodhumoredly watch what you say george my charts tell me youre due for a prostate exam id rather get cancer nancy lined up again mouth pursed in concentration and this time managed to hit the edge of the board dana radioed the scoreless result now we know why we won the americas cup the kiwis radioed back the comment buzzing with static i guess athletics arent nurse nancys forte lewis observed not after teatime anyway geller murmured again if you need something checked try to see her in the morning shes steadier then booze ah i dont know shes just not big on the handeye coordination thing which aint too cool if you need brain surgery our sole physician you get the best and worst at the pole missionaries and escapees how many good doctors can walk away from their practices for a year its like the old naval surgeons they all tend to have interesting stories from the lines on her face she looks like shes got more than one my bet is she busted up with someone and came down here to lick her wounds or to find somebody else this can be lonelyhearts club sometimes goofily so hell even somebody as ugly as me gets lucky sometimes i dont know if i believe that one lewis said playing straight man its true the pilots brought in a crash dummy once and even he scored but nancys not competent i didnt say that shes smarter than any of us we have a lot of fun with each other kidding around just seems kind of rattled sometimes like shes anxious to get rid of a patient like shes afraid of making a mistake the darts were fun and unworldly performed to the background buzz of a radio linking them to a base across eight hundred miles of ice and snow the kiwis were intrigued by the new american mascot and dana insisted the slug was doing gyrations every time the yanks scored a point players drifted in and out lewis holding his own for a while with the americans down three matches to one however he excused himself and walked up a flight of stairs to the upstairs bar the only place on station where alcohol could be consumed it was the one nutrient they had to pay for norse was there and lewis joined him nodding at the psychologists beer and getting one of his own from the fridge putting a mark on a tab for later accounting feeling better i see norse observed just drinking after realizing what i got myself into miss your rocks already at least the ones ground into sand on a sunny beach norse looked at lewis with amusement its interesting that they picked a geologist to do your job i was available thats their reason whats yours it sounded like a shrink question i trace it all to my mother ah the psychologist nodded in defeat okay confession some other time he sipped his own beer i heard you met the estimable doctor moss he granted me an audience interesting that you two got together so quickly lewis wanted to deflect this line of questioning too hes friends with my mentor jim sparco and its fun to talk to god he says were all down here for science well thats the party line norse said were the cannon fodder of the national science foundation you know they see us all as a means to an end knowledge and you dont i see knowledge as a means to us as a way to develop as people its a subtle difference but an important one are we here to save civilization or is it here to save us some historians see all of human history as the triumph of the group over the individual but one of my questions is whether it isnt the extraordinary individual who defines the group if the groups purpose isnt to make possible the occasional exceptional human being the einstein the jefferson the alexander youre looking for einstein at the pole im looking for character integrity individuality i sense some of that in you jed you have a certain center of gravity and then determining if that kind of person functions in a tight almost claustrophobic society like the pole is smothered by it transcends it im just trying to keep my butt warm exactly lewis smiled norse seemed more interested in who jed really was than in helping him fit what the pole wanted him to be lots of individual characters here he said and i like that but it can be lonely being too individual thinking of someone in particular well i heard buck tysons real name is island that doesnt mean hes lonely he said at dinner that you two think alike norse laughed did he well my belief is that no two people do think alike contrary to popular belief the western god is rationality and a communal kind of sanity all of us agreeing on reality and pulling along the same track this social scientist is squishier im afraid theorizing that each of us is a prisoner of our own beliefs fears perceptions that we live in different worlds so to me the fundamental question is whether the kind of knowledge we gather in places like this leads to real sanity or some view of the universe that in its very rationality is truly insane does it lead to happiness wellbeing does it solve anything at all lewis considered isnt knowledge worthwhile just for its own sake rod cameron told me the purpose of life is learning arent we all down here because we sort of believe that in an unconscious way do you believe that the psychologist asked i dont know its nice to have a goal whose goal yours or the groups both no cameron just gave the goal to you lewis was irked now what do you think we came down here for i dont know the psychologist admitted he sipped again thats what im down here to find out make a guess i dont guess im a trained professional it was selfdeprecating the psychologist had his own evasions lewis saw not good enough he persisted whats your reason doc okay i came down here to see if we should be here at all the psychologist nodded as if to confirm it to himself do you know that america spends two hundred million dollars a year in antarctica two hundred mil on the altar of knowledge thats a goodly chunk of change but what if rationality is a fraud what if sanity the idea everyone should think the same way share the same reality is a fraud what if science is a fraud that what pretends to explain everything in fact explains nothing to animals like ourselves that nsf stands for a myth that the druids and pagans and witches were right and that the true knowledge the real insight is in the dark wood is in ourselves what if the outermost veneer of civilization we represent is no thicker than the aluminum on this dome what if at some point in our explorations we reach not revelation but utter mystery a whole new pit of the indescribable the unknowable he was looking at lewis his eyes bright what do we do then that intensity again lewis shrugged in selfdefense well golly open another beer i suppose he got one and did so youre saying youre getting your ass frozen off for no reason norse laughed as if that were a huge joke i hope not but you think were nutcases because we believe in sanity no no im rambling the psychologist studied his beer drinking but in an age when the machines are bending us to become like them to become part of them im curious what it still means to be human to stand for yourself here at the most inhuman place on earth lewis left the bar more wound up than when he entered it still unable to sleep as his brain tried to make up its mind about his new home he impulsively decided to walk outside no dome slug he the suiting up took fifteen laborious minutes and when he surmounted the ramp he saw the same pale sun at midnight that hed seen that morning weird the constant light was disorienting the circuit of the orb dizzying his own brain was swirling with impressions new faces glib philosophies individuals every one but a group too which was what hed come for wasnt it maybe doctor bobs problem was that hed never been truly alone lewis felt alone now the station still the breeze mild yet when he listened for the whisper of his freezing breath he realized he was not there was a distant whining noise of a moving machine and he gradually recognized it as a snowmobile tyson someone at least was out driving at the witching hour he began walking in a broad loop around the dome still puffing from the altitude looking for the source of the noise finally he saw a speck in the distance an orange dot on a black one someone driving out onto the featureless plateau he had no idea who the driver was old or young man or woman odd at this time but then scientists kept odd schedules where was there to go the sound seemed to connect them like a thread and his eye remained fixed on the receding traveler because there was nothing else to see then the snowmobile slid out of view as if entering a dip and a few seconds later the noise grumbled away silence lewis waited awhile for the pilgrim to reappear but nothing happened the plateau was empty he got cold and bored and turned back inside exhausted enough now for bed what came before i called him fat boy not to his face of course because by law and custom and administrative directive the university was so politically and sexually and racially correct that those of us grubbing for a check were expected to be as unctuous as undertakers prissy constipated and afraid but in my mind he was fat boy a lagging drogue of blubber a leech a handicap a brake an anchor a limit a curse i honor people who achieve the ultimate of what they can be i despise those who pretend to be what they can never be fat boy could never be a mountain climber let me tell you about climbing it is the most sublime of all human activities first because it is difficult second because it is dangerous third because it has a tangible goal and there can be no mistaking if that goal is reached or not you summit or you dont everything else is bullshit fourth because it is revealing a mountain brings out the truth in a man or woman and fifth because it is beautiful our doomed little party started out at three minutes past midnight the temperature fifteen degrees and the stars an orbiting city past the great dark silhouette of the cascades volcano that was our goal when the moon rose at three it turned the glacier into a bowl of milk and our route into a clean kind of heaven it was early enough in the season that the crevasses were mostly filled with snow and so we made good time fifteen college students two instructors and myself tagging along on each climb because i actually knew what the hell to do on a mountain it was a real class professor kressler getting paid to pursue his hobby fleming in his shadow like an eager puppy the kids getting credit for sweating in the snow for me it was an excuse to go climbing schmooze brownnose connect you know the drill we were roped in three parties of six the kids were quiet in awe of the mountain and i mostly just heard the clink of equipment and the rasp of nylon it was good that way the pant of their breathing was like a team of horses the plan was to summit an hour after dawn and then glissade back down before the rising spring sun turned the snow to mush it was the last climb of the semester id expected fat boy to drop the class by now he wasnt just obese he was weak he wasnt just weak he was incompetent he could never remember the knots never keep track of his gear and he wasnt just incompetent he was stupid twice hed dropped off a route to catch his wheezing little breath and once id had to go back down myself to find him he hadnt been apologetic hed been surly id told him the sport wasnt for him hed shown up the next class anyway i should have shaken him slapped him shamed him into recognizing his own limitations but we werent allowed to do that and at that time i was still weak i was still willing to believe that others the kind of morons that wind up in administration might know what was best for me the warning signs were there fat boy was last to climb out of his bag last to dress last to eat last to gather his equipment hed farted stumbled spilled after three months of classes he still needed help with his crampons still needed help with his line almost put another students eye out with his ice ax whining defensive apologetic in a realistic kind of world a just one his kind of genetic fluff would be combed away in an instant but the world carries its cripples now doesnt it for a while i thought we could pull him along okay like a goat on the end of a wagon fleming the other prof knew how much i hated the kid and so put him on his rope last in line and managed to cajole rather than curse the man had the patience of a saint and for a while i could forget fat boy was with us we topped the glacier made sullivans saddle and pushed on up the central cone only half an hour behind schedule the boy had blubbered a bit nose dripping pack awry one mitten lost who the hell knew where but he was keeping up with a frantic gasp and if we finally made the damn summit i think id have been almost ready to forgive him my contempt wouldnt fade but my anger might i was actually in a good mood that morning i still had a life the sky was pinking the cascades were turning from black to deep blue shadow and we could see the glint of the cities along the sound the air was cold and so clean it washed you out laundered your brain and i could taste the top we were so close clouds were building in the west an approaching storm but i thought we could beat it i was ready to forgive fat boy anything if we could just finish and be done but then there was a shout and the party came to a jerking unsteady halt the students gasping gratefully for breath in the respite confused calls running up and down the line i unroped and sidestepped down the snow trying to find out what was the matter minutes ticking on the sun approaching to the east overcast from the west the summit waiting we had a tight window we had to summit and get down of course i knew what id find before i even got down to the last team fleming pointed in the light of the dimming moon and i followed the rope with my eye to where its end trailed on the snow like a dead snake empty of anything hed spoiled it of course for all the others hed spoiled it for me fat boy had untied himself and was gone chapter six lewis sniffed abby dixons approach before he saw her not perfume her breath his new instruments at clean air alerted him so sensitive was the carbon dioxide sampler at detecting changes in the surrounding atmosphere that the tracking pen jumped from the contribution of her lungs other meters logged the dying sunlight chlorofluorocarbons that could attack the earths ozone layer ozone itself and water vapor it was like gaining new senses hed come back inside after a brisk thirty minutes of collecting snow samples and was still warming up in front of his machines when she stamped her boots in the vestibule by the door gearloose he greeted her rockhead she replied cheerfully pulling off her parka im thinking of a nickname a little less descriptive lewis said vaguely heroic perhaps like stormwatcher skywalker it will never catch on she hung up her coat too nice doesnt anyone have a flattering nickname neutral is the best you can hope for how did the tradition get started she plopped into a chair shivering slightly as the tension of being in the cold outside was shed her cheeks pink her dark eyes bright she seemed confident in this environment and he liked that her strength her energy i dont know the navy maybe or the parkas when were outdoors its hard to tell whos who everyone looks like an orange traffic cone so they came up with name tags except people didnt like that it felt like we were at a convention so some put them upside down names seem part of the world weve left behind so people got tagged for their occupations and it evolved in the perverse way things do around here you have noticed how perverse this all is wade pulaski told me its paradise she laughed cueball would say that thats his nickname he called this place planet cueball i thought he was referring to the terrain not his head rod says he looks like queequeg in moby dick id go with jesse ventura or an old yul brynner movie hes actually exmilitary which he doesnt talk much about except to hint he was into some extreme stuff scuba climbing biting the heads off chickens whatever apparently he didnt fit into ordinary life very well so he came down here odd alternative better than winding up a mercenary in angola i guess you could say that about all of us the south pole saved you from angola abby smiled the south pole saved me from being ordinary there was silence as he considered this of course its interesting i could detect your approach by your co lewis finally said he pointed to his sampler its like i have superpowers down here by the end of the winter youll wonder if the instruments are an extension of you or if youre an extension of your instruments the observation seemed to echo what norse had said about machines had he made the same ramblings to her to what do i owe this visit the official reason is that i wanted to check to make sure the broken computer is performing okay wow every technician ive ever spoken to after fortyfive minutes on hold with excruciating music wanted to get off the line as rapidly as possible none ever called back to see if things actually worked she smiled again youre in paradise like cueball said and whats the unofficial reason youve come for a breath of clean air i wanted to check how youre getting along it isnt easy being the fingie and everyones curious about you so curious she looked at him wryly its unusual to come down on the last plane like you did and youre a geologist not a meteorologist which is kind of odd and you quit some oil company apparently and you came for the gossip i came for the truth its a small town jed people talk speculate if they dont know about a person things just get made up ah so they send a comely lass to worm my secrets out of me a spy a temptress a she wrinkled her nose please but its more than your undeniable fascination with me lewis grinned disarmingly he was enjoying this youre an emissary of espionage you were elected someone sent you she looked disappointed its that obvious im just used to being ignored by women i doubt that she paused to let him mentally log the compliment actually doctor bob suggested i visit he said hes trying to write up a sociological profile of the base who we are why were here then hell track our attitudes over the winter at the end were all toast yes the good doctor already asked me to explain myself you know lewis said he told me that she admitted and he said men will tell things to women they wont tell to men lewis smiled as he looked at her her neck high ears as fine as shell eyes large and guileless he could guess why norse had recruited this assistant she could attract any man on base and wasnt surprised shed agreed to be recruited it was indeed a small town people would make fast friendships and theyd rupture even faster hed noticed the undercurrent of flirting and competition almost immediately what was it cameron had said about women were more civilized now well maybe for a spy youre pretty blunt you might want to work on that the truth is im not very good at the whole human interaction thing who is i guess thats what doctor bob wants to know so do you want me on a couch he asked should i blame it all on my parents my unhappy childhood did you have an unhappy childhood dismayingly no middle class middle brow middle life me neither wealthy parents but nice too its so annoying they watched each other for a moment smiling slightly damn lewis finally said i dont know what doctor bob is going to find to do all winter well she said youre not entirely normal were all wondering what a geologist is doing on an ice cap ah jim sparco was desperate for a replacement hes studying oscillations in polar climates spaced over decades and my predecessor took sick as you know reading the thermometer is not that hard a job what did your family say my folks are dead actually accident im sorry it happened after i left home quite a while ago anyway i was pretty much alone job gone friends fleeting no warm and fuzzy relationships no significant other he took her curiosity as a good sign i never stayed in one place so girls didnt stay either there wasnt a lot holding me still she persisted its hard to find people to come down here sometimes especially at the last minute yes i was desperate too she looked at him with honest curiosity what happened he paused to remember what had happened the tumult of emotions hed experienced was only slowly being sifted by his mind into a coherent story i went into geology because i liked explanations he finally said rocks were a puzzle out of the past a trip back in time they were also stationary and organized and understandable compared to people i liked mountain climbing so it meshed with my hobby but to make a living in geology i had to concentrate on one kind of puzzle where oil is hidden that was fine for a while exciting even texas the gulf arabia but then i wound up on the north slope of alaska puzzling in a place we werent really supposed to be just in case congress changes its mind someday about opening up the wildlife refuges to drilling we were pretending to be backpacking tourists but we were setting off shock waves to probe for oil and you began to question what you were doing no he said slowly it was like there was never any question and then suddenly there was no question about quitting the tundra did that to me she waited for him to explain its a place something like this one not snowcovered not in summer but treeless and stark with this low everlasting light that seems to reach inside you and yet it took me a month before i really noticed that my mind was underground finally there was a rainstorm late one afternoon dark and furious driving us into camp and then rainbows and finally a plume like smoke curling over one ridge under that prism of light at first i thought it was a fire but how could a fire burn in a place that damp then i realized it was caribou a drift of life in a place so empty that suddenly everything hit me like adrenaline all my senses suddenly came awake do you know the feeling she nodded cautiously maybe like falling in love the analogy hadnt occurred to him and he cocked his head maybe anyway what i was seeing was the porcupine river herd id seen animals of course but never animals in numbers like you see numbers of people never animals to make you question everything you thought you knew about whose world this truly is they came over a ridge and down to the kavik river i stood there in that light watching them for hours and that was it suddenly the idea of spending my life looking for a pollutant struck me as profoundly unsatisfactory sneaking onto a refuge seemed wrong people told me my dinner was getting cold but i ignored them and then that i would get cold if i stood out there all night but i ignored that too it wasnt even night of course the sun never fully set i didnt feel the cold at all everything just got rosy and soft finally when everyone else was asleep i pulled together some gear and started walking after the herd i left a note so they wouldnt worry about me what did it say she asked she was looking at him appraisingly finding herself liking a man who could be affected so profoundly by caribou his smile was wry i quit im sure that did reassure them one of the things i realized is that i didnt truly know a single person in that camp had never thought deeply about what i was doing nothing to hold you like you said nothing to care about nothing to be proud of i walked two days before i hit the haul road that runs from fairbanks up to prudhoe bay it was the loneliest two days ive ever had and two of the best they turned me inside out then some scientists came by in a bronco and gave me a ride i stayed at an ecological research camp at a place called toolik lake and thats where i met jim sparco he was doing climate measurements in the arctic and hes one of those rare omnivores interested in all kinds of science we hit it off talking about weather geology climate and oceans come from rocks you know volcanoes run the planet we stayed in touch while i bummed around idaho i was running out of money deciding what to do next when i got a package from sparcos lab in boulder it had a tshirt inside that read ski the south pole two miles of base half an inch of powder plus his telephone number i called and the rest as they say is history he sent it to a geologist yes because he knew me and because of mickeys rock he was surprised howd you know about that i told you therere no secrets here its a small place mickey went weird at the drill site one day last fall evasive and people have wondered ever since if he found something unusual he seemed pretty excited for a guy whose project is over budget and behind schedule then a geologist its not hard to put two and two together what else could he find in the ice but a meteorite he told me no one knew people guess theres always a lot of buzz about everything because theres nothing else to do the question is why did you come all this way to see it its more like i agreed to see it in return for getting to come all this way she leaned forward looking expectant and and what is it significant he stalled wondering what to say dont i get seduced first sorry just twenty questions youre the worst spy ive ever seen he knew she was pumping him and that he should muster some annoyance but he actually enjoyed the attention the fact is he asked me to keep quiet about it im not supposed to talk she nodded her interest confirmed he wouldnt bring you down here if it wasnt important lewis smiled like a sphinx women are so snoopy women listen sparco is a friend of mosss our astrophysicist wanted an opinion from a rockhound i was unemployed thats all there is to it i havent even done any tests yet but what you saw is worth testing well see if its the right kind of meteorite it could be big for mickeys reputation thats not what i mean you know thats not what i mean what she was too damn smart and he liked smart women if its a meteorite it could be worth a lot the wind came up as evening approached when lewis walked back to the dome from the clean air facility he felt the first true bite of winter the temperature still hovered at sixty below but a rising wind pushed the windchill to minus one hundred dry snow undulated in ragged sheets across the ice the flakes rasping at the fluttering nylon of his windpants they stung the bits of skin that were exposed his upper cheeks and temples the wind made a low moaning sound as it blew a discomfiting change from the earlier quiet and when he followed the fluttering route flags to the dome he found the big bay doors had been closed against the first drifts he yanked open a smaller door to one side and the wind pushed him as he stepped in so that he had to lean back against the door to shut it as he caught his breath he regarded the gloom of the dome with new gratitude inside felt safer he could still hear the hoarse scratching of antarctica the blowing snow made it sound as if the aluminum dome were being sanded lewis didnt see norse at dinner and so went looking for him afterward guessing the weight room attached to his berthing module the psychologist was the kind of guy who would try to stay in shape norse wasnt there but harrison adams said hed just left heading for the sauna the astronomer was working out in faded trunks and gray baggy tshirt grunting as he lifted with his white stringy muscles adams was a sharply intellectual man obsessed with the sky and it was odd to see him like that can you take a minute to spot me lewis lewis wasnt anxious to he found adams prickly the kind of scientist who did not suffer fools gladly and who thought everyone who wasnt interested in what he was interested in was a fool i need to find doctor bob hell cook for a while come on spot me first tyson certainly wont the big mechanic was lifting in a corner an enormous weight across his back as his knees bent and straightened like thick hairy pistons his lungs whooshing like a surfacing whale he looked at them balefully as if offended by their mere presence for a man who claimed a crushing workload he seemed to have plenty of time and energy to lift weights what do i have to do lewis asked adams stand over me on the bench here while i press just so i dont pin myself why cant buck do it tyson pushed himself erect exhaling im busy hes always busy adams said moving to the bench too busy to grade the trail to the dark sector too busy to fix the spryte too busy to move the cargo for my scope repair before this wind came up too busy to give me any hope of meeting schedule im not your servant adams the weight clanged heavily down tysons arms dangling after it like an apes the world doesnt revolve around you the astronomer lay down on the stained weight bench were not serving me are we mr tyson were serving the research were justifying our time and expense the world does revolve around this pole except too many of us have to wait on you screw you tyson stretched shoulda let me go home when i had the chance if you dont like me and get in line tell cameron to back off on the other stuff he wants me to do if youre so anxious for my help you use too much water too you ignore the rationing people resent it let them drink beer im talking about the showers let them shower in beer adams gripped the bar of the weights at the end of the winter buck theres going to be a review for bonuses and recommendations for future employment tyson took two fiftypound weights and began hoisting them like a crane is that a threat harry he knew adams hated the common nickname adams began lifting too grunting simply a reminder of how things are he gasped im thinking how things ought to be adams was growing red from the exertion maybe you ought to think about where you are right now buck your future your lack of it his arms were shaking with the final lift maybe i am thinking about my future maybe im not the moron you think i am maybe errand boy here is starting to think for himself the astronomer gasped and put the weight to rest sitting up he was sweating angry frustrated you cant go through the winter like this buck you cant sulk for eight damnable months youve got to get along really and who says tyson racked his own weights with a thud who says i have to get along with anybody the truth is adams you need me but i dont need you for a single fucking thing i could care less about the sky i could care less about you or the fingie there or cameron or any other moron stupid enough to like it down here i do my job at my own pace mind my own business and count the days until i get out and if people were honest about it everyone else does that too no they dont like all you beakers are best buddies you know moss pigs out on the grant competition you know youre in a race with all the beakers to get papers featured in science or nature you know the competition is about as collegial as a convention of mafia dons and you know that all you want from me is a broad back and compliant brain two weeks after the winter is over you wont remember who i am dammit thats not true this is the one time in your life to contribute to so you can take that bonus of yours and cram it up your ass because down here i dont have to take no shit from nobody the big man walked out adams shook his head looking after him now theres a project for doctor bob he muttered to lewis doctor bob might think tyson has a legitimate point of view adams snorted shrinks think everything is a legitimate point of view lewis went to the sauna cameron had told him the cedar box was both a morale booster and a safety feature adept at warming people up after too much exposure outside it was also supposed to relax them bringing them together in communal contemplation it worked well enough to be heavily used lewis shed his clothes wrapped a towel around his middle and stepped into the redlit dimness inside he recognized norses muscled form and mohawk crew cut through a veil of hissing steam and sat down on a cedar bench the psychologist lazily raised a hand adams and i were just talking about you lewis greeted in flattering terms i hope about putting buck tyson on the couch making him into mr rogers norse smiled as if therapists could make anyone into anything the best they can do im afraid is help people come to grips with who they are i think bucks already come to grips with himself as a selfcentered showerhogging antisocial dysfunctional buttugly son of a bitch so good for him norse threw some water on the sauna rocks releasing a hiss of steam the psychologist leaned back uncharacteristically quiet who am i doc for a minute he thought norse wasnt going to answer then thats what im working on remember i talked to your spy today spy abby came out to poke into my past said she was working for you oh yes he sounded unembarrassed shes already reported back and said you were desperate i think that was the word its in my notes his tone was amused is that description accurate do you think i suppose it is the psychologist said of everyone whats the phrase lives of quiet desperation they were quiet again then what the hell are you really doing down here doc i already told you trying to get into our brains is just going to piss people off im not trying to do that its one thing to trade life stories its another to be pinned like a bug to a wall for some shrinks research project i dont care for it and i dont think anyone else is going to either i know youve got your job to do but nobody asked for a psychologist and its going to be a long winter head collecting isnt going to make you popular norse turned and looked at lewis directly for the first time his features indistinct in the shadows he seemed to be considering what to say questions bother you dont they he finally tried i just dont think i have to explain myself nor do i norse thought a moment okay look first of all im not a psychiatrist im a psychologist im an observer not a therapist i dont change people i only study them but your point is well taken ive got not only the most unpopular job ive got the most difficult one so do you know why im really here thats what im asking because were about to leave this planet jed he waited for a reaction what the hell does that mean childhoods end as arthur c clarke would say space travel is inevitable maybe well eventually find some new eden or be able to build one way out there but the first voyages are going to be in conditions like we have at the pole hostile crowded uncomfortable a ship of strangers maybe a ship of fools who is going to go out there why can they function when they do this place does which is exactly why im here you think your job is important and it is all the jobs down here are important but of equal importance is the mere fact of your existence that youre here at all surviving cooperating feuding an unwitting guinea pig at the beginning of the next era the pole is at the edge of space cold dry clear deadly it doesnt even have normal time can we adapt to that we have to somehow earth isnt going to last forever the national science foundation and nasa are as interested in our simple existence as in our research product uncomfortable result me i dont want to be written up as some misfit norse laughed misfit i wish it were that simple meaning what meaning that misfit is a copout word everyone fits but each in their own way from admiral to hermit but you called us guinea pigs right rats in your maze thats what im trying to explain norse said im not allowed to build a maze not as an observational psychologist sociologist its bad enough im here at all an observer who changes things slightly by the simple act of observing manipulating events would discredit my entire study it would ruin my winter no my issue is different what drives people to places like this is one of the greatest mysteries of human history why did we ever leave africa why do we risk at all do you know that when shackleton came down to antarctica just before the first world war to drag his men through several circles of hell his advertisement to attract fiftysix recruits promised only low pay abysmal conditions hardship and danger and do you know how many applicants he attracted plenty ill bet five thousand lewis didnt want to admit his surprise humans like adventure they get bored adventure change escape and yet when they get to a place like this they get all the visual stimulation of a cement wall i mean come on its amundsenscott base thats pinning us like bugs to a wall were a little island with tedious routine the very people who most want to come to the pole may be the least qualified to coexist here at least thats one theory do we need commandos in space or accountants thats the question when the heat went off the other day some reacted smoothly and some had a little panic not necessarily the ones youd expect im in the prediction business like you youre trying to forecast the climate and im trying to forecast human nature we both look at patterns to do it youre going to list twentysix rational reasons for being here whats rational wasnt that our discussion at the bar when the first world war finally started with shackletons ship trapped and sinking in the ice the germans launched a massive attack through belgium toward france they did so even though they knew mathematically that their attack couldnt succeed their own planners had calculated they could not move enough troops on belgiums dirt roads in the time available to beat the french once they got there the whole idea was doomed but they did it anyway producing a monstrous fouryear stalemate that slaughtered millions and do you know why why because it was the best plan they had at the time the psychologist waited watching lewis did norse believe a thing he was saying or was this a calculated game to elicit reaction he tossed another cup of water on the hot stones obscuring himself with steam thats human motivation for you the best plan we have given our tangled past messy emotions confused logic and vain hopes my issue is is that good enough can we rely on each other becoming stronger than the sum of our parts or does it all fall apart somewhere on the way to pluto lewis thought back to the argument in the weight room your conclusion would be premature thats why im spending the winter but corporate and government america worships groups teamwork the committee modern historians have abandoned the importance of the individual leader and embraced economics and sociology and biological instinct they worship the anthill one of my questions is whether that worship is appropriate in extreme circumstances when does a team become a herd and then a mob how important is the individual and selfreliance can a single person like yourself or buck tyson change the chemistry of an entire community were pericles and caesar and napoleon and lincoln the product of their times or the creators how the hell are you going to tell that down here by watching what happens to us when the first real tests come lewis was acclimating to the pole his first nights in his ice room hadnt frozen him to the wall as hed joked but theyd been uncomfortably restless as his body adjusted to the dryness and altitude his dreams were turbulent and hed jerk awake suddenly gasping for air alternately parched or prodded by a full bladder yet slowly his breathing and pulse slowed he found himself regularly using lotion on his hands and face for the first time in his life fighting the dryness pulaski told him to smear his nostrils with vaseline before venturing outdoors to protect the lining of his nose and he began to associate the smell with the snow inside the dome he noticed the rarity of smell when he took one of the last fresh oranges from the galley to the computer lab and peeled it abby was drawn from a machine she was fixing like a moth to a flame each strip of skin released a puff of scent intoxicating and tropical that drifted on the currents of ventilated air hiro sakura came too sniffing and so did nancy hodge he playfully offered them sections of fruit juicy and elastic together they bit and sucked with wistful glee ambrosia abby was becoming a friend he told her about the drift of the continents and how antarctica had once had forests and dinosaurs she talked about the history of communication and how the internet was like a melding of brains an accelerator of thought as potentially revolutionary as the printing press how machines might outsmart them all once she took him to the garage and they checked out a snowmobile abby demonstrating how to use it on a runway that was beginning to drift in the coming dark it would be too cold to use them they skittered around the quonset huts of summer camp her arms around his waist shouting directions into his hood the air cutting so fiercely that they had to give it up after half an hour his nights had turned deep and dreamless his body sapped each evening by the toll of cold he set an alarm to keep on schedule and when it went off hed jerk awake disoriented and groggy the sky didnt help him to tell time when his door slammed open in the middle of one sleep then lights blazing on his shock and confusion were profound he jerked in his blankets panicked at the chance of fire and then before he could collect himself cameron and moss were crowded into his room jostling his bed rifling his things lewis sat up in his underwear dumbfounded norse was there too he realized hovering just outside the door what the hell moss was pawing through his duffel in frustration and cameron leaned over his bed pinning him in place relax lewis were here to help what his heart was hammering in confusion the quickest way to remove suspicion is to do a search mickey insisted get him the hell out of my things no can do bob he appealed to norse who was watching from outside the door the psychologist reluctantly stepped into the room glancing around its for your own good sport moss swore backed out from under the bed and stood up winded nothing the astrophysicist looked disgusted at lewis and at the world what in the hell is going on the three others looked at each other confirming and then norse spoke thats what we want to ask you mickeys meteorite is missing chapter seven what we have here is a fascinating sociological situation robert norse was enjoying their dilemma the others looked at the psychologist sourly mickey moss and rod cameron hadnt slept and lewis was still groggy from having been awakened the four were crowded into the station managers office next to comms the radio communication center of the base it was tight hot and electric with tension fucking swell cameron muttered what time is it anyway lewis asked blearily threethirty threethirty in the morning stop whining the suns up it was a sour attempt at levity the sun was always up until it went down in a couple of weeks and stayed there already the outside was a world of blue shadow something of uncertain value norse went on disappears in a tiny community from which there is no possibility of a getaway why who how the why is obvious moss rumbled our newest member mr lewis here somehow called attention to my find after i sought his expertise the motive is money money he confirmed that id discovered a scientifically important meteorite the right kind can be valuable norse turned to lewis is that true jed lewis looked at moss warily miffed that the scientist had searched him i agreed it might be important i hadnt even started the chemical analysis yet how much should he say rich people will pay a lot for a piece of outer space its a fad what kind of money throwing figures around will only encourage thievery moss cautioned id say the thiefs already encouraged norse countered lewis looked uncomfortably at moss the astrophysicist shrugged gloomily one entrepreneur put tiny slices in lucite cubes and sold them on the home shopping network lewis finally said hundred bucks each nice payday an intact one from the south pole that could come from mars or the moon who knows thousands per gram which means norse prompted moss was looking at the floor lewis shrugged five million dollars youre kidding cameron interjected maybe more no way if theres any microscopic fossil evidence of life the value becomes astronomical pun intended jesus the station manager thought a moment but thats not an issue not down here by treaty you cant sell anything found in antarctica its against international law lewiss tone was flat thats good to know people down here dont care about money glad to hear it cameron looked at moss you knew this in theoretical terms the astrophysicist said blandly the price is irrelevant to the science when sparco said hed be willing to use a geologist who could also give a quick judgment on my discovery i was delighted it seemed useful and lewis here said he needed a job but perhaps he concluded he could earn more another way meaning what lewis asked that youre the thief moss looked at him squarely waiting for denial and then waiting for any kind of response at all lewis refused to give it to him im sorry young man this may be completely unfair the astrophysicist finally went on with less certainty but i prefer not to be oblique you have the knowledge to market such a rock the skill to assess its true value and possibly the need and bitterness as a fired petroleum engineer to hock it when the rock disappeared i was forced to think about it from your point of view to come down to study weather is a detour from your primary career to come down for a meteorite from mars or the moon discovered at the south pole thats very good pay for enduring a single winter norse was looking at moss with amused interest stealing something when you cant get away makes no sense at all lewis said slowly and i wasnt fired i quit thats what you say my point is we dont really know what your story is and its disappearance is coincidental with your arrival the common knowledge that there is a meteorite apparently came with my arrival but not from anything i said people were speculating about what you found for months inviting down a geologist simply confirmed it and how do you know that moss demanded because his emissarylewis pointed to norse told me so abby dixon who the computer technician cameron explained moss thought oh yes the cute one he squinted at lewis youre saying shes the thief no im saying anyone might have known enough to lift it from your file cabinet aha but it wasnt in my file cabinet id hidden it lewis threw up his arms in exasperation then how could i or anyone else have taken it moss opened his mouth and then closed it looking troubled i thought youd seen me and guessed seen what that he drove out to the solar observatory on the plateau at midnight when it was closed down for the season and there was no scientific reason to go there norse said quietly it appears doctor moss in trying to hide his find betrayed it lewis was surprised so it had been moss hed seen moss turned to norse you saw i heard about it at breakfast the psychologist said dryly i dont know how many people saw you but your snowmobile trip so soon after jed arrived set tongues wagging you might as well have buried it with ceremony at the pole stake i thought people were supposed to sleep moss groused i informed my colleagues i had to doublecheck the winterization well the general consensus is that your excuse was bullshit the astrophysicist looked embarrassed for only a moment so you told abby dixon about its value moss suddenly accused lewis youre not getting the point it was more like she told me mickey did you email colleagues in the states about your find cameron asked just sparco who could have emailed who knows who with word bouncing back down here i dont think so but its possible moss frowned yes he didnt like the suggestion he was somehow at fault and irrelevant word leaked the issue now is the theft so what do you want cameron asked slowly the astrophysicist took a deep breath we know lewis here didnt hide it in his room and im not surprised but a thief had to hide it somewhere i want to search the station every bed every handbag anyone who is innocent shouldnt object if the culprit wishes to confess and give it back im prepared to end the matter for the winter we all have to live with each other if not then i want it found he waited he doesnt have probable cause to search anybody lewis objected yes i do this is a very tiny village young man and i have the certainty that my meteorite is in the hands of someone in our colony of twentysix souls that doesnt make you the gestapo the astrophysicist was miffed at this challenge to his authority nor do you have the right as a raw newcomer to call names your obstruction is exactly the tactic of a trapped thief hey time out cameron lifted his arms looking tired he was irritated with mosss accusations but there was a subtle issue of rank here rod was station manager but michael m moss was the quintessential old antarctic explorer an astrophysicist whod been doing work at the pole since the s the national science foundation respected this kind of longevity they liked the guys who came back ignoring moss was a political risk because word of any snub would get back to washington the man had become cranky and vindictive as he aged and it was dangerous to cross him mickey we all operate on mutual trust down here cameron tried you know that we depend on each other for survival making accusations of thievery is like throwing gasoline on a fire so is stealing ive been here longer and trusted longer than anybody well i didnt take your rock lewis said he was disappointed that cameron was allowing himself to be bullied by the headstrong scientist it wasnt right then i want this place turned over until we find out who did cameron groaned mickey im not going to let this pass rod are you going to be searched lewis asked moss snorted me im the victim here how do we know that youre presumptuous fingie not as presumptuous as you im afraid lewis has a point norse interjected quietly moss looked at the psychologist with annoyance pardon that you have the plainest motive of all if the rock seems to have disappeared you could smuggle and sell it without arousing suspicion if you have a grudge against someone like lewis here all you have to do is hide the rock and accuse him of stealing it in fact you could plant it on him or anyone else maybe youre looking for sympathy maybe youve decided the meteorite is actually worthless but still want recognition for what you almost had i can think of a thousand reasons to suspect you he shrugged you have a devious mind cameron complimented hes full of shit the astrophysicist corrected thank you norse said occupational requirement what youve suggested is ridiculous moss went on im just saying that were dealing with pandoras box here you throw accusations around and human emotions begin to burn like gunpowder we need to think about this carefully a disappearance occurring in a group small enough for everyone to be searched and questioned if it comes to that does the thief wish to be caught did he hide the meteorite where it cant be found do we arouse suspicions a dilemma as old as the first sailing ships im sure im glad youre having so much fun doc cameron said lewiss mind was whirring moss abby who had the most plausible motive investigating this could prove a nightmare norse said however its just the kind of emotional dilemma i was hoping to explore then maybe you stole the rock cameron said with a sigh he was visibly aging indeed i should be among the first searched if we decide to take that step and doctor moss just as we searched jed anyone with knowledge or motive if we truly want to investigate this were going to be making a list and checking it twice so the question is indeed who who knew about the meteorite the others looked uncomfortable thinking well i did cameron conceded i was skeptical about the lewis hire a geologist in a weather job mickey filled me in sort of i probably should have locked up the damn thing except theres no place to lock it norse made a checkmark in the air with his finger yes of course lewis i didnt tell anyone but abby said it was common knowledge or at least rumor the meteorite craze is no secret id look for someone who needed money people down here dont care about money norse quipped quoting cameron the station manager scowled i heard gellers got some debt he allowed tysons talked about money alexi doesnt have any in russia prestige norse interrupted the station manager shrugged thats wide open any scientist anyone jealous anyone who doesnt like mickey moss looked annoyed which means that lewis here could actually be a fall guy for the real thief norse concluded they wait until he arrives and lift the meteorite voila the fingie gets fingered by accusing lewis you might be playing into their hand moss looked at norse with frank dislike i despise your profession you know and i think youre close to retirement after an arduous career that has yielded you little fame and less money we have no idea what you intended to do with the rock moss jerked as if stung lewis was surprised at the psychologists apparent willingness to make a powerful enemy willingness to come to jeds aid so doc do we turn over the mattresses cameron asked the psychologist his tone strained by the sparring stripsearch the inmates thats your decision of course im just the observer but we can consider the pros and cons the danger of any search is it accomplishes nothing while pissing people off the advantage is it could recover the meteorite how much does that opinion cost moss asked sarcastically norse ignored him maybe we should sleep on it cameron said no moss objected that just gives the thief time i dont advise that either norse said make a decision we should all pledge ourselves to secrecy about this discussion of course but i guarantee the dilemma will be all over the base anyway inside of an hour you dont have a very high opinion of us i dont have a very high opinion of human nature cameron looked gloomy he was thinking of the station report hed have to file would a thief really be stupid enough to put it in his room yes because he might not be after a rock or money so much as to satisfy some other psychological need criminals betray themselves with regularity a surprise search could work failure however might simply encourage our troublemaker theres no right answer we could just forget about the damn rock cameron said norse smiled yes forget about several million dollars i dont want to turn the station upside down moss glared if you dont i will theres science at stake too if that rock really hails from mars or even if it doesnt cameron closed his eyes people are going to go apeshit mickey moss looked implacable i already have perhaps theres another solution norse suggested whats that the station manager asked gloomily jed lewis here represents opportunity the psychologist nodded toward the newcomer hes a geologist our resident expert on all things stony he should be motivated to clear his name so i propose two things first that with his permission we search his workplace as well i dont think well find anything even if hes the thief but it simply eliminates one of the variables then search each of the rest of us in turn right now with all four along lets not have suspicions linger that any of us have anything obvious to hide his eyes polled the others no one spoke to object second lets enlist lewis as our detective what do you mean moss said slowly lewis simply tells the truth he admits he was brought down partly to check out the meteorite he quietly lets slip its missing and asks for guidance on likely suspects these are people whove been together for four months they know each other by now perhaps a suspect emerges im going to be a private eye a discreet investigator youre going to be yourself with a newcomers curiosity its not rod laying down the law its not mickey looking like a steaming bull its you asking a few new friends for help if you handle it right no one will be upset what friends another of your spies he clarified mickeys spy lewis looked at the others considering poking around was unlikely to make him very popular yet if he didnt hed be hung with mosss presumption that he had something to do with the disappearance a lousy choice what do i get if i find it your good name back norse said i never lost my good name your name and a recommendation for future employment moss said no lewis shook his head theres no reason i shouldnt get that anyway im doing my job i didnt take your damn rock i want something else what then cameron asked an apology for dragging me into this he pointed at moss from him the astrophysicist scowled moss was not the type to apologize to anybody find it first he said grudgingly an apology for rousting me out of bed find it moss growled and ill be fair and what does that mean that you dont want me as an enemy chapter eight now what sherlock lewis stood indecisively at the junction of tunnels near the entrance to the dome two corrugated steel archways both completely buried under the snow branched at either arm to his left were the generators gym and garage biomed the sick bay was to his right tucked into the same arch that held the stations fuel supply the tunnels were like a huge half culvert cold and dimly lit and a scuffed layer of dirty snow coated their plywood floors like old sawdust the medical facility was a windowless metal box the size of a truck trailer inside this makeshift hospital doctor nancy hodge dispensed everything from useless advice on the inevitable polar crud we cant escape each others viruses deal with itto betterappreciated painkillers stitches and antiseptics if seriously hurt their lives were in her hands if desperately ill or wounded there was probably little she could do it was a place to start by necessity hodge knew everybody lewis wanted to find the meteorite not for itself so much as to find whod caused him this trouble any thief must have known the fingie would be suspect and of all the people on base he was least equipped to probe because he was the fingie the outsider he really knew no one which the thief knew too you can be more objective because youre new cameron had told him bullshit it was a sop to mickey moss and a thankless job for krill low man on the totem pole but hed do it to save his winter and if he found the rock hed be tempted to keep the dang thing but first he had to find it find someone who knew peoples secrets the four men whod met in comms had searched each others rooms in the quiet hours before breakfast and found nothing of interest except mosss fondness for a box of scratched vinyl lps hed shipped with an old turntable a barrelshaped kit telescope that norse was assembling to look at the winter stars and a shelf of pathetic howtobeaboss books next to camerons bedside norse had a chess set cameron a jigsaw puzzle mickey a book of crosswords lewis wasnt surprised at the lack of smoking guns no one was going to put the rock under his pillow but it had satisfied him to rifle through their belongings as they had his served them right now he pulled open the door and stepped into biomed doctor hodge the medic looked up with a start a small pharmacy of pills was scattered on the wool blanket of the sick bay bed nancy was bent forward from a chair and going through it sorting drugs into piles the doctor jerked at the intrusion and some of the pills went awry nancy hastily rolled them back dont you knock i didnt know we were supposed to sometimes i have patients i thought youd use the lock she was slightly mollified lewis was new after all we never use it because someone might be in a hurry in an emergency looking for stuff when im not around is this an emergency not exactly then knock next time she began scooping up pills and putting them into bottles so you got the crud no he glanced around there was an examining table and the single bed just wanted to pick your brain the doctor straightened and leaned back in her metal chair looking curious and mildly wary she got tense and excitable when patients showed up a lapse in bedside manner that had already made base personnel reluctant to seek her care had there been some kind of malpractice back home or was she still just adjusting to the pole now she gestured toward the bed as if there were a need to explain look at all this medicine thats accumulated over the years antibiotics aspirin laxatives even seasick pills some are pretty potent im trying to sort it out she held up two pills one to make you bigger and another to make you small your own pharmacy i could market on street corners she smiled slightly and he realized how rarely nancy mustered amusement she wasnt dour but she was serious tired maybe thin her face beginning to line her hair to gray her eyes to lose their optimism late forties and tough as horn not something wed advertise to nsf thats the odd thing isnt it lewis said that in theory we could do anything we want down here and nobody would ever know nancy shrugged thats the theory the truth is that everyone is such a blabbermouth that sooner or later the feds in dc know everything which probably is just as well that half smile again keeps the place from exploding im wondering if you know everything what does that mean about the people who come down here you get their records and you might have some insight as to what makes them tick she laughed if you mean their organs yes if you mean their heads no thats doctor bobs business hes too new youve been with everybody for four months as their medic not their mother i just need somebody who might have insights that slight smile again and a sigh lewis youre looking at a woman who realized not long ago that she doesnt know anything about anybody she held up her left hand displaying that white streak on her ring finger a medical marvel who just happened not to notice that the man shed lived with for eighteen years had taken up with one of her own nurses drained her savings and eloped to mexico until he sent a dear jane letter from a guadalajara cybercafe you want medical advice maybe i can help you want to understand people theres nobody more clueless than me she nodded toward the door he stood his ground well youre the only person i can think of to start start what getting mickey moss off my back she regarded him speculatively for a moment finally she pushed away from the pillladen bed whats the problem doctor moss found this meteorite in the ice now its missing so its been stolen nancy looked skeptical stolen why its probably worth some money the medic barked a laugh not down here it isnt who are you going to hock it to but later outside no that doesnt make sense nancys mind was quick everyone admitted that and she was instantly engaged by this mystery i mean steal it now and sit on it all winter no no no a prank maybe a borrowing when was it missed i dont know couple days ago i took a look at it because im a geologist and mickey hid it out in the solar observatory and now its gone not that long after the last of the summer crew yes then they took it dont you think its gone forget about it no i saw it after they left saw it or a fake what if moss swapped rocks its an alibi see send the real rock out bring in a fake have the fingie tentatively authenticate the phony and then get rid of it before he can really tell lewis looked at the doctor in surprise hodge seemed to have certainly considered the problem in a very short time youve heard about this before she smiled a certain grimness to her grin about the rock everyone has if i was in charge id start with you they already did i was searched last night whatd they find he kept his face straight a bag of white powder a wallet full of prophylactics and an aryan nations membership card told ya you didnt have it my hustlers they simply confiscated i would have let you keep them so who does have it nancy i need help here i come down take a look at a meteorite as a favor and it disappears so youre questioning me i need to know who i should question maybe no one maybe you should tell mickey to go fuck himself snooping around isnt going to make you very popular you know moss is the stations eighthundredpound gorilla i cant have him on my case all winter either true she conceded i feel your pain she thought a moment well any number of people need money greed is universal cameron has no real career except as polar junkie linda brown has a loser boyfriend back home who might marry her if she came with sufficient dowry gabriella reid would be a gold digger if she could find anyone with any gold the medic shrugged take your pick see you do know things thats stuff everyone knows id swipe it if i could do you need money too i already told you i was pillaged by the son of a bitch i was married to the bottom line however is it would be stupid as hell to take the meteorite at the start of winter why have to hide it for eight months hocking something from the pole wouldnt be all that easy anyway the whole thing makes no sense why not wait and steal it in the spring mickey is smart and old and cranky and i think hes somehow messing with all of us either that or or what if its one of us she thought some more i think it was taken not to sell but to send a message make a point zing mickey moss relieve the tedium create a joke screw him screw you but why she shrugged who knows she pointed to the door again but i wouldnt look for someone greedy id look for someone pissed lewis stood back under the intersection of archways again more frustrated than ever take your pick well hell this kind of interrogation was really rod camerons job but the station manager had been all too eager to palm the job off on lewis nor was cameron about to tell mickey moss to bug off harrison adams had told lewis that moss had been down too long and was worshiped too much he pushed everything too far giving the pole an importance it had never quite lived up to it was rash to promise discovery and yet moss promised incessantly and bragged on work half done creating pressures for performance that became obnoxious its true he brings in research money and charms when he wishes adams had told him ive watched him schmooze a whole planeload of government vips who fly down for an hour to get their picture taken at the pole but he can also be as vain and vindictive as hell rods afraid of him and probably you should be too nsf can yank the old scientists chain whenever they want to but they never will michael m moss is their polar god the eminent graybeard poster boy dont cross him yet someone had who had the balls to steal mickeys rock one beneficiary of the mystery was norse he was an outsider too and the theft was exactly the kind of thing that played with their heads and gave the psychologist more to write about except that a stunt like that the deliberate introduction of an artificial variable would discredit the reliability of his entire study norse had said himself that he couldnt build a rat maze besides the shrink had been surprised at the meteorites value and was almost as new as lewis with no obvious ax to grind against moss or anyone else a beaker on the other hand would recognize that any meteorite had value a beaker might be jealous of moss beakers were insanely competitive boasting about hours worked sleep forgone they could be jealous even petty yet a scientist risked his career and reputation with any theft while support personnel risked what there was no law or court or jail at the pole theirs was a job period and a hard and thankless one at that put in a year and get out there was little the scientists did that the cooks and mechanics and carpenters and safety specialists didnt know about some like buck tyson were openly contemptuous of what amounted to a twotier system the intellectuals and the grunts if you wanted to annoy the eggheads you didnt throw a wrench into the power plant because that hurt everyone you created another kind of turmoil like this and who was the station sorehead lewis crossed to the archway on the other side and went down its dim half cylinder the corridors string of caged lights punctuated by pools of gloom pipes and conduit years past their projected life extended like rusty ropes on either side wrapped in fraying frosted insulation in two places there were memorial pools of brown frozen water where sewage lines had ruptured before emergency repairs could be made sand had been thrown across the puddles until the dirty ice could be chipped out someday he went through another door to the generator room more brightly lit and noisy there were three generators here one rumbling like an urgent drum another in emergency readiness and a third being overhauled pika taylor the plant manager was bent over its black interior with ear protectors on his head down inside his machine like a rabbit entering its burrow he didnt hear the geologist lewis considered the generator mechanic sometimes it was the quiet guys who blew look for someone pissed pika seemed awfully possessive about his machines yet he also seemed as mild as the animal he was named for what did he have against mickey moss the two were probably unaware of each others existence pikas tuneless whistling hum was the sound of the bubble of preoccupation the man carried with him he lived in a machine world largely oblivious to the gossip intrigues friendships lusts jealousies and alliances that swirled around him his myopia was enviable in a way unfortunately lewis wasnt allowed to share it without interrupting pika he went on the gym beyond was the old garage dark and low with a frayed net that divided the space in two it was the site of volleybag games so named because an ordinary ball could be hit too easily up to the arched ceiling a bundle of rags was used instead only a single light was on there in line with the plea for constant energy conservation there was no fuel resupply until the end of winter and the resulting twilight was spooky empty during the work shifts except he started when he saw a shadowy woman sitting in the corner she ignored him hey there he tried no response oh yeah the woman was a mannequin hed already been introduced to the doll dubbed raggedy ann that had been brought down to practice cpr on she was a mascot in the gym the way their slug hieronymus was in the galley now she watched him from the gray twilight slumped and somehow mocking hey yourself he turned left through another corridor that led to a second archway that had been added to replace the old garage inside was the stations motor pool such as it was two aging d bulldozers whose rust had been arrested only by the arid polar air two tracked exploration vehicles called sprytes and four beatup snowmobiles including the one hed tried it was becoming too cold to use the machines routinely and the main doors had been shut against the growing dimness outside blowing snow had made a small drift through the crack where the barn doors joined the garage was more brightly lit than the gym but still had a dungeon feel chains hung from overhead tracks used to hoist engine blocks the red paint of their steel hooks flaked and faded into a semblance of dried blood metal racks built against the walls of the arch held a shadowy armory of spare and abandoned metal parts intricate and mysterious pegboard above workbenches held racks of tools heavy and sharp a steel mesh floor laid across the snow was slick with dripping oil the air stank of fuel fumes a blowing heater kept its temperature barely above freezing a thousand places to hide a rock there was a screeching rasp and shower of sparks behind one of the parked sprytes and lewis made his way in that direction he had no better plan of approach than with nancy hodge gee tyson you got the meteorite you being so disliked and all hey buck tyson glanced up from the spinning grinder with impatient annoyance and reluctantly turned bracing himself against the likelihood of another work request as he took his foot off the grinder pedal its whir died away yeah it was a grunt hows it going tyson squinted its going lewis looked at what the mechanic had in his hand flat metal shiny and sharp it was an opening i heard you made knives tyson glanced around so as a hobby you sell them back in north dakota so maybe this was the wrong time to draw him out the mechanic was on shift and obviously not working on whatever he was supposed to be working on he was probably afraid lewis would tell cameron lewis cast about for a revealing question where do you get the material what for the knives where do you get the metal the mechanic looked at him as if he were blind weve got enough scrap to build a fucking battleship every bit of useless junk you can think of except what we really need at least he was answering and he took things what do you use for handles tyson considered his visitor what was this about he had no illusions about people who came into his garage they all wanted something and screw them still he answered metal wood bone hard rubber plastic why im thinking of buying one the mechanic looked wary for christmas presents well be home by then tyson waited for more how much lewis asked what how much for a knife the mechanic considered hundred bucks for a knife handmade and engraved at the pole he deliberately huffed out a cloud of vapor a plume like cigarette smoke i put up with a lot of shit to make these would you consider fifty that baleful look again no then he reconsidered maybe seventyfive im on a budget buck so am i there was a long silence each watching the other tyson didnt act like an imminent millionaire another dead end when will they be finished long before you get home he grinned at that lewis smiled falsely you got some i could look at the persistent interest softened tyson slightly he shrugged in my locker in my room maybe i could show you later my dad might want one too i dont care who wants them he likes crafted stuff show me some cash then well get serious tyson turned back to the grinder lewis glanced around again spotting nothing of interest the mechanic might be a grouch but there was none of the evasion expected of a thief lewis turned to go thinking he might try abby next and worrying shed be more annoyed than helpful he was no investigator this entire fiasco was a waste of time tyson rod cameron was stalking into the garage toward both of them looking sleepless and angry jesus fuck the mechanic turned stiffening the mechanics grip on the blade tightened and lewis could see the knuckles whitening he looked at lewis accusingly as if hed led the station manager here and lewis shook his head in denial what the hell was this about cameron strode up and stopped rocking slightly on his ankles his mood stormy what the hell are you doing here he asked lewis talking with buck while my computer defrags he raised his eyebrows trying to prod camerons memory the investigation oh he looked at lewis curiously and lewis shrugged again nothing well go poke around somewhere else lewis i need to have it out with tyson the managers eyes darted back to the mechanic he was gathering himself for a fight sure lewis took a step back you dont have to leave fingie tyson said quietly no secrets here lewis hesitated he was curious cameron glanced at him waiting for him to go but lewis thought tyson might let something useful slip maybe i can help cameron blinked it might help to have a witness okay no secrets he turned to tyson whatre you doing buck tyson looked sourly at his boss stuff you get this spryte fixed the machines a piece of shit we need it anyway its fucking dangerous if it breaks down its fucking all weve got and i thought you were a good mechanic tyson looked from cameron to lewis wondering how belligerent he could afford to be and spat deliberately the spittle hitting the floor im working on it cameron looked at the big mans fist whats that then tyson looked at the metal in his hand with apparent surprise and then held it up the sharpness glinting in the light piston rod he said deadpan cameron looked at the hoisted knife and then back at tyson i looked at the water budget this morning do you know the daily ration is off fifty gallons why no boss i dont its because of your damn showers isnt it beats me i do ive been timing you then youve got more time than i do youre using as much water as six other people so melt some more you know the rodriguez well is slow two months ago you were complaining i was too dirty thats because you stank every time you came to meals youd clear an entire table like some goddamn wino are you insane or what dont you wish youd sent me home tyson smiled you know i couldnt find a replacement you goddamn butthead tyson pointed at lewis sparco did you could too theres still time to get a plane in here maybe for an emergency i feel appendicitis coming on im warning you buck because i wish youd send me home the mechanic tossed the knife aside onto the metal workbench where it rang like a bell he raised his big hands you want to compare hands rod dont you threaten me you want to compare those soft white thinfingered paws of yours which hardly ever get out of your warm fucking office with mine which get so hard i gotta soak em in vaseline and wear gloves to bed you want to spend a day under this spryte or the cats where the metals either so hot from the stinking engine spewing carbon monoxide that i burn my hands or so cold that i burn em again you want to work on shit so brittle that it shatters like glass and string extension cords so stiff they snap like a twig he glowered as he spoke like a looming thunderhead dont talk to me about your fucking precious water its the only damn thing keeping me sane his volume had grown to a roar cameron instinctively stepped backward the big man was at the barest edge of control the station manager was sputtering ive about had it with you no you havent you ineffectual snot the mechanic seemed to expand with frustrated rage like an inflating balloon he filled the garage dark and hairy and lewis felt nervous too tyson was losing it you havent had it with me for another eight fuckedup gloriously boring months you cant get away from me and i cant get away from you and so you can take your lunatic work calendar and cram it like a suppository up your soft supervisory ass the mechanic waited defiantly for a response quivering with rage and yet there was none cameron momentarily speechless at this outright defiance the station manager had gone rigid then tyson turned arrogantly back to the workbench picking up the knife thats outright insubordination cameron finally managed you need me ill be in the shower cameron looked at the mechanics back with a mixture of disbelief and hatred this time youve gone too far he choked trembling with outrage so fire me im writing you up in my email report tyson laughed cameron looked bitterly at lewis who was embarrassed at this exchange the manager knew he couldnt let this one go couldnt risk losing control couldnt bear the humiliation this time buck tyson youre toast we decide as a group kids come out of their childhood thinking theyll be taken care of kids show up in college with this sorryass misapprehension of helplessness glued between their ears like slowsetting concrete as hapless as clams as dim as donkeys fix me be fair fat boy had been carried his whole life im sure of it instead of being forced to get fit to survive hed always found a place on the team always convinced the others to wait up always whined his way into some kind of secondclass acceptance fat boy always got bailed out and now he needed to be bailed out by me who knows why the hell he unroped himself to rest to pee to make the rest of us wait what does it matter hed insisted on joining the group and was now slowing the group hed joined defining our chain by its weakest link the end of his rope lay trailing on the snow like a foolish scribble somewhere hed unleashed himself and was gone i looked at the summit pink and swollen in the dawn light i looked at the clouds to the west which were beginning to mound into a grayish wall if he cost us too many minutes hed cost all of us the climb unacceptable i wanted to take my team and kresslers team up to the top let fleming find him hed lost him why ruin it for everyone why ruin it for me but kressler sided with his friend and they insisted the entire class stay together so down the tracks we went the other kids grumbling and cursing looking for the point where our chubby little moron had decided to wander off by himself and myself so potentially eruptive that i knew better than to say anything i half hoped fat boy had already found a crevasse and was gone for the next ten thousand years frozen like the dense brick he was until a glacier spat him out then maybe we could still make the top i should be so lucky it turned out that the idiot fleming had lost him a full quarter mile back never having turned to check on the end of his string the weaklunged halfwit couldnt say that either of course but fleming was a lousy climber truth be told pisspoor instructor he was too nice always a mistake made me uneasy theres a difference between selfcontrol and weakness so back we went a quartermile backtrack and sure enough footprints led off the main trail wed beaten and away in a meandering wander down one side of the saddle what was fat boy thinking we hadnt followed his trail for fifty yards when there was a break in the snow like a bite in a sandwich the kid had obviously triggered a slide and been carried over the edge with it i cant say i felt much pity i frankly looked at the evidence with a certain feeling of satisfaction life was just finis can we go to the top now but i bit my tongue great surprise and consternation of course wails tears and so much phony emotion i thought the sheer weight of the pathos would trigger another avalanche as if anybody really liked the dumb kid but of course we had to do the right thing and the right thing was to clamber up and around risking us all and getting so close to the edge of wallace wall that we all might soon join fat boy in paradise i kept looking for a place to plant my ice ax once the class started the slide over except we didnt and then wonder of wonders we heard a frightened scream fat boy wasnt done with us as the one instructor who really knew what he was doing i had the other two belay me and edged downslope for a look over the cliff where fat boy had fallen leaning so far that the rope was taut as piano wire at first i couldnt see a damn thing in the dim predawn light but then i made out movement on a ledge about three hundred feet below the kid had slid down a chute bounced off into space and then by a miracle had somehow fetched up about three thousand feet shy of the real bottom he saw my silhouette and started screaming to beat hell the smart thing to do would have been to leave him right then and go get help except that the storm was coming kressler and then fleming had to take their turns edging down to see minutes ticking by our window closing it was a mess all right a right royal snafu the triumvirate met my advice was to get the rest of the kids off the mountain better to lose one than fifteen lower a bag down to fat boy and come back with a chopper and a medic unit when the weather allowed lets not be heroes now kressler didnt like it and i knew why it was his class really we were assisting a rescue would get in the newspapers and questions would be asked about why our dumb blubber buffalo had been allowed to wander off into an avalanche chute wouldnt look good for our fearless leader to have allowed such an elementary mistake kressler was up for department chair and the competition was vicious as it always is in the ivied halls of academia where so many fight so relentlessly for so little his rivals would use this embarrassment against him silly but there it is careers have turned on less hed really rather just bundle the kid down the mountain himself if it was all the same to us come back a hero smelling roses it was the political thing to do no way jose but then fleming willing to brownnose an upandcoming department chair with the best of them in order to grease his own skids toward tenure sided with the ambitious idiot the pair was convinced they could pull off this bit of derringdo kressler was actually pretty good technically but fleming was in over his head and didnt have the judgment of a flea he trusted always a mistake and he trusted kressler to be able to somehow snatch fat boy off that wall and save us all from an awkward morningafter of questions stupid stupid stupid except those clouds were coming that was their trump card id actually heard a little about the approaching storm id volunteered to monitor the radio but decided not to share it with the doomsayers the evening before because it might have cramped our try for the summit in hindsight maybe that wasnt the smartest thing in the world to do but i thought we had time and i wanted the top dammit that was the whole point we could have beaten the storm if not for the unroping of fat boy now the other two used the weather to justify our immediate rescue of the idiot left alone the bozo might actually die and then what was now mere bad luck becomes major fuckup turns kressler from rising star to object of inquiry so heres the plan we climb down to fat boy all of us and then continue down an easy route that kressler knew on wallace wall we all get down off the mountain pronto disaster turns into rescue fat boy becomes a trophy save jesus the voice of reason being me gently pointed out that the pack of amateurs we were leading didnt have the skills to do this kind of matterhorn macho shit i told kressler that he could go down there while fleming and i took everyone else back down the glacier but kressler said he needed fleming and fleming said fat boy was so heavy they really needed two more young studs to help and no one wanted to break up the party and so in the spirit of eternal togetherness the decision was made over my quiet objections to take fourteen kids down the hard way in hopes of saving one and avoiding any awkward questions im sure theyd tell you it made sense at the time the kids were frightened we need your help on this one the other two instructors told me i caved with more camaraderie than sense i put on a happy face announced we were all making a brief detour and agreed to take kresslers dubious route picking up our overweight blubber baggage along the way wed look so smart when we reached the bottom ah togetherness a couple of the girls were weeping a couple of the guys looked whiter than the snow the sun was just cracking the eastern range we started down chapter nine i think i need some help lewis had found abby in the greenhouse it was little more than a closet with burbling hydroponic tanks potted soil and the smell of tomato vines but it was brightly lit by grow lights and a refuge of steamy warmth lettuce tomato parsley kale and other greens struggled to maturity there adding meager scraps of fresh chlorophyll to meals dominated by canned and frozen foods while the greenhouse was more hobby than experiment nasa scientists had visited twice to take notes on the facility as a model for future spaceships abby came regularly to help lena jindrova tend the plants and get an injection of artificial sunlight im kind of busy jed she told him she was snipping dead leaves as hed feared his investigation was turning people cool no one wanted a snoop lewis suspected nancy hodge had put the others on notice about his investigative efforts was their doctor the thief trying to sabotage any inquiry or the enforcer of group propriety last night when hed sat in the galley the conversation had muted and this morning abby im in a fix here and i dont know what to do she didnt look at him why come to me because youve been here longer than i have she took another snip so has everyone okay because were friends a friend you said blabbed about the meteorite that may have started this whole mess thats what i heard jesus ice cream had turned hard again we were just discussing who knew about it you pumped me she didnt reply and i didnt come here to ask you about the meteorite im disappointed i didnt make your list he stopped exasperated hed crossed some unseen line at the station some unseen line with her at his silence she finally stopped trimming and turned to look at him allowing some reluctant sympathy maybe that wasnt fair she allowed but i dont know about the meteorite jed i came to ask you about something else i dont have any suspects no something else she let the shears drop by her side what then someone slipped this under my door this morning he took a piece of thick paper from a pocket and handed it to her abby unfolded a fivepointed star cut from yellow construction paper on it were printed the words deputy dawg she frowned i dont even know what its supposed to mean lewis said she crumpled up the star and threw it in a recycling basket the sorting of trash was a basic ground rule at the pole it means to back off back off what she looked at him impatiently are you dense youre the fingie jed no one knows you yet no one trusts you yet but youre going around asking questions about mickeys rock like a cop and implying that the rest of us are a bunch of crooks worse youre doing mosss dirty work for him nobody likes him either not really its the worst kind of way to try to fit in here and somebodys trying to tell you politely to cut it out before youre toast for the rest of the winter why do you even care who took the meteorite nobody else does because he thinks i might have taken it she looked at him with impatience and what do you care what he thinks hes not the person you have to eat with we are hes sparcos friend and sparco hired me and im just trying to do the right thing well this is a great community of goodhearted people and youre doing exactly the wrong thing if you want to fit in mickey can be a bully and cameron always feels pressured but those guys arent the group we are and were not a bunch of thieves im just trying to feel my way so do your job keep your mouth shut and watch learn listen theres a society here and your winter will be miserable if you dont fit into it tyson doesnt fit into it and is he happy lewis didnt have to answer in fact tyson is an example of the risk you run i ran into rod and hes so hot hes got steam coming out of his ears i think he and buck had some kind of runin they did i saw it she looked at him in surprise she was instantly interested unable to mask her curiosity when i was in the garage when he told rod to essentially go screw himself that mechanic is unbelievable hes nuts hes got so much anger its scary its not the pole theres something wrong with him some basic resentment of other people or frustration with his own life they should never have let him come down here she nodded i think rod went to doctor bob for advice tonight hes called a meeting and thats why its not a good time to play columbo jed theres too much tension on station and the winters starting poorly things are coming to a head about the meteorite about water amundsenscott station sat on a freshwater ocean but it was frozen into ice that stayed a permanent sixty degrees below zero imported jet fuel ran a heater that melted a bulb of liquid water in the ice cap called a rodriguez well but raising the temperature of the ice to the melting point was enormously costly it took a gallon and a half of jet fuel just to fly in a gallon more for use at the pole liquid water here costs more than gasoline at home cameron told the assembly in the galley that night every drop we consume represents energy we cant use for heating or lights or to run our instruments if we were on a nuclear submarine we could shower all day but were not and were using water faster than its budgeted how much faster carl mendoza asked about fifty gallons a day some of the others turned to look at tyson who was slouched in the shadows along a back wall he looked determinedly bored are you listening buck cameron called to him for a long minute the big man didnt answer then what hard to hear you rod might need to wash my ears out tonight there was an uneasy silence in the room tyson looked huge surly mean everyone was waiting to see what cameron would do what cameron could do the station manager waited letting the silence and uneasiness build finally he went on the reason were using so much water is of course a mystery there was a murmur of surprise but doctor bob was watching cameron expectantly nodding slightly the one thing we do know is that if were going to make it through the winter with a sufficient fuel reserve we have to curb our excessive consumption one person has to astronomer harrison adams muttered so cameron continued blandly ignoring adams im being forced to announce a new rationing policy effective immediately showers are being cut from two to one a week what geller shouted the crowd erupted several turned to glare at tyson he had straightened in initial surprise but now was grinning sardonically enjoying their outrage seeming to feed off it thats not fair dana andrews protested rod you cant do that to the maintenance crew station carpenter steve calhoun objected we get dirty man we stink once a week is too long in between and im not going to lose my privileges to accommodate that blowhard baboon mickey moss thundered pointing at tyson hes a bully sticks and stones man the mechanic mocked him im going to break you moss shouted at tyson not just here but after when we get home your performance is going to dog you the rest of your life fuck you mickey mouse moss was seething fighting for selfcontrol the rest of your life tyson cameron held up his hand this rationing is temporary until water consumption appears to be coming back into line with projections im leaving it up to the rest of you to figure out how to make sure that comes about there was quiet again everyone looking speculatively at tyson he looked back at them defiantly saying nothing this is your fault lena jindrova finally hissed standing up to look at the big man who topped her by a good foot you are the pig who is making the rest of us suffer fuck you too lena you are the pig like the old party bosses in czechoslovakia pulling everything to themselves caring for no one this whole waterrationing crap is bullshit weve got plenty of fuel more than we can use youre wrong buck cameron said quietly you are like a worm that cares only for itself lena went on heatedly she pointed to the galley serving counter where a glass mason jar held a leaf of lettuce and the curled form of hieronymus our mascot has more heart than you more soul tyson scowled the resentment in the room toward him so palpable it made the air they breathed like syrup you could smell the sweat the electric tension in a moment cameron had turned everyone against him that slug the mechanic growled ominously more brains more work more everything little hiero the mechanic pushed himself away from the wall and made his way around the folding chairs where the others sat his work boots ringing on the floor as he walked he was supposed to have taken them off as well before entering the galley and they left a trail of snow and grease the others watched him warily resentfully none quite daring to interfere with whatever he chose to do next he walked up to the counter and picked up the mason jar with the gastropod this slime sucker here dont you touch him lena warned tyson held the jar up to the light oh yeah i see what you mean hes cuter than any bitch in this room buck put it down cameron commanded he now looked worried tysons open defiance hadnt been planned cool it tyson pulaski stood up too muscles tensing im cool cueball then the mechanic made a sudden violent swing of his arm and brought the jar down on the galley counter with a crack the glass shattered and lena screamed the slug slid a short distance on the stainless steel braked by its own slime tyson flicked a couple of pieces of glass off the animal and gingerly picked it up between two fingers holding it up in front of the crowd is this what you prefer to me lena you put him down she cried norse had become rigid his gaze flicking around the room taking it all in do you think i give a flying fuck what any of you think of me tyson asked them turning in a slow half rotation to give everyone a clear view of the slug do you think i give a diddly damn about any of you were all down here for bucks and glory and to punch the time card home man i dont give a shit about the science i dont give a shit about the station and i sure as hell dont give a shit if the rest of you dont get a single shower for the rest of the fucking winter heres the bottom line i dont need you i dont want you i sure as hell dont like you i aint afraid of you he held the slug closer to his face scrutinizing it and this is what i think of this little guy here he opened his mouth buck if you do that youre bloody dead on station dana andrews cried suck my dick dana he crammed the animal in no lena shouted jesus christ pulaski said in disgust the crowd groaned tyson chewed twice his look wildly defiant and then swallowed the gulp audible there were flecks of slime on his beard he deliberately belched why in the name of god did you do that cameron breathed his look one of horror he took a shaking step toward tyson and norse put a hand on the station managers arm heres another rule for you asskissers tyson said wiping his mouth no pets in antarctica lena was looking at him in hatred pika regarded the mechanic in disbelief this your idea bob tyson asked the psychologist turn everyone against me well surprise surprise they already were so fuck you too norse composing his expression into something opaque didnt answer im crazier than you thought arent i tyson persisted youre setting yourself alone buck the psychologist warned quietly youre right on that one he waited for another challenge his look amused but none came okay we done here gotta hit the showers man the quiet was as thick and cold as the ice cap he left lewis could hear the bubble of the juice dispenser in one corner one shower cameron finally said shakily the others looked frustrated furious sick that night someone nailed a piece of burnt toast to buck tysons door it was two nights later that jed lewis was roused from his bed once more again in the early hours of the morning cameron burst into his room and flicked on the light what what get up were organizing a search now sooner than now get your ass in gear the station manager looked sick whats going on is it the meteorite screw the meteorite now somethings really wrong what i cant believe this is happening to me what dammit now mickey moss is missing chapter ten this is what its like to be dead lewis thought the searchers had stopped on the polar plateau three miles from the dome clambering gratefully down from the spryte to take a break from the snow tractors ungainly lurch and guttural growl it was a tiring vehicle to ride in noisy and slow with treads like a tank and a cramped wedgeshaped orange cab but it could also straddle small crevices snort its way up fortydegree slopes and clamber over pack ice if mickey moss was lost on the plateau the tractor should spot him he wasnt there was nothing to see distant radio towers appearing as fine as spider silk marked scottamundsen base its dome a bump on the horizon in all other directions the whiteness was as empty as heaven and as frozen as hell it was amazing how far they seemed from the station the effect was strangely dreamlike lewis feeling as detached as an astronaut cut from a lifeline he didnt like being out here unprotected and cold mosss body could have been covered by drifting snow of course but why would the astronomer walk out here there was nothing to walk to no hillock no wrinkle no vale no stop theyd gone first to the tiny solar observatory buried in the snow a mile from the dome its ramp the place where lewis had seen mickeys snowmobile disappear that lonely midnight it consisted of another metal box sunken in snow its interior housing a small solar telescope boxed for the winter no mickey no meteorite no tracks beyond that all destination disappeared once you left the polar station there was only the wind this is stupid tyson said the mechanic was their driver pressed into reluctant service after the three hours that it took him to get their one operable spryte in running condition and warmed up if moss was out here he was already dead tyson had reasoned and if he was dead theyd probably never find him the blowing snow would bury him so what was the point do it anyway cameron had said quietly no one else had said a word tyson had hesitated and then finally shrugged and obeyed a disappearance was serious pulaski had been picked to accompany tyson because of his military background lewis was drafted because of his unwanted association with the whole mess norse had come along on the theory he might guess where moss had gone and could help manage the volatile tyson cameron wouldnt get on the same machine with the ostracized mechanic and so he was leading the others in a systematic search of the buildings if moss wasnt there he had to be out here by crackling radio they were confirming he was neither didnt he go off by himself all the time anyway lewis asked just over to the dark side with his junk food pulaski said you could phone him never went off like this before snow skittered up to their knees blowing so fast that any tracks were erased within minutes of being made so whatd they teach you about this in the army tyson asked pulaski it was an honest question not a mocking one and a tentative effort toward reopening some kind of communication with the group hed scorned tyson had seen the piece of toast on his door and was quietly reconsidering his defiance he was tired of the pole but it was spooky how nobody was talking to him maybe hed gone too far besides the mechanic respected the cooks mysterious military past pulaski let a silence hang for a moment just to let buck know where he stood and then answered have clear objectives inform your superiors maintain communication prepare for the unexpected the cook squinted into the wind doesnt look like mickey did any of that to me anybody ever vanish like this before lewis asked the programs been pretty safe considering i mean theres been a lot of american deaths in antarctica more than fifty since world war ii if you count all the ship and plane injuries but mostly industrial accidents weve never lost a beaker at the pole and a guy as experienced as mickey its weird man they shuddered in the wind the uncomfortable orange cab was beginning to look good again so do we just keep driving around in circles tyson demanded im about to go snowblind im betting hes not out here the cook agreed unless he was suicidal or something and this is a tough way to go its like swimming out to sea all of a sudden the station looks very far away and you turn back any sane man would do that was mickey sane lewis asked suddenly it seemed like a fair question given the mans long association at amundsenscott this place was his life and why would big rodent be suicidal tyson added he looked pointedly at lewis the way i heard it he was about to come into big money maybe that was the problem norse said quietly the others didnt reply everyone on station was contemplating the coincidence of moss vanishing shortly after the meteorite disappeared everyone lewis was sure was thinking about how his own arrival had brought bad luck maybe mickey has fled or left or escaped the station on purpose going somewhere else norse suggested pulaski barked a laugh where he gestured at the blank plateau theres no place to go to doc yeah tyson muttered except vostok where norse turned to the mechanic the closest russian base tyson explained its across the plateau which means its basically flat no glaciers no crevasses nobody in their right mind would want to go there but its the one place you might actually drive to people have joked about it the psychologist was interested you think moss could have gone there no its seven hundred dickshriveling miles youd need a vehicle extra fuel and im the guy in charge of the motor pool mickey didnt check anything out is it hard to drive a spryte tyson looked at the psychologist dubiously it aint hard on your brain its hard on your butt but im telling you we aint missing a spryte but someone could do it tyson contemplated the spryte with that piece of shit maybe youd have to want to get there very very bad to risk it but it could be done if you were lucky but moss didnt do it pulaski clarified the mechanic nodded no way dollars to donuts hes within five miles of where were standing and frozen stiffer than the poker thats up rod camerons ass the station manager called another meeting in the galley that night lewis came last and sat in the back depressed by the mood of bad feeling abby glanced his way and then turned her head looking troubled hed said hello to her earlier hoping shed warmed but shed flitted by him in distraction not wanting to talk its not you its mickey she had muttered something about mosss disappearance had hit her hard norse sat to one side of the room near the serving counter again scanning the crowd they needed a shrink now didnt they yet the psychologist looked somber no doubt remembering tysons blowup at the last meeting lewis bet that slug eating hadnt been in his script now lewis watched norse catch abbys eye once and give her a look of reassurance as if to say i understand had their psychologist become her confessor lewis found the idea irked him his own mood was gloomy hed come to the pole for a fresh start and instead his counseling on the meteorite had dragged him into the middle of a serious crisis you cant quit down here cameron had told him well hell the station manager got up from his chair and stiffly faced the group his movement left two chairs empty lewis noticed pulaski without thinking had set out twentysix and mosss was conspicuously vacant everyone eyed the extra seat uneasily it was an accusation a plea a warning cameron looked haggard he hadnt slept in thirtysix hours and the emailed heat he was getting from washington dc was enough to set his terminal on fire first hed had to tattle on tysons waterrationing violation instead of simply fixing the problem himself now the possible death of michael m moss would be shocking the polar establishment moss was mr south pole worse the people on station were family and now hed somehow lost one of them cameron had apparently failed in the most fundamental way at keeping them all alive he was in no mood to forgive himself at the sight of his drawn face the groups anxious chatter died away im not very religious the station manager began his voice hoarse he stopped looking confused pulaski got up and poured cameron a glass of water handing it to him with the gravity of communion the station manager drank and the simple act seemed to steady him he tried again im not very religious but id like to start this meeting with a prayer not mine but our own prayers each of us individually from our own hearts i dont know where mickey is but lets acknowledge the central truth that whatever our relationship to him he was is the soul of this station so id like a minute of silence to pray for his soul which i hope is alive and which i fear is somehow inexplicably dead at least none of us have seen hide nor hair of him for more than twentyfour hours weve looked and looked and are going to keep on looking but right now i think we need the help of a higher power so for just a minute please send our sonofabitch old antarctic explorer your best thoughts he bowed his head lewis did too trying to think what moss might have been thinking or where he might have gone it made no sense nancy hodge was looking with sad sympathy at cameron she knew a tragedy like this would threaten to erase whatever professional advancement the station manager had hoped to gain by coming down here norse was calmly letting his eyes scan the group as if someone would betray themselves and buck tyson looked uncertain as if the possibility of mosss death were making him reconsider his intransigence selfsufficiency was one thing exclusion another tonight everyone had shifted their chairs away from his well heads came up and cameron continued ive let nsf know our situation and that were doing everything we can they send us their best and urge us to keep searching im going to launch another perimeter search around the station tomorrow and go through the buildings again i dont i dont know what else to do he hesitated looking gloomy maybe he had a heart attack he was strong as an ox pulaski said there was quiet strong people die too nancy finally amended in any event the station manager went on were getting our winter off to a stressful start and its at times like these that the group has to hang together together he looked at tyson worriedly its hard to lose anybody but especially mickey damned if i know what happened could have been illness could have been an accident could have gotten lost you probably have your own ideas i pray to god hell just show up but we all know how cold it is outside several faces turned to check the television monitor the temperature was sixtyone degrees below zero a rising wind had pushed the chill factor to minus ninetytwo why dont you tell us what this is really about rod a voice demanded it was harrison adams the astronomer as a scientist i dont believe in coincidences what does that mean the rumor is that mickey found a meteorite in the ice someone apparently took it he demands an investigation then he disappears i mean come on what are you saying harrison that five million dollars makes this more than a simple missing person there was a murmur through the crowd as speculation suddenly became baldly stated fact five million what pika asked in confusion take your ear protectors off once in a while doofus geller chided now hold on cameron cautioned we dont know that do the arithmetic adams said thats what it comes out to if this meteorite is really a chunk of mars or the moon and our fingie isnt blowing smoke right so thats my question what do we know not that mickey had a heart attack only that were missing a stone that some people irresponsibly i might add have wildly speculated might be worth a lot of money next thing we know boom mickeys gone jed lewis just gave a professional opinion adams swung to look at the fingie its an amateur unscientific seatofthepants opinion and this problem started when jed lewis stepped off the plane thats not fair doctor adams it was norse our meteorologist was asked to give a geologic judgment based on his professional background by doctor moss himself thats right cameron said theres no evidence that anythings connected and no evidence it isnt adams said jed said he was searched nancy hodge spoke up what did you find nothing cameron replied several of us were searched norse chimed in including mickey nothing was found abby lewis noticed had turned her face to the floor something was wrong had something been found i want to emphasize here how little we know the psychologist went on we dont know if the meteorite really had value we dont know if it was lost or stolen we dont know what happened to mickey any conclusions at this point are premature cameron looked at the psychologist with gratitude maybe norse had his uses an excited buzzing broke out among the group so now what gabriella finally shouted cameron took a breath now we decide what to do together in trust the only problem being that one of us may be a thief or worse it was pulaski exactly said norse and heads turned back to him so a more realistic option is to work together in temporary distrust to scrutinize each other carefully in order to get all bad blood out of the way how do we do that geller asked our real problem is lack of information the psychologist said were afraid because we dont know accordingly i have a proposal to make its unusual but this is an unusual situation it has to be a group decision not imposed from above i was skeptical when mickey himself first proposed it but it might be the quickest way to reinforce our belief in each other he paused his eyes polling the group seeking permission to broach an idea physically and in personality he was a more commanding presence than cameron his shower idea hadnt broken tyson but the mechanics defiance was cracking norse seemed to have a better idea what to do go ahead doc geller prompted i propose a broader search norse went on not of the station where weve been looking for doctor moss but of our rooms to look for the meteorite i suspect well find nothing but any discovery that would clarify this situation would help finding nothing in contrast might reassure each of us about each other our rooms are the only bloody privacy we have objected dana andrews i sympathize norse said i propose to limit the searchers to two people myself and doctor hodge ill check the rooms of male personnel she the female as weve said ive already been searched im not asking anyone to undergo anything i havent already experienced well do it now while the rest of you wait if anything is locked we ask for your keys what we discover remains entirely confidential unless it has some bearing on the disappearance of doctor moss or the meteorite he glanced at cameron agreed no tyson yelled i dont want some selfappointed shrink searching me thats because youve got more phallic objects in that armory of yours than a nymphomaniac in a nunnery bathing boy geller scoffed the others laughed fuck you tyson glowered his belligerence immediately returning in response to mockery he was always ready for a fight nobodys afraid of a man who showers more than a teenage girl buck yeah try me sometime my creditor friends tell me even the biggest goon can slip in the shower and not get up if he stays in too long the group stirred uneasily at this threat enough enough cameron said the station manager was trying to look stern but was fighting the start of a smile at this needling tyson was getting the mechanic looked uncomfortable and scowled avoiding anyones gaze it wasnt easy being toast is this going to work alexi molotov interjected you would have to be stupid to steal a meteorite and hide it in your room no who said people were smart norse replied you would be even more stupid to find the meteorite and not keep it for yourself said hiro perhaps we should check the pockets of our two doctors at the end the others laughed nervously perhaps they hunt for themselves you agree to a strip search doc pulaski asked lightly only if you can hide a meteorite in there norse replied laughter again the tension breaking slightly look everyone can come along but the idea is not to embarrass anyone nancy and i are used to handling things in confidence were trying to eliminate suspicion not create it trust us this once so you can trust each other with glances the group polled itself in uneasy silence tyson looked angry but said nothing lewis had no sympathy for anybody ive already been probed he thought now its your turn adams spoke up i agree to this search the astronomer said i have nothing to hide but i think we also need to start using our heads as well as our feet maybe mickey left other clues electronic ones if i could get his passwords i could examine his hard drive carl mendoza wryly smiled as if there were something more behind this idea than adams was admitting geller smirked cameron looked questioningly at abby their computer technician i have them she said in a quiet voice its privacy again i guess id draw the line at our hard drives norse said uneasily thats like reading our thoughts we do need some privacy im not talking about our files im talking about mickeys adams said i worked with the guy maybe he left a note this is an emergency dammit its for his own good mendoza added guilelessly geller rolled his eyes if mickeys dead so is his issue of privacy adams went on the psychologist opened his mouth to disagree again and then closed it considering all the ramifications its a group decision cameron looked at the group well no one objected lets do it then the station manager said quietly norse and nancy hodge left the galley to go through the berthing areas abby and adams departed to open up mosss hard drive the mood of the remainder was somber cameron tried to lead a desultory discussion about outdoor safety but no one responded nobody wanted to talk about rules the clock seemed to have stopped what if we never even find mickey dana abruptly wondered aloud well find him pulaski said ten to one he had a stroke over this meteorite and got covered up by snow another good wind and his parka will pop back out im not even willing to say hes dead yet cameron said but if he is its a lesson to us all sign out take a radio thats the third time youve said that geller groaned we learned that stuff way back in denver and mickey knew it too look can we continue this discussion upstairs i need to clear my sinuses upstairs was the bar yeah steve calhoun the station carpenter chimed in there are times when life needs to be dealt with through an alcoholic stupor getting drunk isnt very professional at a time like this the station manager objected he was worried how this would all look in the reports look back home but its damned rational dana rejoined nsf wants us to keep our wits about us your yank bureaucrats are ten bloody thousand miles away for gods sake rod were going to bloody choke each other if we cant lighten up the station manager looked at them gloomily tyson had already put everyone on edge and now this he was clearly outnumbered one drink each then thats all right dad they pushed past cameron and surged upstairs crowding the small room like frat boys in a phone booth all but tyson who remained downstairs determinedly alone cameron hesitated not wanting to wait in the same room with the mechanic im going to check on harrison he called we wont miss you dana sang back music came on a few of the winterovers began tapping to its beat relieving some of the tension it was creepy being searched creepy having their station manager be so morose creepy having moss disappear lewis got a beer the elbowtoelbow jostling made him feel less isolated and he began to cheer up a little the music was cranked higher he wished he could talk to abby but she was off with adams he was curious about her now there was something she wasnt telling molotov came over instead his water glass half full of vodka now lewis he said clasping the american on the shoulder from you i need to know how to sell this rock in america where all the money is just in case i ever find it yes too late buddy secrets out if we ever find it im afraid its going to stay with uncle sam well then lets spend the winter looking for another one the russian grinned showing a steel flash of old soviet dentistry the jewel of mars no everyone was joking about what norse and nancy would find in their rooms lingerie sex toys marijuana grow lights offshore bank accounts jimmy hoffa its like going nekkid said calhoun except the docs are the only ones to see us in our birthday suits his companion woodworker hank anderson said and praise god for that i see the crack of your ass too much already every time you bend over to drive a nail didnt know you were lookin henry with nothing else to do while they waited some people began dancing awkward in the press of bodies lewis still feeling isolated by his own clumsy investigation maneuvered himself against a wall he thought the bar was a good idea to break the tension but he wasnt really in a mood to talk he felt like bad luck himself he watched gabriella reid slither through the press of people teasing taunting a serial flirt inviting attention eventually she came up to him grinning at his wallflower stance a beer in one of her hands youre all alone people are learning to avoid me its unfair that people blame you i guess its because im new i like new people she rolled a longneck on her lips eyes dancing antarctic ten i judge ive heard what that is he was wary she smiled mischievously behind the bottle okay eleven maybe how about me he smiled distractedly glancing beyond her abby still hadnt come back dont bother with ice cream shes frigid lewis focused on the woman in front of him frigid or careful she holds things in not me gabriella swayed in time to the music and handed him her beer turning a circle she pulled her waffleweave longunderwear top over her head a silk undershirt beneath showed the line of a low bra and the bump of nipples getting hot in here hot enough for the three hundred degree club what is that anyway she smiled mysteriously the place where you learn where you really are the music cranked still higher and it became difficult to hear the beat pounding against the walls no one was obeying camerons admonition of one drink the winterovers were sweating the air was rich and dark and heavy the mood was tribal lewis allowed himself to dance once with gabriella and then when abby didnt return did it again she smiled at him the invitation was obvious what are you doing down here he stalled raising his voice above the music i like to be at the center of things the pole everything comes together here all the lines all the numbers its a place of power i worship natural powers you know nature instinct emotion what about science thats for beakers what about feelings beakers have them no they dont they have to be drawn out she made him nervous ill bet youre good at that i can show you the way christ it was tempting excuse me ive got to check on something dont check too long he moved away maneuvering toward the bar he ducked behind as if looking for something and geller sidled over looks like you still have a friend she makes me nervous shell make more than that buddy until you lay off the meteorite and we figure out whats up with mickey she might be about the only friend you have lewis looked at the maintenance man sourly this place was too damn small why does everyone assume im to blame i dont geller sipped a scotch theres so many people sick of moss that i wont be surprised if we never find him who wants to i dont believe that you can bet adams is going to use those passwords later to snare some of mickeys data clues my ass hes robbing the dead and you noticed carl mendoza he looks like he won the lottery with moss not undercutting him he might actually keep his grants thats cynical you lose money to the wrong people and you get cynical moss said he made everyone elses research possible as long as they sucked up moss was also a classa prick what do you think happened to him that he saved his reputation by dying it was after midnight then one two oclock everyone danced with everyone stocky dana andrews shook like a maori and lena jindrova turned an erect circle with a drink perched bizarrely on her head gabriella moved sinuously among the other men her body a kind of social lubricant erasing inhibition even linda brown pulaskis plain and overweight assistant in the kitchen lost her stiffness and began to gyrate the steaminess brought a kind of communion that relieved the anxiety over mickey for a blessed respite the chill disappeared by the time norses head appeared at the foot of the stairs then they were drunk he bounded upward and nancy was right behind him her eyes wide and dark following with a hand on his belt a ragged chorus of hoots and bronx cheers erupted at their reappearance the underpants police the crowd parted slightly to embrace them and pull them in like an amoeba swallowing prey who is it a drunken pulaski shouted which of us is the thief norse grinned reassuringly we found not a hint of scandal youre all the most boring people in the world now the crowd booed clamoring for salacious detail who had the most secrets to hide our lips are sealed nancy said ply them with alcohol pulaski cried a bottle of champagne erupted fountaining over the two newcomers norse and nancy ducked but not quickly enough white foam spewed over them adding to the heady salt and sweetness of the rooms cloying air it ran down their clothes making them sticky norse staggered in the press of bodies and gasped suddenly grabbing the neck of a bottle and taking a swig he passed it to nancy and grinned with relief at this enclosure by the crowd his eyes swept them triumphantly and for just a moment lewis thought he saw a wistful shadow in the psychologists survey of the others the same longing to belong that lewis himself felt then commanding selfassurance replaced it like a mask norse was the king of selfcontrol lewis could learn from him what now geller shouted weve still got a mystery norse said handing back a few keys they had been lent for personal lockers he drank again we tried to put things back but carl i accidentally broke one of your candles just clumsiness i apologize you didnt puncture my sex doll i hope no but i had to inflate her to make sure she worked do we trust dana asked norse grinned personal choice does that mean were innocent it means you can choose to believe in each other and how long do we keep partying doc geller asked until ive drunk enough myself or until harrison as if on cue though the music abruptly cut everyone groaned the lights came up and they were blinking the communal mood shattered it was cameron whod come up quietly and slipped behind the bar time to pack it in the station manager said gruffly the group protested rod shut up weve got something that silenced them more footsteps and abby and harrison adams trooped up the stairs they looked graver than norse and nancy and as they pushed into the hot room the crowd split apart from them squeezing against the walls as if this news threatened to be unwelcome everyone was suddenly uneasy again it was deathly quiet did you find anything in the rooms cameron asked norse and nancy from the bar nothing norse replied well harrison found something the station manager said grimly doctor adams theres an email on mickeys drive the astronomer said were going to trace it if we can meanwhile it points to a place we havent looked which means i need a few men to volunteer now pronto and the rest of you in bed so i can have you tomorrow half awake and not too hungover cameron said whats going on mendoza asked its a place i hadnt thought to look frankly were going to go there now where everyone was curious where even mickey moss had no business being where the abandoned base chapter eleven thin blue shadows bobbed ahead of the search party like anxious children their silhouettes running ahead to get to the buried ruin lewis felt more hesitant he was curious about the abandoned navy base but hed also been warned it was utterly dark and cheerlessly cold the truth was he was mildly claustrophobic he didnt relish looking for a dead body down there the emailed message that adams had found had been deleted from mosss computer but abby who had some hacker skills had been able to retrieve it from the encrusted history of his hard disk if you want your meteorite back meet me in the old base at midnight unsigned of course and dating from the evening before mickey disappeared she was trying to retrace its point of origin now meanwhile the elongated penumbra of their own bodies stopped at a womblike slit in the snow its lips widened as if recently penetrated someone had passed this way not long before the edges of the tiny entry glowed a cobalt blue that sank into the ink of a catacomb it seemed the kind of hole that could close up behind you not letting you out its the only place we havent looked cameron said in response to the unspoken reluctance of the others everyone was tired and hungover the cold worsened their headaches why in hell would a thief lead mickey here pulaski wondered aloud cheese to a mouse suggested geller whod pulled down his gaiter to bite on a candy bar his beard began to grow ice crystals as he chewed which implies a trap the cook said or an exchange said cameron lets get on with it then lewis thought he was tired and uneasy and the halfmile walk from the dome had left him sweaty and cold he wanted to crawl into bed but volunteering to help this time seemed another way to get loose of the albatross of suspicion this opening goes down to the old meteorology room at one end at the old base cameron said stay tight and watch your step the timbers are starting to buckle from the weight of the snow he was carrying rope an ice ax and a small field shovel whyd they build it down there anyway geller asked dubiously looking at the hole they didnt the snow just piled up around it eventually it buries everything you dont even have to dig your own grave down here pulaski said and a hundred thousand years from now the ice will have flowed enough to spit everything back out into the ocean cameron replied sewage garbage remains wont want to be around when that iceberg melts out geller said they crawled through the opening switched on flashlights opened a hatch and descended cones of illumination danced down old wooden stairs to a snowdusted plywood floor the wood was too frozen to exhibit any signs of decay when they got to the bottom the four of them almost filled the low room its ceiling bending ominously from the weight of snow above cameron let his beam play across the walls there was a table with an abandoned military radio its clunkiness suggesting decades of antiquity a gray metal office chair another table with old meteorological charts there was no decay and no dust just a patina of frost the air was utterly still and heavy with an ancient undisturbed cold somehow more cloying and penetrating than the brisker air outside while the temperature was a constant fiftyfive below zero it felt colder well i dont like this geller announced would mickey really come down here moss once lived here remember cameron said he helped build it built a meatlocker morgue it was different with the heat on lewis played his flashlight along the floor trying to ignore his claustrophobia boot prints his light slid along to a dark doorway lots of them going both directions doesnt mean anything cameron said theres no wind and no fresh snowfall except what seeps through come down here and your prints last as long as on the moon until someone else walks over them like us they went through the door to another room there were crates and old cardboard boxes empty a few polar visitors had scrawled or scratched names on the walls nothing had decayed in the cold the men shuffled ahead the gloom swallowing where theyd been and obscuring what lay ahead doorways appeared like the lids of pits yawning a deeper darkness examination with the flashlights showed them to be merely old rooms empty of any life walls canted crazily from the strain of the snow above if these lights go out were in shit city geller said this place is like a maze exactly cameron said so dont wander off except maybe it would go faster if we split up no splitting up said pulaski mickey got into trouble because he was alone i thought you was rambo geller said oneman army rambo is horseshit in the army the idea is to get there first with the most and most means you dont split up warriors who want to do their own thing are called dead heroes tyson says you have to look after yourself tysons a butthead you look after yourself by looking after each other they came into the galley it was as if the old base had been suddenly evacuated not shut down there were dirty glasses open beer cans and bottles and a spill of old forks on the floor tables and chairs were askew in the kitchen an abandoned refrigerator hung open to reveal a cascade of forgotten frozen hot dogs a bulletin board had meeting notices and cartoons from a quarter century before their lights flickered over an old bar revealing the charms of a laminated miss november geller studied her with a historians interest they plasticized her he said look she was before pubic hair did they pack or flee lewis asked as he looked around some of this is crap from people who sneak down here to party cameron explained nobody stays too long because its too damn cold its just something to say youve done it like sleeping in a haunted house but yeah the navy pretty much just walked away why didnt they move their stuff geller asked move it where it was old and theres no place to store it cost a fortune to fly it out so this has become a repository like scotts hut at mcmurdo a thousand years from now some archaeologist is going to come down here and find those hot dogs not exactly king tut pulaski said but its history just like the dome is history thats what were doing down here making history the way mickey moss is history pulaski said lets hope theres still a chance cameron lifted his head and shouted mickey the call echoed away into the darkness seeming to shake the old base as it did so somewhere a wall creaked in reply jesus dont do that geller said youll bring the whole place down on us we gotta try they went into the next room an old barracks the bunks and mattresses were free of mold because of the cold not even bacteria could live here the beds held frozen impressions as if bodies had vacated only hours before lewis felt like the place was inhabited by ghosts he was freezing up from their slow pace are we near the end halfway the ceiling on the garage and powerhouse had mostly collapsed the trusses and plywood snapped and crumpled across an old generator cameron played his flashlight across the wreckage looking for a clue there was none they went on through a connecting corridor to the other half of the base a gap of snow having been left between the two to help contain any fire the short passageway was lit by a faint gray crepuscular light that penetrated the snow from the surface a beam creaked as they edged past there was an old recreation room with abandoned pingpong table and bookcases in a storage center were steel and paper drums lined like sentries their frozen dregs unknowable the science room had been mostly gutted of equipment except for a lab bench calendars were dated discarded trash was heaped in corners the last room was a small astronomical observatory the clump of their boots on plywood was uncomfortably loud they launched weather balloons here and took sightings of the stars cameron said end of the line thats it then pulaski said no mickey where do those stairs go geller asked pointing to a set leading upward out i hope this is the other entrance to the base we might have to dig a little if its drifted cameron glanced around the barren room clearly frustrated i cant think where else to look lewis let his flashlight play about its beam was already dimming whats that there was a small plywood door behind the stairs its edge opened a crack the snow at its foot was heavily scuffed i think its an old tunnel that goes out to pits used for earthquake and geomagnetic research probably collapsed except the doors been recently opened lewis said he walked over and pointed there were fresh splinters of yellow wood around the faded gray bingo geller said the door had frozen back in place and cameron used his ice ax to once more pry it free a tunnel just five feet high and three broad led into darkness the wood ceiling bulged downward as if pregnant the walls looked ready to implode but patches of snow on its plywood floor showed a welter of tracks and scuff marks gawd pulaski said doubtfully mickey would go in there somebody did cameron said not too long ago either im guessing i think wed better rope up who wants to lead no one spoke up okay i will he peered down the tunnel uncertainly ill go last lewis said with the other light the cold was stiffening his muscles and he didnt want to stoopwalk into that dark corridor last in first out the snow was pressing down like earth on a coffin ill take the ice ax ive used one before if you fall ill brake you they moved in a half crouch their boots echoing in the stillness at one point the squeeze of the ice was so great that they dropped to a crawl then stood again still a confusion of tracks went on the two flashlights continued to dim lewis realized he was sweating and that made him shiver his heart was hammering it was impossible to see what was ahead shit it was cameron there was a crack of breaking wood and his light disappeared the rope jerked taut yanking the men to the floor and dragging them forward in a terrifying slither lewis frantically dug with the ax and it scraped along the plywood with a squeal then it caught on a joint between two sheets of wood and he jammed it down past the plywood into the ice their slide was arrested they were stretched like beads on their rope their waists painfully squeezed rod you all right im hanging in some damn pit can you back us up pulaski and i can brace ourselves against the plywood walls geller grunted you pull on the ax lewis slowly the three men who had escaped the fall began to retreat hauling the station manager back up as they did so cameron got to the lip of the hole and worked his way over broken plywood to the top they rested a moment panting lewis had the only light what happened to yours he asked shining it on cameron dropped it the station manager crawled to the edge of the pit and looked down lewis joined him the fallen flashlight was still glowing feebly fifty feet below where the old study excavation hole ended the pits icy sides marked by meter sticks installed four decades before the hole had been roofed over with boards and plywood but someones weight had broken through before them cameron had simply stepped too close and slid down the sagging wood into thin air ah jesus the station manager now breathed a man was down there curled in a fetal position in the cone of fading light they had found mickey moss it took them an hour to lift the astronomer out pulaski had done some rock climbing in the military so they lowered him to the bottom of the pit to attach a line around the stiff corpse then he shimmied back up and they hauled cursing when mosss rockhard limbs caught momentarily on the uneven edges of the broken wood the scientist was heavy finally they got him up and over the edge of the pit they sat back gasping mosss parkaclad body seemed to fill the tunnel cameron dug out a water bottle he kept unfrozen by strapping it to his torso and passed it around the water was actually lukewarm to mickey drink all you can working in the cold is how you get dehydrated in antarctica lewis drank and shuddered i need to keep moving we all do my hands and feet are numb i think we can sled mickey from here they dragged the body unceremoniously finding it skidded well when they came through the door back into the stairwell they lifted moss more gently like pallbearers and carried him to the aluminumroofed observatory above a ladder led to a wooden trapdoor which they pried until it fell down swinging on its old hinge there was a roof of snow over the entrance softly blue and the men looked at the color eagerly a few twists of camerons shovel and the snow cascaded down in a flush of gray light they lifted and pushed mickeys body up and surfaced gasping as if emerging from underwater the hole theyd come from looked pitchblack cameron reached down and pulled the trapdoor shut thats enough of that lewis looked at the horizon clouds were moving in obscuring the low sun the day was hardly more than a gloomy twilight and yet brilliant after the darkness below mickey didnt get the cheese geller said panting no meteorite no jillion bucks was the pit a trap the station manager wearily got to his knees and examined the body the astronomers eyes and mouth were open and they could imagine him bellowing for help one leg was twisted unnaturally as if broken or an accident it would be easy enough to just fall i did he looked at lewis you were smart not to take point fingie i dont like dark places cameron said nothing its weird pulaski said he could have been lured pushed dragged whatever geller lay back blowing not dragged too much work well somebody shut the door behind him right he could have done it himself or it swung shut who knows can we just get back lewis asked cameron rocked moss this way and that looking for anything that could tell a story if anyone was aware of the dangers of the old base it was mickey weve got to get back or im going to freeze lewis insisted his torso was beginning to tremble hed never felt such cold i know cameron glanced at lewis speculatively and stayed at a kneel his hands searching mosss outer pocket held the usual gloves then the station manager yanked hard on the parka zipper breaking a sheen on ice and reached inside to a polar fleece pullover there was something flat in a zippered pocket he pulled out a photograph and looked at it in mystification not showing it to the others then he tucked it inside his own clothes and took out his field radio calling comms this is ice pick he radioed harrison there clyde skinner their radioman took a few minutes to fetch the astronomer adams you guys traced that email yet cameron asked dixon did adams said his voice crackling is lewis with you yes then ill tell you later cameron looked at the fingie no tell me now there was a hesitation the message came from one of the computers in clean air jed lewiss password the quartet absorbed this then roger that out the station manager put the radio away everyone looked at lewis if i sent mickey that message would i do it from my own machine he asked my own password no one replied come on did you send mickey that message no no the others looked grim and tired look this is crazy it sure is geller said im being set up lewis thought his heart hammering with new paranoia so who was that picture of he asked pointing nobody hey if someones sending email on my account i get to see what else is turning up cameron considered and then slowly took it out the others frowned mickey moss had been carrying a picture of the one person who knew all their passwords who could read all their mail a picture of abby dixon next to his heart fatal confidence going down a new route is always harder than going up its risky to lean out far enough to properly see and gravity conspires to shortcircuit your decision making people bunch up hesitating and sliding and inadvertently kick stuff down on each other if the kids hadnt been a pack of scaredsilly sheep with implicit trust in our decision making wed never have gotten them started down the wall at all kressler kept telling everyone it wouldnt be bad after we got to fat boy they were frightened enough to believe him once started the students gasping in anxiety and their limbs trembling as they clutched the wall it seemed even worse to have to go back up yet each step we took each foot we descended sank us deeper into the trap we were digging for ourselves fat boy didnt exactly help the mood his pleas and moans and bitchy impatience were enough to put experienced climbers on edge let alone a bunch of shaky kids then he cursed and whined at the rocks and snow that seventeen clumsy people inevitably knocked down toward him hugging himself to the cliff wall and expressing all varieties of selfpity i wouldnt have blamed his classmates a bit for pitching the blob off the ledge once we got down to him but instead there were shouts of greeting and reconciliation and hugs and a hurried halfassed setting of his broken leg fat boy roaring in pain for a moment of excited triumph we were all united again one for all and all for one plucky and indomitable in other words so thoroughly deluded that i could have written the overblown feature story about our insane little victory all by myself except we were squeezed onto a ledge that was like an overloaded openwalled elevator going nowhere cliffs below and cliffs above and the clouds were blotting out the surrounding peaks it was getting colder kressler and fleming were hearty as hell of course everyone was doing great way to go jolly good pip pip and any other kind of bullshit nonsense that popped into their heads me myself and i however happened to take a tiny peek over the edge of our view terrace and didnt see kresslers easy way down at all there was in fact a severalhundredyard drop down a softrock cliff before another ledge led sideways to a point where we might sidehill on snow again assuming we didnt trigger an avalanche how we were going to get two hundred and twenty pounds of blubber boy and fourteen other amateur climbers down this way however was not at all clear to me and it turned out not at all clear to our wouldbe department chairman kressler we now learned had never been here at all hed just read that it was climbable jesus oh what a pack of veritable einsteins we were let me tell you something about cascade volcanoes you go up the right way at the right time and season and most of the way its a steady snow slog to the top exhausting but not terribly technical really dumb people have done it and have the snapshots to prove it get fancy about it however and you can face some of the most treacherous climbing in the world the mountains are hot inside active and full of steam and the steam leaches out through the lava rock of their cones and turns their geology into a kind of swiss cheese crumbling and unreliable the mountains are weak and have an alarming tendency to break slump or slide with no warning the rock is about as firm as hardened snot in other words breaking off with pops and bangs with each rise of the spring sun spitting out pitons and breaking loose handholds for anyone optimistic enough to try it skill can very quickly be trumped by bad luck it was dawning on me that all our luck this day seemed exceedingly bad indeed i suggested we go back up and regain the normal route the kids wouldnt hear of it kressler had scared the shit out of them getting them down this far and the idea of going back up the mountain when a storm was swirling in struck everybody but me as absolutely insane i started arguing me against the other two and a debate in front of weeping fat boy and tired shivering sophomores was probably not the brightest thing we could have done kressler was furious id even raised the question he needed confidence and the group was losing it my two esteemed colleagues finally announced that they would show us the way while i babysat the classroom climb down to that beckoning snowfield and scramble back up setting ropes driving belay points and generally building a super freeway for the rest of us doubters so we could get the hell out of here before we found ourselves in whiteout conditions there was long doubting silence they were all waiting for me to speak well go for it i finally told them oh pioneers yep you fellows go right ahead ill just bundle up with the coeds here and you all call when youre ready oh and hurry it up will you didnt say that of course just gave my inthefaceofadversity nod and said id try to fashion some kind of sling to lower fat boy what choice did i have as the lone voice of reason i was being dragged down with them doomed by the original sin of fat boys unroping and if we by some chance actually survived id sure as hell demand my share of glory for trailing along idiots the doughty pair started down off the ledge it was rock climbing for which we were neither equipped nor prepared we had stiff boots for crampons not rock shoes and the two instructors were weighted with too many ropes and carabiners and pitons because they wanted to fashion a nearladder for the class even in the best of conditions it would have been difficult to descend that route now the sky was spitting snow fat boy was groaning in discomfort many of the others were snuffling and when flemings head disappeared below the edge i have to confess that even i felt terribly alone if theyd made it of course everything would have been very different i crawled over to watch their progress the wind was rising and nothing was audible but i could see them slowly picking their way down the more they descended the more they hesitated and i could tell the descent was looking more and more impossible once kressler stopped and looked back up at me for the longest time as if realizing he was in over his head come back up you moron i thought to him as hard as i could i really did but he didnt hear my mental message or chose to ignore it a few hundred more yards and his mistakes could be transformed to rescue the secondguessing transformed to a good war story his chairmanship might be secure can you imagine any goal more pathetic so they kept going fixing a line and for one brief minute i began to concede they just might show me up get down get the kids down even get fat boy down and they would have too if they were descending a wall with any kind of structural integrity but wallace wall is as unreliable as a lovers promise one minute they were bolted to it making our route and the next moment a foothold gave way and fleming who was highest slipped fell and bounced hanging on his rope from a piton suspended in terror his ice ax sparkling as it whirled away downward there was an awful pause kressler roaring instructions and then the pitons popped off the steamriddled rock like buttons in a fat boy squat ping ping ping the rope curled out in space in a lazy arc bright red against the foggy depths beyond and then fleming fell past kressler and plucked him off his perch as neatly as youd pick a grape they went screaming the students shrieked too an anguished wail that signaled their own sudden realization of mortality and doom the instructors tumbled in a gray dawn light orbiting each other in an embrace of line and then hit rocks ice glacier snow setting off a small avalanche to accompany themselves and sliding down in their very own slurry of debris the rope snapping they settled out individually finally to lie still some infinity of distance below us their broken profiles looking like discarded dolls they were dead the keening from my little mob of survivors was as mournful as the bitter wind snow was spitting at us visibility failing and we were trapped on a shelf of rock with about as much square footage as a kingsized bed the easy route down had been exposed for the fraud it was and our leaders for fools so now they clutched pleaded wept and turned to me chapter twelve the funeral of michael mortimer mickey moss astrophysicist and old antarctic explorer took place the following morning at the stake that marked the south pole or at least the clocks said morning lewis still tired and sore from recovering the body felt a groggy growing disorientation from time the sun ran around the base like a coin on a track refusing to go up or down or acknowledge the normal succession of days geller had made a joke about it a cowboy riding into the sunset would get mighty dizzy here under the dome in contrast was perpetual shadow brain chemicals that were normally triggered by the rhythm of darkness and dawn were beginning to misfire it gets worse nancy hodge had told him when he first complained about the problem theyve found the pole can mess up your thyroid and a bunch of other stuff t syndrome reports of depression date back a hundred years to the first explorers a study a decade ago found twothirds of winterovers had trouble sleeping and half were depressed it saps your energy slows your mind the best thing you can do is be conscious of it and stay focused scheduled if i feel this toasty now im going to be a charcoal briquet by october find a hobby gina is teaching italian hiro is trying to learn the harmonica bob is building a telescope even tyson is doing something right manufacturing knives but lewis hadnt found a hobby yet and was feeling increasingly alone and misplaced it had taken him two hours in the sauna yesterday to expunge the haunting chill of the old base and hed left the hot room wrung out and exhausted his sleep had nonetheless been troubled lewis had never seen a dead body before by the time he got back from saudi arabia after his parents death the funeral was over and they were already in the ground at first the corpse had simply been a frozen weight a piece of cargo pulled up on the ice cap however mickey moss had been recognizable as a oncedominant human being without wishing to lewis had caught a glimpse of the skimmilk pallor of frozen flesh the obscenely open mouth the bulging eyes moss had died in pain and horror and who was trying to blame it on lewis the astrophysicists shock was covered now by the plastic garbage bags used as a makeshift shroud for the body sealed with duct tape around the dead mans torso the plastic rattled in the bitter wind like a playing card in the spokes of a bicycle lewis found the others stood a little away from him and he thought the twentyfour other mourners looked like a cluster of orange monks hooded and hunched their ski goggles and neck gaiters masked all expression and the tendrils of their fur ruffs waved like the groping cilia of sea anemone blowing snow slid across the plateau caressing the corpse with filmy waves the station manager led the group in an awkward recitation of the lords prayer cameron stumbling haltingly through the words there were normally no services in winter and no minister only pika and eleanor chen a science technician sometimes allowed themselves to be seen leafing through the bible the group needed a priest what they had was a psychologist norse too stood a little apart from the others as if to watch both them and the body like everyone else his expression was unreadable under his swaddling of clothes his goggles giving him that black blankeyed stare of cartoon space aliens lewis was sure he was trying to figure the tragedy out figure them out theres not much i can say and its too cold to say it cameron began after the prayer his gaiter pulled down and his beard beading with bits of ice well put mickeys body out by the cargo berms until it can be evacuated in the spring as you know he fell down an old research pit and its impossible to say if it was accident heart attack the meteorite or what he glanced at norse a mute acknowledgment of the possibility of suicide as well moss had found almost the only place on the flat pole to fall any appreciable distance and how accidental was that well probably never know and maybe thats how mickey would prefer it i think hed like to be remembered for what he lived for not how he died and he lived for this base he lived for us we might not be down here having this unique opportunity without him the group shuffled uncomfortably mickey was one of a kind a sort of polar miles standish who helped pull this place together he and i didnt always get along but ill say this now and ill say it honestly ill miss him amen pika concluded gabriella leaned forward with a plastic flower liberated from a floral arrangement kept in a coke bottle placed in one of the bathrooms that the women claimed as theirs she put it on the body the wind caught it and it flew off almost immediately startling her norse stopped it with his boot and brought it back sticking it upright into the snow a red waxy rose pika cameron prompted the power plant mechanic zipped down his parka reached inside and pulled out a small portable disk player i downloaded this from the internet he announced he pushed a button and a mournful tune began tinny and barely recognizable the military ending known as taps the military dirge played out its long notes warped by poor recording and carried away by the wind then there was quiet except for the fluttering of the plastic shroud well thats that then cameron said well tow him over to the storage area we made a cross for him out of black pvc plumbing pipe the body will be rock solid perfect until we can ship it home the berms of stored cargo will give him some protection from the wind thats not that spoke up adams his words muffled by his gaiter i said i dont believe in coincidences his masked head rotated to look at lewis and then abby im not sticking mickey in the snow and forgetting about him we need to check his hard drive his records his papers everything we can to find out why the hell he died down there geller coughed lewis couldnt see past his goggles and the cloth that covered the maintenance mans mouth but he imagined the smirk robbing the dead hed predicted no one said anything until norse spoke up theres still that issue of privacy i think group survival is a little more important than privacy adams righteously replied it was probably an accident cameron said probably a coincidence but yes of course were going to try to figure out what happened who happened adams corrected you have to let me look through his things well talk about it the group began to break up lewis heard a sound of snuffling and realized it was abby weeping behind her muffler any tears that leaked out would freeze something was going on with her something about that picture why the hell had a geezer like moss gone to his death with a picture of her on his chest lewis watched as norse stepped around the body and came to her whispering something reassuring then the psychiatrist put his arm around her shoulder and led her toward the dome lewis resented the intimacy no one else said a word to him theyd heard where the email had originated from guilty or not he was bad luck it wasnt even dark yet the long winter still stretching ahead and already he felt like toast at midnight insomnia drove lewis to the computer lab compiling weather numbers for sparco was the one thing hed found that was reassuring if the sun would not finally go down a necessary first step toward the eventual return of spring at least his data sheets grew day by day with satisfying progression time was passing he found that entering the readings was relaxing a precise but mindquieting task that could ready him for sleep it was midnight and the station was still except for the ceaseless murmur of machinery and ventilation he was not particularly surprised to find abby there however her face lit by the glow of a screen she inhabited the nighttime lab like a specter appearing at odd hours and taking comfort in nursing her sometimes balky machines he admired her mastery of them the selfpossession her skill gave her when she burrowed into their innards he liked her curiosity right now she appeared to be taking a minute for herself not easy to do in an environment where the expectation from higherups was tireless work beakers were desperate to get as much information as possible in their allotted research time and their pace set an air of urgency in research camps that was impossible to escape polar science was done at a dead run but tonight her slim hand moved a mouse casually she was playing solitaire on the computer he hesitated a moment in the doorway watching her the flicker of light played across the fine features of her face and made it float in the surrounding darkness as if disembodied a ghostliness that seemed doubly foreboding after mosss funeral suddenly everyone seemed vulnerable down here certainly abby looked as lonely as lewis felt he needed a confidant and theyd proven harder to find than hed hoped summoning up the courage to endure rejection he walked in and sat next to her gearloose he said gently for a minute he thought she wasnt going to reply then ive thought of a nickname for you she didnt look up from the cards on her screen she was going to win he could tell at least she was talking to him higher than krill i hope enzyme the agent that makes things change he winced a metabolic chemical im not sure thats an improvement its true though things are different since you came here he waited for her to elaborate but she didnt she won her round and the deck of cards began handsprings of laudatory joy how so more complicated i didnt send that message abby you should have told him his rock was useless lied you mean yes he sighed secretly he agreed with her and it was costing him sleep i didnt know mickey moss was going to die all i wanted was a job and a chance a chance for what a chance to be at the pole to mean something fit in you didnt fit in before she said it lightly but she doubted him now his machine the source of that email to mickey and she wanted to erase that doubt she wanted to know that the newcomer she had trusted indeed deserved her trust how much of this would get back to norse he wanted to tell her anyway maybe even tell the psychologist not very well i didnt tell you everything that happened in alaska you know it was more complicated youre not just an environmental zealot i was a field geologist but not exactly one of the boys you get hard if you stay in the oil business and i was never comfortable with that hardness i thought i joked i objected i looked to them for family but theyre not a family theyre a machine you quit because big oil wasnt cozy i quit because i didnt have enough in common with the people i worked with it bothered me what we were doing i left some documents at prudhoe where a tour group from the wilderness society might find them sooner or later it was going to come out i was just waiting for the ax to fall i didnt like my boss i wasnt really doing my work so you came down here to escape i came down here to find some meaning is that so crazy she bent her head no understandable admirable even it seems noble all this research but that damn rock is it really so valuable not that its worth a life she dealt herself a new hand youre not unique you know meaning we all came down for things money i think geller and tyson have said yes as well as fame love promotion tenure wisdom selfunderstanding and companionship it was a recital belonging contributing yes and you abby she thought before answering i didnt fit in either the thing thats spooky about us is that were too alike i got my first masters in marine biology and discovered i didnt like ships theyre male cold and force an intimacy with people you might otherwise not pick as friends i dont make good friends easily so i went over to computers theyre like pets much more controllable predictable not the ones i buy he joked so here you are a marine biologist eight hundred miles from the sea from ship to spaceship doesnt make sense does it except i wanted time by myself to know myself she hesitated i know another guy a beaker who i met at mcmurdo and whos now on the coast at palmer station i didnt know if it was real or an ice infatuation the winter gives me some time to sort it out no wonder she was ice cream already booked whats he think about the separation that it will give him time to finish his dissertation and have you sorted it out it was like asking her to hold up her left ring finger she swung away from the game to face him not with a dead man having my picture in his pocket she meant moss you know about that then the whole base knew about it within twenty minutes after you guys got back same with tracing the email to clean air everyone always knows everything about everything except why mickey died what if thats somehow my fault he laughed bitterly i thought everyone was blaming me doctor bob isnt you sure like talking to doctor bob hes a professional barely hes a sociological researcher he knows people and he thinks its possible mickey killed himself over you over fear somehow because the only thing a man like moss accumulates is reputation and selfrespect maybe the meteorite and the picture threatened that thats doctor bobs theory anyway where did the picture come from i dont know why would mickey have it i dont know did you know mickey somehow no she sighed i dont like these questions did he know you i dont want to talk about it anymore right now okay lewis leaned back cautious lest he drive her away im just trying to be a friend so is bob so is everyone she said it impatiently rubbing her eyes as if the whole idea of solicitous concern was immensely wearying they sat for a while listening to the fan of the computer she laid a hand on his forearm finally giving it a slight squeeze why does everything have to be so hard he tried not to betray the jolt that ran through his body at her touch you want more than a friend he admitted to himself it doesnt abby i thought things down here wouldnt be complicated its full of humans one less now they were quiet you know an enzyme isnt really a bad thing abby finally said cant we find a name that implies handsome and strong it was another attempt at a joke she didnt even smile maybe you were sent to change us all i dont want to change anyone i just want to join in and do my job i just want to get to know someone she looked at him wistfully and stood i have to go now its late please i want you to stay she leaned over him thats why i have to go her lips brushed his cheek unexpectedly goodnight enzyme maybe youll change me lewis sought out norse the next day somehow he had to repair his social position at the station or go nuts hed become a snoop a pariah a suspect in a bizarre death getting involved hadnt helped him it had made things worse lewis was told the psychologist was out on the dark side boxing mosss things so he hiked out to the astronomy building he found norse at the astrophysicists workstation mickeys desk drawers half yanked open like an act of exposure it seemed unnecessarily intrusive so soon after the funeral pillaging the dead hed meant it like a joke but it came out sounding sour the psychologist glanced up from a box he was filling with mosss files he looked patient instead of defensive the mans calm might be his strongest asset but it could also be infuriating im shipping things back to the states cameron appointed me as the best person to bundle up the astronomers personal effects and papers suggesting the family and nsf would like them boxed before theyre lost the best because youre a psychologist probably the best because im new like you a little apart from the others and used to keeping confidences right lewis hesitated maybe norse was really as isolated as lewis was maybe they did have something in common the fellow fingies and because of that maybe hed understand i came out because im done playing detective doc case closed norse slipped one cardboard flap under another sealing the box say again the meteorite looking for it now will cause more trouble than its worth with mickey gone theres no point and im toast if i keep grilling everybody the psychologist nodded slowly ah he considered this and then pointed to the astronomers old desk chair sit down jed it was the tone of a parent about to lecture not unkindly reluctantly lewis sat you think mickeys death has ended things for me it has im afraid just the opposite is true how so norse took a breath rod and i have been in communication with nsf and mickeys home institution nancy doesnt have the training to do an autopsy now but theres going to be an investigation into mosss demise some of that is standard and some is unusual because of the peculiar circumstances of his death there might be people down here in the spring asking questions i understand im not sure you do the psychologist pulled over another box and began dropping in files the most likely scenario is that doctor moss suffered an unfortunate accident while trying to retrieve his meteorite its possible an autopsy would reveal a heart attack or another contributing factor another possibility however is suicide abbys picture yes im not at liberty to fully discuss that but suffice to say theres some evidence that moss had an unusual interest in younger women i dont believe that norse glanced at the boxes around them as if they held compelling evidence nobody is asking you to mickey moss is not the kind of guy who kills himself im talking about possibilities the psychologist looked at him speculatively look you know whats appealing about the hard sciences their rationality a handful of greeks more than two thousand years ago said stop were not going to explain the world with supernatural miracles anymore were going to look for natural causes it was almost a superhuman thing to do embracing the scientific method and for many scientists this rationality is their religion yet its my contention that were not wired to be rational that superstition survives in all of us because thats the way people naturally think doctor moss was a supremely rational man but he was also a man with all the freight of impulse and emotion and fear that any man carries with him he might have been spooked he might have been depressed who knows its completely unfair at this point to suggest anything untoward but abby and i have been discussing the situation please dont press her on it because that could cause some real trauma in what in the best of circumstances is an emotional pressure cooker down here still we all have to admit the possibility of the irrational one more reason to put it all to rest i think yes were really talking about the functioning of this group except theres a third possibility besides accident and suicide you see what do you mean murder come on its possible that whoever took the meteorite and lured mickey moss into the old base pushed him down that pit that doesnt make sense doesnt it an esteemed scientist finds a meteorite a thief takes it as a search closes in our culprit becomes desperate and decides to eliminate the one man he thinks might figure out who did it youre suggesting the meteorite could lead to that im suggesting that with five million dollars at stake any rational person would consider it as a possibility and if theres anything we can say about the scientists and engineers who run our little kingdom back in washington they are supremely rational positively anal about it well im sure as hell not going to play homicide detective ah but i think you have to forget it based on what authorities know so far only one clear suspect has emerged norse looked at him with unusual intensity which means in your own defense you cant stop looking now wait a minute because that suspect is obviously you chapter thirteen lewis watched the first big storm of the winter season approach on his instruments as if he were tracking an armada of bombers the barometer falling and the temperature actually rising slightly as the monster swelled up from beneath the horizon faxed satellite photos made the tempest look as vast as a pinwheel galaxy yet nothing happened at first the atmosphere at the pole seeming to hold its breath he paced from his weather monitors to the windows and from the windows to the monitors curious and watchful anticipating the storm but seeing nothing but gray blandness he looked out at the other buildings on station and everything seemed still his wait was like the solitude of a lighthouse keeper lewis made people nervous now since the discovery of mickeys body and people avoided him like they avoided buck tyson no one had accused him of anything no one had asked any questions but when he was out at clean air no one telephoned either no one emailed when he was out with his instruments jed lewis was the last man on earth a murder suspect absurd no one but norse had said a thing and yet in every eye he now read suspicion and in every gesture a distancing that email galley chatter subsided at his approach as if he turned down a dial and when he sat away it regained its volume not so much a snub as formal politeness hey lewis and that was it no questions about anything his isolation was exactly the opposite of what hed expected at the pole his daily walk to clean air was a kind of voluntary exile his trudge home one of dread at the caution he would encounter every five minutes lewis cursed mickey moss he was reluctant to notify cameron of his readings it was difficult to talk to the man the station manager had become remote since mosss death as if lewis represented potential contamination cameron never visited clean air in fact he rarely left his office where he was struggling with a report to washington his depression was dangerous it affected the entire station when lewis suggested in a rare phone call to the station manager that cameron stick his nose out of the dome once in a while the response had been curt im a little occupied lewis were still trying to hash this out hash what out mickey were they convicting him behind his back im tired of mickey i didnt have anything to do with him i understand what youre saying im sorry im busy but as the approaching tempest swelled with power lewis was its first witness and while he resented that all communication had to be initiated by himself his duty was to warn the others the storm would howl over the corpse of mickey moss entombing him and trap any human who hadnt scurried for shelter in fact the storm would do its best to snuff out the entire station trying to push people back home where they belonged except at the end theyd still be here burrowing out and with them would reemerge his own problems his own mystery what was the astronomer doing in that pit he telephoned cameron rod here the tone was tired this is lewis weve got a herbie the name was slang for storm and lewis had picked up on it immediately adopting the language of antarctica what cameron came to life where when greenwich quadrant it will hit soon how soon is soon lewis looked at the storm boiling up on his screens within the hour maybe sooner i dont know ive never seen one before an hour didnt you see the storm i saw it im supposed to get a heads up im giving you one earlier why the hell didnt you call earlier the sucker brewed up out of nowhere you know how fast the weather changes i need more of a heads up the scolding irritated lewis rod i havent noticed a whole lot of interest lately in what i have to say there was silence for a moment anybody else out with you no you okay im talking to you okay listen i want you to stay there i want you to clock the storm the instruments will do that automatically i know i just dont want you wandering around until this blows through that might take a while just sit tight ive got to get everyone battened down this is dangerous lewis we need an early heads up we need to get some warning thats why im calling listen nobody ever calls me cameron hung up nice talking to you rod lewis watched the sun wink out in the advancing wall of snow and then the ice plateau itself seemed to evaporate as the storm rushed forward devouring ground it was as if the world were dissolving the dome was snuffed the route flags jerked over flapping and then the blizzard hit his own research building with a howl clean air lurched and then shuddered its glass quaking the wind rising to a shriek flakes streamed past the railings in parabolic swirls the plateau below was gone replaced with a rushing river of fogged snow and the sky was equally obliterated here was the real antarctica powerful and malevolent lewis clung to the frame of a window drinking in the magnificent violence the building trembled under his hand like a frightened animal he thought again of his predicament suspicion rubbing on his concentration like a rock in a boot the damning email had been traced to the macintosh that abby had fixed someone using his logon or more likely taking advantage of the fact that he rarely bothered to log off of the machine unless shed done it abby had their passwords but no the problem was that lewis had skipped the galley that night electing to work out at the gym and take a packed meal to clean air afterward depressed by the feuding of tyson hed purposefully been alone then hed come back to his bed leaving his computers on and unattended he had no alibi maybe it was jerry follett hed tried with norse jerry the psychologist had smiled we both know follett is a nerds nerd his idea of conversation is atmospheric chemistry the station could burn down and he might not notice no jed jerry follett is an extremely hard sell and im not i dont suspect you norse assured lewis its too neat too obvious to send the message from clean air thats why i was against harrison poking around in the first place people jump to conclusions on fragmentary evidence but you understand why you cant stop probing we need to plumb the soul of every person on this base before this is over jed we need to know who how and why youre being made to look like a killer theres something really perverse going on and im worried it will only get worse this is all a game to you isnt it he was frustrated no im in greater earnest about this whole issue than any person on this base except me yes except you well thats just dandy doc except im a damned fingie murder suspect in some kind of psychotic sinkhole where we dont even know if a murder occurred he thought glumly maybe you could speed up the analysis and give me a little hand lewis looked out at the storm now the flakes rasping his shelter he knew that relatively little snow was falling the polar plateau was a desert with only a few inches of precipitation a year what produced the ice cap was the fact that nothing ever melted the blizzard was made of the ice caps skin picked up by the wind and hurled like saharan sand he was in a world where the molecules all rearranged themselves fifty times a year when the storm ended thered be an entirely new landscape and it would look exactly the same as before the telephone buzzed again it was cameron lewis you with adams who harrison he set off from the dark side to talk to you about something something he found on mickeys hard drive you seen him i told you i was alone i thought maybe hed gotten there no shit that means hes out in the storm maybe hes holed up in astronomy no i tried there but bob says hes gone norse was still boxing up mosss things this is why we need a heads up dammit i gave you one i got people all over station we need that heads up he clicked off again why the hell did harrison adams want to see him now had he found something incriminating he moved from window to window watching them breathe in and out against the wind there was no sign of the astronomer it made him uneasy hed been too moody not sounding the alarm the instant he could have and that meant another mistake what pissed him off about cameron was that the station manager was right he should have alerted everyone earlier suddenly he felt restless unfairly cut off he had no food no water no toilet he didnt want to sit out the storm here it felt useless cameron called again adams there yet no sign of him not at the dome no they were quiet lewis listening to the rising wind im worried about him rod he could hear the station manager take an anxious breath me too the guys brilliant but he couldnt find his way out of a phone booth all he has to do is follow the flags so why isnt he back yet next time i want a heads up you said that already i just dont want any more fuckups that made lewis angry im going to go find him he decided he suddenly realized that adams represented opportunity what im going to find harrison no dont ill starve if i stay out here look ill follow the flags back meet adams and make sure he gets back inside you said yourself hes no good outdoors jed the flags can blow out theyre holding ill be okay no im ordering you to sit tight monitor those instruments you dont work for noaa i fucking run this base do you rod it came out without thinking im going to get adams he hung up the phone began ringing he ignored it he knew that was impolitic but he suddenly felt trapped out in clean air unable to influence his own winter hed come down to help dammit so hed help lewis looked out the window at the drumming opacity of the storm and then at the satellite photos again he was still green at meteorology but it looked to him like the blow was going to get bigger before it got smaller sometimes they clawed at the station for days he wanted to get back to the dome where there were people food where they couldnt talk behind his back tyson was right high school he wanted to find adams and earn some goodwill the phone kept ringing and lewis resisted it he needed cameron needed his support but he was tired of being suspect because he was new he was tired of being the fingie as the ringing stopped he began climbing into his polar gear somebody had to find the astronomer somebody had to act hell hed been in the snow before he was pulling on his mittens when the phone started ringing again shrill and insistent to fail to answer was a major violation of station policy a portable radio squawked and lewis shut it off too neglecting to put one in his parka another violation lines down lewis stepped outside his picturewindow view of the tempest did not prepare him for its energy when he pushed out the door the wind hit him with muscular heaviness like the side of a horse a blow that knocked him sideways and almost off metal steps newly slick with a rime of ice the door banged open and he slipped and hurt his knee scuttling back to close it barely wrenching it shut against the push of the wind as it swung he had a glimpse of a small tornado of paper that the wind had kicked up inside storm noise that seemed exotic inside his metal cocoon was a deafening cacophony when he stepped outdoors the blast yanked his hood off his head because hed neglected to tie it and he was blinded when it flocked his goggles he wiped them with his nylon mitten and then shed the hand covering to clumsily tie his hood strings he was stunned by the violence it was the cold that was most surprising lewis had partly acclimated to the everyday freezerlike syrup of chill that seemed to coat every object with brittle rigidity this cold was different it wanted to reach inside his clothes and suck him out swallowing all available oxygen as it did so he couldnt see hear breathe how was he going to find adams only if the astronomer met him coming the other way lewis realized instantly that if he didnt follow the flag line briskly and alertly to the dome entrance focusing every bit of his being into where he had to go hed be dead people have died a dozen feet from shelter cameron had said use common sense common sense was to stay put well he was beyond that wasnt he he needed to take control of events lewis leaned forward into the wind the nearest flag was bent like a bow its pennant flapping frantically the nylon of his own clothes stuttered like a jackhammer feeling as if he were climbing a steep slope lewis began staggering toward the flag when he reached it he stopped turned his back to the wind pulled down his gaiter and gasped for air the strain of pushing against the storm had left him breathless he pulled his gaiter back up and turned around again wiping his goggles against the sting he could see the next flag a couple dozen of the pennants and he was home free with luck hed find adams staggering along the way this way to hot buttered rum buddy you got a problem with that rod lewis bent and labored ahead toward the pennant again movement was like pushing through plastic he was headon into the wind he made it to the flag and stopped wheezing when he turned around he saw the clean air building had already disappeared into the storm eerie the dome couldnt be seen either it was just him and a bucking flagstaff in either direction everything else was white he couldnt see the ground or the sky his own body was erased at the waist another stagger ahead the noisy drum of the storm was like the hammer of a factory snow that found the crevice between his gaiter and his goggles burned his skin his fingers were already stiffening the pounding was stupefying hed skied bad days when snow spat like wet snot but that was nothing compared to this a polar storm was beyond the pale it was the literal end of the world it was a head butt into tapioca a struggle on the football line he began counting flags five six seven then naming them for amusement homer zeke jezebel hortus pygmalion god how far was it wasnt he there yet had he somehow turned around where the hell was harrison adams he stopped again to catch his breath wiping tediously at his goggles the snow crystals threatened to build into a mask of ice his vision was blurring and he couldnt tell if it was the fogging of the goggles or the growing snow blindness of his own eyes he realized his clothes were failing him the wind seemed to be slicing right inside robbing his torso of heat it was like being knifed in the ribs ive got to get inside soon the words were muffled by his gaiter his cheeks and jaw slow to move his tongue thick ib ga ge iside soo christ how long had he been out here cameron had been right it was stupid to go into the storm too late mate he had to be at least halfway didnt he with no other choice lewis went on each thrust of his leg was like swinging a weight his clothes buzzed in the wind the fabric vibrating so fast that it might disintegrate he felt dull slowthinking the cold was freezing up his brain tightening his muscles he kept his head down trying to conserve heat an eternity passed lost in selfpity why in hell had he ever come to the south pole then lewis remembered to look up nothing he squinted where had the flag gone hed been aiming for it and now it had disappeared he turned around awkwardly and when the wind struck his back it knocked him to his knees as if hed been tackled from behind he was tired dangerously tired no flag back there either he watched his own boot prints dissolving in the wind covering up his passage somehow hed stumbled the wrong way a vast dread began to overtake him forcing himself to stand he slowly turned in a circle trying to recognize something the universe was white think think which way had he come hed been facing into the wind but the wind kept shifting and so did his path to the dome how to get back to the trail he took a step stumbled on a small drift and lost his footing as he began to topple the wind caught him like a sail he actually flew sideways a few feet coming down on his belly and skidding on the snow his hood came off again a tie broken even as he lay there the slashing snow began to drift on his windward side curling into a ball half weeping he found the ends of his hood tie and got it back on the strap now tight and choking against his throat for one perilous second he considered not getting up then he worked up to his knees trying to see he felt dumbfounded it seemed to be getting darker he needed a flashlight something to pick out color but hed left his light back at clean air idiot youve killed yourself think dully he noticed the sastruga the small drift he had tripped over the sastrugis tops had been torn off and hurled into the stormy air but their icier underlayment still existed slowly being abraded by the wind hed walked over them every day and watched their wavelike pattern from clean air which way did they run he tried to focus his mind yes yes he remembered perpendicular to his path and lower smaller in the lee of the dome he could read them like sailors read the water perhaps he struggled back up desperate now he hadnt much time he was seizing up like the tin woodsman im rusting he set off abandoning the flags as lost in the storm betting all on his ability to run into the dome he stopped for neither air nor rest plunging forward determined to bang up against salvation trudging on hammered by the wind trying to read the drifts increasingly disoriented nothing how much time had gone by as he looked down through the curtains of snow he was increasingly uncertain which way the sastrugi ran it seemed they were dissolving and reforming before his eyes curling into circles no dome no flags no hope he turned around his footprints had already disappeared hed failed he realized gambled and lost somehow hed missed a structure nearly the width of a football field he was a dead man the wind lessened slightly and above the shriek of the storm he heard a lower whine was he near the generators he struggled to place it a butterfly bright red spun by its flicker like a flash of light he was stunned butterfly no it was cloth old glory still on the dome up there because theyd forgotten to take it in before the blow the flag was being shredded to pieces its bits spinning past him like sparks in the storm he had to be close peering he saw nothing and then suddenly there was a light catching him in its blaze and a snowmobile snorted and charged up to him a huge hooded figure on its back like death itself get on you fucking moron tyson yelled im half frozen looking for the likes of you lewiss leg seemed enormously heavy as he tried to lift it over the machine he was on jupiter pinned by a cold that had become equivalent to gravity yet he managed to clutch the huge man in front of him clinging to tysons waist and the snowmobile howled and spun off tyson following the weaving course of his own track rod made me come look for you you dumb fuck i would have let you die the dark wall of the dome loomed briefly out of the snow as tyson followed it the snowmobile growling as it jounced over confused drifts then there was a sudden bank of snow the machine lurched up it and they were airborne aw shit lewis was so surprised he let go and felt himself separate from the machine he fell his world gauze then hit hard ice and snow rolling and finally skidded to a stop breathless and stunned the snowmobile banged down somewhere coughed and went silent in the stunned quiet that followed lewis realized he was somehow more protected from the wind he was on the ramp that led to the dome tyson skidded down colliding with him fuck i thought id lost you again what happened snowbank from digging out the ramp jumped the sucker and did a barrel roll the snowmobile lewis managed to mouth its trash they half crawled half skidded down the rest of the ramp skittering like hockey pucks against the closed metal doors lewis yelped when he hit sore and gleeful the smaller plywood emergency door was to one side of the main entrance and he pushed on it frozen shut stuck like glue tyson shoved him aside and butted it see what i told you he shouted sufficiency man you couldnt get out of the jam on your own the door popped open slamming inside as the wind caught it you didnt have me youd be locker meat lewis leaned through and mittened hands grabbed him and yanked tyson pushed through too the door slammed shut behind them a puff of flakes trapped inside even the cold of the dome was immense relief because the wind was shut out lewis could still hear it howling the snow rasping the protective shelter but at least he could breathe and the wind didnt cut at him he reached to pull down his goggles and had to break them loose from his forehead where theyd frozen ow he felt blind in the gloom his legs were trembling his feet dangerously numb lewis my god you all right it was cameron pounding on him you damned lunatic we thought youd lost it why didnt you take a radio take a light uh no words came im going to thaw you out just so i can kick the shit out of you he shoved him in the direction of the galley the station manager turned to tyson good job buck norse just got back too but adams hasnt showed tysons face was a mask of ice fuck he was going to see lewis i cant raise him the mechanic slumped im wasted man the machines kaput i cant go back out there cameron turned to lewis jed did you see him at all lewis shook his head he remembered the argument between tyson and adams in the weight room how anxious would tyson be to look for him we got another machine cameron asked tyson shook his head not fired up and ready how long if i go instead of you no way its suicide man dont go but if i did too long too long in that sickly they looked at each other im going up the ramp to fire some flares cameron said maybe he can home in on that you cant see for shit tyson looked as exhausted as a blown horse ive got to try something you cant see you cant hear you cant find i just stumbled on the fingie with dumb luck ive got to do something i cant lose two chapter fourteen the storm blew for thirtyseven hours the snow crystalline and pitiless driven so hard by the wind that it sizzled against the outside of the dome like grease in a frying pan in that long cold twilight of noise and confinement with no telephone or radio call for help the winterovers of amundsenscott base became glumly convinced that harrison adams was also dead in the midst of the storm cameron led a party roped and lit out along the flag route to the dark sector astronomy building to look for him again one flag was down a bad sign and they had to use gps to bridge the gap they searched the building endured two hours in the blizzard going and coming back and found nothing any further searching had to wait until the wind died down i told everyone to stay put cameron said bitterly as he exhaustedly shed his parka his nylon frozen over by a sheen of ice why the hell didnt they stay put no predecessor had ever lost two people before the great hush that marked the end of the storm came at what the clock said was morning so much snow had drifted that when they opened the exit door to the ramp again there was a chesthigh wall they had to dig through to get outside tyson was told to warm up a cat to bulldoze more blocking snow away and this time he complied without rebellion the tragedies seemed to be sobering him the others marched out in a platoon of orange and fanned out to look for adamss body cameron passed out whistles to signal the clouds were gone it was almost the equinox the time when the sun would disappear completely from the pole the orb scraped the horizon a trick of light making part of it seem to catch and drag behind in a blob of trailing fire the brightness washed out by the rim of light fog that surrounded them the haze was so thick and the light so low that the entire station already seemed shrouded in cold sepulchral twilight the temperature was seventythree degrees below zero during the storm the windchill had dipped to a hundred and fifty below lewis searched for adams in a mood of glum depression maybe if hed called about the storm at its first sign the astronomer might have made it maybe if he hadnt lost the flag route hed have run into adams he was lucky he wasnt dead himself cameron had chewed him out for not staying at clean air as hed been told getting lost puts everyone else in jeopardy it was a stupid juvenile fingie stunt norse asked lewis if hed thought up anything new about mickeys death harrison said he was coming out to see you i presume there was a reason he didnt tell me that people are pretty bummed out jed weve got to get a handle on whats going on dont you think im trying its pretty tough to play detective when no one will talk to me help me out on this will you he grimaced people are shy about talking to me too lewis walked up the flag line now toward the astronomy building trying to imagine where the missing astronomer might have gone his own stumbling trek had made him realize how easy it was to get lost adams had obviously gone off course while trying to get to clean air for some reason choosing to talk to lewis personally instead of simply call why once disoriented his body shutting down from the cold adams would have sought any shelter where the stark nature of the polar plateau created an illusion lewis had realized the base seemed simple and yet there were more than a hundred separate buildings and structures scattered around observatories storage shacks vaults telescopes antennas and long rows of stockpiled crates called cargo berms if lost adams could have stumbled into a lot of places to seek refuge cameron and a few others were already searching the electrical substation shack and telescope support buildings of the astronomy sector digging into the driftedover plywood bumps one by one lewis meanwhile squinted down the flag line holding out his arm to provide a makeshift straightedge the flags were leaning raggedly but for the most part theyd held the astronomer should have been able to follow you didnt he remembered and here there was a flag missing adams should have retreated you didnt he reminded himself lewis walked to the gap where the flag had fallen and slowly realized that the markers nearer the astronomy complex seemed slightly out of alignment going toward the astronomy building the gap seemed hardly to matter a straight walk from flag to flag would aim you correctly across the break in the route but turned the other way lewis backed up and sighted again it was a subtle shift hardly noticeable with the wind gone and the snow once more lying obediently in place and yet he knew just how blind hed been going this way the last two flags would point at an angle that led off the main sled road toward the white nomansland of the runway a person walking that way would veer away from the dome fail to find the next flag because of the gap cross the skiway and had someone shifted the flags suddenly certain lewis started by himself toward a cluster of shacks where the planes taxied if adams had gotten into shelter over there it was possible he was still alive people had seemed dead on everest stone cold and yet had revived inside a shack harrison might have had a chance a substation and storage shed were padlocked for the winter no refuge there but a warmup shed used by air crew to rejuvenate as they loaded and unloaded planes had not been bolted harrison no answer the building was nothing but a weathered plywood box with a shed roof and a round plastic bubble window to view the runway its portable heater was probably in winter storage still it offered shelter from the wind lewis tried the door but it was stuck frozen shut when he pounded there was no answer he went around to the window but it was smoked against summer glare and too scratched to see inside he studied the door again a flat orange cord and a bar of ice ran around its frame thicker than was normal if the ice had been present when adams arrived the astronomer couldnt have gotten inside yet why was there so much as on other buildings the cord was an electrical heat tape that ran around the jamb that was used to melt accumulating frost and keep openings from sticking somehow this one hadnt worked or had gone haywire the ice had sealed the door adams his shout drifted away in the cold twilight something else orange caught lewiss eye poking out from the bottom of the wall near the door a scrap of fabric he stopped to inspect it brushing snow aside and slow dread began to settle on him as he dug it was a mitten a buried mitten when lewis tried to pick it up it wouldnt come because he felt something hard inside stiff and clawlike fingers attached to someones arm lewis was holding adamss frozen hand reaching blindly out from under the wall of the warmup shack as if the man were trying to dig his way out of a vault he dropped the mitten and backed away the arm was reaching out from beneath the shed wall in supplication its hole too shallow for a body to squeeze through the astronomer had tried to get out of the icelocked shed through its floor burrowing through the snow hed been stopped by the underlying ice lewiss heart was hammering something had gone horribly wrong he looked more closely at the ribbon of heat tape the astronomer had gotten inside maybe in his confusion adams might have cranked the tape temperature too high melting so much snow that water ran down the frame to create a bar of ice meaning he could no longer get outside yet why had the water then turned to ice why had the tape failed lewis followed the cord down to the snow where it turned toward a junction box that supplied electricity orange wire came up as he would expect winding winding at the corner of the shack it was broken no neatly cut harrison adams had not died alone someone had followed him and effectively locked him in snipping the tape and imprisoning him in ice this wasnt negligence lewis thought this was murder there was a gasp and he turned dana andrews had come up behind him and was looking from the beseeching mitten to lewiss own hand and the severed cord her head rotated from mitten to cord back and forth as if at a tennis match then she pulled her plastic whistle out from her parka put it to her mouth and blew and blew and blew the winterovers swarmed the warmup shed like a crowd at an accident looking in horrified fascination at the beseeching arm and severed tape everyone kept a wary distance from lewis cameron strode up puffing after a quick trot from astronomy took in the scene in a moment and brusquely ordered the others to leave i want norse and lewis only the rest of you back to the dome i dont want anyone thinking anything not yet but everyone was already thinking of course considering every dark possibility why us the psychologist asked because weve got some talking to do the others trailed off in a line of orange looking curiously back at the remaining trio and the forlorn shack once they were back their galley would buzz with speculation like a disturbed hive cameron lewis and norse watched until the others disappeared inside and then fetched a wooden beam from the cargo area to batter down the shed door the ram made a dull booming echo in the dusky morning like the dirge of a bell finally the ice shattered in a spray like broken glass and the door burst inward adamss last moments were heartbreaking he must have stumbled inside in exhaustion seeking a temporary refuge from the minddeadening wind the shack was insulated but had no heat eventually harrison would have realized that he was still in subzero cold and had to start again for the dome but when he tried to go back out the astronomer was frozen in hed have butted and kicked and screamed but no one knew where he was no one could hear him above the howl of the wind eventually he must have panicked with superhuman energy hed somehow managed to rip up one of the plywood sections that formed the shacks crude floor nails shattering in the cold hed sliced the nylon arm of his parka in the process and scraped his wrist the floor was dotted with droplets of frozen blood then hed burrowed throwing a small heap of snow to one side of the room as he tried to dig his way out of his cold trap the ice was too close to the surface to allow him to squeeze his way out at some point hed stopped from exhaustion or defeat helpless in a spasm of shivering and then hed fallen asleep as his core temperature plunged pain and then no pain at least his eyes were closed i thought he took a radio norse said cameron searched for one adams had it in his pocket but its battery was dead someone had failed to recharge it the astronomer probably hadnt checked it looks like someone broke the heat tape lewis said dully cut it cameron said what tape norse asked cameron pointed to the orange cord around the door youve seen these to keep the doorjambs from freezing he pointed to a dial at the bottom of the door adams or someone cranked this tape way too high it would have created a niagara of meltwater around this jamb then the tape broke or was cut i dont get it if you wanted to seal someone inside an unheated shack at the height of a blizzard that would be the way to do it melt some water get the doorway wet and then cut the heat off the door would freeze as if it were welded he looked at the other two youre saying someone trapped him im saying i dont know how the hell else that tape broke maybe it was just an accident norse said everythings brittle in the cold like mickey yes two accidents and what kind of luck is that camerons tone was bitter sometimes random chance clusters youre a scientist and you know that unfortunately the cluster fell on your watch ill be the first to testify you did all you can testify at my trial the station manager gave a sharp laugh at my funeral i just mean when nsf asks questions about this youve had bad luck rod jesus one storm and im down two beakers is that some kind of record or what mickey didnt die in the storm no i lost him in clear weather christ almighty i wish i was the one who was dead he looked gloomily down at adams cant someone pull his fucking neck gaiter up over his face so i dont have to look at him stooping lewis did so accident my ass if it wasnt an accident then why norse asked cameron looked grimly at lewis thats the question isnt it jed why was adams coming to see you in clean air i dont know its not like we were buddies why did you leave clean air after i told you not to to help find him i couldnt last out that storm id starve i thought id meet him coming back to the dome it was stupid to tell me to stay out there rod i should have left before i did did you see harrison in the storm no of course not but you saw tyson he saw me you were riding with him tyson and you together the guy who doesnt like adams the guy who doesnt like anybody lewis said in exasperation look i had nothing to do with this i couldnt even get from clean air to the dome i would have frozen myself if tyson hadnt found me you know that you saw what condition i was in and i didnt have time to wander clear over here if anything the storm proves im innocent he looked expectantly right it proves youre the one person who knew where the body was i guessed why would i go find the body if i killed him to make sure hes dead that one crossed the line fuck you the station manager looked at the new man with frank dislike why are you always in the middle of things because everyone else always puts me there he pointed to norse why dont you question bob he was out too where the hell was he i know that cameron said quietly thats why i asked for both of you to stay here with me to hash this out he turned to norse did you see harrison i already told you i did at astronomy i left just ahead of the storm i got back before lewis did adams was going to follow shortly were the flags intact they were when i passed them so what do you think happened norse looked down at the frozen astronomer why not bad luck a flag blows away adams gets lost finds the shack the cord somehow fails on its own its almost broken through adams cranks it too high the wind catches it he considered or not look the only one with any true mobility was tyson on the snowmobile do you think he i did see them arguing in the weight room lewis said and then instantly regretted having said it he was doing to tyson what cameron was trying to do to him but not anything that would lead to this well i damn well want to know what would lead to this the station manager suddenly shouted in frustration i want to know whos ruining my winter this isnt fair dammit im sick of you and im sick of buck and im sick of this damn job rod norse snapped crisply rod rod cool it his voice was admonitory talk like that and youll throw everyone in a panic this is a time for leadership not accusations rationality not wild suspicion maybe it is all accidental certainly its all circumstantial weve got a small group and a lot of concern right now even fear consternation sorrow you name it people will be feeding off each other weve got to get them to the point of feeding strength not weakness cameron looked utterly depressed how do we do that first of all you are the man the man man of the hour everyones looking to you for cues on how to respond youve got to seem confident unafraid in charge get it together norse looked concerned the station manager took a deep breath i know but to lose two of our top scientists and then this bonehead herehe nodded to lewis wandering off in the storm its just hard doc its like being in the navy and grounding a ship they dont want to hear excuses you just dont run aground and when you do you dont surrender listen this is what the station is about this is what our winter is about leadership the ability of the individual to define the group youre the keystone the pivot the rock cameron closed his eyes some rock he thought a minute his chest rising and falling and then opened his eyes i know ive got to get my shit together he said tiredly its just a little much to take its a little much for everyone to take thats why we need you he grimaced at his own explosion its lonely at the top he recited wryly everyones alone thats life okay he took a breath okay okay listen im going to ask nsf to send an investigator down here they sent the fbi to mcmurdo once maybe they can send somebody here norse was surprised a cop i thought planes couldnt get in here lewis said if they can im ready to go home theres an outside chance for at least an airdrop cameron said theyve done them in winter before weve definitely got an emergency here maybe they can parachute somebody in somebody with a weapon and authority someone who knows what to do that might be overreacting rod norse said overreacting with two dead bodies two accidents until we learn otherwise you put a cop in here and it becomes two victims you define the problem in the worst possible light you put your own stewardship in the worst possible light and nobody will get any work done bullshit he pointed at norse maybe theyll begin by investigating you the psychologist sighed id recommend it actually if you dont want to spook everyone else and screw up the whole winter concentrate on me is that a confession he was sour think about it suppose you get your gman he parachutes in and interrogates me or lewis or tyson people are freaked out a small group like this can turn on a person and make his life miserable ive read about it ive seen it and then youve got somebody under a cloud preoccupying everyone until spring what are you going to do with them for the rest of the winter how does anyone get any work done i think we need to calm things down not hype them up and nsf is going to go ballistic if you turn an accident into a murder investigation if you really need a fall guy make it me im not doing physical science im not worried about what they might ask im not looking for a fall guy im looking to keep things under some kind of control what do you suggest doctor freud just that we all cool off for a day or two that we dont panic the bureaucrats in dc for a day or two if one of us is a murderer well were not going anywhere we chill and separate and wait what does that mean lewis asked quarantine jed theres going to be a lot of gossip and speculation about this its inevitable especially with you finding the body after the email to mickey i think you should stay out in clean air for a while longer this time with a sleeping bag well bring you your meals you can collect your data for sparco and be safe under house arrest lewis clarified so everyone else feels safe temporarily its for your own good doc theres not even a john out there well bring you a bucket just for a few days until we sort things out i cant believe this is tyson going to be quarantined buck quarantines himself everyones avoiding him like the plague anyway are you going to be quarantined oh no he smiled because this is what i came down for to watch us cameron said bitterly watch us go nuts to watch the variable in the experiment once jed is out of the way norse smiled thinly who had mobility who had motive im going to watch the habits and patterns and movements of buck tyson and save your career by letting you solve this one yourself i make my decision when the shit hits the fan theres no time to be polite to the weaklings fleming and kressler had just killed themselves with their own reckless idiocy fat boy had doomed himself by waddling off the rope against all orders and the rest of the kids were sniffing and sniveling like a pack of whipped dogs somehow i had to find some spine in them if we were going to get out of this mess i mostly felt contempt that theyd allowed themselves to be herded onto this ledge that id allowed myself to be herded and outrage that my life was at risk because of the incompetence and bad judgment of others i didnt deserve to die still i bit back most of what i wanted to say i needed two of them the two best to ascend the cliff with me so we could belay the rest of the sheep back off the deadend ledge my colleagues had led them to i needed the remainder to break out of their freezeup panic the wind was rising the snow getting thicker but if we moved quickly moved now we still might get up to the saddle and descend the glacier on the other side before we became totally lost in a whiteout theyre dead but youre not i snapped at them about fleming and kressler dont think about them think about yourself if youre going to survive this its going to have to come from inside you i need fire in your bellies or youre all going to die more weeping and moaning jesus h christ they were falling apart some of the kids were starting to shiver a first warning of hypothermia and wed all lock up if we didnt get moving so i had to be realistic when the shit hits the fan its no time to tell fairy tales its triage time some were going to make it and some probably werent fat boy was dead meat as far as i was concerned hed blundered and was about to pay for it big time the strongest of the rest of us had a chance maybe women and children first is lunacy at a time like that a sure invitation to disaster i like girls as well as any man but not at the end of a rope thats holding me to a crumbling rock wall so the first decision i made was that the females stayed behind they were supposed to be better in cold anyway right epidermal layer and all that if they huddled maybe theyd last through the storm if i could get back with help if if the storm was building and help was a long time off nobody was helicoptering in nobody was climbing back up not until this little snow spat was over bad luck but there it was so the ladies would have to wait and hope for the best i was taking the strongest boys if the bucks remembered what theyd learned maybe a few of us could make it couldnt tell them the grim facts of course sometimes when youre honest with yourself you still have to lie to the others especially if they might survive and tell stories about you afterward so i told them i was leading the strongest of us to the top of the cliff and that wed try to belay anyone else who wanted to come up if we could and if we couldnt do that we were going to get help and they should all sit tight until we got back trust me hold on to each other and pray were all going to get through this bullshit i took the two i thought just might make it i truly did chisel chin was a bigballed sonofabitch wise guy who had the endurance of any two of his classmates and was eyeing routes even as i tried to settle the rest of the herd carrot top was jumpier and not as strong but he was big and reasonably competent and hadnt spaced out like ponytail boy the third candidate i had in mind that one had developed a thousandyard stare like hed already seen the angelic choir so i didnt think i could rely on his presence of mind maybe if we could really rig a rope to help the others ponytail could be the first to try to follow i shook him telling him that meanwhile however id have to rely on the other two we roped up slipped on our packs and readied ourselves to go back up the way wed come down what a moronic mess somebody asked about fat boy and i admit i was a little curt at that point saying fat boy was just going to have to look after himself for a while and if he gave them any grief they could just roll lard ass over the edge they stared wideeyed at my moment of honesty and actually shut up for half a minute gee did i let a fart what did they think was going to happen to fat boy i loathed their innocence i truly did so id start the first pitch hammer in a piton fix a rope and let chisel chin come up to me then id go on my partner braced so that if i fell the piton and chisel chin combined just might hold me in space i might drop thirty feet before the rope brought me up taut but thats a hell of a lot better than three thousand then another piton another point carrot top coming on too and wed work our way up the cliff bing bang boom fleming and kressler had taken too much rope so we had to take all the remaining line from the others if we hoped to fashion a line all the way back up to the top if we made it great if we didnt the others werent getting off that ledge anyway just before we started i faced away from the weeping group looked out to the gray eternity swirling all around us and fumbled under my coat i was mindful of what had happened to kressler and fleming and was determined that it wasnt going to happen to me it wasnt prophetic i was counting on those two kids sure but if youre going to survive in this jungle of ours you prepare for every contingency you have to think ahead every time ive won in life its because ive thought two or three moves down the road a step ahead thats the secret so i took out a silver commando knife slipped it out of its sheath and tucked it into a strap near my neck where i could snatch it out easily just in case then i turned to the others and actually managed a reassuring grin what a hero i was we started back up chapter fifteen flat gray clouds spoiled the final exit of the sun there was a week of overcast as dark and featureless as a pot lid and when it blew away the lingering orb was finally gone and the long polar night had begun the sky was still dusk blue a couple of stars popped out tiny and cold the first outriders of the glory to come instead of seeming foreboding the approaching dark heralded a kind of peace to lewis the suns scheduled disappearance meant it would reappear on schedule too and when that happened he would be near release from the pole meanwhile the ground had lost shadow and definition and the boundary between snow and sky became even more indistinct at first he didnt mind his isolation in the clean air quadrant it spared him the necessity of trying to prove his own innocence he didnt have to act some kind of normal relationship with a group of people half suspicious that he might be a murderer at worst and a badluck enzyme at best solitary he called it except that each day he had four hours in which orbiting satellites lifted high enough above the polar horizon to allow access to the internet lewis monitored world news that seemed increasingly remote shopped for products he had no use for and couldnt get delivered and kept his mentor sparco updated on his weather measurements he found himself surprisingly intrigued by the accumulating data points of temperature wind snow carbon dioxide and ozone graphing the readings was like painstakingly sculpting a work of art when winds were calm he watched from the windows as gerald follett launched his atmospheric balloons observing the quiet routine of inflation rigging and recording the man had declined lewiss help looking nervous when lewis even offered but the regularity of the task was somehow reassuring life went on there was a purity to the science and a purity to the dry cold that lewis found bracing meteorology itself was a constant dance of interwoven factors like the twisted glass of a kaleidoscope suggesting different global futures hed found a better purpose his exile also spared him fevered group speculation on the deaths of moss and adams no theories no rumors no jokes it made him calmer people were complicated but science was not the universe was designed to be understood only humans were an enigma yet when his tasks were completed he was increasingly lonely as well the others brought him a mattress a bucket and food as if he were a leper his basic dilemma was that day after day went by without mishap according to cameron there were no disappearances no discoveries and no confessions and thus nothing to turn suspicion away from him lewis comes and things go wrong lewis is banished and normalcy returns no gman parachuted in no conclusions were drawn a week drifted by empty of real news then abby came the first time hed seen her since adamss death once more he detected her breath before he noticed her approach a spike in his carbon measurements that he duly noted in the log he stepped to a window and watched her walk the flag line following a path of snow clumpy enough that she occasionally stumbled a heavy daypack adding to her clumsiness in the dusk hed learned to recognize her from a distance her quick straightforward walk the rather tight swing of her arms her habit of sometimes tucking them around her torso as if to warm herself bowing her head in thought like a bird at roost and then popping upright suddenly to peer around like a startled dove it was funny how much you could tell from posture and movement everyone looked alike in their orange parkas and black bib pants and yet they didnt a tilt of head a curve of back an angle of foot stances as individualistic as fingerprints she clanged up the stairs stamped snow loose in the vestibule and came inside swinging the backpack onto the floor with a soft thud more food enzyme lewis grimaced he was getting tired of hotplate leftovers bread and water meat loaf and macaroni a little junk food as well for morale chemical preservatives disguised as cake salt disguised as chips sugar dusted with a little flour cueball promised he wont put in enough to poison you not without a group vote at least he meant it as a joke but it came out sounding sour im sure everyone misses me forgotten you actually she shed her coat too many troubles trouble he was shamelessly hungry for gossip a suspect unmasked just bad feeling its turning into a pretty grim winter rod told me nothings happening thats because he doesnt know what to do tyson has gone nuts he thinks everyones against him which we are one shower stinks yet he wont back down hes announced that since no one appreciates his contributions to our little society hes going to find the meteorite and make himself rich and to hell with anyone else so hes stomping around ignoring his job and even threatening to wig out of here on a spryte or something fixing those is the one thing hell work on cameron blew up at him in the galley and said hes pulling bucks bonus as if he had any chance of getting it anyway so then they almost got into a fistfight it scared everybody geller fantasizes about putting a contract out on the guy pulaski is about to call buck out the beakers are bitching about not getting enough work done and bob is writing it all up like were a bunch of lunatics which maybe we are were toasting at record speed jesus tyson was being pushed toward an explosion maybe norses plan of removing lewis from the center of things was working after all bad feeling couldnt be blamed on him yet the tension sounded risky so you came to visit the only sane man on station she looked at him warily just to deliver groceries even though i might be dangerous the mysterious fingie the enzyme impulsively he took a step toward her to see what shed do doctor bob actually suggested i deliver the food this time said its good for you to see other people and he said that she stopped suddenly flustered and what nothing she looked away what he said we mesh well together he took another step i thought i made people nervous abby shed stiffened he noticed not as sure of him as she pretended not me im not afraid of you jed another step very close now if so youre the only one stop it im trying to trust dont put everything to the test he stopped feeling foolish im sorry i shouldnt joke around its just that the whole situation is so absurd this place this paranoia people are spooked im spooked we all just want to go home and yet we cant yes she slumped in a chair stuck with each other she squinted at him slightly annoyed at his advance her lips were full her neck high her hands were small good for working with electronics she was prettier than he remembered he realized that hed missed her i like you abby the bold confession surprised himself and he was pleased at his own sudden boldness i like you a lot im attracted to you and im lonely im glad you came out here she smiled wanly just dont take an ax to me and make me regret it you trusted me enough to come out here right i guess and i have to trust you right she looked wary i guess he sat in a chair opposite her if were going to trust each other we have to talk i think too much has happened you have to tell me about that photograph in mickeys pocket she squirmed i dont know about that picture but you know something right i saw it upset you abby im a damned murder suspect im in exile i need help what in the hell is going on i dont know she looked away it turns out its a photo from my personnel file i checked and its missing from the stuff nsf sent down mickey lifted it thats not what he said mickey brought it to me that night not long after the meteorite was stolen he said he found it in doctor bobs room when you searched each other that there was a wall panel with screws missing and it had been tucked in a slit there he said that he didnt trust norse that he didnt like shrinks he wanted to know what my photograph was doing there he said if i was having a problem with bob he had authority enough to help me he said he was prepared to be my friend jesus doctor bob thats what i thought so she faltered a moment summoning courage so i went to norse and told him i had some personal problems i wanted help with and needed to talk to him privately in his room and then i went there blabbering away looking at the walls and i didnt see anything like what doctor moss described no screws missing no gap in the panels so i told bob what mickey had showed me and he suddenly got very concerned and agitated and warned me to stay away from the astronomer at all costs i was just dumbfounded but he said thered been past complaints from young women on the base about moss coming on to them and worse this old guy bullying and pawing them because of his power on station that he invented excuses to get close to them that he even researched the next group coming down picking out the pretty ones and that one reason norse was sent down here was to check out those rumors and that moss probably suspected that and didnt like him because of it and that possibly this whole meteorite thing was an attempt to distract attention she said it in a rush lewis was skeptical a geezer like moss boy i dont know he was pretty regal i cant imagine him coming on to anybody thats what i thought but then bob had these files i couldnt read them because of the confidentiality but he showed me a packet of what he said were complaints that had been filed it was horrible i didnt know what to think and then mickey dies suicide yes she nodded miserably he was afraid of exposure i think so i think norse is some kind of investigator except bob norse told me he thought it could be murder or at least thats what nsf thinks back in dc and for my own protection im sitting out here dont you see nsf wants a murder or an accident anything but a big sexual scandal like tailhook thats going to throw a wrench in their plans to get congressional money to rebuild this base reconstruction is going to cost a hundred million dollars and they cant afford to have their star scientist exposed as a rogue after clarence thomas and monica lewinsky and all that so norse thinks youre in danger jed youre not one of the fraternity youre just this oil guy down to make a few bucks over the winter they might try to pin something on you to distract from any stories about mickey nothing to file in court because that would just make matters worse just enough suspicion and rumor to muddy the waters to make you the fall guy send you away under a cloud doctor bob is trying to help you thats why he encouraged me to come out here what about harrison adams his death is probably a coincidence but who knows doctor bob is as confused as we are this is too crazy which is exactly why hes here lewis sighed trying to think harrison adams had been going through mosss computer had he learned too much was there something incriminating he needed to discuss with lewis and if the deaths werent backtoback accidents or a suicideaccident then who was responsible the only one he could see with a stake in the future of base reconstruction was rod cameron who might be angling for a promotion in the nsf bureaucracy but would cameron kill to cover up a scandal it was too farfetched you needed someone truly loony or someone desperate for that meteorite he looked at her what do you think of me my heart tells me youre just unlucky in the wrong place at the wrong time my brain tells me not to trust anyone but im here arent i maybe all this is nothing moss decided to go exploring slipped and fell harrison got caught in a storm it happens he smiled ruefully so you risk bringing me dinner she looked away im attracted to you too jed she said the admission took him as much by surprise as his own its going to be a long winter we both need a friend she amended her words filled him with longing the tundra had been liberating when he walked away from his oil job but the aftermath had been lonely hed had no place he belonged no purpose to his life and now suddenly there was this woman abby i think i need to kiss you he decided she looked at him wryly im going to go crazy if i cant kiss you right now he insisted you are crazy were all crazy we just decided that yes thats why its all right to kiss you she considered it cautiously if we kiss things change yes like an enzyme i want to change things with you i know theres that other guy but hes not here and we are hes not in this and we are then what happens i dont know i just know its important to do this now she looked at him amused impatient uncertain im afraid ill like it he grinned im afraid you wont she hesitated as judicious as if reviewing a contract reviewing her own instincts about him then she made up her mind okay he knelt next to her and lifted his face to hers struck by the green hazel of her eyes and the dark curl of her hair on each cheek she coolly waited as he cupped the nape of her neck bending her to him but when his lips gently touched hers she shivered and closed her eyes he came away and her lips parted slightly revealing a glimpse of the pearl of her teeth he kissed her again more deeply this time and she started to respond then she turned her head sighing and his lips brushed her cheek and ear and followed the curve of her neck to the collar of her thermax underwear thats enough she stood up he remained kneeling looking up at her no it isnt i like you jed but too much is going on ive got a lot to think about her eyes were darting around the room betraying her confusion you think too much you know lets just leave it there for now he stood as well grinning savoring his small triumph hed tasted her shed liked it i want to get to know you yes she said it in a tone that suggested she wasnt at all sure that was a good idea yet she wanted to surrender he was sure of it im tired of exile i think i want to get back to the dome yes suddenly he was excited isolation out in clean air was preferable to being ostracized inside the dome but abbys confession of attraction made everything different here at least was a friend ally hed work side by side with her talk to her endure the winter with her go talk to rod for me tell him to bring me in i dont know if doctor bob thinks thats a good idea yet to hell with doctor bob hes trying to protect you isolate me for his observations hed seen norse confer with abby maybe the shrink wanted to put the moves on her himself his own exile was a convenience screw norse i want to be with you well then you talk to cameron it will be embarrassing if i do it yes absolutely he felt energized she was receptive to a partnership he could talk the station manager into anything youll have to call him but hes pretty stressed out i will maybe in the morning hes a little more rested then good idea people are still pretty edgy in the dome snapping at each other its not going to be easy for you if you come back ill be okay if i can get to talk to you thats all im promising i know rod is pretty jumpy be patient i will but when she left to do some maintenance work on the computers in astronomy he decided he couldnt wait to hell with patience to hell with tomorrow he was sick of being isolated in clean air like some kind of germ he went to the phone and called camerons office there was no answer so he dialed the galley pulaski told him to try a radio our station manager is making his rounds cant it wait no it cant lewis hung up and picked up the radio enzyme to ice pick over after a few tries camerons raspy tired voice finally came on this is cameron this is lewis where are you anybody with a radio could listen in but he was too determined to care checking the fuel arch rod can we meet to talk there was a wary silence then im kind of busy im going nuts in clean air its for your own good buddy ive been talking with abby let me come back to the dome she can keep an eye on me lock me in my room at night if you have to he stalled ill talk about it to doctor bob doctor bob has no authority here you do ive been exiled without charges thats unconstitutional isnt it more uncomfortable silence i dont know its easier having you out there the implication was plain rod i think it was suicide suicide and an accident you cant blame me and you cant blame yourself things are kind of messy jed you mean tyson camerons voice was cold tysons a dead man dont bring him up to me dont blame me for him let me come over to talk lets meet privately you and me to talk another long silence i have to check out these tanks ill find you there well talk in private enzyme cameron sounded besieged reluctant listen stay in clean air when i finish this inspection ill swing by and see how youre doing okay will we talk yes it was a sigh well talk talk about changing things well talk it was enough roger that he put down the radio impatient and hopeful maybe with abby dixon he could find a way to live in this place i choose survival every once in a while you arrive at a point in life where you cant afford to make a mistake might be a job might be a romance might be a gamble or the way you choose to answer with a gun pointed to your head might be an icy road and oncoming headlights and that drink you had that was one too many you cant know when or how its going to come but when it does you have to get things right if you dont youre dead figuratively and literally my climbing companions didnt get it right for the first two hundred feet i was optimistic it was difficult climbing but not impossible even for relative amateurs there were cracks and toeholds and chimneys enough to squirt our way upward though the rocks we dislodged banged down and set off a fresh round of squeals and shouts from the kids below crash sorry about that hey we were making it inching back up getting to a point where maybe everyone but fat boy could climb back out of purgatory chisel chin and carrot top straining up to each piton breathing hard eyes wide limbs trembling yes but making it our lives were at stake the two kids were doing what they had to do i was feeling good about saving them i was pulling us out of the trap to understand my choice you have to picture how pisspoor miserable it was on wallace wall at first the light had strengthened as the sun rose giving a crumb of encouragement but then the storm blotted out any sight of old sol and the morning grew dim and murky snow was blowing horizontally turning the rock slippery and small puffs of snow broke off from the cornice at the top of the wall and rained down on us like sand into a pit each of us tensing in case the drizzle heralded a larger avalanche the gusts were up to forty i learned later and the windchill well below zero our mittens were off to allow us to grip but the rock was shredding our glove liners and our fingers were turning numb and bloody the wall angle wasnt vertical but almost so and it was a strain to stay glued the farther we ascended the more anxious i became i could imagine the fear the two kids were feeling the exposure the helplessness i kept remembering kressler and fleming pinwheeling off that cliff it was chisel chin who made the mistake the first rule of climbing is to keep at least three of your four limbs in contact with the mountain at any one time he was impatient and had both a foot and a hand reaching for fresh holds when a rock broke and both legs were suddenly churning in empty space he hung for a moment on one exhausted arm kicking in the air for substitute footholds hed failed to locate first id warned himand then with a grunt he dropped all of this happening in the flash of a second i had time to jam one forearm in a crack almost breaking it and braced against the shock he fell to the limit of his rope yelling and it cinched on my waist so hard that i felt like i was being crushed against a wall by a car bumper the impact expelling my breath and igniting my adrenaline with an experienced team we probably would have recovered if chisel chin had a few seconds to dangle in space until he forced down his panic and found fresh purchase he could have taken the pressure off the line we could have stabilized and after a minutes shaky breathing we could have started up again but when he dropped past carrot top the second boy jerked in surprise and panicked coming off the wall for no reason at all his wits gone in a blaze of shock he dropped heavily a condemned man through a trapdoor wrenching at me and then hung like a cow both of them swinging and screaming and sawing on me with the weight of four hundred pounds grab something get the weight off me my own panic erupted and all i could see was that picture of kressler and fleming tumbling lazily through empty gray air the two kids were going to pull me off with them and wed spend the last moments of our existence watching each others sick dread as the glacier rushed up at us or we could act grab grab im coming off the cliff they kicked and twirled like the condemned when that life moment of split decision comes you dont think but you react and you react with instincts formed by all the thinking youve done before im a strong man but not strong enough to handle two heavily weighted climbers swinging across the face of a cliff arms and legs flailing rock peeling off everyone roaring and cursing together i can carry myself but not the rest of the world with me so i reached for my knife if id fallen every kid in that class would be dead i knew that i was their only hope in the world the choice wasnt really about my survival but theirs yet i had to think for myself too think of myself i really did it for them i reached with my knife and slashed at the climbing line even as i felt my other forearm being dragged out of its crack in memory there may have been just a moments slackening of tension as one or both of the boys briefly grabbed back onto the rock it was a confused experience and ill never know for sure dont you think ive wondered in the dark sweats of the night but it was too late because i was already cutting desperate to get free of them and finally the rope parted and i slapped back against the cliff making a woof and then below me i heard long terrified screaming i knew better than to look down from the ledge below there were more shouts cries wailing terror as the students two companions flashed past them i ignored it all that part was past me now and there was nothing i could do the surviving kids called to me like a wounded man calls for his mother and i ignored them knowing that there was no second chance that destiny had made its irrevocable turn instead i waited a couple minutes to catch my breath my sweat freezing on my collar and hair i still had presence of mind i took the end of the cut rope and rubbed it against the rough igneous rock for the longest time almost frantic until i had frayed it into ragged string i reached with my knife and put it into a deep crevice on wallace wall where it will never be found i hope then i resumed climbing what else could i do chapter sixteen dana andrews shivered and it wasnt just from cold the shadowy fuel arch gave her the creeps this dank tunnel that stank of petroleum and was so dimly lit accordingly she started down the shadowy steelroofed tunnel that held the stations petroleum supply with exasperated reluctance where the bloody hell was rod cameron since coming upon the stiff reaching hand of harrison adams dana had become more and more of a dome slug clinging to the light and warmth of the galley and berthing floors like a child retreating to a bedroom the winter was not beginning at all like shed hoped thanks to mickeys meteorite the station team seemed rent by suspicions and rivalries two deaths and the increasingly bizarre behavior of mr james buck tyson had smashed through the serenity shed sought like a bus through a window in reaction dana spent what time she could under the grow lights in the station greenhouse helping lena tend the hydroponic plants and trying to fight her own impending depression god it was claustrophobic here her work on polar atmospheric circulation was lagging to the point where she might not gain the tenure at the university of auckland that shed hoped to achieve by wintering at the pole she needed tyson to help her sled and service her instruments pronto but it was impossible to get the mechanic to do anything unless he was ridden by cameron and the station manager had avoided tyson since the two had almost come to blows two days before in the galley it was an ugly situation cameron oscillated between bursts of annoying spunk in which hed radiate false optimism in a pathetic attempt to rally the troops and a private gloom so profound he was becoming reclusive half the time he hid himself in his office and the other half he set off on pointless inspection tours of the tiny world of the dome then it would be up to the winterovers to find him so they could get some work done like now the crazy americans were wrecking her work wrecking her future it was hard being a woman in science and she needed some good data a solid discovery to establish herself some stroke of dumb luck like mickeys rock some commitment to the often mundane and tedious tasks that made up the painstaking minutiae of modern research she needed logistical help and she needed to talk to the station manager alone have it out with him get him to snap out of it their cook who served as unofficial recording secretary of the comings and goings at the base had told her that cameron was checking the fuel that supplied the station the generators suckled off four hundred thousand gallons of imported fuel kept in a chain of tanks in the arch behind nancy hodges biomed the heat was as precious as oxygen periodically cameron or pika walked the tunnel to check the integrity of the valves and pipes as carefully as the hull of a boat the fuel arch represented survival but it also served as an excuse for cameron to disappear hed taken to inspecting it more than necessary rod dana cried out impatiently she was standing on a steel grate catwalk that ran the length of the tunnel looking for some sign of the station manager along the line of tanks the system was new installed two summers before to replace rubberized bladders that nsf had feared were too susceptible to leaks or sabotage and the new metal had the reassuring solidity of a battleship it was also cold her call echoed off the tanks and bounced to the archways far end the wall there lost in darkness there was no reply dana hated the gloom of the arches where cones of light from infrequent bulbs were separated by pockets of deep shadow for a moment she considered returning to the galley and surrendering to a cup of tea but no she needed to get her project firmly on track and that meant talking candidly to cameron in a place where they could have a moments privacy tyson was lurking and wandering around like a perverse moron eating slugs and hogging shower water and boasting he would find the meteorite and make himself rich and hed scared poor gina brindisi half to death by jumping out from behind a shed out on the dark side as if to make a joke out of the common belief he was ready to erupt everyone hated him and hated the water rationing he had perversely imposed on them everyone feared him norse seemed like the only person able to even talk to him but their conversations had little apparent effect tyson was two hundred and fifty pounds of coiled resentment impenetrable to reason and uncaring of consequences there was no sign hed taken heed of the toast dana had tacked to his door the mechanic in fact seemed to enjoy being an outcast cameron had to reestablish control or the base would become dysfunctional it was time for cameron to stand up to tyson time to be a man reluctantly she continued walking down the catwalk her boots making a rhythmic thud that repeated behind as if someone were following her unable to resist she turned no one there rod shed neglected to bring a flashlight and so couldnt see well into the dark crevices between the tanks still she should be able to detect the movement of cameron poking about nothing was he even here dana began walking faster toward the end of the fuel arch impatient to conclude her search and get out cameron dammit where are you there a dark shadow moving ahead hadnt he heard her the figure rose and then sank as she followed her boots rapped quickly rod he didnt reply was the idiot playing hide and seek no there he was again popping up and dipping down a nonsense pattern was he circling around each tank he was going to make her walk all the way she could tell sighing she went on deeper and deeper into the cold gloom she could hear the tinkle of her frozen exhalations crystallizing and falling away behind her bloody silly yank then a thought occurred to her she stopped her blood thumping in her ears and considered her situation again with sudden doubt what if the figure at the end of the archway wasnt cameron at all what if it was somebody like that lewis who always seemed to turn up in the wrong places or tyson growling like a wounded bear here she was alone in this dark spooky place with no weapon no escort nervously she reached inside her parka and pulled out the whistle shed kept since finding harrison adams the fingie lewis standing there with broken heat tape in his hands as if hed snipped it himself shed had nightmares about that one rod her call was quiet but still it echoed away cautiously she moved ahead again waiting for the elusive stranger to reappear there she stopped and he stopped as if freezing my god who was it why wouldnt he approach whos there her weak challenge echoed away you cant run she told herself not if youre going to live here for seven more sinister slogging domeslug months she edged ahead cautious now her whistle in one mitten the figure moved upward and then slipped down and away damn that was unprofessional you didnt duck around like a silly jackinthebox not after all that had happened she was almost to the end and left the illumination of the last light the archway like a receding cave her eyes were adjusting and she could make out dark shapes the tanks sat in their trim mute line these farthest ones already empty and yet she saw no one no movement she stopped perplexed and frightened rod this was weird dana turned to retreat her skin prickling under her parka something was wrong she could sense it and she felt a growing dread at being here it was time to go back to the galley cameron was a lost cause a supervisor who had no business supervising her data could wait global atmospheric circulation could wait shed spend the winter watching bloody videos if she had to and try to pick up the pieces back in auckland she strode back purposefully fighting the impulse to break into a clumsy run and then there he was again somehow having circled around her rising up in front of her in the distance elusive and illformed she stopped he stopped and suddenly it dawned on her my shadow she glanced upward as she passed under each light the shadow of her form appeared and faded on the tanks ahead her elusive fugitive was her own advancing form shed been frightened of herself she laughed the sound sharp and relieved silly goose her heartbeat began to slow her sweat to cool her she shivered again enough of this nonsense back to the galley to hell with tea she was ready for a tumbler of single malt she walked again quickly now her boots banging as if she were on the boardwalk of a pioneer town deciding firmly that her days of searching for her wayward station manager were over enough craziness if cameron wanted some research progress to show for the winter he could damn well start working more effectively with the scientists and if not she stopped again there was something odd about the snow between two of the tanks she realized dana peered closer into the dimness coming this way the shadows cast by the light made apparent what had failed to draw her eye in the opposite direction the snow was heavily trampled sprayed as if kicked there was a geometric regularity down there in the scuffed area she saw a white curve against the dark paint of a tank the curve of a boot a white bunny boot she glanced quickly around no one there rod just leave it send someone else but no theyd think her a girlish fool her pulse racing again she climbed over the railing and down from the catwalk and walked unsteadily toward the boot she could see a leg now its black nylon windpants extending into shadow and then another leg knee up the figure was on its back my god she stopped dizzy with fear why why why was she the one to stumble on these troubles the whole winter was terribly unfair she breathed a moment closing her eyes gathering her courage then she opened them again the snow was blotchy and as she came near she realized that between the tanks it was colored red bright red shaking now she stepped in the gap leaning unsteadily against one of the tanks it was cameron sprawled on his back his parka hood off and his eyes screwed shut with pain hed frozen that way he lay as if on a red disk a platter of congealed blood his parka was soaked with it and a wisp of steam came from a ragged tear in his chest rod hadnt been dead very long feeling her gorge rise she leaned closer it appeared to be the kind of wound a sharp weapon would make something like a knife a big knife camerons mouth was open as if hollering as he went down and so something was stuffed in it as if to cut the noise a cloth perhaps to gag him smother him she knelt reaching but what had seemed like a cloth crumbled in a shockingly familiar manner and trembling she pulled a piece out and backed into the light where she could see what had been crammed down the station managers throat it was a piece of rye toast exactly the same kind she had tacked to buck tysons door dana turned and threw up chapter seventeen the most important thing is to stay calm robert norse was magnificently calm an inspiration a pillar an anchor he was their nucleus and everyone else in the galley an excited buzzing electron the group was threatening to fly apart and the psychologist was the stations magnetic center norse hadnt been voted to leadership in the wake of camerons death and yet hed quietly assumed it with the backing of nancy hodge her own authority established by her brisk nononsense willingness to take charge of the station managers bloody corpse norses accession made a kind of sense as a psychologist he was their odd duck their voyeur but he was also free of the everyday scientific allegiances and rivalries that might have made any other leader unacceptable to at least part of the group he was a beaker and yet he wasnt he conveyed sympathy and yet had a detachment that seemed to make him unflappable now the psychologists eyes swept the room like a hose trying to extinguish the panic that smoldered there it was not just murder but murder within a family there was an incestuous nature to the stabbing that struck at the groups social core tyson by going after their station manager it was if the mechanic had vandalized their church violated their taboos hed struck at the stations head and heart it would be all norse could do to keep the group from lynching him well calm down when that murderous bastard is out of here geller heatedly replied there was a growl of assent fear was close to turning the winterovers into a mob norse held up his hands please i understand your emotion i understand your fear but our choices arent easy we dont have a jail cell we dont have a police force and theres a limit to what we can do we dont have a gun and we dont have a good lock and we dont have a sheriff geller added what weve got is a psycho built like hulk hogan hiding somewhere on station and not even a cap pistol to defend ourselves with were in one hell of a fix doc is there any weapon on station at all norse asked closest we come is the flare gun rod used to try to signal harrison it might hurt if fired into your eye but short of that thats something though lets start with that where is it with the emergency stuff in the fire closet said hank anderson the carpenter who helped coordinate fire teams it aint much well i dont want tyson to have it either can you get it please and deliver it here how about the fire axes geller asked norse shrugged yes lets bring them to the galley too until this is sorted out anderson nodded and left okay norse went on ive contacted the national science foundation about our situation down here and ive asked abby at their request to hold off on other email or communication to the outside world for a while were going to keep this infamily no gabriella protested i want to talk to my friends there was a rolling murmur of support and anxiety nothing was more important than their electronic link the psychologist nodded again he never disagreed youre right communication is what we need above all else thats why were talking now and well reestablish contact to the outside world as soon as we can but this is an explosive situation and people are trying to get a handle on it weve got some circumstantial evidence a volatile mechanic whos disappeared and laws that say hes innocent until proven guilty the folks back in dc need some time to sort this out and consider what our options are he hesitated it was rods idea after adams was found to ask them to send help down like the fbi agents that went into mcmurdo a few years back to pick up that cook who flew off the handle ill confess i talked him out of it as premature i thought it would hurt his career maybe i was wrong but even then it was too late to get a plane to actually land its winter the runway is shut down and the guard crews who fly are long gone its dangerous to fly it makes no sense to risk more lives if theres any other alternative there is no alternative dana andrews shouted yes lets open the damn runway astronomer carl mendoza agreed get out the bulldozers well figure them out without buck plow without buck put flame pots and flares out without buck we have to ship tyson out of here before we lose the whole winter norse kept nodding absolutely were going to look at every possibility but right now nsf is asking us for three things first no panic okay no panic we have to keep a clear head second no yelling to the world over satellite and third no rashness nothing that will stain the reputation of the station in the future think this is what you trained for this is what youre paid for keeping things together keeping it going okay can we lower the temperature here he waited for a response chill out hiro sakura finally said it is easy to do at the south pole there was strained laughter at his thickly accented observation a slight release of tension norse smiled slightly gratified at the help okay now what do we know dana found rods body with a stab wound someone had put toast on bucks door and the same kind of toast was in rods mouth and tysons disappeared it looks bad but that doesnt mean we can be certain hes a murderer bullshit said pulaski were certain hes a slugeating showerhogging workshirking sonofabitch whos deliberately tried to scare the crap out of just about everyone in this room why not a murderer the bastard had it in for rod from the beginning added mendoza he did nothing but complain and threaten we all saw them almost get into a fistfight he had it in for harrison too and he was out the day adams died him and lewis we all know buck carried a chip on his shoulder norse cautioned we dont know he snapped we have mickeys death as well pulaski reminded tyson didnt like him either yes nancy hodge chimed in which could mean that rod learned something about those deaths that the killer didnt want discovered he panics they fight she shrugged it could happen it did happen alexi molotov stood up listen doctor bob i appreciate your efforts to keep things as what you say sensible we are scientists that is how it should be but we have had three deaths three deaths in our tiny group and now this angry mechanic who makes knives is hiding somewhere and we have no weapons and maybe no chance of help from the outside world he looked at them expectantly what are you saying alexi norse asked quietly that we hunt him down before he hunts us like the russian wolf hunt him down string him up geller said only half jokingly first tree we find no we are not executioners molotov said let your authorities investigate when they can but you are right it will not be until spring in the meantime he has to be quarantined confined so the rest of us feel safe like lewis was like lewis still should be dana said lewis wasnt there having been ordered to stay out at clear air for his own safety i dont trust him either hes the one who started all this thats unfair abby said coming to his defense hes just new youre sweet on him ice cream but he gives the rest of us the willies besides where was he when cameron died i heard he was on the squawk box setting up a meeting with our dead leader yes molotov said he radioed we heard it right abby retorted and if he was going to knife him would he broadcast a rendezvous she was angry where were you dana in the arch with the victim as i understand it maybe you killed him and made it look like tyson that is so completely out of bounds enough norse raised his hands enough enough enough lets deal with mr lewis later he stays in clean air until we sort this out how can we sort it out when hes never here to defend himself abby protested norse ignored her we think we have our killer so lets not go off the deep end pointing fingers at others the problem is buck the issue is buck where can we keep him when we catch him thats the problem calhoun spoke up as the other station carpenter he was one of the most familiar with the construction of the station this base has no real locks worthy of the name you can pry apart most of the walls with a can opener the habitable parts he could break out of ill bet we could bolt and weld some kind of coop but how to heat it plumb it feed him jails are complicated how about sticking him out in bedrock suggested geller bedrock village was the nickname of the stations emergency shelter quonset huts called hypertats they were a bright blue cluster several hundred yards from the dome with their own generator put him at a distance like lewis and how do we keep him out there asked calhoun guard him how hes so big youd need at least two of us both men three shifts a day seven days a week come on we cant lock him and we cant guard him and we cant feed him unless we want to spend the rest of the winter just doing that the only practical solution is to ship him out of here robert it was nancy hodge and it was odd to hear her call norse by his formal first name for the first time norse looked mildly exasperated they cant land a plane its too cold anything below minus fiftyfive and the hydraulics freeze up you know that we know were facing the worst emergency this base has ever encountered and we need something done before we all go nuts doctor norse looked annoyed he didnt like criticism from another professional the others shifted uncomfortably theres one other solution of course pulaski said grimly we try him and do to him what he did to rod cameron fuckin a geller said no way linda brown protested wadeher tone was scolding were not executioners we have no legal authority we have no moral authority we do when our lives are at stake the cook said quietly there was no reply pulaski looked dangerous the old soldier sometimes its you or him kill or be killed whoa come on people norse raised his hands again wearily lets not go off the deep end cueball i understand your feelings but try to keep them in check just dont go off by yourself pulaski told the others with a growl not until we find the bastard norse nodded okay good advice stay together stay alert but before we go on a manhunt let me talk to nsf its offhours in dc now but ill call when i can ill stress the dire nature of our situation again maybe they can find a break in the weather to somehow parachute an agent in here there was cautious hope or maybe i can think of something else tyson jerked awake in the dark and sat up banging his head he heard the sound of the grate to the cramped utility tunnel being removed and someone dropping down into his burrow he brought an arm with a knife out of his sleeping bag and extended it toward the entry to his hideaway his wrist betraying an irritating tremble if a mob came for him he was going down fighting but he felt trapped hunted outnumbered doomed that you bob its me the answer came as a relief hed left a note for norse when the commotion started the shrink was the only one hed been able to talk to in this zoo the only one he trusted then hed hid here fearing for his life the psychologist had whispered through the grate that he would come back after a station meeting now it was two am he saw by the illuminated dial of his watch and norse had dropped down into the mansized conduit for wires and pipes that ran from the garage all the way to the fuel arch most station personnel didnt know the utility tube existed and that was buying him time tyson was hoping he could camp there until things cooled down whats the verdict doc norse kept his voice low its not looking good no it wouldnt look good would it hed never exactly been mr popularity with the grab bag of nerds and cretins theyd assembled to endure this insanity tyson could just imagine what kind of a fair hearing hed get from them now hed told them all what he truly thought never a great idea and now it was payback time oneonone he could take any of them but a group would hamstring him like wolves jimmy you are well and truly fucked he told himself should have practiced that shiteating grin it hasnt looked good since i left north dakota he said aloud norse actually chuckled for a second he switched on a small penlight providing them with a beam of illumination and how good could it have looked there its better than its reputation i had room back home the psychologist nodded and thats what you need now room what are they gonna do to me doc nothing if youre not here the two were silent for a moment norse giving time for this statement to sink in he was also waiting with his next question did you do it the psychologist finally asked pointblank hell no that was simple enough norse studied him probably looking for the twitches and ticks that hed been told in shrink school would reveal a liar well let him look as far as tyson was concerned he was trapped in the looniest of loony bins and norse was the asylums big nurse the psychologists professional opinion was worth about as much as the cheap tools they gave tyson that kept snapping in the cold when he dropped the phony psyche bullshit however norse wasnt a bad guy he listened kept in shape looked after himself youre too obvious arent you norse finally said too angry too mouthy so obvious that i dont know if i believe it its the kind of crime that seems blood simple too dumb youre not dumb are you tyson dumb enough to come down here norse smiled that could be said about all of us whats going to happen to me bob the ideal would be to ship you back let people sort this out in the states where emotions are a little less raw the trouble is i dont think theyre going to get a plane down here its cold and its getting colder weve got at least six more months of isolation you want to spend six months in this tunnel i dont want to spend six months in this whole fucking base you know that ive made no secret of it i just want out you and everyone else about now thats right and im as scared as they are i didnt kill nobody im being set up maybe by that fingie lewis all the trouble started when he came the only thing im guilty of is saying what i think they crucify you in this world if you say what you think amen to that its like we talked about doc the importance of selfreliance the fucking duty of selfreliance everyone pays lip service to this touchyfeely group shit but thats only because they hope somebody like me will carry their load do the shit work until you wont do it for them then they turn norse betrayed nothing my concern is that you get a fair hearing well i aint gonna get it here i know so what the fuck do i do now they wont listen to me i cant fight them all i didnt want their bullshit commune and now im the bad guy its because i wont play the game its like that movie where the island kids go crazy that lord thing what was it flies lord of the flies thats what it feels like like im the only sane one is that crazy norse grimaced it may be the only rational reaction to this base my fear is that humans arent meant to be in a place like this so cold so bleak it does things to them physically and mentally we evolved in africa for christs sake coming here is an act of hubris greek hubris the pride that goes before the fall so i sympathize with where youre coming from i admire your insistence on being an individual tyson nodded you gotta keep them away from me doc ive been thinking about your situation norse went on carefully we had a meeting and the mood was ugly i calmed them down for a while but six seven more months i dont know i cant hide you that long i cant keep the others functioning that long not with you tucked down here like a troll a few of them want to try and execute you jesus h christ the mechanic was quietly frightened about your only hope would be another killing while youre locked up taking suspicion off you if youre telling the truth and the killer is someone else otherwise it all points to buck tyson the new totem of evil unfair perhaps i wouldnt be in this hole with you if i thought you truly dangerous but very human so ive come to suggest a longshot chance one you once suggested to me when we were looking for mickey whats that vostok what i think you should seek asylum go to another base winter over and surrender to the american authorities in the spring by that time the situation may have cleared up a bit who knows otherwise its a risk that something might trigger a mob mentality and you find yourself in salem as witch number one you get my meaning yeah but holy shit trying to get to vostok no airplane is going to get in here like a magic carpet the others are fantasizing that theres a chance but there isnt any not really youre going to have to flee overland the closest refuge is the russian base seven hundred miles but its fairly flat going across the polar plateau no crevasses no mountains bad food good vodka and better company than youll find here the rest of the winter its a risk to try to reach it but i dont know what else to offer obviously i think the risk is even higher if you stay here i cant fucking believe this my idea is you take a spryte like you said if anyone can do it alone you can youve trained for survival youre prepared to tough it out and we can survive without one of the machines pull a sled loaded with fuel and food and take along a gps to help you navigate with minimal sleep and decent weather you could reach vostok in several days if you have to hunker down for a storm you can take enough along to survive for a few weeks if the engine doesnt break down you can make it and if it does well youre our best mechanic right me and pika right so we have pika to keep things going here and you keep your spryte going out there tyson groaned but if i completely break down im fucked a couple hours at a hundred below and you go to sleep the meaning was clear there were worse ways to die tyson took a breath considering the stark choice he knew he couldnt stay there will the others let me do it i havent told them im not going to ask them we have to move now fait accompli their disappointment at losing a spryte will be more than mitigated by their relief at losing you thanks im giving it to you straight buck the mechanic nodded glumly a mob or the plateau when you dont have any friends you have to rely on yourself they waited tyson mulling it over if he got a hole in the weather it should be possible he had the skills to earn his way at vostok or we can go face the others in the galley now norse said the mechanic shook his head fuck those bastards they want it to be me thats the problem you can rely on them or rely on yourself tyson hesitated gathering his courage there was a certain hopelessness in his eyes a realization of having made an irrevocable wrong turn then fatalistically im out of here its for the best buck best if you leave soon dont worry about that if im leaving i aint going to let the screen door hit my butt on the way out he unzipped his bag suddenly anxious you gonna help ive taken the liberty of doing that norse backed up removed the grate and crawled out the mechanic followed him they stood in the gloom of the garage looking at the vehicles the spryte is fueled the sled loaded youre ready to go its best to be well away before morning just in case some selfrighteous sheriff gets it in his head to chase after you with a snowmobile agreed tyson looked at him curiously why you helping me doc ive found myself thrust into a curious position of responsibility my profession is people and i know what theyre capable of you ever hear of the swordfish tyson shook his head its classified but word gets around in professional circles nuke sub on a long secret mission under the arctic ice there was a quarrel a popular ensign was killed and there wasnt a chance to surface or return they were sitting off a russian base for christs sake they did a quick courtmartial but there was no brig just like here you know what they did with the offender do i want to know loaded him into a torpedo tube and fired him out he was kicking screaming pleading crying it didnt matter hed made no friends and everyone was around the bend with tension anyway there was hell to pay when they got back of course and a few careers ended but at the time ejecting him into the arctic ocean seemed the right thing to do thats what im worried about here the right thing to do tyson nodded dumbly im gambling on this one buck gambling on you so punch on out of here and hope you make friends with the russkies your boots and parka are in the cab tyson looked at the spryte resignedly determined ill make it what are you going to tell them that i helped you go if i get blamed for it ill tell them you pulled a knife on me adding to my reputation until winters over and the truth comes out i have to live here too tyson stepped up on the treads of the spryte and looked back at norse if i didnt do it who did doc im not sure you didnt do it im just praying it doesnt matter because with you gone and convicted in abstentia any other murderer escapes suspicion which means he has good reason not to strike again chapter eighteen pika taylor always woke first to check the generators and walk the archways surveying their safety it was he who discovered the open garage door and the missing spryte so much snow had blown into the entryway that he couldnt close the bay and had to fetch help to shovel it clear his shouts woke the survivors a group filed into the garage and gaped at the opening and the tread tracks going up its ramp as if it were as miraculous as jesus tomb the temperature in the vehicle shed had plunged coating the workbenches and machinery with a flocking of frost the winterovers worked rapidly to clear the drifting snow melt a rim of ice and shut the bay door against the night then they went outside the darkness was deepening the cloudless sky was beginning to spot with stars and the horizon had only the faintest of blushes the blue there as eerie as the glow of cherenkov radiation in a nuclear fuel rod pool the snow glowed silver there was no wind but it was bitterly cold the tractor and sled tracks steered for the horizon as straight as the wake of an autopilot boat the sprytes message as plain as a telegram tyson was pointed toward vostok station their nemesis had fled his escape was received as deliverance the monster was gone no longer did they have to fear him hold him or prepare the runway to export him their water crisis was solved in an instant his blustering hunt for the meteorite became a bad dream he left behind only the nervous disorientation that follows a nightmare an emotional tingle as barely contained panic gave way to mutual reassurance theyd survived they straddled the tracks in numb relief that norse must have had a role in tysons disappearance was quickly assumed despite the excitement the psychologist didnt emerge from his room to follow them out into the snow and he didnt join in the wildfire of announcement it was as if he already knew what theyd find out there rising later he admitted nothing nor did anyone pronounce it still he hadnt talked to their bosses at the national science foundation and had gone to bed late the night before as if the problem were solved norses equanimity about the mechanics escape told the rest all they needed to know he was calm where rod cameron had visibly battled depression robert norse was their rock i wonder if tyson took the rock geller said happily at a late breakfast working through a celebratory stack of pancakes maybe he found it maybe hes the one who took it all along good riddance if he did calhoun opined forking a sausage maybe hell hock it maybe well meet him years from now on a beach in hawaii tanned and retired still sipping mai tais from mickey mosss meteorite maybe hes smarter than any of us and got doctor bob to help send him to the russians so so it would be ironic if dumb old buck got exactly what he wanted if i survive this freezer and get back to a beach in hawaii to see him do you think ill give a flying fuck alexi geller asked with his mouth full you think vostok will take him the russian shrugged why not he brings his own car maybe his own food even his survival scraps will be better than theirs theyll radio who he is well say a what a defector just so they dont fear him and send him back hell work or hell starve at that base it will be worse for him than jail here and hell find some companions even scarier than he is only the hardcore icemen still survive at vostok the real russians he grinned they chew leather and pound nails with their foreheads the brits up at faraday wear leather and paint their nails dana said and their women are even kinkier shed rediscovered her spirit as soon as she blearily woke to find tyson gone i hear the kiwis nail their women and leather their foreskins geller remarked well the argentines at esperanza calhoun began make fun of the chileans at bernardo ohiggins who tell jokes about the poles at arctowski who long for the chinese food at zhongshan their psychologist interrupted sliding into a seat with a cup of coffee norse had come into the galley quietly its a wonder any work gets done in antarctica at all we were just wishing tyson the worst doctor bob geller explained we figured the russians would give it to him hes given it to himself the plateau at vostok is a half mile higher than the pole the world record low was set there minus degrees norse said it as if the precision gave him pleasure and traveling seven hundred miles is like driving from berlin to moscow hell be doing well to get there without losing his fingers and toes he brought it on himself norse sipped somberly thats the question isnt it what was bucks choice the central conundrum of psychology how much of what we do is free will and how much is genes and conditioning how responsible are we for our actions one hundred fucking percent pulaski said bringing a bottle of syrup from the pantry to replace what geller had depleted if you dont believe that then society doesnt work because nobodys responsible for anything dont give me the behavioralist song and dance tyson was a mean sonofabitch who scared everyone here and deserves every inch of frostbite he gets the feds are going to have a lot to answer for by not taking him back to begin with when he started grousing the pole is no place for malcontents uncle sam better hope rods relatives dont find a good lawyer lawyers now theres a scary bunch said geller i happen to agree with you wade norse told the cook you cant have freedom without accepting free will and all the risk and responsibility that goes with it buck believed that too he just wasnt very adept at fitting his philosophy into a group he was damn antisocial said calhoun he refused to follow but he also refused to lead norse corrected he tried to isolate himself in a place where that was a physical impossibility he had to either change the pole change himself or leave rods death made him realize that and he left that struck abby who was listening as a little too neat youre saying he should have tried to take over im saying that just as the natural world is an evolutionary struggle of species against species society is an intellectual and emotional struggle of ego against ego you conquer or you submit you impose your own will or you labor under someone elses you lead or you follow because lifes a dance mere rebels like buck simply hang or go into exile the psychologist sipped his coffee again i thought the whole point was to work together abby said were a team thats what makes the pole work our working together or not work when you have a malcontent then it boils down to leadership i was hoping rod would come to terms with the need for leadership or at least i was observing his struggle and then there was quiet everyone thinking about the murder you did the right thing to get rid of buck dana finally said there it was out in the open shed said what everyone knew norses mouth twisted wryly not trying to deny it he had a knife but i just gave him a choice and he got rid of himself its not a light thing you know more like banishment in the middle ages back then everything was kin and clan being forced out was being forced into poverty no family no land no equivalent of social security to take you into whatever old age you could manage exile was a kind of death sentence down here with our feudal cluster of bases maybe its not so different dont be so grim doc pulaski said the research stations help each other they dont besiege each other tyson will survive if he can make it im not sure the bastard deserves to survive that is the question yes said molotov will he make it no the real question is how were going to celebrate his leaving said geller i propose a thankgodimstillhere dinner and a polar cocktail contest here here dana said the pig pulaski suggested the what calhoun asked i had one shipped down for our winter solstice party im thinking maybe we need it now you know hawaiian luau what do you think doc good for morale good for my morale yes bring on the mai tais dana said and an initiation session into the three hundred degree club is it cold enough geller asked didnt you feel it this morning she asked breathing out there was like drinking drno the temperatures getting down there the cook agreed well have to get an official reading from lewis out in clean air assuming he gives us the time of day that fingie has been treated pretty rough norse looked at the new zealander you ready to accept jed dana she sighed i dont know when i saw him with that severed cord and harrisons hand reaching through the snow i thought the worst unlike abby here i cant warm up to lewis hes quiet hard to read but yes were down to just twentytwo now bucks escape points to lewiss innocence right lets assume so the psychologist said i dont think they were butch and sundance bonnie and clyde god i didnt even consider if the killer had an accomplice norse looked at her evenly or if tyson was the wrong man she looked uncertain we still dont know for sure do we we never know for sure on anything in a courtroom or down here all the important things in life remain a mystery so your verdict on jed your responsibility your choice your call she glanced at abby bring him in she sighed it was buck or ill go crazy call lewis up cueball norse told their cook find out if were going to get weather severe enough to let we fingies join your club every tribe has its initiation lewis thought this is mine the temperature at clean air had actually registered only ninetyeight degrees below zero but hed promised norse that it would keep on dropping and then altered the thermometer link to the dome to make sure the reading on the galley television screen fell to minus one hundred the slight subterfuge seemed justified after all hed gone through this was his way back into the fold pulaski whod done this once before briefed those who assembled outside the sauna first of all this club short of having walked on the moon may be the most exclusive on the planet he told them youve gotta be at the pole when its a hundred below which means youve got to be here in winter which means youve got to be stupid enough to sign on for eight toasty months of cheerful isolation there was nervous laughter among the group accordingly it may also be the most foolish club on the planet theres some polar plunges into the antarctic ocean at palmer and dips into the frozen lakes near mcmurdo but for sheer idiocy i think we take the cake this is a story you can tell your grandchildren about and if you do theyll have you institutionalized the tittering had an edge to it exhibit one is this temperature gauge he pointed to the dial registering the temperature inside the sauna as you can see our cedar box is crawling upward to two hundred degrees above zero just about enough to let me slowroast some meat thats you he gave his best evil smile the lights glinting off his bald head cueball could look scary when he wanted to exhibit two is your appearance this is the south pole people and you look like you bought tickets to tahiti laughter again thirteen of the twentytwo survivors were bunched outside the sauna door men and women segregating into separate groups all were wrapped in towels had tennis shoes on to protect their feet and clutched balaclavas scarves or gaiters to cover their mouths at the critical moment still there was more bare skin on display than theyd seen for months their bodies looked pasty in the fluorescent light like shelled oysters the clumped flesh was as depersonalizing as a military haircut exhibit three is the goal to endure the heat until it hits the twohundreddegree mark to drop your towels and then to sprint starkraving naked except for shoes and head covering to the south pole marker or as close to it as you care to go given safety and screaming common sense a threehundreddegreedifference shock to the senses for those of you hoping for an erotic experience let me disappoint we dim the lights for privacy and subzero temperatures have a way of diminishing and i do mean diminishing any sexual ardor nature attacks any and all appendages i urge you to listen to your body and retreat prudently we had a case of genital frostbite one year and it was not a pretty sight nipples noses anything that sticks out jesus they got more encouragement at omaha beach geller muttered youre not exactly getting my spirits up thats just what im saying george dont get anything up or dont get it up around me nancy hodge added i shrivel every time i have to see you doc yeah i noticed ooh that hurts the men hooted thats more painful than the cold who does get it up for you nurse nancy if this is an issue for you george theres some new drugs in biomed that might help more moans and laughter okay enough anticipation pulaski interrupted doctor bob can take care of all your freudian problems while youre packed like pringles in the sauna ill open the door to let you out after it hits two hundred move briskly but not recklessly dont fall on the ice and break your leg or anything else if youre on nancys drugs calhoun called pulaski turned to lewis still standing a little apart from the others so fingie you glad we brought you back to share in our secret society lewis managed a grin didnt know what i was missing damn right last night we all set fire to our hair tomorrow is electric shock therapy okay in the sauna go go go get pumped get psyched get hot sweat snarl the night is just beginning they crowded into the dimly lit box with their towels laughing and cracking jokes george youre poking me someone said in a falsetto voice the door closed and there was only dim red light it was initially claustrophobic a mesh of flesh as intimate as a crowded elevator the box was already one hundred and fifty degrees for the first minute or so the heat felt good like an enveloping blanket then it began to seem cloying skin scraped unfamiliarly on skin it was a tangle of bodies hard to make out who was who which sex was which and yet lewis felt the terrycloth press of a breast against one arm long dark hair gabriella he glanced around looking for abby she was on the lower bench looking down again as if lost in thought shed given him a shy glance in the corridor to acknowledge his return from clean air but showed nothing of the flirtatious familiarity hed expected after their kiss camerons death and tysons flight had gotten between them leaving her troubled and remote a shadowy powerfully muscled man probably norse sat behind her this is what sets humans apart from the animals someone said a reckless thirst for experience sweat lewis felt lightheaded there wasnt enough air for this many occupants his skin tingled as his pores opened an almost forgotten experience after the dry cold of the pole his nose filled with the scent of their bodies the perspiration and musk the hot steam of the air heated his lungs in a way the press of the bodies reassured him after the fear that had divided it the community was coming back together the bizarre initiation implied a certain trust an implicit friendship im toassssssting someone wailed like the dissolving witch in the wizard of oz im riiiisssssing geller rumbled dont listen to him nancy hodge assured you couldnt tell the difference with a surveyors transit everyone laughed do you like hot weather lewis it was gabriella whispering in his ear she made him nervous im a moderate no youre not i know about you working for the oil companies always going to extremes thats just where the oil is theres oil in other places too her breath raised the hair on his neck do you like hot weather he was staring at abby but she wouldnt look up she was more embarrassed by this intimacy he guessed i like sensation gabriellas lips were brushing his ear incongruously he thought of the load master shouting into it the day he arrived the tale of the doomed fly gawd im going to suffocate before i freeze someone said almost there pulaski called through the door lewis leaned back pressed against someones body leaned away he was roasting unbearably hot his concern about dropping his towel was fading he wanted release he was looking forward to the cold sweat ran in tributaries down his temples in rivers down his back his belly was sticky with it he wanted to make the pole he wanted to shed his newcomer status gabriella brushed his arm with her own both were slick as if oiled despite himself his pulse quickened at her touch once i read that everyones lonely gabriella whispered that what we want is to fuse with each other lewis tried to joke well were sticky enough he was feeling dizzy that hell is being scattered apart heaven is coming together i thought heaven would have more oxygen he felt drugged that everybody wants reunion she was arousing him he wished shed be quiet that all the parts try to become one he was saved when the door finally swung open the light in the hallway killed to give a measure of privacy there was a gush of cooler air and theyre off pulaski yelled everyone stood jostling like passengers anxious to get off an airplane towels dropped like shadows it was so crowded and dark there was nothing to see people began shoving out the door breaking into an awkward run gabriella moved in front of him her towel slipping away and he got only an impression of curved form lithe and smooth then he was carried with the crowd out the door a jostling of elbows and knees like people squirming through a fire escape they spread out in the corridor darting through the exit and out under the domes interior like a swarm of ghosts everyone was whooping and screaming with fear and excitement lewis felt like he was running on a beach his core so hot he didnt yet feel any cold when they hit the chill of the dome their sweat flashed to steam they ran in a river of fog so dense they couldnt see each others nakedness as they sprinted out past the archways to the exit ramp lewis pulled his gaiter over his head and down around his mouth so his lungs wouldnt burn the lining of his sinuses had already frozen when he burst outside he could feel a further temperature drop it was like hitting a cold pond his breath jerked away he could hardly see he blindly followed the yells and laughter and howls of the others up the ramp and then across the sastrugi drifts toward the pole marker some were already hurrying back the other way he realized stunned by the cold and turning for shelter well before reaching the taxiway it was an act of selfpreservation he had no sense of who was who anymore it was just a shuttle of bodies a scene from a medieval triptych of hell his sweat was freezing on his skin it had crystallized in his hair his fingers were already numb his testicles had shriveled he was grateful it was as dark as it was come on fellow fingie it was norse loping ahead of him as if on an earlymorning jog he could make out the silhouette of the mans powerfully broad shoulders and slim hips the psychologist was built like a greek god fit and vain the steam had left them now and the other runners were gone too they were the only two loping across the runway for the distant stake lewis felt his muscles tightening what if he cramped up out here with the steam gone it was dazzlingly clear glancing around lewis realized it wasnt as dark as hed first thought the structures of the research base were geometric sculptures in sharp starlit relief the dark sector clean air the snowy hump of the summer quonset huts that were winterized now the sky was on fire he realized the aurora australis it shimmered a spangle of colors as hallucinatory as a curtain to another world the pole had never looked so beautiful and for a revelatory moment he grasped the magnificence of being allowed to be here of being given this glimpse of astronomical beauty a rare privilege of time and space and it was killing him lewis was wheezing his lungs ached with cold despite the frostshrouded gaiter over his mouth his energy was evaporating he stumbled almost fell he should turn back he was risking frostbite by staying out so long but there was the polar stake norse had paused at it watching him you can do it jed lewis staggered to the pole and looked back everyone else had disappeared inside the dome looked impossibly far away and he realized hed misjudged this was insane he was naked at a hundred degrees below zero and his sauna warmth was leaking away like a reservoir from a ruptured dam i think im dying he gasped he was looking up at his own ephemeral existence the aurora not yet norse reached out and seized lewiss arm jerking him back in the direction of the dome double time they jogged together their goal rocking in his vision the psychologists hand like a vise you can do it it feels like my shoulders are freezing up i can hear them cracking youve got to sprint man sprint to save your life he seized lewiss hand and the two began awkwardly running flat out nude intimate two earthlings cast off into space barely keeping their balance on the skittering of snow go go they saw pulaski at the crest of the ramp waving them in like an orangeclad angel stars began dancing in lewiss eyes i cant do he fell skidding on powder his chest painfully burning on the firmer packed snow just underneath then he was being pulled up off the snow by one arm the stars swinging crazily and his consciousness dazed norse dragging him forward like a wounded man were almost back the psychologist leaped over the crest of the ramp howling at the cold yanking lewis over its lip with him and then they fell and slid down it together in a tangle scraping their skin again pulaski ran and hauled them up snow stuck to them like flour their skin flushed red we made it cueball norse gasped in triumph made it to the pole now you have to make it inside the cook pushed the pair through the dome door and slammed it shut and they staggered on utterly frozen back under the dome toward the sauna lewis had no memory of the last minute or so across the dusky dome just the wooden door a blast of heat and then falling into the welcoming arms of the others whod crowded back into the sauna before him snatching at towels and coughing and swearing and shouting with victory from the cold that had seared into their lungs three hundred degrees now he was one of them chapter nineteen the pig is on fire repeat the pig is on fire the warning over the galley public address system penetrated a haze of postsauna alcohol and set off an explosion of consternation and amusement pulaski had arranged for an entire pig to be flown down for a midwinter luau planning it to occur at the june winter solstice the darkest time at the pole but by general consensus the darkest time was now with rods death and tysons flight and so hed decided the group needed the pig in order to recover equilibrium and fraternity hed constructed a crude barbecue out of scrap sheet metal and concrete blocks in the archway near the gym fed it with propane and lit it up soon after the disappearance of tyson putting the pig to roast before the three hundred degree club even met as the animal turned their cook deputized assistant pit chefs to check it occasionally after ritually donning a hawaiian shirt now hiro with his heavy japanese accent was delivering an apocalyptic message in his scientific monotone informing them that their luau was in danger of turning into a cremation laughing and hooting several of the men spilled out of the galley with fire extinguishers and flame blankets to rescue their meal pulaski sprinting after them just barely managed to deflect an enthusiastic but illthoughtout blast of halon before it contaminated the meat he smothered the flames in a blanket instead this is our dinner morons then he examined the blackened hide with a jewelers squint no harm done the pig was elevated above the gas flames to keep it above the flash point and the rescuers trooped back to the galley with mission accomplished lewis among them the pungent smell of cooked pork making the men salivate in anticipation the pig has been extinguished pulaski announced the women dutifully applauding this act of male prowess it had taken lewis a full half hour in the sauna to thaw himself from the brutal run coughing uncontrollably for several minutes from the bronchial rape of raw polar air then fifteen minutes more to convince himself that none of his parts public or private were seriously frostbitten he was the last to limp out from the cedar box dehydrated and exhausted and was ready to collapse into bed when others seized him gave him water pushed him into the shower and then told him to join the survival party in the station galley it was a camaraderie he was unaccustomed to now he savored it he saluted the cook along with everyone else hoisting a cup of domebrewed beer the three hundred degree club had purged the group of tension the participants were pink and relieved the veterans welcoming and inclusive and the suspicions and speculation had been for the moment at least erased tyson fled for our sins geller belched a shadow had passed and the polar night had been symbolically rolled back the survivors desperately needed psychic relief and couldnt go anywhere but inside themselves to get it a rock anthem was playing haunting and accumulative as it built in volume a fossilized pulse from planet led zeppelin a world back across the edge cliiiimbing a staiiiirway to hey all the way to the pole man geller gleeful and drunk slapped lewis on the back youre lucky your dick didnt fall off heaaavennnn lewis grinned modestly im not sure it didnt i got so cold im still looking for the damn thing geller laughed check out gabriella dude shell help you find it their gal friday had put on a skirt short and tight a garment more extraordinary at the pole than a bathing suit or sarong she wore a tank top its straps tangled with those of the lacy bra underneath like a dna helix the outfit revealed an upper arm tattooed with a ringlet of flowers her dark hair had been released to cascade down to her shoulders its color matching her black liquid eyes she was beginning to sway by herself in time with the music her hips hypnotic as she did so her look demurely downward but her entire being intensely aware of the attention she was drawing to herself she had a smoky intensity as if she too could burst into flame thats almost scary lewis confessed not after a couple margaritas man carl is mixing up a batch in honor of cinco de mayo youll be ready for her then its not even may yet its any day you want it to be former fingie its luau night mexican independence day the lords birthday and halloween rolled into one were alive my friend the north dakota boogeyman is gone and were all so thoroughly toasted that tonight might as well be the first insane night of the rest of your life cheers brother heeeeehaw the pig was deemed ready by hiros watchdog replacement alexi molotov a group of men went outside again and brought it back slung on a pole chanting as pika kept time to their march by knocking together two pieces of wood the pigs head was still attached mahogany brown shiny and squinting a red rubber ball stuck in its snout in lieu of apples long since eaten the preposterous animal filled half a galley table there was hot fresh bread canned fruit salad yams with brown sugar and pecans mashed potatoes olives baked beans peas and onions cheeses jello chips the other tables had cloths and lit candles and coupled bottles of red and white wine a memorial to the dead had been pinned up near the galley tray table pulaski had posted pictures of mickey moss harrison adams and rod cameron they live on in our memories a small banner read norse was looking at the pictures as if they might reveal something that had eluded him it makes me want to cry said lena jindrova who unconsciously carried with her the perfumed scent of the tomato plants she tended in their greenhouse shed come up beside norse but youre not crying are you the psychologist replied a little coldly she took it as a criticism well i have accepted them not being here does that sound mean it sounds human norse conceded his manner softer do you know what i was told in college she shook her head that society does nothing better than close ranks and move on after the death of its members that thats what society is all about that is awful dont you think or ruthlessly realistic he turned and regarded the others everyone here will be gone someday and the world will go on what will give their lives meaning what they are were she pointed like these three what they learned norse corrected or rather what the world learned from them they feasted and lewis felt as if his own body were on fire electric from survival of murder and cold he shuddered uncontrollably a couple of times as he continued to warm his skin prickling his senses taut even as he felt a deep purging exhaustion his brain was effervescent with its own chemicals he felt high as if hodge had sprinkled some kind of pixiedust drug from biomed on all their food he could hear everything see every color smell every scent the women were all beautiful the men his comrades suddenly overwhelmingly he loved them all ive had too much to drink he scolded himself he poured another glass of wine after the eating they cleared the food and plates some helping with the washing and moved the tables aside the dancing began carl mendoza brought out a slush tub of ice lime tequila and triple sec putting on a cd of salsa music the celebrants yipped and sang dancers bumped and swirled some clumsy some sinuous gabriella writhed abby stood against one wall sipping a drink lewis hadnt talked to her since their kiss at clean air he made his way to her with some difficulty geller stumbled against him badly drunk and linda brown whod skipped the three hundred degree club because shed joined the year before clipped him with her ample hip oops and shake it all about abby smiled stiffly at lewiss approach the exhibitionism of the three hundred degree club had slightly embarrassed her and shed been one of the first to turn around during the run it had been a ritual to get through not an experience to be savored did you like the run he had to half shout above the music she looked at him over the rim of her glass holding it like a bandits mask it reminded me of what they say about jogging it feels so good when it stops i thought i was going to freeze out there i didnt notice the cold at first it was so beautiful then it hurt i wish id stopped with you it was odd to have burst outside naked with this woman he couldnt remember what she looked like he couldnt remember having really even seen her theyd shared it without really sharing it at all you looked half dead when you got back to the sauna i think bob saved your life he hadnt quite thought of it that way but it was true the man had pulled him in sort of hed never heard her call norse just bob before hes holding us together i suppose he is now youre not the fingie anymore youre in the club yes she was looking past him at someone which annoyed him look do you want to dance it brought her back to him all right she put her glass down they moved out into the swaying thicket of bodies the fluorescent lights had been turned off and incandescents warmed the dancers with their yellow glow the bulbs were usually discouraged because their heat could cause a fire so feared at the pole because all water was frozen and all wood was tinder dry acquisition of a regular light bulb was a sign of station rank and moxie the bulbed and bulbless more high school as tyson would say the table candles also allowed tonight because the crowd would keep an eye on them danced in the hum of warm ventilation pika taylor was passing a magazine back and forth in front of a lamp in one corner creating a primitive kind of strobe effect he seemed perfectly content to be their mute automaton it was hot like the sauna musky again animalistic abby began to move her hips undulating turning a slow careful circle shed acquired a new gravity since the deaths of the others and her movements were still too tentative to be entirely silky she seemed lost in thought remote and unobtainable i heard you defended me in front of the others after rods body was found he tried i want to thank you for that just from dana the two women werent fond of each other he knew i liked what happened between us at clean air now that the troubles over i hope we can be friends good friends now that its over there was doubt in her voice and a strange detachment lewis wanted to be enzyme again agent of change but he suspected she was still focused on that mysterious photograph less persuaded than any of them that tyson was the easy answer to it all why had mickey died with her picture near his breast lewis had to break through to her calm her fear everyones come together this is the real start of the winter he told her i hope so she murmured im glad the group wanted me back she looked at him then the old mischief in her eyes just so we could keep an eye on you the jibe made him feel he was getting somewhere thats okay its a relief fitting in what are you fitting into before he could reply a muscular arm landed on his shoulder how you doing sport norse shouted it into his ear warmin up that was some run wasnt it nothing like it what a rush the squeeze of the arm had stopped lewiss modest attempts at dancing it was hey thanks for pulling me through there norse laughed naked as jaybirds dont tell that to my freudian friends abby was eyeing the psychologist shyly at least we had shoes lewis said yes and im even growing back my hair the psychologist smiled his teeth big and perfect running his hand across what was now a crew cut i can almost feel it coming back my strength like samson he hammered his chest with his fist youre doing good with our group lewis congratulated youve held things together but youve got the prettiest partner norse smiled at abby making no move to leave lewis felt dominated by the help hed had to receive the older man had established a hold over him somehow like a big brother he had to counter with his own help cut in if youd like never give an opening as easily as that but the psychologist took abbys arm and lifted it tugging at her wrist and letting her twirl underneath she shrugged at lewis norse moved with catlike grace interposing himself maneuvering her backward i want to talk to you he whispered at her involuntarily lewis had to step back abby was looking up at her new partner with a mixture of expectation and fear a fly to a spider lewis stood momentarily at a loss looking at them dance abby avoided his eye then someone bumped him from behind you can dance with me he turned gabriella had her arms up wrists together her tank top lifting to show a slice of belly as she shimmied laughing her arms squeezed and lifted her breasts revealing her cleavage making her look more naked than when shed been nude weve already sweated together he joked evasively glancing around at abby yes gabriella twirled her hair flying lets do it again they danced she expertly steering him away from the other two and losing them in the shadows pushing suggestively up against him as pikas makeshift strobe provided a peekaboo privacy he felt himself flushing growing hard and he turned slightly so that she might not see or feel it gellers prediction had been right she laughed at him slithering away then coming back her body quivering as she shook it i feel the power of the pole where all lines converge he almost stopped dancing as he watched astonished at her suppleness she laughed again and stopped taking his hand her point made im thirsty from all this sweat buy me a margarita the drinks this night were free to mexico and freedom mendoza slurred as he scooped them two glasses carl you were raised in fresno gabriella said what do you know about mexico i lost my virginity in puerto vallarta he leered or was it modesto she took lewiss hand again and led him to a corner where they sipped and watched abby was still dancing with norse moving more easily now as if shed been cajoled out of her moodiness so lewis and gabriella returned to dance more and then drink more the music and the movement and the talk blurring his partner was losing all inhibition writhing like a snake flashing her thighs and a glimpse of her panties as she moved the music had given her the fluidity of honey lewis glanced desperately about feeling himself shunted to the wrong track he wanted to talk to abby but she and norse had disappeared he was alone with temptation life is good isnt it gabriella asked over the music what being alive and not dead he nodded hypnotized by her body she was grinning at him i feel more alive at the pole he slurred but more dead too she ground against him mocking him not that dead lewis felt embarrassed im getting too drunk ive got to sit down his reentry into the group was going too fast he hadnt sorted out his feelings for everyone sure she took his hand again both their palms moist but not here he thought again about abby she was with norse the man shed said had saved him pictures flickered though his mind of the two dancing talking whispering he felt humiliated by the psychologist dominated irritated somehow hed barged into lewiss life okay they slipped out of the galley module getting a quick blast of cold air under the icicles of the dome it sobered him was she taking him to her room would he regret it if she did no they ran into the heat of the communications building she led him up the steel stairs to the library and glanced inside all clear she pulled him in it was dark the air musty with that faint paperandpaste smell of books there was a couch they bumped against and he jerked to a stop dizzy she kissed him quickly and hard he broke away in the library theres no one here theyre all at the party she kissed him again i like it in places like this what if someone comes i like the danger he glanced around what the hell he kissed her back this time letting his tongue glance off her lips her teeth her tongue he could feel the sting of alcohol there his head reeled with the smell of perfume and perspiration and musk jesus its not good to hold your feelings in it backs up on you her hands were running from his chest to the back of his thighs then it blows up like tyson gabriella i like you but im not sure this is a good idea yet i want you jed i want you to want me he wanted it too even though he felt nothing for this woman it was just that she was a woman her beauty inflamed him she crossed her arms and lifted off her top in an instant and then with a twist of her wrist dropped her skirt the lace of her underwear revealed shadows of her nipples and delta of hair lewis groaned she was pulling at his own longsleeved thermal shirt and he helped pull it off they kissed again and he unfastened her bra it slipped away her nipples like tarnished coins the tips engorged and hard he was just as hard and she pushed against him excitedly then she broke free and turned looking back at him coyly and slowly wiggled her panties down it was dark but he could see light reflected off the curve of her hips a topography of shadow led to the darker mysteries beyond take me on the couch she whispered crawling over the arm of it he thought of abby as he swayed unsteadily she was the one he liked dammit im not ready for this he tried slurring the words gabriella twisted onto her back reached up and snagged the end of his belt tugging her to him her hand brushed his jeans yes you are he let her pull him as if on a bridle he didnt know this woman but he wanted her wanted her badly it had been a long time she reached up to grapple with his pants he was fearful he was going to simply explode she was gorgeous a chocolate candy melting in the dark he felt himself starting to plunge toward the pool of femininity beneath him then there was a gasp he jerked around gabriellas hand still at his belt abby was in the library doorway something bright on her cheeks a tear that glistened in the dim light she looked wildly from lewis to gabriella taking in the moment the other woman looked at the intruder angrily her knees up her thighs parted were busy abby gave a low moan why didnt you wait then she vanished abby there was a hand on his leg forget her jed shes gone but he was jerking away awkward in his drunkenness suddenly frantic to break free of this woman holding his leg he didnt want this damn you take me he pushed gabriellas nude body back down to the couch his hands marveling despite himself at the smoothness of her skin every fiber of his being screaming regret her hands slipped along his forearm as he pulled away and suddenly she looked despairing at his abandonment her act broken her seductiveness punctured her knees pressed together please im sorry dont leave me like this there was a hollow hopelessness i have to go i just want it was a groan she was pleading but hed already lurched out of the room in his bare feet banging down the cold metal stairs and stumbling out the door into the chill of the dome the snow burned his soles like a drowning man straining for breath he whirled around looking for abby nothing frantic he made his way to the berthing building where she slept everything was terribly wrong abby the call echoed down the corridor what did he care what people thought her tried her knob but her door was locked he hammered on its surface abby but if she was behind it she didnt answer his mournful pounding chapter twenty amundsenscott base came awake with a collective hangover wrung out from alcohol the temperature extremes of the three hundred degree club and emotional depletion clouds had moved back in the outside was ink and the temperature rose to eightynine below and settled there norse sent a message to washington dc explaining that tyson had disappeared and that the base was in the process of recovering its emotional equilibrium some of the research would slip for a day or two in his professional opinion the survivors could still endure the winter personal email and satellite telephone messages were still on hold until the group completed its catharsis their mood was fragile they needed time lewis lay awake for most of the night and then fell into an exhausted sleep that lasted until early afternoon he woke feeling wearier than when hed gone to bed and he scratched morosely at the frost of the ice room he supposed that with four people gone from the base he could move to an interior berth but the thought of occupying the space of a dead man seemed ghoulish he sat on his bunk euphoria replaced with depression i have no friends norse had undercut him by pursuing abby abby he had betrayed poor gabriella hed abandoned he dressed and went to the galley dreading meeting either woman fortunately neither was there he ate a few leftovers without appetite his mouth like cotton and then went outside into the dark hoping to assuage his guilt and regret with the rote labor of collecting data the cold was bracing a sharp reminder of where he really was the surroundings were so black that the meteorology building looked like a hovering spacecraft as he approached it he climbed the stairs shed his parka and boots and duly recorded every decimal point a robot on assignment lewis wished he had the control of a robot hed been welcomed into the fold only to drunkenly embarrass himself in front of the person he cared about most now that hed made the club hed become a fool why was connection so difficult hed learned the superficialities like anyone else the hearty hellos the solicitous sympathies the psychological bargaining of favor and position that made up casual friendship it was true communion that eluded him honesty brought a wary reaction and confession seemed regarded as weakness sex seemed the enemy of love lewis had hoped that by coming to the pole hed find an isolated commune in which barriers would shatter a forced encounter group in which the environment would encourage people to share their souls nothing of the sort had happened if anything people seemed to grow thicker shells to protect precious privacy the nicknames were armor signaling the role each had been chosen to play through the false dance of winter if he couldnt make connection with another human being he thought he was going to go crazy well buck old boy its time to find an exxon station the gauge on the spryte still showed a quarter tank of diesel in reserve but tyson had been thinking of refueling for the last twenty miles hed just been putting off getting out in the cold the cabin altimeter showed the plateau had swollen to eleven thousand feet here and the thermometer read one hundred and three below zero inside the machine it was a relatively cozy sixtythree above a cocoon of habitability maintained only by the fullblast roaring of the cabin heater the wind was beginning to pick up too pretty soon it might blow hard enough that hed be fighting ice on the windshield damn it was lonely beyond the pool of his headlights he could see nothing tyson checked his gps again a compass was so useless down here that hed thrown the damn thing away but the satellite readings were faithfully keeping him on track according to his latitude and longitude beamed from space hed come about two hundred miles from the american base and had five hundred to go vostok better than being lynched by a bunch of polar nutcases perhaps but just barely someday they were going to know his innocence someday they were going to find the real killer and wish they had big bad buck tyson around to help bring him down but right now he was out on pluto the underworld hoping hard as hell that he could get back someday to the green hills of earth he knew norse didnt give a shit about him the shrink was just trying to keep the lid on and prevent everyone else from going loco by flushing mr unpopularity away and old buck hed have a right jolly time with the russkies the rest of the winter eating pickled herring and black bread and counting the seconds until he could get out of collapsing commieville get back to clear his name not until you gas up buckyboy he stopped the rig letting the engine idle grunting in the tight cab space he pulled on his parka and ski gloves and face mask and goggles and pulled the lever on the cab door it had frozen shut natch so he had to pop it with a hard butt of his shoulder ow when he stepped down to the metal footrest the cold squeezed him like a frozen lake my balls are going to implode as quickly as he could he slammed the door shut and peered back inside at the cabin thermometer the interior had plunged fifteen degrees from that brief blast of cold air before steadying wouldnt take long to freeze up completely if his dear old diesel stopped chugging well hed babied that mother for weeks now it should tick like a clock tyson dropped to the snow and apprehensively looked around he couldnt see shit the only thing visible was a curtain of kneehigh blowing snow rippling at him out of the dark and zipping on waving goodbye to the lights of the spryte beyond was dark and profound as a cave five six more months of this insanity before the light returned jesus hed been stupid yeah hed needed the money but this place he walked to the sled he towed behind stiff from sitting and awkward from the thick clothes and the cold he involuntarily shrank from theyd used the sled to drag construction materials on base and norse had commandeered it for tysons escape it was loaded with fuel in fivegallon jerricans the mechanic grasped one feeling the cold of its metal even through his gloves and tugged it was like pulling on bedrock everything was frozen to everything else fucking antarctica he trundled back to the spryte and shoved open its toolbox kept marginally warm by its proximity to the engine he took out a ball peen hammer and pointed tire jack and went back to the sled a few whacks broke the outermost container free enough that he could yank it off it took more hammer blows to get the metal screwtop loosened everything clumsy in the cold finally he had it off and a fuel spout screwed on grunting he lifted the can and began emptying its contents into the tracked vehicles gas tank the process was excruciatingly slow at this temperature the fuel was like syrup when the can was empty he unscrewed the spout and heaved the empty container away the garbage would mark his spot like a bobcat pissing on pine needles like that stuff they left on the moon puffing cursing he went back for the next one christ it was cold his lungs were raw his head aching despite the exertion he felt like he was stiffening up he stopped after fifteen gallons and climbed back into the cab to warm up letting the ice on his face mask melt before he ripped it down gasping he sipped some water to battle dehydration cameron had told him once that studies showed everything at the pole took three times longer to do than normal then the asshole asked him to do things three times faster than they reasonably could be done rest in peace you sonofabitch no one deserved a knife in the chest but jeez hed been an ineffectual prick he wondered who murdered him half the base would qualify near as tyson could tell he climbed out again and went back to work the hammer shattered like glass on the eighth can its metal brittle from the incredible cold tyson wearily got a spare from the toolbox and went back to work glug glug glug terrible task but this stuff was his lifeblood without fuel he was a dead man at fortyfive gallons he called it a pit stop the tank was still slightly shy of full but he couldnt take the cold anymore hed drive several more hours nap and fill up again as long as the plateau stayed flat and featureless hed be drinking vodka toasts in a few days until then stay calm stay focused stay alive he climbed back aboard the rumbling spryte tyson gave himself a few minutes to warm up savoring the heat of the cab and finally stopped shivering enough to take off his parka and gloves he gave the engine a couple of experimental blasts with the throttle slipped the vehicle into gear and set out with a lurch the scattering of empty jerricans slipped away behind to be quietly entombed by the snow an hour of dark tedium passed it was like driving a submarine across lightless mud except this was far colder than the deep sea he was right his windshield was beginning to ice up so he turned the defrost higher and beat at the skin with the feeble scritchscratch of the wipers not that there was anything to see then the engine coughed dont scare me like that you cheapass hunk of machinery it coughed again tyson chilled a breakdown out here could be lethal these diesels liked to run until doomsday once you got them warmed up what the hell could be wrong the engine began stuttering as if something were caught in its throat and he goosed the throttle to clear it it roared gagged clattered wildly then as if drowning on its own phlegm it guttered out shit he crawled behind his seat and lifted an access panel there was nothing obviously wrong no smoke the fluids were normal he checked the oil and there was plenty of that too it sounded like there was water or some other contaminant in the fuel had that moron psychologist given him the wrong stuff reluctantly he opened the cab again the wind had risen and although the temperature had climbed ten degrees with it the colds bite was worse than ever tyson was instantly chilled he slammed the door shut and looked longingly back inside again that fifteendegree drop but this time there was no heater blowing to maintain cab temperature even as he watched the mercury continued to slowly descend have to hurry if it was the fuel the two filters should bleed it out maybe they needed to be emptied of water maybe theyd iced up he crawled under the machine with a flashlight to open a panel and check the fuel line muttering imprecations at every mushminded beaker hed ever met norse wouldnt know a carburetor from a camshaft he was sure of it shining the light around he was momentarily puzzled where the devil were the filters it was like hed never seen this machine before then he looked closer and realized the filters had been cut out of the line excised like a bad appendix snip snip the breaks had been bridged by tubing dread realization began to descend well well doctor bob savior of the pole more mechanically savvy than i gave you credit for and with a little tune and lube my judge jury and executioner if he got going again hed turn around and strangle the bastard tyson crawled back out and stood in the wind trying to think he had to not just fix things but fix them fast he had to get that engine going before he froze he boosted himself up on the step and looked back in the cab it was down to forty degrees tyson opened the door fished out some chewing gum from the console and shut it again then he dropped back to the snow his only hope was that the other fuel was good how many cans could the fucker have doped tyson had no tubing to siphon the bad stuff out and no drain hole his only choice was to make his own he opened the toolbox took out a cold chiselnow theres an appropriate name he told himself and placed it against the fuel tank then he swung with a hammer it took a furious set of blows which had the advantage of warming him before he punched a hole through the dented tank diesel began running out onto the snow in a pulse like a cut artery warmed by its proximity to the engine once it hit the snow it congealed what had norse put in it water sugar some weird chemical shit he took out the gum having to painfully bare his hand to unwrap it and stuffed every stick into his mouth chewing furiously then slipping his glove back on he began to break the other cans loose from the sled even if these worked were there enough to get back to amundsenscott would the others help him if he got there cursing clumsy from the cold he got one top off after another the wind kept rising biting at him frantic he left off for a minute to check the fuel tank it was still emptying in a nowsluggish stream he stepped up on the spryte to look at the thermometer inside the cabin eighteen degrees above zero heat was leaching from his survival capsule like gas from a balloon at last the fuel tank emptied the area under the machine was slick with it half frozen a petroleum lake he took the gum from his mouth and wedged it steaming over the hole hed made the gum wrapper went over that shitpoor work but the cold instantly hardened his patch like putty then he began lugging the newly opened cans to the opening and pouring them in diesel spilled on the side of the tank streaming into the snow and he didnt care if he could light the damn diesel hed get warm in a hurry and that sounded almost pleasant right now baby will you light my fire he could hardly feel his damn feet but he couldnt afford a bonfire he needed every drop to get back for a little counseling session with robert norse you saved em all didnt you doctor bob talked to me with sympathy just before you pushed me off the plank so whats going to be your solution when theres another murder and you realize that oops buck tyson didnt do it what happens to your tidy little social theories then at fifteen gallons he left off had to get the engine going before he froze once he had respite with the heater hed dump the rest in thats if the engine started if this crap wasnt as poisoned as the other batch if just once in his pathetic life hed get a single fucking break tyson climbed in the cab and slammed the door it was a relief to be out of the wind but the temperature inside was already close to zero it was like escaping to a meat locker without hesitation he turned the key please please please me it cranked stuttered died he turned it again the cab light dimmed as the engine labored and again duhduhduhduh he looked at the cab thermometer zero even with his body heat the temperature inside was falling like a rock he needed heat and fast it occurred to tyson to use the radio not for rescue there was no possibility of that but just to inform norses many admirers at amundsenscott base just how well and truly the psychologist had fucked over naive dakota farm boy buck tyson wouldnt they like to hear about norses therapy in action of course maybe theyd cheer that their exmechanic was about to turn into usdagrade frozen gee the doc sure took care of that little social problem but they should at least know what their paranoia had led to just to interrupt their slumber at night and so he picked up the radio hello this is your old buddy buck and im about to die click nothing not even static he wormed under the dash all the wires had been cut checkmate jimmy and you cant even flip over the game board can you he flicked off all the lights and turned the key and cranked and cranked and cranked there were a couple pops and snorts just enough to give him a moment of cruel hope but the damned engine wouldnt turn over wouldnt even properly fart finally the batteries died it was quiet and dark he turned on the flashlight kept close to his chest to avoid the cold draining its d cells and took another reading minus eight and still falling going for equilibrium with the great outdoors well this was it then his nowhere life had come to ground in nowhere he began to shiver tyson knew his body would shake only so long then it would be out of energy like the sprytes batteries his core temperature dropping a surrendering drowsiness taking over how many hours of torture before that sleepy relief minutes if he opened his coat which was worse or he could find a match and try to light the mess outdoors a quicker more painful pyre whats it to be bucky fire or ice norse does that fucker have any idea what horror hes inflicted yep doc you saved em all tyson considered trying to think clearly if he didnt burn himself up theyd find him someday maybe piece together enough to determine what had happened maybe even catch that slimy psychologist and make him pay maybe or maybe give norse a medal he slammed open the door letting the last of his heat escape best to get it over with then he closed the cab again and settled deeper into his parka trying by muscle strength to control his shivering he couldnt of course one last peek at the thermometer minus twentyeight and accelerating plunging downward to match the bottomless cold outside even at the bottom of the world solitude can be interrupted by the telephone lewiss at clean air rang with buzzsaw insistence as harshly demanding as a babys cry and his guilt over ignoring camerons calls at the onset of the blizzard made him habitually pick it up now his reverie of isolation watching the lonely ice cap as fire lookouts once held vigil on their mountaintops was shattered lewis here got a minute it was norse im busy doc the reply was sullen the psychologist was the last person he wanted to talk to hed moved in on abby started this mess really and it was beginning to annoy him that norse carried his air of authority of leadership so easily annoy him that hed let the man establish unspoken rank youve been hiding out there ive been working even the weather takes a break data to catch up on there was a pause as norse thought about what to say look i called because i figured you might be sore about the other night abby the party guilty as charged trouble is she isnt attracted to me i guess it caused some trouble we were all drinking too much lewis his pride wounded thought any apology was condescending you can dance with whoever you want we werent a couple as near as i can tell she doesnt like me either thats where youre wrong sport lewis was curious what had led norse to say that and was not about to admit it and dont call me sport or friend or son or buddy or sweetie i dont like the father superior act no offense meant norses voice crackled over the phone just trying to repair the damage why because todays the first day of the rest of our lives the postbuck era remainder of the winter all for one and one for all lewis inwardly frowned knowing hed voiced the same thoughts had abby repeated them to bob look how about a meeting on neutral ground norse went on what do you mean the kitkat club after dinner tonight ive got an idea to help continue patching things back together under the dome theres a bunch of crap out there that people leave behind hobbies toys eccentric gear its stored there might be something good for morale youre recreational director now im just trying to keep the station on keel lewis knew he was sulking ive never even been out there thats the whole point its the stations startover place lewis thought about it fighting with his pride who said i need to start over okay maybe i do norse waited youre a manipulator you know that you manipulate people of course i do any effective person does but that doesnt mean im not your friend im trying to help dammit help what help the winter progress help make up for my own mistakes lewis was mad at norse because he was still mad at himself so why did you take her away at the party there was a long silence look i said i fucked up okay i cut in on you i came on to abby i was feeling cocky that people were turning to me and high that tyson had split i was drunk conceded but it was a game to me and abby saw through that and she shot me down she told me she liked you i should have known better i did know better and i woke up hungover like everyone else and not feeling too good about myself so now im trying to move on from here lewis was silent he was jealous of this man trying to hold things together jealous of norses glib rationalizations grow up he told himself hes trying to apologize im a shrink and ive wound up as temporary de facto point man okay boss lewis thought thats not a recipe for popularity and i feel pressure like anyone else norse continued but we need each other and we need to get through the winter together i think abby really cares about you jed she knows that other thing with gabriella she knows that was bullshit so give me a chance to fix things manipulate like you said thats not always a bad thing lewis sighed i just feel this whole winter ive been jerked around with the meteorite and everything else im tired of it this isnt easy for me either you know if you havent guessed yet ive got quite an ego when push came to shove she chose you that stung but you me her all of us getting back together is the right thing to do the right thing im losing my bearings on that one doc norse laughed at himself okay the best plan i have at the time there was a click as he hung up the phone chapter twentyone the kitkat club was a twostory plywood balloonlaunching shack obsolete and abandoned that an enterprising station carpenter had remodeled in his spare time into what he had jokingly proclaimed as a penthouse pad of pleasure actually it was the top floor that had been turned into an unofficial storage attic for base personnel crammed with castoff junk the bottom had been insulated carpeted papered with travel posters and heated while it was just three hundred yards from the dome the building named for the decadent nightclub in cabaret had become a place of physical and psychological separation and escape the one refuge that didnt have a job attached to it neutral ground norse had called it when its carpentercreator left after one season his shack became a place for parties sexual trysts verbal showdowns and therapeutic solitude station managers like cameron diplomatically ignored its existence because of its value as a pressure relief valve fingies were introduced to it after station and social acceptance it was a perk like visiting the abandoned base winterovers thought of the kitkat club like the pole itself as theirs when lewis arrived norse wasnt there he flicked on the lights to look around while he waited small windows had been shuttered for the winter but smuggled incandescent bulbs behind a screen of colored paper violating all fire safety regulations gave the room a warm glow there were two surplus single mattresses covered with unzipped nylon sleeping bags a ratty and torn couch surplused from the dome crates and a cable spool that had been liberated for tables and makeshift shelves that held drifts of dogeared books tolkien and grisham shackleton and byrd a hot plate an espresso maker a small fridge an old boom box and a shoal of cds the walls were a mosaic of posters clippings cartoons and bumper stickers he who dies with the most toys wins it seemed unintentionally macabre after what had happened maybe the psychologist would put him on the couch he felt like he needed it about now he heard the crunch of snow outside and considered again what he wanted some kind of equality he decided some kind of mutual respect an acceptance of who he was and an end to norses incessant observation the shrinks real problem was that he didnt have enough real work to do and so dwelled on everybody else with so many lost they needed a reallocation hello it was abby outside the door sounding uncertain just her voice was enough to get his heart to slip sideways off its track surprised by both her presence and the strength of his own reaction lewis opened the latch she was startled its you she said blinking what are you doing here he replied great beginning she glanced past him to see if anyone else was inside bob of course it was always bob wasnt it come on in he said gruffly were letting out the heat it was too cold for indecision she stepped inside and he shut the door abby took a deep breath letting warmth settle back inside her lungs and then looked at him warily i didnt know youd be out here i think we were set up by norse he sent us on the same mission mission to find some toys right i thought he was coming out too but meet on neutral ground norse had suggested he hadnt said with whom quite the matchmaker look i didnt plan this but im glad you came out really im surprised but please dont go somehow he had to make things right she remembered she was angry about gabriella if bob did this then im mad at him too please he lifted his arms to take her parka its a long winter his conciliatory tone softened her hesitantly she let it slip off i thought i was meeting him lewis explained hanging her coat on a peg but maybe not if he sent you too he said its all for station morale she looked cautious i dont know whether to believe you really hes playing with us both were just another experiment which im fed up with i dont need his help or yours thats what i said except except what except maybe we should start over here on new ground you thought or doctor bob thought abby i got drunk and screwed up the other night thats not an excuse but it wasnt what i wanted to happen i wanted things to happen with you im frustrated frustrated at how things havent gone as i planned frustrated at myself it was apology enough to get her to reluctantly sit let him help her shuck off her snowy boots and with that concede that she wasnt immediately leaving were all frustrated jed she admitted its been a hell of a winter yes so now that the bad stuff is over lets have a truce okay what about her shed be damned if shed say the name there is no her thats the whole point i ran after you didnt you hear me she glanced away letting her eyes roam the room i havent even seen her lewis added i think shes embarrassed too well abby was looking for a way to answer without answering welcome to the club then if weve both been sent here by our group therapist her voice was quiet resigned he smiled they were going to talk at least in a general way how many clubs does this place have anyway she considered the light question seriously the entire pole is a club i guess sos antarctica the science community itself this is a subbranch half hippie hideaway half slumber party its not architectural digest i think of it as a den or burrow she allowed a slight smile ive always liked it if anything ever goes wrong ive thought this is where id come to wait for the end she meant the generator but he had to laugh if anything ever goes wrong you should have camped out here weeks ago you know what i mean yeah its cozy and hot how high did you crank the heat anyway enough to get the rest of your stuff off she looked at him skeptically and he grinned its part of my plan make it a sauna and watch em strip works with all the girls abby snorted at that joke and shed her nylon bib overalls keeping on the fleece pants and vest underneath he enjoyed a glimpse of her stretching and bending even while pretending to politely glance around elsewhere men called her ice cream because they wanted her to melt yet while abby was attractive she didnt make him uncomfortable the way gabriella did somehow her presence made him content like the beauty of a flower she hung up the overalls next to her parka water from her boots pooling on the plywood by the door why would it matter where you waited he asked her id want to die at home jesus lets not be morbid how can we not she meant the deaths the makeshift graves its been hard hasnt it he said nothing like what i hoped but its over i think so we should be friends again weve never not been friends you can be angry at a friend and still be friends so youre still mad she sighed her look one of exasperation but an exasperation as much at herself as him yes but i dont have an excuse for my anger no claim to you i mean i know that i admit that im trying to be honest about things ive been thinking a lot about whats going on and and im not doing very well handling it alone we do have doctor bob it was meant as a kind of joke but his frustration was portrayed in a sarcastic tone that popped out before he could control it are you jealous jed it took him a moment to admit the truth yes hes smooth i pulled away from you because i was afraid how i felt about you not bob i dont have the same feeling about norse hes too smooth and thats what ive been thinking about now lewis was curious maybe wed better sit more comfortably she nodded pointing him to the torn couch he sat sinking in a squeal of springs instead of sitting next to him she plopped crosslegged down on one of the mattresses facing him have you noticed whats been going on she began the dying she shook her head the pole what it feels like here cold it was flippant an attempt to lighten things no our perspective were so low to the ground that we cant see very far its almost like treading water and then as the sun set the horizon kind of shrank in on us we went from seeing little to seeing almost nothing on the really dark nights step beyond the lights and you step into a void its like were floating which in a sense is true since were on this ice and at the same time the sky is so clear were not just looking at the atmosphere but beyond it out to the universe its exactly as if weve blasted into space doctor bob again she shook her head his focus is on the compound the way all us little bits glue together or fall apart hes a social scientist studying a spaceship but to me were individual atoms after a big bang flying away from each other while maintaining this faint gravity thats how the station makes me feel anyway maybe its that all these people here are too close physically and so as the winter closes in it forces you deeper inside yourself just to get away if youre not careful the pole starts to take you over like the monster in the thing except its the pole itself your sleep cycle your appetite your hormones your periods your energy your habits everything begins to slide out of whack when the sun leaves and the more you try to run after yourself the more you seem to fall into yourself leaving everyone else behind do you know what i mean sort of its isolating we know each other but we dont know each other because if we all admitted what were feeling it would create this kind of psychic whirlpool which might suck us all down so were wary but some people reach out you bob even gabriella but not you she took a breath hesitating then plunged ahead a woman learns to be cautious with men guys want to pretend everything doesnt matter but it does this thing with my picture baffles me you baffle me that a geologist would really want to go to the pole its like a biologist going to the moon so i chickened out im not afraid of relationships but im a little afraid of you i know another guy too i told you that but i wasnt ready to commit to him either i came down to think things through i respect that abby it was escape but its not working out as i planned these deaths havent exactly created a retreat atmosphere im just trying to explain that i havent been trying to be a jerk even if it seems like it i like you and because of that im afraid of getting hurt im not teasing im just incompetent she looked defeated abby everyones incompetent its a fact of life she looked at him hopefully do you think so at that stuff they are look at the gossip columns about the rich and famous its one constant litany of incompetence the more confident they act the more frightened they feel she smiled i dont know if i believe that if thats true then norse must be very frightened indeed ive never seen anyone so confident under such pressure i think thats because its good for his damn study or hes rising to the occasion he thinks thats what the best people do and i admit hes got a weird charm i dont really blame you for leaving with him at the dance i dont have a claim to you either we just never seem to get very far theres just been too much going on too much pressure bob and i talked about that picture of mickeys hes easy to confide in a talker a professional charismatic even he invited me to take a bottle of wine and to go talk so we did but then he came on to me youre an attractive woman abby i wasnt offended i didnt think it was some breach of professional ethics its not like im in therapy but when he began touching me i stiffened up no matter how hard i tried not to and this terror this irrational terror took over i broke away and he accused me of being dishonest with him and myself and i saw something she shivered suddenly he looked very analytical it was so dispassionate he frightened me like his warmth is a disguise for his cold so i left looking for you but youd left the dance too and then i found you she looked hopeless i pushed you away we both screwed up yes we wound up with the wrong partners yes so forget about it its over this is the first day of the rest of whatever it amused him to quote doctor bob she looked depressed youre so much better at getting over things than i am all men are thats not really true you function compartmentalize i cant even function women get paralyzed men go out and do something stupid start wars and things im not sure ones better than the other abby grinned ruefully i guess what im admitting is that i would like to kind of start over now that the bad stuff is past or at least i hope it is that id like to know you just so i can tell myself i know somebody on station in some kind of meaningful way he looked at her with hope cant you sense how alike we are im incompetent too i got into rocks because they were as unlike people as anything i could find then i joined this industry that seemed to be just about money disposable conscience and transience nobody belonged anywhere it was all just oil ruthless competition so then i ran away from that i ran here to the pole to become the fingie the outsider if buck tyson hadnt run away id have gone nuts from being ostracized his disappearance saved my winter lewis studied her trying to decide what to do he wanted to kiss her again but feared it would drive her away he wanted to take her in his arms and feared shed evaporate if he did that too can we make it through her voice held doubt that analytical hardness you saw in bob norse isnt entirely a bad thing hes held things together by staying levelheaded hes trying to prove we can all sail to the stars i was bad to him too abby did it ever occur to you that you werent bad to anybody that its your prerogative to have doubts to say no to change your mind she shook her head no youre supposed to be nice youre supposed to be honest youre supposed to be some mix of those two things and thats where i always foul up she flopped backward on the mattress her hands over her eyes i know i make things harder than they are he laughed at her ill say she lay there her hands over her eyes her legs stretched out and stiff her chest rising and falling he slid off the couch and knelt beside her she didnt move he bent admiring the sculpture of her ear the barest down on her cheek wondering if he had the right to kiss her again after what had happened still she didnt move so he kissed her lightly brushing her lips she slid her hands down to cover her mouth her eyes watching him with deep seriousness but without surprise then she reached up to put her arms around his neck pulling him down to her and kissed him again fully this time it was sweeter than with gabriella less wanton and more affectionate softer he held her going again to her cheek and neck and she cuddled into him shivering slightly as he nuzzled her he was content for the moment to just hold her his fingers on the fine bones of her back ivory on a piano they lay quietly for several minutes finally she spoke what are we doing down here jed he was drowsy in her heat and embrace trying to understand the universe he mumbled thats what mickey moss said buck tyson argued for realism he said everything but the paycheck is a pose to come so far she sounded doubtful to a place this bitter were adventurers abby people are driven no she shifted restlessly we misplaced something and weve come down here to find it we came down here to take it back home our real home misplaced what hope that we can make things right again he lifted on one elbow looking at her lazily more contented at her quiet intimacy than hed have guessed more contented than at any time since hed come to antarctica make things right how by finding the best in ourselves he grinned im starting to find the best in you lets explore some more she considered then rolled away no not yet not now he fell on his back the picture of rejection forget what i said about the honest part go back to nice lets make sure we truly like each other first she was too shy to say love now theres the difference between men and women she laughed ruefully at herself i am a complete tease arent i no but im not sure you recognize how attractive you are the effect you can have on men thats sweet ill remember that so let me kiss you again no she held out her hand to pull him up come on enzyme weve started over and well see how things go doctor bob sent us for a reason dang he looked wistfully at the mattress people store stuff upstairs oddball stuff that theyve smuggled down and then dont want to bother taking back musical instruments obsolete stereos leftover hobby kits ancient laptops even a foosball set our mission is to bring back something fun even if its other peoples stuff it becomes our stuff when we sign on like an inheritance we share it like santa claus maybe were anticlaus since were at the south pole gathering data is fine but weve got to have something more at the end of the day right thats what our shrink said bring it back to the others become the waltons or little house on the prairie oh yuck he looked around instead of hauling stuff out of the attic maybe we should just have a party out here not a scientific instrument in sight its too small to fit everybody and we need everybody right now we need to lighten up the galley ive still got a hangover from the last party he looked at a ladder that led to a trapdoor and shook his head it reminded him uncomfortably of the entrance to the underground base its got to be freezing cold up there abby lets pass for now and just go back to what we were doing no well never get to it she stood ill go first she marched to the ladder and pushed up on the trapdoor letting it fall over and bang down with a thud on the plywood floor above light from below gave a pillar of pale upward illumination but the room jammed with junk was mostly shadow i need a flashlight youre letting in the cold lewis grumbled feeling the draft he went to his parka to get a light abby glanced around as he fetched it letting her eyes adjust it was fun like peeking into santas workshop there were boxes a guitar case an improbable singlespeed bicycle old skis and snowshoes skates and a runner sled what could they bring back for the others there was a trombone that might be fun in one corner something white and shapeless hung like an old dress moving slightly in the column of warm air that was wafting up from below next was a broken universal gym a driving wood an unstrung racket it was bitterly cold in the unheated upper floor a deep freeze as effective as a time capsule frost spotted the boxes but there was no rust no decay it was too dry then abby realized what shed seen shadows can confuse the minds eye sometimes one sees what isnt there sometimes one misses what is her head was turning back her brain reassembling the patterns even as lewis handed up the flashlight it was with growing dread that she suddenly swung back to that white form in the corner it had feet she turned the flashlight beam on and jerked so violently she almost dropped it then screamed oh my god what what lewis shouted from below he was climbing up next to her trying to get past her her blood was a roar in her ears her vision dazed she forced herself to play the light across what was hanging there the body was ghostwhite all right the head tilted the tongue purple everything waxy and elongated and sad abby what the hell it isnt over what isnt over the bad stuff she forced herself to look sickened the toes were small and pointed down like the broken wings of a bird jammed in next to her lewis took the flashlight and aimed it the face that stared back at him had been made hideous by strangulation completely transformed by a cruel death a naked and forlorn gabriella reid hung limply from a ceiling crossbeam turning slowly in the current of warmer air ah jesus he finally forced his way past abby and stepped up onto the floor the body was frozen by now a noose around its neck he approached it cautiously suicide no of course not there was a sign around her neck he played the light across it reading block letters that had been cut and pasted from a magazine like a ransom note you know who you are you know what i want give it or everyone will die i go for help by the time i topped the cliff the visibility on the mountain was down to a hundred yards i could no longer hear the wailing of the kids on the ledge which was a considerable relief and instead the only sound was the stutter of my clothing as the wind blew over the saddle the ripple of fabric was welcoming reminding me that i was alive alive and off that damned wall because id acted for myself snow was falling heavily which meant avalanches were likely sometime soon i had to get over the hump and down the glacier as quickly as possible i had to get a rescue team back up to the rest of the class before it was too late i had to refine my story so i untied the rope and put it in my pack it would raise too many questions to abandon it and answer some if i could point to its frayed break you have to understand that i no longer had any means to haul up the others i had no choice but to walk out on my own i had to hurry the storm was getting worse i made good time freedom without a team of blundering neophytes in harness i felt release i was tired but electrified with adrenaline my thighs chugging like pistons and my torso warm from their burn i made the crest of the saddle in nearwhiteout conditions acutely aware that it would be easy to repeat the blunder of fat boy and go down the slope in the wrong direction but id been up the main route several times and i felt an uncanny sense of direction maybe i was being directed maybe all of this was fate maybe fat boy was some kind of agent of my own destiny or maybe i was simply the victim of blind bad luck saved from hideous misfortune by my own skill and fortitude maybe and this is what i really felt as i stood on the shoulder of that white volcano with snow swirling around me i had been granted a revelation an understanding of how the universe really operates all is cruelty except whatever you can draw from yourself theres nothing outside no angel of mercy the goal of life its test its meaning is survival itself and survival is a lonely thing harsh merciless and the direction of any herd of sheep is set by the few individuals who recognize this cold reality and set a sensible direction most people are carried the victims of mass delusion the visionaries carry them and if some lambs are lost along the way well its no loss is it it weeds and strengthens the remainder what had just occurred on wallace wall was an act of natural selection i was its evolved product i chose my direction and prepared to glissade it was as if i could see through the snow so certain was i of my direction id never felt so powerful i sat on the steep slope my ice ax ready as a brake and began to buttskid down the mountain flashing down in seconds the elevation it had taken us long painful minutes to slog up only hours before i was exhilarated ecstatic i was alive forged in the fire and newly capable of seeing through the bullshit of existence i was reborn really born again as they say i felt the breath of an uncaring implacable divinity as i careened down the glacier the breath of a monster i had bested snow stinging my face like a joyous shower and i dropped through the clouds until i popped out of their lower reaches and could see a good mile or more down the glacier the smudge of the first dark trees far below me id escaped the dark god the glacial slope began to bottom out and my easy ride came to an end i stood a bit unsteady from the emotion of the last hours and began to walk our tracks were gone erased by the new snow but i swear i could have found my way in an unfamiliar cavern it was as if i could see through the fog id been purged of fear and doubt i had direction i got off the ice and removed my crampons descended down the snowy moraine to the tree line and then into the trees to the cabin where wed spent those few hours of uneasy rest before the midnight climb the walking was gray and ghostly under the trees quieter away from the wind and in the stillness i began to imagine shapes behind the shrouded firs as if someone were watching me no one was of course still i hurried mindful of those kids stuck up on the ledge mindful of how this must all play out i got to the university van found the key where its magnet case stuck it to a wheel well and unlocked the frozen door my pack inside the scraper out my mittened hands brushing the snow from the windows i climbed onto the cold vinyl pumped the accelerator got the engine to turn over and waited a few minutes while the vehicle warmed as i sat there it occurred to me i might need tire chains in the storm and rooted in the back until i found them and began putting them on the engine exhaust was choking me and so i had to stop to shut the van off again and then went back to the chains i wasnt very practiced and i was cold and tired and had to take a moment for a candy bar and some water so it took me a while i checked my watch fortyseven minutes there might be questions about things like that later on so it was smart to know i couldnt be too precise however or id sound too calculated then i started the van again put it in gear and began driving down the mountain the snow was slippery and deep and i had to go slow at first being all alone i couldnt risk going into a tree at the junction with the main forest service road the snow was turning to wet slush and mud and the chains were clanking i stopped the van and took them off eleven minutes i hurried i hurried smeared myself with mud making me look like id crawled through the trenches and then back in the van and down toward the main highway they asked me later about a cell phone but it went over in flemings pack i had to get down to a telephone astonishingly it was only nine in the morning with the storm and season there was no mountain traffic i had the roads to myself until i got down to the mountain highway the first telephone i could find was at beedles store which wasnt even open the phone was in a weather hood but otherwise open wet and cold and i remember the chill of its plastic and metal as i dialed to report what had happened i have no idea what i sounded like except that a dispatcher reported afterward that i sounded like hell kind of numb she said shellshocked incoherent still i conveyed the emergency the tragedy the plan was to meet the assembling search and rescue team at the forest service headquarters eight miles down the road i drove there and was welcomed with alarm and concern what followed was long and grim i was too exhausted to go back up the mountain but i knew the terrain well enough to pinpoint to the experts where the rest of the class was i explained the fall of the other two instructors my decision to climb out alone to get help our heroic efforts to rescue fat boy and so on i neglected to mention the fall of the other two kids i was distraught anxious demanding all the things i imagined i was supposed to be it took until noon to get a team assembled another hour to get them to the trailhead another hour up to the cabin and still the snow was falling i made it to the cabin with them before collapsing they went on up themselves trudging up the glacier but stopped at four pm as they neared the cirque below the saddle and heard avalanches rumbling in the clouds like the crack and thunder of artillery one slide came down out of the mist and erased the tracks where theyd just been it was getting dark and still snowing heavily and if they pushed on theyd risk an even greater disaster prudently they retreated when they came back down i refused to leave the cabin for the comfort of a room down below those were my kids those were my kids i would spend a second night the storm blew through during the dark hours and when the rasping trees began to hush i finally fell into what i pretended was a troubled sleep they left me alone the rescuers started up again at dawn and a helicopter was launched at the same time i sat up and managed to get down some coffee everyone was somber hope was slim two reporters hiked up to us as we waited and i haltingly went over the story again how fleming had let fat boy wander off in the wrong direction and wed done our best to rescue him and id been left to go for help i covered for the other two instructors as best i could giving them the benefit of the doubt mourning their loss but the resulting stories painted me in a pretty sympathetic light by god id done my best i was haggard with sorrow distraught exhausted the helicopter report came in an hour later avalanches were still spilling down wallace wall rinsing it clean the pilots orbited the area for miles in all directions the ledge was empty fat boy and all the others were gone chapter twentytwo the winterovers gathered in the galley like a convocation of the damned their faces revealing the underbelly of the human psyche dread anger suspicion depression their illusions about escape had been buried with gabriellas body her snowy grave marked by another bleak cross of black plastic pipe it was months before the winter was over and already everyone looked like toast several staff members had come in carrying makeshift weapons lengths of pipe knives an improbable hickoryhandled hatchet brought down for some longforgotten purpose pulaski arrived with a sixfoot length of galvanized water pipe that hed sawed off at a sharp angle to make the point of a spear in a society with no guarantee of safety people were arming themselves as best they could robert norse had looked the night before like a faithshaken priest his shell of infectious confidence cracked by the discovery of gabriellas body the news of her death left him haggard his eyes sunken and hed refused to help take down the forlorn corpse i cant deal with the rest if i have to do that hed said his voice hollow at the news of her death i have to function one of us has to function so the dead woman had been laid to rest with no ceremony her cross the fourth in a row the gravediggers chilled and spooked and anxious to finish the task and get back inside to the light and warmth of the dome whoever had hanged gabriella might be lurking somewhere out there in the dark of the plateau waiting for the next one to pick off by the following day however norse had collected himself the disquieting breach in his calm had been repaired in fact he seemed newly confident newly knowledgeable and he came around the tables to tell them all to stay after supper it was important that they all talk he said important that they use this to grow stronger important that he find strength to feed theirs so they stayed when he stood up to speak it was so quiet they could hear the drone of the ventilation and the burble of the drink dispenser their ranks were visibly thinner it was awful how small their gathering looked im afraid i have some more disturbing news norse began you could hear the sound of their breathing ive radioed the russian base at vostok theres no sign of buck tyson he never arrived we have no idea where he is there was a long despairing quiet dont we geller asked dana andrews gave a low moan we cant assume anything norse looked at them soberly anything we dont know its buck and somehow until we come through this weve got to combat panic panic will kill us faster than anything distrust will kill us paranoia will kill us i think were going to have to reach inside ourselves and find the core of whats there this is a test a test of what were made of cut the psychobabble doc geller replied im panicked and distrustful and paranoid as hell im freakin ready to jump out of my skin and im freakin ready to call it quits for this winter i didnt sign on for the chainsaw massacre i want to get out of here before that north dakota madman annihilates us all there was a buzz of assent if thered been anywhere to run to theyd have bolted gellers complaint focused the psychologist on him norse looked resolute you cut the fantasy george were not going home we cant go home this is home for six or seven more months you know that so we just go about our little datacollection duties waiting for tyson to pick us off one by one mendoza asked since the discovery of gabriellas body hed refused to hike out to the dark sector to continue his research the other studies were also on hold the plants in the greenhouse were yellowing lena too morose to tend to them their routine was breaking down why are you so sure its tyson norse replied that startled them they looked at the psychologist uneasily i was never certain myself i sent him away for his own safety as well as ours he could still be traveling his radio could be broken he could have gotten lost and died but coming back here to prey on us seems particularly risky wheres his spryte where is he surviving does tyson really make sense the survivors looked at each other who then hiro sakura asked my bet is lewis alexi molotov spoke up abby turned to glare at him goddammit lewis groaned yet when he looked around the room for support everyone except abby shifted uneasily pulaski was staring resolutely away the butt of his new spear on the floor lewis had a sense of foreboding something wasnt right lewis molotov insisted who just happens to find all the dead who can never account for his whereabouts who started all this when he came down here who was going to meet rod when our station manager was knifed who has some kind of fallingout with poor gabriella who knows everything about this mysterious meteorite if i was the killer would i lead the way to my own victims lewis retorted yes because you know where they are i didnt find cameron dana did and im tired of being suspected just because im the newest suspect doctor bob hes almost as new as i am molotov shrugged he didnt come for the meteorite that doesnt make me a killer maybe you are innocent but you do not belong here because you do not really fit a geologist doing weather it is absurd you are not even a real scientist you are an oilman a prospector a fortuneseeker you should go go find tyson go to vostok go and try to get to mcmurdo just get out of here before our little group shrinks down to nothing he glanced around do you realize we have lost five people go how asked hank anderson the carpenter i aint giving him the last spryte i would dana said hold up here lets not run ahead too fast norse cautioned no more sprytes no more disappearances we need to consider things slowly rationally was jed the one who led us to gabriellas body he put the question to abby she looked uneasy i found it you know i was going to the attic to find some stuff to entertain us and jed didnt she looked suddenly confused remembering his reluctance in going up the ladder did lewis pick the kitkat club to meet dana asked no abby said looking at norse bob did thats right norse agreed i suggested to jed and abby separately that they go out there i was trying to bring them back together i wanted to give them a chance to talk on neutral ground lewis was grateful for the candor so it wasnt jeds choice to go there at all dana clarified which means he could be the killer geller reassessed wildly he put the body there before bob suggested he go there george norse began wearily jed didnt kill gabriella abby insisted im certain hes incapable of murdering anyone how do you know that molotov replied are you listening to your head or your heart i saw how shocked he was when we found the body maybe you remember good acting what about that sign geller interrupted that sign around her neck you know what i want what does that mean it means somebodys got the milliondollar rock and should put it out where tyson or lewis or whoever can get it and leave us alone mendoza said it means somebody in this room can end this cried dana she jumped up looking at them wildly you know who you are who is it then who knows what he wants for the love of god lets stop this insanity and give it to him maybe its you dana said steve calhoun just to quiet her down and maybe its you steve a babble of voices erupted angry and afraid people began pointing norse watched them evenly and lewis wondered what the psychologist was thinking watching his little laboratory of rats it was norse who directed them to the attic and yet norse had made no secret of it and had seemed more disturbed than anyone more surprised than anyone where was he going with this meeting what was robert norse really down here for the psychologist held up his hand until the group quieted science people he suggested our enemy is unfounded fear and suspicion and our ally is science science just like its been for our kind since the ancient greeks rationality right isnt that what you represent so were going to be rational were going to beat this with rationality doc this whole situation is completely irrational geller said thats why were freaking out we cant rationalize it cant we norse asked softly thats the issue of our winter isnt it can rationality handle the irrational lewis looked curiously at the psychologist wasnt this the issue hed mused about over beers in the bar when they first met hadnt norse been antiscience what did the man truly believe good acting molotov had suggested yet what motive did norse have what motive did anyone have how was gabriella a threat to anyone geller was right it was all irrational lets play scientific method norse went on lets play by the rules that drive this whole place bob nancy hodge groaned hypothesis and experiment right logical progression and maybe at the end a workable theory that we all agree on one that lets us decide what action to take are you with me can we do that the others looked at him uncertainly except pulaski he was nodding so what are the possibilities to explain whats going on down here they hesitated like a classroom lunacy geller finally mumbled greed mendoza added some kind of weird vendetta dana said terrorism sort of norse nodded good very good logic people logic lets consider the body gabriella is found dead hanged suicide not from that height mendoza said no chair to stand on and why naked she was probably dead before she was strung up i say murder maybe rape and murder nancy hodge had inspected the body no semen she was bruised scratched maybe an attempted rape i say she went out with a fight the crowd murmured norse nodded any chance of making an id with clues hair blood not with the instruments i have down here the psychologist nodded again taking a breath okay suspects possibility one tyson somehow came back and did it for reasons unknown because hes bloody jack the ripper of amundsenscott base dana said possibility two tyson didnt come back and we have a different killer several people looked at lewis he looked squarely back at them in disgust who hiro prompted he was a scientist he liked this stepbystep it could be a single killer is responsible for all the deaths either tyson or tyson was never responsible in the first place and we exiled the wrong man alternately it could be we have a second killer a copycat killer it could be the deaths are some weird mix of murder accident and suicide they dont seem linked geller said thats why i say its a fruitcake and which one of us is that george mendoza asked lightly id say were all a little balmy the maintenance man muttered just for being here there was nervous laughter of agreement norse nodded again other possibilities what are they people come on hypothesis jealous lover linda brown said softly she slept around too much someone finally got mad the idea seemed to give her a certain satisfaction nobody was sleeping with linda brown okay so we consider who slept with her who didnt calhoun cracked ill bet you didnt you horsefaced nail pounder gage perlin said youn me gage were the only ones homely enough to be left out every other male is suspect calhoun laughed the other men said nothing not wanting to admit or deny a relationship what else norse said someone trying to sabotage the base lewis spoke up a foreign agent he looked at molotov take that russian fingerpointer maybe mickey or somebody stumbled on something strategic someone chasing the meteorite for something other than money lena jindrova suggested maybe it has evidence of martian life something philosophical theological hmmm interesting norse said dana you read the bible does life on another planet threaten your view of our world my beliefs are compatible with science and i didnt kill anybody the government playing with our heads the postdoc gina brindisi suggested she pointed at the psychologist they sent you down here to watch us all go nuts norse shrugged to concede the point its true im in shrink nirvana as george said were all balmy and getting nuttier by the minute uneasy laughter again but at this point id rather have you sane maybe theyre faking everything spoke up gerald follet its a hoax they want us to panic like that radio broadcast of war of the worlds except the bodies are real geller said glumly take a walk out to boot hill if you dont believe that opportunity abby suddenly said youve got a score to settle and people are dropping like flies what better time to murder its lost in the crowd thats good norse nodded i like that one it could be any of us taking revenge on anyone he scanned their faces people were looking more confused than ever more wary and suspicious than ever lewis didnt like the way the meeting was going how was this a help what good are these ideas if theyre not testable hiro interrupted as if reading lewiss mind we can speculate our way into the grave good question ideas somehow figure out who really boinked gabriella geller suggested who was lover enough to care to be jealous oh please dana groaned no really to eliminate some of us that doesnt eliminate anybody mendoza said with exasperation maybe it was someone she wouldnt sleep with maybe it was a jealous woman maybe it had nothing to do with her love life well then eliminate people who couldnt have been around the victims make a spreadsheet of our whereabouts so where were you george when these deaths occurred i dont know mendoza threw up his hands in exasperation what about your files abby asked the psychologist quietly dont you have basic information on all of us didnt rod doesnt nancy dont you have suspicions norse opened his mouth as if to speak and then stopped a moment as if considering the idea for the first time not from the files you all left the box next to are you a murderer blank on your application forms making someone a murderer on the basis of a psychological screening test is a little reckless dont you think there was a slight edge to his voice as he replied to her this woman whod turned him down abby looked unsatisfied he hadnt denied having a suspicion i dont see that this discussion is getting us anywhere molotov complained i have my suspicion which i have voiced he looked again at lewis but unless someone wants to confess we are no closer than before it is a nice try doctor bob but you cannot rationalize what makes no sense you cant rationalize without information norse corrected now he looked directly at lewis suddenly he was the teacher a lesson about to become apparent ive led you through this speculative exercise to demonstrate the dangers of jumping to conclusions but ive also done a little investigation of my own since the shock of finding gabriella ive considered all the possibilities you just voiced thought of all the ways a murderer might leave clues everything we know is circumstantial but in our desperate situation maybe that has to be enough wade pulaski stood up he had positioned himself between lewis and the door the cook stood with his legs apart as if bracing for attack and looked somber even sad his new spear his staff you all know what good little recyclers we are the cook began there were smiles and a few snickers they were supposed to separate all trash into labeled containers in the cold of the dome miscreants who dropped things into the wrong bin brought a regular outburst from linda brown who was in charge of the recycling program shed threatened to kill one or two hyperbole of course but the bins had been one more source of casual tension we have no incinerator at the pole we have no dump everything that flies into the pole eventually flies out of it every bit of garbage weve generated this winter is still here he paused they were quiet waiting the sign around gabriellas neck was made from letters cut from a magazine so i looked in the paper bin for its source what i found at the bottom was this he held up a copy of a popular science and environmental journal it has an article on meteorites he flipped it open showing ragged pages and a lot of letters cut out from the middle norse was looking at lewis and wheres the cover wade he asked the cook wheres the address label that will tell us whose magazine it was it was jed dana gasped ive seen him read that we all have from the library lewis objected torn off and missing pulaski said he nodded at dana so i checked jeds room couldnt find a thing except yes there were ashes in the soup can id given him the first night to use as a chamber pot hed never bothered to give it back lewis stood up his head dizzy dumbfounded by a combination of outrage and fear he was being set up thats a lie he choked everyone was looking at him even abby looked confused ive bagged them for lab analysis in the spring pulaski said holding up a baggie maybe the lab people can tell if they came from the magazine stock in the meantime this is absurd those ashes could have come from anywhere i saw you reading it dana yelled the magazine must have been stolen see this is what i am telling you molotov shouted lewis lewis lewis every time it is jed lewis the hell it is what do you propose we do alexi norse asked quietly if there is only one more spryte then i agree i dont want to give it to a murderer if we cannot send lewis away then i do not want him wandering around we need to lock him up i dont trust him dammit im being framed thats no proof there is no proof of your innocence either guilty until proven innocent right alexi lewis said heatedly like tyson is that how you did it in the gulags the americans shifted uncomfortably prove that you did not do it the russian insisted everyone saw you with gabriella no one saw her since i did not cut up that magazine lewis insisted wouldnt i hide it would i leave the ashes in my own damn room think dammit this is what we are doing thinking about what has happened the silence was thick a congealing presumption of guilt so we put him in the sauna pulaski suddenly summed up hed thought this through just to be safe its our thickest box we can put a crossbeam outside the door we keep him locked down until this is resolved hes right it isnt proof but we cant prove he didnt do it either or anyone else so i say safety is priority one no more wandering around no one leaves the dome no one even goes down the archways to the generators or the fuel we block up the entrances so no one can exit the dome and no one can enter we search every inch of this aluminum beanie we watch each other we enter a state of siege that sounds like a police state mendoza said no carl a state with police a citizen militia us so no one else has to die mendoza frowned considering it another thing pulaski said that means the science goes on hold nsf isnt going to like that norse pointed out fuck nsf if theyre not getting their data maybe theyll figure out some way to resolve this thing send in an fbi agent like weve talked about get us the hell out of here something there was a murmur of approval enough was enough this is a radical decision to lock lewis up norse said to lock the rest of ourselves in i think it has to be a group decision what about our work lewis protested i thought we were all down here for the research what about jim sparcos data global warming we wont get anything done with what youre proposing and i say no more victims pulaski responded no more sacrificial sheep this is a state of emergency until we can get out of here get help get something if we block up the entrances no one can get us from outside none of us can wander off to be picked off we arm everybody i train everybody if a killer strikes i want it to be a fight i want noise i want screaming i want the attacker so bloody punctured with wounds that theres no question who did it and then i want to fry him myself he looked at them fiercely its liable to feel a little claustrophobic norse cautioned winters already claustrophobic pulaski said better claustrophobic than dead most of the others nodded it was time to bar the door it was time to pen jed lewis the geologist looked around for support and saw none abby was looking morosely at the floor outnumbered alone and confused by doubts you can make a fight of it or you can cooperate pulaski told him im not saying its you im saying we wont know its not you until we remove you as a variable like we tried to do at clean air except he goes in the storm when harrison dies molotov said calls rod when cameron dies slowly lewis sat down dizzy with fear another thing geller said i say no more censorship no more email cancellation no more radio silence its time the world knows whats going on down here not just the bureaucrats at nsf its time we screamed bloody murder damn right dana said i understand what youre saying norse looked uneasy i know we need help but before we get on the horn hollering our heads off lets cool the jets a minute weve got a new polar base planned weve got a hundred million dollars riding on how these events are characterized in the media if you guys get on the net and start yelling for your mothers its going to sound like charles manson so geller asked the whole polar program could be in jeopardy and with our lives at stake how many of us give a rats ass about the polar program right now doctor bob pulaski demanded norse waited letting the question add weight i dont know he said softly how many people shifted uncomfortably its survival doctor dana said quietly what do you propose to say to your friends who can help you what good is it to contact them right now except to worry them needlessly ill bet theyre worried already by not hearing from us dana said im just suggesting we give nsf a chance to handle this screw that said geller they shouldve parachuted an investigator in the minute mickey disappeared theyve left us swinging in the wind i say we tell the world whats going on norses eyes polled the room they were against him on this one all right he surrendered broadcast your panic destroy this station maybe thats what the killer wants were bottled up pulaski said defensively we need release youre also professionals i thought the two men looked at each other i cant stop you norse said i know that pulaski hesitated he was a cook not a beaker norse had unconscious rank norse was looking at a bigger picture okay then how about this he said reluctantly looking at the others we have leverage people leverage its like doctor bob says we broadcast this in the right way and we can turn this station into a fiasco too unstable end all funding for it close it up and send it packing and thats our stick with nsf lets call them and tell them what weve discussed and give them twentyfour hours to figure out a way to get us out of here i dont care if its the space shuttle or a dog sled we deserve to go home and if they cant do that then we talk about this to the world the world let the chips fall where they may twentyfour hours isnt much time norse said theyve had time and done nothing the others nodded norse took an unhappy breath all right deal let me talk to them on the phone when the satellites come in view i agree they need to know how antsy we all are ill talk to them about lewis about tyson about everyone let me think of what i want to say and we should be ready to phone inhe looked at his watch an hour say i want to hear what you tell them geller said and i dont want to talk as a committee theyll get a babble and things will be more confused than ever give me a chance okay a chance to save the winter one day clyde skinner will be helping and he can listen okay clyde skinner was their radioman he nodded meet me there in an hour to fire things up norse said it was enough everyone appeared to agree on this compromise jed goes into the sauna at least for the time being and cueball why dont you start figuring how to lock us in like you said our world shrinks down to this dome spaceship pulaski norse looked at them and took a breath the group was still under control if nothing more happened maybe they could make it ill do my best to resolve this thing norse promised chapter twentythree the explosion was so muffled that at first it was more puzzling than alarming sounding in the galley like a flat mysterious whump then the alarm began ringing fire it was the one deadly threat they constantly drilled for in the dry air of the pole combustibles could flash into fire like gasoline and liquid water to douse them was in chronic short supply reaction was instantaneous and automatic people jerked to their feet chairs toppling over a coffee cup spilled this was no overcooked pig it was the real thing not bothering to dress they crashed out the galley door and sprinted for assigned extinguishers and hoses there was a haze in the air of the dome wheres it coming from pulaski yelled smoke was drifting out of one end of comms he saw its aluminum wall bulging like a blister the radio room the cook called for help and then waved their dead run to a halt feeling the outside of the metal module for heat before cautiously opening a door a gust of smoky gases rolled out stinking and ominous from inside came an agonized screaming christ pulaski muttered shining a flashlight into the murk what more can happen was doctor bob in there everyone looked around norse was nowhere to be seen gina brindisi had the presence of mind to run around the end of the building to a crack where the building had split like a swollen can and then spray fire retardant through the hole into the communications center pulaski geller and calhoun donned fire masks and pushed into the corridor squirting halon and hunting for survivors the screaming was horrible when they reached the radio room it was dark and smoky illuminated by spurts of sparks puffs of chemical from the extinguishers made the last orange flames snuff out and then their flashlights and headlamps swept the wreckage pulaski dropped to the floor groping for norse and touched a body a wounded man was writhing in agony with his hands over his face his skin burnt off from an explosion of acid the cook gripped the man and leaned close peering through his mask it was clyde skinner their radioman im blinded what happened what happened pulaski kept shouting the question through his mask but it was obvious skinner was in no condition to answer what breath he could suck in was used to scream oh my god i cant see the communications center was destroyed its bank of lead batteries had exploded shattering the equipment and spraying the room with acid the explosion had caught skinner full force dissolving his face it was almost unlucky he was alive nancy hodge pushed into the room took in the wreckage at a glance and knelt beside skinner she looked sickened where the hell is bob we dont know well help me get skinner to sick bay weve got to wash him the trio of men lifted the radioman and carried him out to the cold and clear air of the dome someone came at them with a bucket to douse skinner and wash the acid but hodge stopped it not here it will just freeze on his face im blind oh how it hurts everyone was looking at him in horror hell be begging for more morphine than we have nancy said more relief than we can give him go on get him into sick bay skinners screams faded like a disappearing train as they carried him off now im really getting pissed pulaski muttered glowering for a culprit and finding none lewis was already locked up really really pissed you cant blame jed for this one abby told him really lets figure out what happened first we found doctor bob someone shouted norse was sitting on the floor of camerons old office next to comms dazed and coughing in the lingering smoke he appeared to have been knocked unconscious in the blast furniture was awry papers on the floor like snow i was getting ready to make the call he choked what the hell happened the worst near as i can tell pulaski told him clyde said he had to crank up the radios he cranked them up all right they lifted the psychologist to his feet norse blinking from the concussion of the blast losing him would cut them from their last anchor they led him back into the radio room where everything stank of burnt plastic and rubber at a glance it was apparent their normal connection to the outside world had been wiped out i dont understand what happened norse muttered the batteries blew up said charles longfellow their electrician yes but why they were probably charging you told us to pull the plug on this place during the communications blackout and the batteries ran down clyde had to bring them up again with the generator charging always creates hydrogen and oxygen gases which is the stuff that blew up the hindenburg normally it vents off okay but a spark or a match clyde didnt smoke no something else longfellow was leaning over the wrecked radios and computers looking for a clue there maybe they looked two crossing wires now blackened and bubbled had frayed down to metal when clyde flipped the radios on the current could have caused a short the electrician pointed out if the gases werent venting then bang but i thought the battery compartment had a vent they went outside a sheet of plywood had been shot outward by the explosion longfellow kicked it this could have been leaning up against the hole he said blocking it deliberately norse asked the electrician just looked at him and the wires dont you check them twice a year longfellow said at the beginning and end of summer season they were fine theres no reason for them to be abraded like that so what happened he looked at the ruptured building someone wanted this to happen the bastard didnt just destroy our radios he shorted out the linkages to the machines and radios on the rest of the station this place was a hub now were deaf and dumb but why someone planned this before clyde ever threw a switch to recharge the batteries someone wanted to destroy our communications someone doesnt want us talking about jed lewis they were panicked now their vulnerability to accident or sabotage made clear no one slept for the next twentytwo hours as they fortified their enclosure from a threat they didnt understand there was no sun anyway no natural clock and no place to escape to only a suffocating paranoia that seemed to settle on the dome with the weight of the polar night pulaski had become transformed by the explosion a metamorphosis that shed the cook and returned the old soldier he was crockett at the alamo girding for battle the garage was ransacked for metal wood welding torches and tools brackets were welded in a shower of sparks and beams were placed against the bay doors latches were fastened for the smallest doors and fastened with wire cutters issued to sentries their greatest points of vulnerability were the fuel tanks and the generators and so the fuel arch behind biomed and the opposite arch leading to pika taylors machines were walled up completely a frame was built across both half sections of tunnel and sheets of plywood and metal were nailed across it to prevent any kind of access at all i still know how to get in pika said quietly no one else has to know no one else has to get to my machines he looked from face to face a slight grin as he regarded them you kill me you die the work went in shifts one group hammering and welding while another warmed up in the galley and gulped down coffee to stay awake no one was sleeping until they were certain antarctica was walled off that buck tyson or some malevolent ghost wasnt somehow sneaking into the dome to wreak murder and sabotage revenge and psychic terror that some traitor in their midst was not plotting a final catastrophe the rest of the station was to be abandoned for the time being the dark sector and clean air left to slumber in the snow were a turtle pulaski explained were drawing into our shell the cook insisted that everyone without exception be armed tysons old locker was broken into and the knives hed made were distributed to whoever didnt have one the recipients regarded them a little dubiously amundsenscott base the blade of one read the legend bracketed by penguins there wasnt a penguin within eight hundred miles what if we start going after each other with these things gina protested like everyone else she was so cold and sore she could hardly move the frenzy of getting the dome sealed was holding off their terror but they were also close to a breaking point losing comms had wrung them out the damage to their communications would take days to repair especially with skinner blinded and abby morose i am a little concerned about arming people to the teeth norse admitted hed deferred to pulaskis military expertise in locking up the dome but seemed uneasy with the cooks new martial authority it had eclipsed his own tempers are short people are jumpy and so far no more of us are dead pulaski answered grimly we tried it one way with all of us wandering around like blind sheep and getting picked off one by one now lets try it another way strategic deterrence people mutual assured destruction you take a predator like a mountain lion and theyll back off if you fight back they dont want to risk injury they cant risk injury because if they get hurt they starve if our murderer is someone other than lewis then he or she cant risk injury either because theyll be found out you get jumped make sure you draw blood die if you have to but scream bloody hell first jeez cueball geller said enough drill instructor dramatics okay you people are almost asleep on your feet you need some dramatics i just dont know that were up to stabbing people dana said tiredly well someone might be up to stabbing you that make a difference the new zealander looked at him gloomily come here dana pulaski suddenly said what bloody for come here it was an order and she complied against her own wishes walking over to the cook he turned her around to face the others youre my raggedy ann for a little knife lesson oh please she groaned i just want to go to my bloody bed now listen he said to the others in the galley the whole point of this is that you dont get attacked that any killer knows that open season is over but if you are attacked you dont want to pussy around right you want to stop an assailant so they cant stop you cut them so they cant cut you make them go down and stay down so you can run for help right otherwise all you do is piss them off they looked at him with exhaustion stay here a moment he told dana he went to the kitchen and came back with a jar of spaghetti sauce and a basting brush wade jesus christ come on stand still this might save your life our lives he dipped in the brush please he dabbed a splotch of red under her nose and she started hit them here under the nose try to break it try to push it upward it will hurt like hell if youre lucky the cartilage will be shoved into the brain and the frontal lobes will bleed and theyll go down permanently he dipped again and painted her throat hit here under the adams apple for men is a good pain point it can chop off air for either sex with a weapon you can cut an artery with a blow you can collapse the windpipe dont screw around dont give your opponent time to do it to you not unless you want to get laid out in the snow with gabriella reid dana looked at him with distaste he dipped again and aimed toward the hollow behind her clavicle next pain point no she stepped away raising her own knife enough stay away from me cueball im not some damned american killer mercenary excellent reaction dana get that knife up this is exactly my point i want to make you a damned killer mercenary so i declare my graduation enough with the sauce she walked away and slumped in a chair throwing her knife with a clatter on the table he turned to the others pointing with the brush the solar plexus right under the rib cage the abdomen breasts if its a woman balls if its a man the eyes the ears anywhere you can inflict pain any way you can get the other guy to hesitate back off go down listen i know its grim but im tired of people dying like rabbits you gotta look after yourself ive climbed ive rafted ive jumped ive shot look for yourself check your own chute sharpen your own bayonet lock and load people youre scaring me with all this army stuff gina said youre going to make us fear every man and woman on this base thats right gina fear is the one thing that might just keep you alive he looked at the others at the end of the winter thats all that counts is that all geller asked wearily no when we finish boarding things up i think it would be smart to search each other again as well lewis was dreaming of arabia he was on a flat plain stony and hot looking for oil the sky was white the horizon watery and he was uneasy because if he didnt find his prize soon hed lose his job the oil was under one of the rocks he knew but every stone looked alike each was the shape of a potato burnt and glassy and he was having to turn them over one by one to find what he was looking for finally he turned one over and was startled to see a face looking up at him it was a woman buried in the sand her long hair made of strands of quartz and mica he stepped back in surprise and she rose up out of the desert robed her gown made of silicon it was a gray shimmering translucent thing her body perfect beneath it the woman was looking at him boldly and he heard himself think i dont know you and then the gown turned to sand and slid away leaving the woman naked except for specks of quartz on her shoulders and thighs and breasts like a scattering of glitter the merciless glare from the sun turned a cool blue directly above her a small dark circle giving her a column of shade except the woman was now abby her hair shorter and her expression shy and the glitter wasnt sand it was specks of ice lewis awoke groggily his dream penetrated by a tapping the sauna was pitchblack and stuffy the bench where he lay hard and uncomfortable he sat up someone was knocking at his door it was the latest in a series of noises that had bewildered him an explosion alarms hammerings drills saws despite his shouts no one ever came to explain what was going on it was like hed been locked in the sauna and abandoned it was like being buried in the old base it was like freezing to death in the pit where theyd found mickey moss his claustrophobia had come back to him whos there his voice was thick doped from sleep its abby can i talk to you he was frustrated and embarrassed at his plight in the end shed stopped trying to defend him in the end she hadnt known who to believe go away jed please were in danger youve got to let me in he didnt answer im sorry that i didnt say more in the galley i was quiet because i had to think things through i had to trust first trust what trust who to believe he sat there brooding tiredly feeling angry and frustrated there was no chance to prove anything to anyone now locked up in here i decided to believe you she said well hell he flicked on the sauna light pulaski had barred the door from the outside as hed promised preventing lewis from escaping his makeshift prison but hed also left the latch working on the inside preventing anyone from getting in that lewis didnt want to see we cant afford a guard to protect us from you and we cant afford a guard to protect you from us the cook had growled i dont want some vigilante coming in here and beating the crap out of you until we know whats going on so lock the damn door from the inside and dont open it up for anyone but me okay lewis had nodded he wasnt even going to open it to pulaski until he was so damn hungry and thirsty that he had to face the cook until then he wanted to be alone in his depression willing himself mentally ten thousand miles from the pole yet did he he felt so isolated and abby he cautiously opened the door fearing a mob behind her but it was only the woman she quickly slipped inside latching it behind her jed i need help she whispered you need help what the hell is going on out there anyway were completely cut off from the outside world and were making prisoners of ourselves comms blew up and what the batteries exploded they think it was sabotage it knocked out the power grid to the outside buildings and everyones gone nuts theyve barricaded all the entrances with beams and bolts and theyre building walls to block off the fuel arch and the generators because thats where were most vulnerable we cant get to the fuel and we cant get to the gym and garage anymore only pika knows how to get around them hes the only one mild enough that everyone trusts him and hes become some kind of hypochondriac running off to biomed all the time like he has a case of the runs the rest of us are in prison just like you theyre walling us in against a boogeyman nobody is really sure is out there until they rebuild the communications hub its like a kettle coming to a boil and theyve screwed down the lid im worried the whole place is going to explode im worried were building a firetrap jesus he rubbed his head wearily what the hell am i supposed to do about it im locked up ive been thinking about things and i think i need to unlock you escape reconnoiter get out to a computer that works and try to figure out whats going on before its too late what do you mean pulaski has armed everybody he gave a class and painted poor dana with glops of spaghetti sauce to show where the lethal parts are he said were all warriors were all deputies he said its like the arms race people are strutting around like gladiators and someones going to get hurt hiro did get hurt he was tired and got in a quarrel with alexi and the russian cut his hand and now its all bandaged up and alexi is in a funk about the whole thing because its just the kind of craziness hes been accusing you of hiros terrified of him all the rooms have been searched again this time throwing everything into the open theres no privacy left no dignity if something more happens im afraid theyll come looking for a scapegoat looking for you they cant blame anything on me when im in here some people already have someone prepped comms to explode before it happened something to do with the wires and batteries it was a booby trap and clyde had his entire face burnt off he might even die so who did that not me the same somebody who killed gabriella lewis shut his eyes in weariness does norse know youre here no she glanced sideways as if he might be watching he led the others into sealing you off and i think its deliberate he doesnt want me talking to you or you talking to anyone why he called me in after you were locked up after the explosion and said he understood my support for you but that gabriellas death had changed everything changed his own thinking then he showed me the note what note he said he found it in rod camerons desk drawer it says rod can save his career by giving you the meteorite and its signed by you she was watching him come on i didnt write that note it had your name its a forgery abby it has to be this is all so crazy norse or rod or someone is screwing me theyre out to turn us against each other he said he hadnt shown it to the others yet but if more bad things continued to happen they might have to ask you some hard questions hard questions jed i think he wants to interrogate you break you somehow to hell with that im just telling you that you cant stay here waiting for things to play out now he was suspicious the paranoia was infectious he looked at her narrowly suddenly wary bob put you up to this didnt he he wants me to try to escape hell use it against me no but he wants to turn your head around just like whats happening now he twists everything he objects to pulaski in public and then confers with him in private hes playing him playing you playing me theres something wrong wait a minute i did sign it lewis had remembered what a piece of paper the first day i came here we were joking around about psychology and handwriting analysis and bob had me sign something his eyes were distant trying to recall what norse had done with the paper i did sign it what the hell has this been a setup from the beginning abby looked intrigued you think he planned this i dont know what to think that far ahead what if mickey was right and it was bob who took my picture she asked thats what ive been thinking about what if he planted it on moss but why to confuse us make us think mickey might have committed suicide put pressure on me to see howd i react you think norse is responsible for all this what do we really know about him hes a fingie just like you he came down at the last minute just like you to figure us out or bewilder us but hes been holding things together has he jesus he thought a minute trying to go back over events norse had admitted hed heard where mickey might have hidden the meteorite norse had been out in the storm when adams died norse had helped tyson flee but why thats what youve got to find out youre the one person who can sneak out of the dome right now and not be missed the one person with time to wait for the satellites and get on the internet the one person who will ask who robert norse really is i thought you said the radios and the computers are down the hub at comms is destroyed but if you could get to another source of power and shunt some electricity to clean air you could still use the machines out here if i can get to another source of power theres an emergency generator at the hypertats at bedrock village can i start it you could try i think it might work i think thats why bob has allowed pulaski to wall up the dome he doesnt want us getting out there calling out all the doors are locked now the perimeter is patrolled so how the hell am i going to get out there thats why i came here look everyones exhausted almost everyones asleep theyve been up for hours and hours locking us in im blitzed too but i was going crazy thinking about bob thinking about you so i couldnt sleep and got up and wandered outside and i just sort of collapsed in the snow under the dome utterly defeated just lying there and then a snowflake hit me in the eye you know how that feels between a kiss and a sting so i stood up and then all these little snowflakes were sticking to me he looked at her in wonder it was like the image from his dream then i realized what we had all overlooked error of judgment for three days i was a hero then the weather cleared recovery teams ventured out on the ice below wallace wall and the bodies began to be recovered some goober of a deputy sheriff who probably watched too much columbo and talked like a mayberry hick started to yodel about the neatly clipped end of the line still attached to the corpses of chisel chin and carrot top i professed shocked innocence id left both fine young men on the ledge with the others just why the devil they were roped and how theyd fallen were they trying to climb out on their own was a mystery to me but then why was my own line broken there were the beginnings of awkward questions of just who had been roped to whom i expressed grieving outrage of course at any implication of negligence or wrongdoing i had risked my life to save those kids to save that whale fat boy but the holierthanthou crowd wanted to know why i had saved myself slowtalking deputy goober wouldnt shut up about it even though he didnt have the balls to go down the cliff himself and look for evidence like a knife secreted in a convenient crevice finally the university had to exert some pressure on the sheriff because of fear of a lawsuit the matter of exactly just what did happen on the mountain was notsoquietly dropped despite the confused bleating of bereaved parents and that was that id done my best and was prepared to get on with my life except my application for tenure was denied they wouldnt let it drop they wouldnt let it drop barney fife deputy dipshit kept nosing around the whispering started the peer reviews of my research papers began to get very much more pointed very pointed indeed they started murmuring about me in the campus coffee shop i could feel the staresand plotting against me in the department they denied it of course but i knew what was happening i knew it the file cabinets that were locked the meetings called without notifying me they were being held the evasive looks the papers turned upside down on desks so i couldnt read them the hollow sympathies god did i know it friends became distant a woman i thought i felt something for became chillingly remote no charge was ever brought and no charge was needed my life had become intolerable id been sentenced without being charged so one day i just walked away let me be perfectly clear about exactly what happened on that mountain an act of individual and immature foolishness by a single overweight student led to leadership miscalculation group panic and a brutal winnowing based on skill and common sense the strongest clearest thinker had survived it was as pure an experiment in natural selection as one could hope for so dont call me lucky i was not blessed i was realistic brutally coldly and rationally realistic no one was going to save me so i saved myself once my companions slipped i didnt have any chance of saving the others with their trust in each other they had all doomed themselves the ropes that bound us together had proved to be gossamer threads long before i brought out my knife i am merely the surviving witness to the fragility of society any society do you see my point we are alone in life we cant know another person we cant join with another person we are islands made of either rock or sand anything else is delusion i found that out when everyone turned on me i acquired another position and began to labor to document this point i plowed into psychological and sociological research and combed through history cooperation comes only through coercion its so obvious when you look at the literature everything else is a fraud progress is achieved by the natural selection of the superior individual and it is individual vision that drives or destroys the group no one would listen of course my realization collided with their cozy dreams of group comfort social security the american myth of democracy teamwork compromise the whispers followed the looks the suspicions i saw it everywhere in the supermarket at the bank in my office everyone looking at me strangely thinking the worst of my quite defensible actions blaming me for having the courage to survive i saw it so how to prove my point how to demonstrate that i really had no choice imagine a small society in a harsh environment imagine one that could be kept in experimental isolation for eight long dark months imagine applying sufficient stress that group solidarity is tested imagine forcing each individual to realize how completely alone he or she really is the national science foundation ignored me of course they dismissed my carefully constructed application they really had no clue as to the significance of the social experiment they had unwittingly constructed at the pole it was all astronomy and climatology to them instruments and data no vision of the future no understanding of our grim evolutionary future in the cold blackness of space so everyone ignored me my papers went unpublished my grant proposals were rejected my every step dogged by ugly rumor i was broke desperate humiliated and then destiny can you possibly imagine what an arrogant boorish prick robert norse really was i met him at a professional conference when he was boasting of his assignment to antarctica his assignment to the pole precisely the place where i wanted to go he blathered on mindlessly gloating stuffed full of himself not having even the merest pathetic clue of just how unfairly his own good fortune had erased my own he was going to a place he didnt begin to understand and along the way he was trekking in new zealand a few months later i read about his disappearance do you believe in miracles im a rational man a man of science and yet sometimes opportunity presents itself in so deliciously glorious a way that one cant help but wonder at the secret workings of the universe the dark wood it occurred to me that if i could not compete with robert norse i had to become robert norse i had to act decisively just as i had on that cliff and everything after that just happened i acted on the best plan i had at the time chapter twentyfour this is completely insane lewis said which is why it just might work in a place like this abby replied it was past midnight and most of the winterovers were asleep with whatever dreams plagued them wrung out from their frenzy to barricade the dome only gage perlin their plumber was making hourly rounds as the designated sentry of the witchinghour watch in preparation abby had raided jerry folletts crate of atmospheric sampling equipment that was tucked against one wall of the dome taking a small weather balloon and a gas canister shed filched and concealed a foot length of sturdy rope a lighter tether line half that length a pack with a flashlight two ice axes and a coil of wire now she crouched behind the ruptured comms building to fill the balloon while lewis used first tape then wire and finally rope to bind the two ice ax prongs at right angles to each other more tape fused the handles the result was a crude approximation of a grappling hook tied to the climbing rope it would be hoisted aloft by the balloon what if somebody sees us lewis had worried theyre worn out besides how much more locked up can we be than we already are in a grave he thought but didnt say that there was a fierceness about abby now that he found exciting infectious her own decisive energy had ignited his own they werent even sure what they were fighting but they were at least beginning to fight back the pair peered around the corner and heard and saw nothing we have to do this quickly lewis said maybe twenty minutes before gage comes through again they briskly walked across the snowy floor to the center of the dome pulling the bobbing balloon behind them the gas bag was tied to a tether line that in turn was fastened by a slip knot to the makeshift grappling hook the climbing rope hung from the hook it was a bizarre plan made necessary by their bizarre entrapment norse and pulaski had sealed every entrance to the structure except the most obvious one the opening at the top of the dome that jed had seen on his first day left permanently open like a smoke hole in a kiva to allow air circulation looked at from below it was like the eyepiece of a telescope giving a glimpse of a few bright stars and the outside world lewis let the medicineballsized balloon go holding on to its light tether it shot up faster than he expected and the line writhed like a flagellum until abby grabbed it and controlled its ascent through her fingers then hook lifted off and the two lines uncoiled upward together at a steady pace swimming in the night when the helium orb bumped against the icicles overhead a few broke off and fell forcing the pair to duck fortunately the frozen spikes plunged noiselessly into the snow in the center of the dome instead of banging against the roof of the modules they stuck out from the ground like knives careful abby hissed help me pull it over they gingerly tugged on the lines to lower the balloon slightly and bring it under the hole then they let rope out again and the orb popped free once the gas bag was above the crest of the dome the wind took it like a fish after bait the ropes yanked taut when their grappling hook was carried to the lee side of the opening they hauled sharply down letting the ice axes wedge against the outside of the roof as the pair threw their weight against it the aluminum bent slightly snugging the ax heads tightly against the rim lewis jerked on the tether to free the slip knot and the balloon lurched upward and soared away into the night the tether snaking up and out of sight remaining were the hook and its climbing rope hanging downward from the vent hole he sighted up the lines length trying to judge its bite on the roof it just might hold he gave her a kiss of partnership ill be back before pika wakes up to check the generators just get up the rope first scaling a rope five stories high by grip alone required considerable strength and risked a bad fall lewis instead used a trick hed learned years ago while mountaineering two loops resembling hangmans nooses and called prusik loops were tied with light line and hung on the main rope with slip knots so they could be pulled up or down the main line he slid one two feet above the snow and slipped his boot into its loop as he put his weight on it stepping up off the snow the slip knot tightened and friction held the loop firmly in place like a foothold giving him his first short ascent he pirouetted slowly as he held on watching the rope turn under the grappling hook and waiting to make sure it wouldnt twist off hold the bottom to help keep me steady he instructed abby then balancing on the loop he stooped and caught the second prusik loop with his glove he slid it two feet higher than the first and put his other boot into that again the knot tightened and he stepped upward he wiggled his first boot out of the first knot loosening its grip bent awkwardly to slide it just under the knot he was standing on and transferred his weight yet again by keeping his weight on one loop at a time he could slide the knots steadily up the rope and keep climbing i think this is going to work he said already breathing heavily what if gage comes abby asked seduce him the first twenty feet were easy enough it helped that abby steadied the rope once he got high enough that a fall might seriously hurt however his worry about the security of the hook increased he looked upward trying to see what was happening in the gloom but could tell nothing what if the whole contraption unraveled then this damnable winter will be over he told himself he climbed higher as he ascended he began to feel a slight breeze from the chilly opening and the stars seemed brighter progress it was like climbing to the mouth of a well up up up he was panting from the exertion and awkward in his winter clothes but hed need them once he was outside abby had become very small below the roofs of the housing modules formed a geometric pattern their tops dusted with snow he paused for breath again braced on one trembling leg glancing below to make sure no one was watching gage would probably wander around again in about ten minutes even with abby holding on below the rope twisted slowly rotating him slowly first one way then another it was too bad in a way the others werent awake he was putting on quite a show a damned circus the dome seemed higher and higher as he climbed toward its apex his perspective changing then he felt an ominous jerk the rope vibrating the hook was shifting he froze waiting with dread for it to slide free and cause his own long plummet to the ice below but no the movement stopped and he was still hanging in space sweating his body tense the rope trembling like a plucked string so much for stopping he began hauling himself upward again as fast as he could manage his glove touched the taped ax shafts and he could hear the moan of the wind across the top of the dome he slipped the top loop as high as it would go boosted himself up put out one hand and grasped the rim an aluminum tube ran around the fourfootwide opening slick and cold and hard to hang on to he awkwardly leveraged his head upward and a blast of antarctic wind hit him like a slap as claustrophobically cold as it was inside the aluminum dome the windchill outside was twice as bad once more its power sucked his breath away yet that way promised release if he could just lever himself up a few more feet he leaned against the rim and began twisting his boot trying to work it out of the final loop the damn thing worked like a snare he came loose awkwardly catching his boot tip on the line and tangling himself he grunted in fear as his legs and weight abruptly dropped free his fingers clenched on the aluminum rim and his body snapped straight as he hung on his gloves swaying back and forth like a pendulum with the hard white floor five stories below abbys upturned face was a white oval the hook somewhere behind him dammit he dangled a moment collecting his wits and then muscles straining lewis worked his way hand over hand around the trim to the grappling hook grabbed it and got his feet wrapped around the main climbing rope again sliding the prusik loops down out of the way he pushed upward with his legs shoving himself back up into the wind and the darkness outside the dome and worked high enough to get the leverage he needed for a final desperate lunge that would let him bellyflop onto the domes slick roof it took a second to catch his breath then he squirmed around to a sitting position and looked down through the hole abby was gesturing wildly perlin must be coming shed already tied the end of the rope to his pack of supplies the rope was deliberately more than twice the length needed to reach the top of the dome and he hauled the slack up quickly finally the pack itself jerked off the snow and began to dance upward as he pulled while abby ducked behind comms and here came the plumber cold and hunched walking again with a crude spear made from a knife lashed onto a sawedoff mop handle ambling across the point where theyd just been standing without noticing the fresh scuffle of snow perlin never looked up at the backpack oscillating silently over his head striding to check the barricaded entrance by the archways he disappeared from view lewis pulled the pack up the rest of the way put it on reversed the hook and pitched the climbing rope down the outside of the geodesic structure grasping it and walking backward he gingerly made his way down the face of the dome to the snow the aluminum making a faint hollow pop as it flexed under his weight it became so steep that he had to let go and drop the last few feet rolling into the drifts that mounded against the dome then he bounded up shaking himself like a dog he was out the freedom after being locked in the sauna was exhilarating lewis looked around all exterior lights had been shorted out in the explosion and the base was dark a ground fog of blown snow skittered waisthigh across the plateau yet above this miasma he could see surprisingly well the stars were a shoal of diamonds the milky way a brilliant white arch their galaxy hed never seen so many stars so close and so brilliant they were a swath of luminous paint he tilted his head back to drink them bite them as sparco had promised the glory of it stunned him with the force of belated recognition yes im a part of that he stood for a moment gaping oblivious to the cold this is why im down here he murmured then he began walking toward the dark blue huts that marked bedrock the emergency shelter that housed a small auxiliary generator he had about three hours the hypertats were modest and modern quonsetshaped huts that had been installed as an emergency refuge in case the dome somehow failed insulated modern and cramped they were designed to keep people alive until rescue could be organized as winter deepened they were drifting with snow and no one so far as lewis knew had been inside them this season behind them was an emergency generator building this shed was deliberately unlocked and had clear instructions posted inside so that any survivor would be able to start the machine still it took lewis fifteen minutes to push aside snow blocking its door inside the machine was brittle and cold ice crystals glittering as his flashlight played over it the fuel like jelly and with the grid down the batteries had lost much of their charge there was enough to start warming the cylinders but then the batteries petered out and it took another twenty minutes of hard labor for lewis to handcrank the diesel to get it going each reluctant chug that died increased his sense of desperation just as he was thoroughly frustrated by its mulelike reluctance ready to scream with resentment it coughed and rumbled and gave him the first real hope hed had for some time energy a source norse and pulaski had overlooked the roar seemed cacophonous inside the shed but he knew the generators modest chug couldnt be heard from the distant dome yet it was enough to make electricity for the hypertats and power was power this juice was going to let him reach the outside world bedrocks small generator was never designed to power the other outlying buildings yet it connected to a substation shack with an electrical panel and if switched and rerouted as abby had instructed it could shunt electricity away from the emergency shelters and out to clean air he trudged to the shack butted it open and searched with his flashlight for the right switches he hesitated only a moment if he threw the wrong ones he could short out the entire system but no they were clearly labeled and one by one he flipped them over as the woman had instructed no sparks flew no circuits shorted he looked outside hallelujah a deck light had come on at clean air abby knew her stuff the light would alert anyone watching but no one should be watching the others had blinded themselves by barricading the dome lewis set off for his workplace boots crunching in fresh crust it was eerie how dead the rest of the station looked everything was in silhouette under the stars the antennas mute the telescopes blinded it was like walking a ghostly ruin the snow was a frozen sea an undulating series of drifts he strode up and down like a boat his trail leading from one halfburied flag to the next he wondered about the distant future would humans stay at the pole forever or retreat someday would everything they had built eventually become as ghostly as the abandoned navy base while fairly confident he wouldnt be missed until morning lewis flicked off the deck light once he clambered up the metal steps to reach clean air he also didnt take the chance of turning on a light inside his old workplace instead he flicked on an auxiliary heater and used his flashlight to pick his way to one of the computers dragging some furniture over to block its glow from the windows he didnt want to be interrupted by pursuit only then did he turn the machine on there was the familiar whir and bleep and a faint crackle as photons danced in the tube lewis checked his watch the satellites that tied them to the internet cleared the horizon at intervals of eight hours the next one was rising now the temptation to simply sound a cry for help was powerful but was unlikely to bring any meaningful response he couldnt stay out here to wait for a reply because hed be missed in the sauna and a hunt would be on and even if the national science foundation decided to dispatch the texas rangers at his strange sos it would take at least days and more likely weeks in winter to mount the logistics to fly to the pole all the military transports were back in the united states their national guard crews had dispersed and their cold weather gear was stored the pole was designed to be selfsufficient until october the winterovers were facing a danger theyd have to deal with themselves and before they could deal with it he had to understand what their peril was there was now one person of uncertain past one person leading them to an even more uncertain future lewis launched a web search robert norse he started with the usual string of search engines alta vista yahoo aol google msn the results were frustrating because the name was too common there were scores of references to bobs and norses but none obviously fitting their psychologist he turned up roberts rules of order and a reference to norse mythology a link to a warhammer game and a construction company in minneapolis come on there were even puzzling references to new zealand referring to outdoor hiking trips there what the hell was that about damn brainless internet clutter he tried searching professional journals but quickly became lost in a bog of poor indexing and the ceaseless accumulation of academic publication so much stuff that no one could read it and so dense no one could understand it brilliant people in a cocoon of irrelevance he didnt have the vaguest idea who norse might have written for anyway and what would an academic study prove stymied he decided to try news media databases instead the new york times and wall street journal came up empty but a los angeles times brief from two years before mentioned norse as a visiting lecturer at san diego state university the sentence came in a story about a psychological conference on human adaptation to extremes it said norse was planning polar research were looking at the adaptability of people to stressful conditions hed told the reporter well that made sense frustratingly there was nothing more the university web site had no listing for norse no picture no biography no vital statistics the citys newspaper the san diego uniontribune electronic archive turned up norse sixtytwo times in stories that ranged from a football lineman for the chargers to a feature on scandinavian cooking it was near the end of the list that he found a twoparagraph news brief and whispered bingo it was dated february and datelined christchurch local man found in nz the headline read the story began robert norse a southern california research psychologist affiliated with san diego state as a guest lecturer survived two weeks in the southern new zealand wilderness and walked out under his own power on friday new zealand authorities said today norse was reported missing on january having disappeared from a guided walk in mount aspiring national park searchers had given up hope when the american reappeared hungry but in good shape more than kilometers from where hed become lost refusing medical help he left immediately for christchurch where he is overdue to join an american scientific contingent assigned to antarctica authorities said he gave little information about his ordeal there were no followup stories and no article in the archives about norses original disappearance lewis began trying other communities in a widening orbit around san diego hunting for their newspapers and trying their electronic databases it wasnt until hed broadened his search to the orange county register near los angeles that he hit pay dirt again orange county man missing read the headline robert norse an american scientist scheduled to conduct sociology studies at the south pole has disappeared during a hiking tour of new zealand a tour company reported yesterday a rare summer snow squall in the high country had obscured a popular trek route and norse apparently lagged behind during bad weather a search for him the following morning proved fruitless new zealand authorities are continuing to look in the rugged area norse who is single is a selfemployed psychologist writer and social theorist who occasionally teaches at area universities authorities said his most recent appointment was at san diego state university so norse was what he said he was a psychologist and hed mentioned something about new zealand yet hed never talked about being lost in new zealand even though everyone on station had depleted their life stories by now it must have been a traumatic experience to be lost for two weeks that was a hell of a long time in the woods yet norse never referred to it odd what if his disappearance was intentional lewis felt a rising excitement that prickling that comes on the edge of discovery but why what could he have wanted in the new zealand wilderness some kind of personal test some validation for his theories of individual survival lewis pondered glancing at the clock at the bottom of the computer screen it had taken him half an hour to hike to clean air from the hypertats fifteen minutes to get some heat and fire up the computer several more to get a connection pika would be up soon in half an hour he needed to race back to the dome if he didnt want to set off an alarm the satellite was drifting out of range again anyway yet he was no closer to an answer than before there seemed no other obvious avenues to pursue on the internet and so he considered the stations databases the hard drives of the victims had been corrupted by a magnet abby had reported to him the killer apparently smart enough to scramble any potential clue there even if there was an electronic link to norse or anyone else the culprit had squelched it lewis tried logging on to the stations uncorrupted astronomy database but found no reference to the psychologist which was not surprising given the astronomers attitude toward norse and his trade what else what else there were always the station personnel records this was mundane stuff not the more intimate information known only to rod cameron norse and nancy hodge and available only on paper not online still maybe the routine logging of the logistical comings and goings of base employees would reveal something its compiler was gabriella whose job had been the arrangement and recording of flights rooms counting heads at meals tracking cargo and luggage he scanned quickly looking for norses name had the psychologist brought something weird or unusual in his gear not really there was a reference to hby tscp which lewis assumed was a reference to the telescope the psychologist had brought down to build appropriate project for a sixmonth night as norse had said nothing else however no bombs no meteorites no knives no nooses everything gabriella reid had written down about norse was utterly tedious most of his winterover gear had been shipped ahead of him but that was normal the guard stockpiled personal gear in christchurch and tucked it into the transports when there was room for an extra load the winterovers themselves arrived with a single duffel and found the rest of their things waiting for them much of it never went back home as the storeroom at the kitkat club testified norse apparently followed the routine he was just one more fingie rotating in on tour lewis sat back frustrated rubbing his eyes he was missing something something obvious but he was damned if he could figure out what it was his time was almost up and except for the new zealand adventure he knew little more about robert norse than when hed climbed out of the dome maybe he was investigating the wrong man maybe their paranoia was driving them to convert friends to enemies enemies to friends in any event it was time to drop back into imprisonment since he still had no ammunition to secure his own release no revelation no smoking gun lewis flipped the computer off and stood up now what nothing made much sense norse was a scientist just like him arriving late just like him then it hit him the thing that had been staring him in the face and hed been too blind to recognize the discrepancy he abruptly sat back down and fired up the machine again that whir again and the laborious chug beep bop boop come on there was the familiar blue glow and he typed madly getting back to gabriellas station lists yes there auckland that was the day norse had checked his telescope and other gear with american authorities in the new zealand capital shipping it through to the staging base at christchurch and then on to antarctica norse had signed the necessary forms he had allowed inspection of his gear which meant according to the records of gabriella reid that norse had been at the auckland airport dealing with logistics at the same time the newspapers said hed already disappeared into the countrys wilderness yet norse hadnt emerged from his ordeal for another week how could he have been lost at mount aspiring and back in auckland at the same time how could he have been in two places at once had he gone astray on a vacation hike popped out to check in his luggage and then disappeared back into the woods again damn unlikely what else then lewis stared at the number what if there were two robert norses one going missing on january another checking his gear six days later odd coincidence maybe the newspaper stories he dug up referred then to another man entirely two robert norses going to the pole no way how did antarctic authorities know a person was who he said he was nobody had asked lewis for id once hed cleared customs hed shown up in new zealand identified himself to warehousing authorities been checked off a list and issued the necessary paperwork and polar gear was the second man really robert norse or someone claiming to be him and which norse had emerged from the new zealand wilderness two weeks later too rushed to answer any questions what if the man under the dome wasnt the real robert norse at all what if the hiking disappearance had allowed an impostor to take his place that somehow their norse had followed the other norse to new zealand cleared customs under his real name and passport made sure of norses disappearance assumed his role boarded the plane to the pole lewis flipped off the computer and stood up dizzy excited and still bewildered who then was doctor bob and how to prove that he and the real norse werent the same man chapter twentyfive bob ive got a problem norse looked at abby quizzically his powerful fingers splayed to hold down something he was writing on his desk as if it might somehow blow away the cursive letters hidden as he did so in an instant he went from the distraction of his thought to focusing intently on her a cautious smile on his lips alert ready once again she felt his peculiar magnetism there was a strength to him that she found disquietingly alluring and with his hair coming back he was more handsome than ever there was also a strain to his gaze now the kind of weariness shed noticed in rod cameron a pain to his slight smile the pole wore on you it was wearing on all of them shed seen it in the others of course a closing up like the petals of a flower at dusk nancy hodge had retreated to biomed taking her meals there and tending to the burnt clyde skinner for the first time since arriving on station shed locked its door insisting that anyone else needing help must knock first several of the men had camped in the library like a squad from an occupying army sprawling on the couches in sullen encampment while they watched a marathon stream of fuzzy video movies a distracting blur of car chases and explosions and halfdressed women that they napped through in depressed exhaustion their talk was in monosyllables their concentration wandering mostly they tried to sleep linda brown was allowing the galley to slip toward disorder a glacial backlog of unscrubbed pans grinding toward the sink their food consumed without being logged gina brindisi was lost in old letters in her room dana andrews was typing in the computer room at a terminal that didnt work its hard disk shorted out in the comms room explosion explaining the clack of the keys was helping her memorize the damning report she planned to write when everything was over and the greenhouse had been clearcut abby had gone there after lewiss exhausted return confused by his discoveries and seeking inspiration for what to do next instead she found its benches covered with a brown carpet of withered leaves lena jindrova had snipped the yellowing plants off at their base or hauled them out of their hydroponic tanks leaving them dry and dead the last greenery had been snuffed out fearing for lenas wellbeing shed found the young woman sitting in a corner of the galley with coffee staring morosely at the station dartboard which had been covered with some kinds of paper we are either leaving this place or we are dying lena explained dully when abby asked what had happened to the plants i didnt want them suffering from neglect plants dont suffer the young czech used her finger to cut patterns into a coffee ring on the formica of the galley table alarmingly depressed do you think not with no sun and no warmth do you think these pretty plants are happy way down here in the dark and the cold the dying is going to stop lena i do not have that feeling it is just beginning is the feeling i have were going to learn whats going on abby insisted people are going to come together over this no people are abandoning hope did you see the board there somebody covered it no more games no more matches with the kiwis because no more radio because the fixing is not going so well so dana and carl got drunk last night and taped their research proposals to the board and threw the darts at them they have given up because we are alone down here and we are forgotten we arent forgotten im sure the rest of the world is wondering what happened to us trying to contact us well get comms up and running no we are forgotten we are not people to them i think just some name some file some record we are trapped down here and so now i am done with my plants name file record and with that abby suddenly had an idea what to do how to follow up lewiss discovery so now she was in the office norse had taken over from the dead cameron trying to mask her own nervousness in approaching the enigmatic psychologist trying to act casual in seeking something that could save them all norse looked at her warily i hope youre not here about lewis i know you dont believe hes guilty but keeping him in the sauna is the only thing keeping him safe no its not about jed she said i know you have no choice im not sure myself that he is who he says he is she watched norse closely when she said this but he showed no reaction if the man was a liar he composed his emotions like a schedule my problems more mundane she went on ive got a toothache norse frowned dental problems could become a real hazard in the isolation of the pole everyone had thorough exams before coming down because bad teeth could produce either agony or in summer an expensive evacuation have you talked to nancy yes and she suspects it might be a problem with a loose crown she needs to see my x rays apparently theyre in the office here i thought she had her own set the one she has is fogged maybe it went through an airport detector and theres another here yes nancy knew that camerons old office had a storage closet that included a complete set of dental x rays for every winterover at amundsenscott base they were required of all american personnel in antarctica one reason was to screen for problems that could be crippling in a remote camp another more morbid rationale was to have on file a means if aircraft crashed and bodies were burnt of identifying the dead for safe redundancy two sets came down one sent by medical authorities and the second handcarried by the winterover i dont even know where they are he confessed havent had time to poke around nancy said rod kept them in boxes in the closet he glanced over his shoulder at a storage closet behind him you want me to find them ill get them he looked at her speculatively here was an opportunity to repair a relationship perhaps shed been avoiding him up to now okay the woman nodded her thanks weve been through some rough times abby he tried its important we all come together in a situation like this i know she looked a little impatient shed said her tooth was hurting but he couldnt help but plunge ahead abby his failure with her represented a rare defeat it gnawed at him i realize youve been upset about lewis but i dont know what else i can do for him until we get comms up and running and some of this sorted out i i know i came on a little strong with you at the party i wonder if we could at least be good friends she swallowed we are friends bob just not that kind of friend he got up from his desk and moved around to her the group worries me frankly its weaker than i was expecting im trying to hold people together but theres a real chance someones going to get in a fight or try to run away or get emotional and do something dangerous the beakers are the worst because they have the least to do now that the grid is down if theres trouble id like to be able to count on you of course you can he took her right hand in both of his enclosing it the grip was not tight but the power there was unmistakable it emanated from him like a force if anything bad happens id like you to stay by me im thinking of assigning pairs a kind of buddy system and id like to partner with you boygirl mostly i think each gender has its strengths and could help look after the other and i know its a little sexist but id like to think i could help protect you in a crisis do you understand what i mean she smiled more bravely than she felt actually confused by what he meant what crisis i guess so she evaded she needed to get to that box i would like to know you better bob thats one reason i came down for the winter to get close to people with jed locked away im learning how important that might be he was looking at her with an intensity she found unnerving she wished hed sit back down are you abby pulled out of his grip but not right now not with a toothache let me get nancy to look at this and decide what we can do after i get fixed maybe we can talk maybe you can tell me more about yourself im very curious youre kind of mysterious you know she got a glimpse of his annoyance at her elusiveness and then his face masked over everyones mysterious even to themselves well my mystery is my own dental work im going to dig out that file he shrugged stepping away of course i hope nancy can help get you a painkiller or something obviously dissatisfied he sat down and went back to writing it looked personal like some kind of diary abby went around the desk and into the storage closet finding the cardboard box that nancy had described lifting it down she began rifling through it praying he wouldnt come help she could feel him glance over occasionally to watch her im surprised you can think to write after all thats happened she called even concentrate what is it there was a long silence then a shuffling of paper a narrative of an important time he finally said explaining things to myself thats what writing does doesnt it that and explaining things to the world she found what she was looking for slipped it into her own file folder and put the box back its too bad clyde was burnt in the explosion she commented as she went back past his desk clutching the x rays the repair work would go a lot faster with his expertise awful norse said he straightened a little yet disaster can bring out the best in people as well its a kind of test i think being cut off from communication from the outside world has forced us to rely a little bit more on ourselves like you and me its terrible to say so but the trauma has given a real edge to my research she smiled hoping for the worst she tried to keep it light without any edge to it shrink nirvana sounds awful doesnt it he shook his head at himself i find myself in an awkward position between participant and observer victim and beneficiary our leader now no no camp counselor maybe our director his look was sardonic no matter how well you plan things everything comes out differently you make things up as you go along and how do you know where youre trying to go bob she seemed genuinely interested im a psychologist inside instead of outside soul instead of stars at some fundamental level im not sure theyre all that different the goal of any life is to justify yourself to yourself or at least explain yourself that sounds like what a shrink would say thats what an honest man would say she left and he watched her go with a concealed hunger her slim back the nape of her neck the curve of her hip that coy primness he wanted to possess and violate her presence was tormenting him like a hunger inflating his desire the more she put him off the more he wanted her but he couldnt let that interfere with the experiment couldnt let that interfere with himself still norse allowed himself the luxury of pondering her for a while considering their encounter shed been more receptive this time he thought as if she were thawing ice cream getting lewis out of the way had helped getting rid of him entirely would help more too bad there was just one more spryte but he needed to reserve that for himself norse imagined triumphing with her he her only hope of survival getting her to do the things he needed too bad she had a damn toothache maybe in the end they could leave together he looked at what he had just written i acted on the best plan i had at the time adaptable yes but always a step ahead always a step ahead it really would be quite the brilliant paper he took up his pen again it wasnt until later much later that another possibility occurred to him and he stood up from his desk suddenly alarmed damn her he wrenched open the closet door threw down the box abby had pawed through and flipped frantically to his own folder cursing as he did so he opened it his dental x rays were gone she was taking them to nancy hodge there were red droplets on the snow between the galley and biomed a bright disturbing trail that announced more trouble abby followed them at a trot the x rays in her mitten the door to the sick bay was locked and she groaned inwardly she remembered that the increasingly paranoid nancy hodge was locking herself in and the need to knock was maddening every second seemed vital norse was no fool and abby feared hed come storming out from his office at any moment she needed nancy to make the x ray comparison so they could get the others to help nancy open up she pounded anxiously with the flat of her hand there was a pause then a reply muffled by the door im busy there wasnt time to be busy they had to learn the truth about norse abby hammered on the door again impatient and irritated hurry up its an emergency ive got an emergency in here nancy please she heard a muffled oath and the bang of something being shut then the quick clump of footsteps the door opened and nancy looked out her eyes looking tired and harassed youll have to come back later im treating gina please ive got to talk to you now abby ive got blood all over the place in here abby stepped up to the level of biomed and peeked past nancy to the examining room beyond clyde skinner was lying on the lone bed his eyes bandaged gina brindisi was sitting on the table her face white and scared looking her pants on the floor one of her legs was smeared with blood a slashing wound on her calf looking partly sewn up my god what happened nancy looked back over her shoulder at gina she tripped over some damn pike or battleax calhoun made were all going to poke each others eyes out with those things its crazy ive got to finish up these stitches to stop the bleeding cant we talk for a second first abby shes leaking all over the damn table are you hurt or sick no then come back later she started to close the door wait abby thrust her boot inside preventing its closure its about everything thats happening im trying to patch up everything thats happening ill talk to you later please nancy was annoyed now get your foot out of my door damn you and damn this place anyway abby was thinking furiously how much time before norse figured out what she was up to she couldnt wait until later not if she was going to try to get into norses room for more evidence she needed to be in two places at once and now nancy was distracted listen to me abby hissed urgently listen or were all going to die her determination interrupted nancys impatience piercing the doctors anger for just a moment the medic was listening norse is not norse abby insisted in a low voice do you understand bob is not bob hes someone else some impostor and that means he could be behind all this craziness thats been going on i cant come back later i have to find the one thing that will convince the rest of you so im going to send jed over here instead okay im going to send lewis he can explain nancy looked wary curious fearful hes locked up im going to let him out its important nancy you have to trust him you have to trust me its our only chance the doctor shook her head i dont trust anyone anymore abby thrust the folder of x rays at her these are norses dental x rays youve got another set here i need you to compare the two as soon as you stitch up gina hurry before bob comes abby just do it youll see im going to send jed to fill you in and then im going to come back if i find what i think ill find then the three of us will go to the others nancy took the folder uncertainly i dont understand just look at the two sets see if they match please nancy i think youre our last chance last chance to get away from the pole alive lewis darted across the snow under the dome like a wraith for what he hoped was the last time carrying as a crude defense one of the ice axes hed used as a grappling hook he had descended like a spider back into the dome the night before pausing on the roof to untie the hook from the rope and thrust it in his belt then he doubled the rope around one of the framing braces on the dome its ample length allowed him to descend back into his imprisonment on the doubled line and then retrieve the entire rope by pulling on one end reeling it in until it slipped out of the dome brace and fell down on the snow he hid the rope behind comms and tucked the axes in a maintenance closet near the sauna then hed waited in his cedar jail in an agony of impatience anxious to see if abby could figure a way to follow up on the mystery shed finally come to him panting like a sprinter gasping out the tale of her acquisition of norses x ray and its delivery to nancy hodge the doctor had been too busy to listen abby said hurriedly because she was bandaging up gina but now nancy was waiting for him in biomed and abby was about to pursue a hunch about what she might find in norses room it was all hunches now a gamble that they could save all their lives by uncovering the truth about one yet what if he was wrong then the only alternative might be the kind of desperate escape tyson had resorted to stealing the other spryte and setting off for mcmurdo probably dying in the attempt now he looked around carefully to avoid interception but surprisingly no one was around eating moping arguing maybe norse had started some kind of bizarre encounter group he slipped into the archway surprised at how easy this was and went to the door of the medics module he reached for the freezerlike door handle and stopped it was hanging askew its lock apparently broken hadnt nancy said they didnt lock the sick bay why was it pried open now hesitantly he knocked no reply the door creaked open a quarter inch nancy no answer he pounded harder hodge you in there again silence its lewis we need to talk then a faint moan help it was clyde skinner for gods sake help where was nancy he shoved open the broken door and stepped inside shutting it against the cold clyde who is it who is it it was skinner all right the burnt radioman he was lying in the sick bay bed with his face swathed in bandages blind and helpless clutching his sheets its lewis ive come to help lewis his voice betrayed dread you set the bomb no i didnt clyde someones setting me up the man lay quietly looking afraid what happened biomed was locked wheres nancy youve come to kill me too havent you no no no im trying to help what the hell happened wheres abby i dont know nancy told me to talk only to abby well wheres nancy i dont know i dont know there was a noise like something breaking and nancy yelled someone inside and then lots of banging around and then it went quiet i thought youd all abandoned me i thought youd left the station and left me behind lewis glanced around biomed was a mess there was blood all over the examining table gina must have really been cut more ominously drawers hung half open cabinet doors were swung wide and medical supplies had cascaded onto the floor notebooks had spilled a glacier of paper the place had been ransacked where the hell was nancy the storage door in back was cracked open he went to the entrance and tried to push open the door but something was blocking it he shoved enough to get an arm through the opening and turned on the light to see what was in the way legs lewis felt a sick dread he pushed harder and something heavy skidded aside allowing him to squeeze through he stumbled inside and looked down in grim confirmation at nancy hodge her eyes rolled back and mouth open a hypodermic needle jutting from the back of her neck a set of x rays was resting on her body he knelt and glanced at a manila folder it read abby dixon the assailant was still confusing the trail he felt vainly for a pulse their doctor was dead there were no obvious cuts and bruises but not even junkies injected themselves in the nape of the neck it was obvious that someone had crept up behind her and injected her killed her before she could talk about the x rays killed her before she could talk about norse no escape no radio and now no doctor no proof he glanced around xray records were upended and the storage cabinet against the rear wall had been shoved aside exposing a metal panel screwed to the wall scratched and dirty lewis slowly stood they were doomed except someone had been searching biomed and that searching meant maybe nancy had hidden the two sets of x rays what if norse hadnt found them yet another faint tremor of hope the shifted storage cabinet appeared to hold nothing but medical supplies the panel behind it required a screwdriver so he moved out into the main sick bay and began his own search whats going on whats happening skinner asked from his bed his voice fearful it wasnt just his pain it was agonizing not to see nancys dead clyde oh my god he moaned not her too it wasnt me who killed her you have to believe that skinner was silent did you see anything is that a joke lewis grimaced sorry dead how his tone was hopeless an injection maybe murder was norse here no voice just funny noises like what youre doing now but who was it who was here before me clyde i dont know there was a tremor in his voice he was afraid think i might need your help please dont kill me lewis i didnt see anything christ he gave up on skinner and turned to the drawers the room didnt take that long to search nothing he took them lewis muttered took what something nancy had does it matter he stood despairing how could he convince the others it matters because it means that i am well and truly screwed he looked back at nancys body frustrated and depressed and thats the first intelligent observation youve made since you came here a different voice said it was someone at the doorway lewis turned norse the psychologist stepped inside and turned to address a group of men behind him we finally caught him in the act he announced pulaski geller calhoun and perlin followed crowding one end of biomed a posse rousted from the videos in the library bleary and belligerent the open door let in a freezerlike chill the spilled papers shifting in the draft abbys x rays slid off nancys still chest with a sigh it wasnt me lewis tried its never you is it jed norse replied softly lewis picked up his ice ax in instinctive defense trying to buy a moments time composing what he had to say but before he could speak pulaski shot forward in sudden assault the cooks flying tackle hurling lewis backward against a set of wall shelves the air whooshing out of him and the ice ax spinning into a corner the shelves gave way crashing down around his head dimly he realized geller and calhoun and perlin were charging too wait he yelled pulaski butted his face with his bald head bloodying lewiss nose and one of the others struck him in the stomach lewis couldnt breathe he feebly tried to rise but the cook gripped him in a wrestling hold twisted his arm and expertly flipped him onto his belly other strong hands caught his wrists and ankles and twisted electrical cords around them theyd trailed him to biomed waited while he scampered across the snow crept up while he was discovering the body geller grunted and stood up stepping over lewis into the storeroom beyond nancys dead he confirmed lewis had been hit so hard he was seeing stars it was difficult to think no he wheezed i found clyde you all right calhoun asked skinner whats going on whats going on its doctor bob norse said we caught lewis preparing to kill you oh my god wheres abby were looking for her too you seen her skinner said nothing he was shaking with fear she comes here you notify us okay the blind man went rigid as if waiting for a blow norse crouched by lewiss head looking disgusted who let you out x rays it was dixon wasnt it ask clyde jed lewis he said solemnly by the emergency powers confirmed to me by the agreement of our peers in an emergency situation i place you under arrest for the murder of nancy hodge he was choking trying to get the words out bastard and for the murders of gabriella reid rod cameron harrison adams and mickey moss perhaps manslaughter for the flight of buck tyson for the blinding of clyde skinner for terrorism and emotional assault for theft and false witness for stalking and betrayal youve jeopardized the very existence of amundsenscott station lewiss lower face was a mask of blood his throat hacked his ribs sore lie norse stood you all saw it he told the others we caught him in the act this time he broke into biomed after id ordered nancy to lock it for her own safety but were not savages were going to have a trial what can we do with him even if hes guilty it was gage perlin looking at the trussed lewis with frank fear he already busted out of the sauna its like he never stays put he gets out and something happens its my fault this occurred norse said i wouldnt listen to the rest of you i wouldnt act when the rest of you wanted to i wanted to go slow but this time i am going to listen to you this time were going to end this nightmare once and for all no lewis coughed hes not something in norse snapped he kicked lewis knocking the wind out of him again it was as if he were furious with himself for having been blinded by the mans ruses shut up lewis just shut up he turned to the others we need to locate abby find out what her role was in all this lewis closed his eyes and spit out some blood he writhed helplessly on the floor his cheek on cold linoleum his vision a cluster of white polar boots abby he thought dont let them do this to you too chapter twentysix i think all of you believe in the rule of law norse began to the assembled winterovers in the galley all of you believe in unity all of you believe in fairness and no one has tried harder than myself to keep a rein on our emotions to counsel moderation to avoid irrevocable actions but in a truly extreme situation extreme measures become inevitable and an extreme situation is exactly what jed lewis has put us in lewis sat in a chair with his hands and feet tied pulaski standing over him the geologist was bruised dried blood on his face his hair in an unwashed tangle his look at norse was of sullen amazement anger and disbelief but he once more felt overmastered the fear and the hostility the others directed against him were as heavy and oppressive as the stickiness before a thunderstorm hed become the new tyson we dont have any communications norse went on we obviously dont have a proper jail what we do have is a seductive glib psychotic who has not only killed our only medical doctor but has been mocking us and toying with us from the beginning the psychologist looked intently at the others were ten thousand miles from home stranded without help at the darkest coldest place on earth a quarter of us are already dead a determined saboteur could doom us all its time for the group to come together for the group to decide how were going to get rid of a murderous infection hes lying lewis spat his voice thick and slurred after pulaskis head butt hes not who he says he is hes the one whos psychotic ask him who he really is norse ignored this no one was fooled more than i was no one liked jed lewis better than i did i was his first friend i ran with him in the three hundred degree club but we found him today with the body of nancy hodge and with that even i had to admit id been wrong about our fingie did we see him kill her no but we have to act on what we know and what do we know we know he has a connection to every bad thing that has happened on this station molotov growled that all this started when lewis came i was looking for the x rays dammit ask him about the x rays thats the key to this whole thing we know it was mr lewis who put a value on that meteorite norse went on and that shortly afterward the meteorite went missing he apparently saw where doctor moss hid it was he the thief i cant prove it youll remember that cameron told jed about the abandoned base and that he asked us about it then mickey moss died down there does that prove anything no does it disprove anything he went last when we crawled to that pit where we found mickey geller remembered the farthest from that hole like he knew it was there he sent the email dana shouted listen to me lewis groaned norse came to new zealand at two different times youre listening to an impostor they looked at him with disbelief their attention was on norse and his recital theyd stopped listening because they wanted their nightmare to stop danas right the psychologist went on remember what happened harrison adams found someone had sent moss an email about the meteorite from jeds computer in clean air i thought a killer would be more careful than to use his own machine but perhaps not during a blizzard lewis leaves his post despite orders from our station manager to stay there adams disappears at the same time who finds his body lewis whos holding a cut heat tape lewis and heres where i made my mistake i proposed a simple quarantine instead of confinement while we investigated the situation i wrongly focused on tyson and so who asks to meet with rod cameron who was continuing to investigate the two deaths lewis and rod ends up dead i never even saw cameron i never went to the fuel arch norse looked grimly at a group transfixed by this history he was reciting what they knew he was preaching to the choir it wasnt until latertoo late in fact that i was exploring rods office after the explosion and found this letter he held up a sheet of paper with lewiss signature on it the same one hed showed abby it promises that rod can save his career if he lets lewis have the meteorite he thought cameron might have it and was still determined to get it any way he could its a forgery he tricked me into signing that norse passed the letter around we thought it was tyson but wasnt it with lewiss arrival that our animosity towards buck began to grow did jed foster that frankly its difficult to remember but tyson fled because he feared he couldnt get a fair hearing not with jed lewis in this group and now he too is probably dead i had nothing to do with so we welcome lewis into our little fraternity we party something goes wrong between him and gabriella and again he is on hand for the discovery of her body the cutup magazine to make a note the ashes in his room weve been through this already think lewis pleaded why would i lead you to my victims youre not the first murderer to do so jed norses observation was dispassionate sad shut up and let bob finish pulaski added then its your turn so we lock him up the psychologist resumed but before we can ask the authorities back home what action we should take our communications center explodes from an apparent booby trap blinding one of our key individuals lewis could have created the conditions for that explosion at any time after we curfewed our communications yet despite all this a young woman someone lewis has been seducing from the beginning and who has apparently been blinded herself by infatuation springs him from his cell now shes disappeared and perhaps with good reason within minutes hours at most our medic is dead as a result of abby dixons romantic foolishness and again jed lewis is discovered with the body is abby an accomplice or has he now killed abby dixon as well i told you hes a bloody psycho dana muttered this is admittedly circumstantial norse went on weaving the prosecution case lewis has been careful to cover his tracks and to strike unobserved when his victims are alone or at least when any witness is too blind to identify him like poor clyde yet sometimes victims can strike back from the grave nancy hodge was drugged but before she died she pulled out the one piece of identification that pinpoints her assailant there was a folder on her body yes abbys lewis said impatiently does that make her the killer nancy was smart and the murderer was in too much of a hurry to look at her folder norse went on it was a grave mistake because when we looked at the x rays he glanced at the cook they were jeds pulaski concluded quietly the group began to buzz like a disturbed hive what had lewis been mumbling about x rays lewis felt dizzy the cook pulled out the film of his teeth and it began to be passed around the room like damning proof everything had gone horribly wrong im sure you can appreciate how embarrassing this is for me norse said sadly i came down here thinking i was a pretty good shrink i thought i was a decent judge of character i bet that jed lewis could be trusted i told rod he could be trusted i stuck up for him when the rest of you were suspicious but i was wrong dead wrong and i mean dead in the most literal way i dont expect you to forgive me i certainly wont forgive myself all i ask is that we act and act now act how gina brindisi said in a small voice norse took a breath jed lewis appears to have directly or indirectly killed six people maybe seven if hes butchered abby its not for me to say if we know that beyond a reasonable doubt its for you but for our own survival and peace of mind we cant wait out the winter we cant wait for distant rescue the final say has to be a group decision but you want to execute him norse looked at gina sadly i dont want to execute anyone none of us does but what then geller asked where can we keep him i want antarctica to do it there was a long silence as they realized what he meant you mean put him outside the dome pulaski clarified where he can sabotage even more dana objected norse shook his head i want him tied out on the snow until he cant do us any more harm if we remove most of his clothing it wont take very long its not that cruel a death hell shiver and go to sleep and none of us have to be the executioner they looked at lewis uneasily hateful fearful sad hes a shrink dammit lewis shouted hes playing with your minds all this trouble started when jed lewis arrived norse summed up i predict it will end when jed lewis is no longer a factor i dont want to risk anyone else were facing a catastrophe and have only each other to rely on i wont do it alone but ill do it with you well do it together as a group in unity and then it will all be over if we freeze him can we reopen the station mendoza asked get back to work we can if you believe hes your killer listen to me lewis groaned norse is not norse hes an impostor hes manipulating you hes playing with the station for some kind of sick experiment is that so pulaski asked he shook his head wondering what fantasy lewis would weave next i called out to learn about him and nothing adds up you dialed up from the sauna geller said derisively no nooo lewis said how to get through to them i got outside the dome went to clean air i started the generator at the emergency camp and rerouted some power bullshit the domes sealed i went out through the vent hole at the top how with a stepladder i used one of jerrys balloons ask him ones missing they turned to follett who looked puzzled a balloon to carry a rope up to the top of the dome i know it sounds crazy but it worked how did you get my balloons i stole one lewis said less desperation in his voice now at least they were paying attention so youre a thief it was flat confirmation to get out follett waved his hand dismissively i dont believe a word you say go count count what ive lost track of my balloons it proves nothing damn right it doesnt geller said youve heard bob now hear me lewis insisted desperately everything hes told you is backward everything hes told you has been twisted around theres a psychologist named robert norse who got lost in new zealand who died i think and our norse followed him and took his place and came down here to to to what pulaski asked i dont know to screw us up somehow but thats not the real norse he pointed to bob who is he then i dont know the others groaned norse had a pitying smile no listen he came to auckland after the real norse had disappeared on some hike or climb gabriella had the date nancy hodge was going to compare the dental x rays norse sent in advance to nsf with the ones this impostor brought down with him but when i went to see her she was already dead think why would i kill her because maybe you are the impostor molotov said slowly you the geologist doing weather which makes no sense you who show up at the last minute you who knew about the value of the meteorite you whose x rays are on the dead body norse planted them there why would i leave them because we found you before you looked at them geller growled just like bob said what jed has just told you is completely absurd norse added unnecessarily hes looking for some chance to escape dana said some chance to kill again dammit im trying to save the rest of you then where are these x rays you claim incriminate me norse demanded lets see this supposed proof i dont know he admitted more quietly i dont have them and i dont have them either i looked for my x rays after we captured you and theyve disappeared very convenient isnt it for you to remove any chance for me to prove my own innocence your whole story is tissue lewis i dont even believe you got out of the dome inspiration struck really because i can prove that part to you the rope i used is hidden in the snow behind comms would i have put a rope there if im not telling the truth go out to a working computer like i did use the satellites like i did and look for what mendoza said people with the same common name just do it and draw your own conclusions carl norse looked uncertain maybe you planted that rope as an alibi come on you know thats crazy i didnt plan this look lets go out into the dome if you dont believe me there was an uneasy silence they wanted it over they just wanted it to be him lets look steve calhoun the carpenter finally said standing up im not exposing anybody until im certain i dont know what a rope proves but if its there we can at least see if its long enough its long i doubled it in a loop so i could pull it back down maybe long enough to hang you if it comes to that pulaski warned if im telling the truth will you look into the rest of it they were wary but here was something easy to check the assembly pulled on parkas and boots and went outside circling behind comms there i buried it there several moved forward and dug with their mittens nothing lewis was confused no it was there somewhere dig more he watched them with growing hopelessness as they dug and kicked the rope was gone everything youve ever told us has been a lie hasnt it pulaski said quietly all this slaughter for a damn meteorite lewis felt dizzy he was exhausted from fighting them everything he tried made things worse he slumped on his knees on the snow then ask abby he groaned we cant find abby dana said please lock me up if you dont believe me just check out bob before you put me out in the cold his gaze flickered from one face to another looking for an ally several looked away we tried that geller told the others and every time we do another of us winds up dead chapter twentyseven they unwired and unbolted the smaller door that led to the dome ramp breaching their fortress for this one grave duty then they filed upward to the plateau like a hooded procession of monks lewis bound and hobbled everyone was there because norse insisted that everyone be there that they make this decision together that they unify as a group when we explain that we did this to save the station it has to be unanimous he told them beyond a reasonable doubt several looked sick but they came along the night outside was green and gold and red a shimmer of auroral light caught by the earths magnetic field lewis was going to die under the colors of christmas the stars had added their illumination to the starlit glow of snow and the plateau was a silver mirror of color a spangle of galaxies they glittered above and glittered below like the spark of mickeys neutrinos the survivors marched on a platter of stars a long metal tube used for ice coring was solemnly screwed into the snow at the south pole stake until it was as rigid and strong as a fence post they would tie lewis there the temperature was almost a hundred degrees below zero again the air still its kinder than what he did to our friends pulaski told the others to help stiffen their resolve hell go quickly and then it will be over they wrestled lewis out of his parka and slit open his windpants the sting of the invading cold instantaneous they disregarded his wince their souls were as frozen as the pole now their mood vengeful theyd had enough they were going to extinguish their own fear youre killing an innocent man lewis gasped as the cold hit him when im gone it will all start again and then this will be on your conscience too cant we gag him geller asked hes trying to divide us mendoza added no let him talk norse said let him predict so that when it does end after hes gone you can all take heart in the knowledge that you did the right thing they looked at lewis waiting for him to say more and in the end he didnt know what more to say when they lashed him to the coring tube it burned through his thermal undershirt like hot iron he writhed against it struggling to think already in mental shock because the absurdity of his dilemma was overwhelming hed come to the bottom of the world for companionship and his companions were about to kill him hed come for purpose and instead had found death the sky was the most glorious hed ever seen and he was about to see nothing ever again it was insane he wanted to weep but his tears had frozen too how long will it take lena jindrova asked her voice trembling hell be lucky to last half an hour pulaski replied this doesnt feel right she whispered norse put his arm around her its right if we do it together the coring tube was high enough that it was impossible for lewis to slip his bonds over the top of it they stood in a semicircle around him and watched for a moment sickly fascinated but he was beginning to shiver and no one wanted to watch this death for very long the slow freezing that all of them unconsciously feared do we really all have to be out here gina brindisi asked it has to be unanimous norse said so theres no fingerpointing afterward so we can come together afterward im not taking any satisfaction in this she said i am geller muttered i hope it fucking hurts when the shivering stops so will the pain pulaski promised his brain will shut down pretty fast he finished his knots and stepped back they watched lewis clench against the cold and then go into a quick spasm of shivering his stare hollow now and far away then hed shake again rattling against the stake like a husk in the wind im leaving gina threatened a few others nodded norse turned away as well addressing the others this is pretty difficult for some of us a hard choice hard to watch hard for me we dont need any more nightmares can you stand watch cueball youve been a soldier id like to take the rest of us back to the dome weve got some healing to do the cook looked at the hopeless lewis go heal they turned a depleted platoon lewis hanging from the coring tube as if he were about to be shot six dead a seventh dying abby missing skinner blinded and months of isolation to go it had been a disaster to allow the fingie to come at the last minute a disaster not to have screened him first not to have incorporated him from the beginning not to have learned something about his warped personality a disaster to trust their next job was to find abby deal with her and then somehow piece the station back together endure the dark winter wait again for the first blush of sunlight and with it their distant rescue goodbye jed gina said sorrowfully as they began to move away good riddance calhoun amended they started to follow their own boot prints back to the dome and then a shout from the crest of the ramp two figures stumbling toward them again they had the anonymous hoods up but the one in the lead was obviously abby struggling over the sastrugi drifts of snow because she was bent with some burden on her back her left hand was extended to her companion who could only be skinner stop she shouted again her high voice drifted a crystal note a bell on the stillness of the plateau let him go dont listen to her norse warned hed stiffened but they did stop until she stormed up gasping for breath her gaiter a white beard of ice straightening her back she rolled something off that looked like a squat mortar and let it fall with a plop on the snow skinner stopped beside her swaying unsteadily goggles missing but his eyes swathed his head cocked at an angle toward a sky he couldnt see so that he could hear better from one ear at the edge of his hood he looked stricken are you all insane abby challenged pointing past them to lewis get his damn parka back on its too late dixon norse said coldly you let your lover out to kill again and he went after our most important member our doctor the group has made a decision to put an end to this nightmare youve got a lot to answer for yourself push things now and therell be serious repercussions is that a threat bob if you like abby turned from the psychologist so now hes got you to do his killing for him she asked her eyes sweeping the group they huddled like uncertain deer newly bewildered by her arrival depleted of their certainty by her own anger get his clothes back on him carl she told mendoza youre executing the wrong man youre bewitched by lewis abby dana tried im an admirer of a man struggling to do the right thing by god get some clothes on him hes going to get frostbite if you dont move give some time to hear me out ive got proof proof that youre all being set up youve got all winter to execute him if im wrong but you let the killer out of the sauna dana accused maybe we should tie you out there too i let jed out of the sauna and whos killing who dana there was an uneasy silence people shuffling in the cold the awful irrevocability of what they were doing began to sink in lets put his clothes back on pulaski finally muttered to mendoza shes right theres time what if were wrong lets sort this out no norse snapped suddenly furious carl dont you dare the astronomer blinked in surprise the psychologists loss of cool was unaccustomed and his implicit threat opened a wedge of doubt it wasnt like norse to snap at anybody especially a beaker hesitantly mendoza took a step toward the stake dont you touch those ropes it was a hiss they all looked at norse uncertainly now surprised by his emotion it wasnt lewis skinner suddenly hollered youre freezing the wrong man the winterovers jerked at this loud pronouncement and that was enough to suddenly make the astronomer stride to the stake cursing at everyone and everything and begin untying lewis start talking abby he said fiercely as he worked clumsily start talking and if you dont make your case ill strangle this bastard with my own hands the ropes began to fall on the snow no one moved to stop what he was doing youre making it worse norse warned his voice trembling slightly he was tensing his eyes flickering from the object abby had dumped in the snow to the others around him when you remember the truth the execution will be worse the killing stops now abby countered lewis was mumbling incoherently uncertain what mendoza was even doing his mind already numb from the cold he was disoriented gina began to sniffle yeah start talking gearloose geller said what the hell is that he pointed toward the mortarlike object its doctor bobs telescope kit abby replied fat suckers like this are called dobsons hobbyists use em right bob you stole that from my room his voice had a quiet menace i broke into your room because i was looking for evidence to set things straight couldnt find a thing not even my picture youre careful bob i give you that but then it occurred to me to lift up your telescope shes in love with lewis norse told the others shes gone crazy herself shes trying to twist things the same way he does but shes not dangerous like him we dont need to kill her just get her some help abby ignored this nancy hodge did leave us a clue bob but not jeds x rays why do his teeth prove anything he looked belligerent how do you even know about jeds x rays oh i was listening to your kangaroo court from above from behind the bar he started at his own failure to check above the galley and frowned furious with himself for not apprehending her we caught him in the act abby he blustered give it up you caught him in the act of discovering the body of a woman youd already killed abby corrected she glanced past him to where lewis was slumping forward as the bonds came free mendoza began to help the shivering man into his parka your silly recitation of evidence did give me an idea though i knew nancy had no reason to pull jeds x ray and put it in my folder you did that but i did think she might have successfully hidden the ones that really counted like you said hodge was smart so while you assembled your lynch mob i went back to talk to clyde here you wouldnt let anyone talk to him because youd been in biomed just before lewis and were afraid of what he might say so i talked to him and do you know what he was lying on she held up the sheet in her mitten which they now saw was photographic film your dental x ray bob the one i took from rods files the one you brought down to antarctica with you the reason you couldnt find it is because nancy had already hidden it under clydes pillow shed also hidden the earlier set sent down by nsf two dental x rays supposedly of the same man she looked past him to the others they dont match i had some work done he bluffed you sure did you gained four molars there was a murmur of confusion and then slow realization of what the x rays might mean one set sent by nsf of the original norse a man perhaps still lost in new zealand and a second brought by his replacement showing a different set of teeth lewis was being dressed mendoza pulling the clothes onto his trembling limbs as if lewis were a young child who are you bob abby asked youre not the robert norse the national science foundation selected to come down here he disappeared in new zealand six days after he went missing you followed him into the woods then you materialized in christchurch and flew to antarctica before too many awkward questions could be asked are you even a psychologist at all thats a lie he shouted to the others shes covering up for lewis youre the liar skinner hollered his ear turned to the debate because his eyes were bandaged i heard you in with nancy before she fell you blinded me you sonofabitch but you didnt kill me and that was your first big mistake i smelled you doctor bob i wasnt sure just who was who but abby brought your aftershave from your room and i remembered it when you lose your eyes your nose starts to remember i smelled your aftershave i smelled your fear when nancy died thats absurd norse snorted a couple days of blindness and clyde is some kind of bloodhound to a scent dixon brought him come on what kind of aftershave does lewis use lewis stinks calhoun drawled hes been in jail someone barked a laugh and with that norse realized he was beginning to lose them the spell was breaking nancy mixed up the x rays norse tried this is all a misunderstanding dont let this woman set the killer loose where he can attack you all im going to get him back inside mendoza said quietly the astronomers manner embarrassed and subdued im going to get him warm putting his arm around the shuddering lewis he began walking him back to the dome nobody made a move to stop them the groups righteousness had deflated a growing dread was replacing it i knew i needed something better to convince the rest of you abby went on ignoring norse and addressing the others not circumstantial and confusing like a pair of x rays evidence that was absolutely rocksolid right so ive been desperately thinking it was the meteorite that started things the meteorite that disappeared have you stopped wondering where it went she kicked the dobson telescope with her boot and something clunked inside when i picked this up it was heavier and noisier than what i expected so i brought it out here on a bet alexi youre the one whos always accusing jed go ahead and look through it at the sky tell us what you see leave it alone norse yelled stepping to block the others from it just give it a try alexi the russian hesitated then stepped forward brusquely pushing the psychologist aside kneeling in the snow he set the dobson telescope upright and bent to the eyepiece cranking its focus first one way then the other finally he looked up it is dark i cannot see from this thing the telescope of bob does not work thats because its not finished yet norse said with exasperation i dont think its a telescope at all abby went on i think its a box a hiding place a way to smuggle down things that might otherwise be illegal something that cant be opened and thus something where no one would ever look and im betting if we cut it open anyway well find a missing meteorite inside it the group shuffled curiously forward making a half circle around the telescope skinner unzipped his parka and withdrew a hacksaw hed carried out dont you dare destroy my telescope ive spent a hundred hours on the damn thing ill make you a deal bob abby said if i cut into this and im wrong you can tie me to your sacrificial stake out there because right now im a threat to your life but if i cut into it and im right then youre the one we strap to the coring tube she knelt beside the telescope deal wait wait he looked at the others with increasing panic and confusion mendoza was disappearing down the ramp with the stumbling lewis the ropes that had tied lewis to the stake were in a tangle around its base the group was extending its own enclosing line flanking around him all right all right but let me cut it open for gods sake maybe that way i can at least repair it when you see how wrong you are abby hesitated holding the hacksaw norse reached out and snatched it from her okay he asked the others hurry up geller growled its cold out here norse began sawing through the fat telescope tube the dobson was only two and a half feet long but as rotund as a small keg its simple mirror arrangement collected huge amounts of light and was a costeffective astronomy tool for amateurs it could also hold a lot inside as the psychologist cut the top of the tube sagged down finally it split the front lens falling away and something the size of a large potato rolled down onto the snow it was the meteorite bloody hell dana whispered she planted it in there norse tried nobody believed him why gina breathed why kill so many norse glared at her then with a look so contemptuous and malevolent his face was transformed in an instant he went from reason to unreason from the solemn light to the hateful dark he was a man consumed by demons a deep inner rage he put his glove into the split shell of the telescope youve been killing yourselves he said ominously youve sabotaged your own little commune with fear mistrust blind faith and group delusion and once again im the one whos going to survive suddenly he sprang to his feet stiffarmed the unprepared clyde skinner to bowl him over and grabbed abby his forearm around her throat it was fluid an action that had been mentally rehearsed with the quick grace of an athlete she went rigid and yelled get him pulaski roared but before the survivors could rush norse lifted his other arm he had a pistol its muzzle gaping like the twin barrels of a shotgun it was crude and homemade with no apparent magazine or revolving chamber but was as black down its twin barrels as the bottom of the world they presumed the gun held at least two bullets back off or i kill some more norse growled they stopped frightened by the weapon he grinned at their acquiescence pinning abby tighter i told you not to open my telescope the things we share amundsenscott base was built by a nation that guarantees the pursuit of happiness a good psychologist will tell you that all of us chase that elusive and torturous goal by seeking four things the first is freedom freedom mine had been robbed by fat boy whose blundering mistake had bound my destiny to his and left me to drag his disgusting ghost of quivering blubber everywhere i went with his death choice collapsed in on me like the dirt of the grave security the kids and the mountain had robbed me of that too when i came down off that glacier i could never rest never rest my career became migratory my jobs makeshift and my savings sifted away i had no home no institution no identity except as the man they whispered about id whirl sometimes to catch them and theyd look at me like a curiosity pretending that they hadnt been judging but i knew better i knew better id been stripped of every certainty except my own moral innocence recognition all my life ive longed for respect my ideas are significant my insights are creative my mastery at the pole is a demonstration of ability already displayed a hundred times yet i was continually passed over snubbed outmaneuvered by lesser men and women the victim of gossip and innuendo and condescension it worsened after the climb every rejected paper was a rebuke every missed invitation was an accusation id been shorn of all respect judged guilty without trial damned for my own survival so at the very end i longed for the fourth thing the shrinks say we all need response for love and if not love then at least friendship and if not friendship then at least companionship and if not companionship then at least acknowledgment the comfort of knowing your words are listened to your comments receive response and at the south pole i thought id found that in the three hundred degree club i thought id found salvation the women shouldnt have betrayed me they shouldnt have betrayed me i was ready to stop you have to believe that i was ready to stop tyson had fled and it would be childs play to let all suspicion remain on him i had a case study to prove my point and a valuable meteorite to give me freedom and security i was on the very edge of happiness im sure of it yet dixon couldnt see my possibilities shed been blinded by a lesser man lewis and at my moment of triumph she ran to a man of clay so when i went to help the weeping gabriella that night i expected we could find some kind of solace with each other some kind of consolation what i wasnt counting on was her anger her fury at herself her foolish longing for love and her irrational focusing of her own poison on me she turned me down the slut after her rejection by lewis turned me down suddenly she wanted selfrespect i found myself out of control without understanding why i even cared damn her i was fighting with her holding her down my hands somehow around her throat im not that kind of man at allbut ordained by god it seems or doomed by the devil to finally take the station down with me i really didnt plan to end it this way i simply wanted to choke out every hateful thing i ever imagined people saying and as she died her eyes bulging her frantic bucks becoming more feeble her look became an accusatory question had i become a coward on that mountain if im to have any peace i have to erase them all chapter twentyeight but the hair on his head began to grow again norses voice crackled over the galley intercom as condescending sermon the paternal recitation of a school principal the experiment had been conducted and its meaning was about to be revealed so his own particular collection of winterover lab rats had been ordered at gunpoint to stay in the galley while he announced his intentions from camerons old office in the other module next to the radios hed destroyed abby was being held hostage to ensure their compliance until he completed his lecture and his preparations to leave the rest listened with gloomy apprehension then he pushed with all his might and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it hes gone balmy dana andrews whispered he always was pulaski said grimly angry at himself the more we listened to him the more over the edge he went it fed him we fed him what the hell is he talking about geller asked i think its stuff from the bible lewis said beginning to revive from his nearexecution he had just enough frostbite to make his nose and fingers sting like fire and his shudders were receding only with the help of some soup pulaski had microwaved the pain as his skin warmed helped keep him from collapsing he quoted some to me when i arrived its the story of samson destroying the temple of the philistines i aint no philistine thats something bad right it is if he pulls down our temple my god is he going to destroy the bloody station dana asked he might if we let him he gets off on toying with us the intercom crackled again weve finally been stripped of pretense havent we norse broadcast the disembodied sound had an eerie power and lewis realized that the psychologist had done what lewis had asked him not to do norse had gotten into their heads it wasnt just a voice vibrating in air his presence reverberated in their minds im revealed as oz puppeteer of souls youre exposed as a thin biologic film on the petri dish of the pole as easy to erase as a smear of mold you joined a society that cant protect you that cant even recognize its own internal danger how does that make you feel there was no way for them to reply ive been giving you an experience similar to that which i faced once norse went on a teacher to his students in the face of group incompetence i had to rely on myself for salvation ive been punished for it ever since so the question is was my misfortune simply a fateful tragedy of bad luck or is it modern civilization the age of the committee that is to blame are there so many of us now in so many clubs and consortiums and families and clans and boardrooms and unions and seminars and societies that weve forgotten how to think for ourselves act for ourselves be ourselves what happens when the lemmings lead us to nuclear armageddon or a stock market crash or global climate collapse or starvation from overpopulation or off the edge of a cliff will it be the feelgood commune that saves us or will it be individual preparation and reliance and free will when i acted for myself was i exhibiting the worst of human nature or the best i think evolution suggests the latter i think weve been so cushioned by mere numbers that weve forgotten what evolution demands he is a nazi is what he is molotov said grimly do scientists have even the slightest idea of the human hardness thats going to be required now to explore the extremes of the universe or survive among the evolving brilliance of machines just how strong is your collective not very strong is it you panicked you abandoned your work you locked yourself in you armed yourself you quarreled you turned on each other you were ready to kill each other the one who finally woke you up was lewis the fingie i set up as the outsider there was noise in the background a scrape of furniture shut up norse muttered they assumed he was speaking to abby civilization is a fraud he resumed his pontificating reminding lewis of mickey moss its a blip in time a blemish on a million years of humanoid existence society is a fraud they always fall always break down and when they do it comes down to individual survival when something new is built in the ruins its the strong individual the visionary the freethinker who points the way i followed the most fundamental of human instincts survival and they hounded me for it so i came down to their little jewel their farthest place the place of night and hypothermia to test social utopia and you snapped like a cord in this cold you wouldnt have survived thirty minutes by yourself you deluded bastard pulaski muttered there was no answer of course i hope you realize that youve made things far more terrible than i intended them to be norse went on i wasnt planning much more than an embarrassing psychological paper on station dysfunction illustrated by depression and mistrust but god had more in store for us it seems he planted an apple in eden mickey was so greedy to get back his meteorite and so pathetic at the end that he followed it and me right into the pit he begged to be let out again let out was lucifer let out he fell from grace hed chosen his own fate but the rest of you wouldnt stop you wouldnt stop first adams and then cameron it was you who turned on buck tyson not me you who mistrusted lewis not me you who missed every clue and misplaced every doubt i used carls candle to make a wax impression of buck tysons knife locker lock i didnt forge lewiss name i got him to write it for me when i wondered how lewis had escaped the dome all i had to do was look down at the icicles stabbed into the snow guess what hed done and find the rope to confirm it i wanted to humiliate your little society not destroy it id made my point but you wouldnt stop he took a breath they waited he didnt mention gabriella so at last it stops how to end my little demonstration closing down an experiment can be as difficult as starting it i think the best solution is that i leave alone im at my best alone ill give miss dixon here a final choice on her fate she can save herself by coming with me or cast her lot with the morons im indifferent either way let her go now so we can test your little experiment tough guy pulaski said to the speaker it was pointless he was talking to a machine as you saw my telescope kit allowed me to smuggle down the necessary components of a gun norse went on blandly you might take me sure but id be sure to take more of you frankly however i think theres been enough violence so this is what were going to do i need one hour one hour to make my preparations at the end of that time ill commandeer the remaining spryte ill take my chances on the polar plateau just as tyson did and if you go telling stories to our vostok friends well lets just say that i have a story of my own prepared i can be quite convincing no one bothered to answer this time they were depleted defeated by their own mistakes spirit had been sucked out of them it was difficult for them to even look at lewis the innocent man theyd almost executed i was the serpent people and when i came you had no individual strength to resist my temptation look around at those socalled friends of yours you have none you have none youll all despise each other the rest of your short miserable lives lewis look at the people who just tried to kill you and then credit me the path to inner strength you came ten thousand miles for a family which meant you came ten thousand miles for a mirage more noise in the background then shut up shut up a long pause he resumed one hour one hour and im out of your lives remain in the galley until im on my way i see that galley door open and the agreements off dont forget i have abby the intercom switched off chapter twentynine they sat in the galley in sick indecision listening to the hum of the ventilation system and half expecting it to go off as the power died if they hunted down and confronted norse they risked abby if they didnt go after him they might risk themselves how did they know the psychologist wasnt sabotaging the station yet they were emotionally depleted after the neardisaster with lewis none had the stomach to sacrifice abby for the group right now by confronting the psychopath a showdown might prompt norse to somehow not just shoot her but damage the fragile machinery that kept them alive maybe it was safer to wait maybe he would simply keep his word and drive away it was a depressed silence each of them profoundly alone a cataloguing of misgivings and second guesses and confused doubts norse had robbed them of their own selfconfidence hed drained them of purpose i dont get it pulaski finally said how can a man hate all of us like that hate his own kind lewis was in no mood for philosophy easy by hating himself and if he hates himself why what the hell did he do who knows i think he lost it completely when he strangled gabriella before that maybe its something he didnt do once something hes been trying to justify to himself justify by killing people by getting us to act like the fools he thinks we are maybe well find out someday if we get through this it would have to be something pretty bad wouldnt it something to really make you feel terrible about life lewis looked at the cook for a long time and then let his gaze drift around the room geller calhoun dana andrews alexi molotov accusers executioners yes he finally said like tying an innocent man to a stake at the pole he couldnt hide the bitterness everyone looked away he should have bit it back but norses taunting had hit home lewis was angry sore depleted hed lived yes but some vital part of him seemed to have gone he felt that hed died a little just by being strapped to that stake he wondered if hed ever get that part of himself back basic optimism trust hed come looking for community and theyd been willing to dispose of him the harder hed tried the worse things seemed to get so here he was the woman he was falling in love with in the hands of a madman without a friend and without a future welcome to the three hundred degree club buddy sitting in a metal box waiting like dumb poultry for their fate thats what norse would have predicted wouldnt he predicted that at the end none of them would be talking to each other hed played with them what if he was still playing with them it was the first thought to jolt lewis out of his depressed apathy what was norses game now they had nothing but the word of a killer that hed ever let abby go that he wouldnt damage the station there were what he counted seventeen of them abby the eighteenth and then norse six dead assuming tyson had succumbed and where the hell was pika the little man was so quiet he was easy to miss lewis stood up suddenly terribly concerned but not certain what he was concerned about the lethargy they had to shake it off norse was counting on it to give himself time to get away get away with abby get away with what seventeen against one what the hell were they sitting there for the others were eyeing him uncertainly cueball did you get a look at his gun pulaski shrugged barely is it real the cook looked at lewis speculatively his own energy pricked slightly by the geologists it looked real to me wont know unless we jump him how many shots does he have well a real gun would have been picked up in the detectors when he came down here so his looked pretty crude a bunch of homemade parts pulaski thought i saw two barrels which suggests theres no chamber for extra bullets probably just two shots like a doublebarreled shotgun until he has time to reload who knows how many bullets what are you thinking that weve been letting him control events since the winter began and that were still letting him by sitting here the cook looked doubtful you want to risk abby jed you think shes not already at risk after all thats happened norse says hes going to leave but how the spryte geller spoke up like tyson tried norse was curious about it from the beginning load a sled with food and fuel and take off across the plateau its risky but he knows hes dead if he stays here if wed killed you maybe he would have gotten away with the whole thing but not now his only chance is to go to the russians and try to bribe his way off the continent with the meteorite norse is a good talker but it doesnt make sense its him against eighteen or nineteen witnesses and he knows well get the radios back up sometime that well alert nsf and the russians hes crazy jed calhoun offered is he if norse takes that spryte he not only gets away with murder but he takes away our only emergency exit in case something goes wrong what if hes screwing up the base right now sentencing us all he cant get to the fuel or generators pulaski said we sealed those up so how is he getting to the garage to get the spryte when you sealed off the generator room you sealed off the garage too didnt you that stopped them maybe hes breaking in or something geller said hed have to pika is the only one who knows a way to get in who has a key lewis let his eyes scan the room so wheres pika heads turned their apathy becoming alarm had norse kidnapped him too if bob is planning to bring down the temple like some kind of deranged samson we need him alive to tell us how to defuse whatever hes cooked up dont we we cant afford to let him set off for vostok because then hes free to pull the plug on this place boobytrap it like the batteries in comms set a fire pulaski said cut a cable were sitting like hams in a can waiting for him to do it they looked at the galley door what if norse had anticipated this very conversation what if he was outside the door waiting for one of them to test his threat or was he already firing up the spryte the station generators about to explode maybe we need to get out of here and into emergency shelter dana said quietly run the bloody hell to bedrock village if it comes to that but im not sure im willing to write off the rest of the station for this guy willing to sit out there hoping for the best i hear you on that mendoza said if hes got pikas keys or pika himself lewis reminded them he can go anywhere do anything were letting a lunatic roam the station and if we go charging out there were not only going to get some of us killed but abby too linda brown warned if we just wait maybe it will be over or not maybe his experiment hasnt stopped why should we believe it has everyone was looking at lewis uneasily suddenly restless suddenly uncertain again every choice seemed risky i care for abby more than any of you but norse is counting on us to react not anticipate thats been his expectation from the beginning hes counting on us to be a step behind him he said if we go out that door linda began thats my whole point he said but what do you want us to do lewis stopped what should they do he thought a moment if he sees us coming hes got more chance to hurt abby or hurt the station we need to take him by surprise if hes really fleeing then he has to already be in the garage gassing up right hes got to be getting ready so he cant see us theres only one of him lets go outside circle around to the garage doors and jump him when he comes out what about the generators mendoza said what if hes rigged them to blow when he leaves blow if we come at him lewis paused is that possible who knows he seemed awfully sure we wont survive long enough to sic the authorities on him okay how about this a few of us should go that way sneak into the garage the back way in case he tries to retreat check for any sabotage take him from behind with the rest in front well surround the bastard how do we get in the same way norse did i hope i just remembered something pikas been going to biomed like a horse to a feed bag but theres no sign hes sick when i found nancy in the storeroom there was a cabinet askew a panel behind it and im wondering now if theres some kind of utility access there to the arches id like to take longfellow through in case theres some electrical thing norse has rigged to boobytrap our power you too carl see if we can find abby before he takes off in the spryte and get her safe then the rest of you can block him hes got a gun linda brown reminded homemade we think with two shots the others looked queasy apprehensive but with a slowly hardening resolve theyd lost all sense of control maybe following lewis they could somehow get it back if any one of us tries it alone well be killed lewis said any two of us maybe but with all of us everyone distracting him he shrugged we win with casualties pulaski warned but not as lame victims geller was nodding too he stood up i agree were sitting here like sheep so we give him a shot at us linda asked we ambush him others were nodding now too the idea of doing something acting together was beginning to reenergize them i just want him to go away linda moaned no because if he gets away he wins lewis said he leaves us like lab rats pressing levers and chasing cheese dont you see norse wants to erase everything mickey moss built by making us give up on it ourselves it was disorienting listening now to lewis the man theyd almost killed so it was clyde skinner who ended the last hesitation he unsteadily stood i dont want him to get away with my eyes lewis stepped out of the galley first bracing for a shot despite the bland certainty about norses movements hed conveyed to the others what if he was wrong but no shot came the shadowy dome seemed empty a soft slough of wind audible through the hole at the top of the dome he heard nothing else saw nothing else so he stepped down to the snow and waved the others out watching them pour silently like a line of emerging bees trotting across the snow to the junction of the archways where the ramp was still no bob to the left and right were the barrier walls theyd erected to seal off the fuel supply and generators they hadnt been breached and the door to the outside was still bolted and locked if he was in the garage norse had followed pikas way okay there has to be some kind of tunnel or corridor lewis told the others go outside and get in position well push from behind stay low but move fast once it starts with luck well surprise him pulaski unlocked the domes smaller side door and the winterovers began filing out into the night going up the ramp as they had before to stake out lewis this time if lewis was right theyd stop the spryte if wrong theyd retreat to the emergency camp at bedrock and regroup pulaski had told them that the galley suddenly seemed like the worst kind of trap unless bob wants us to abandon the galley hiro muttered we yanks had a general named grant once whose officers were always spooked by a general named lee pulaski told him grant told them to stop worrying what lee was going to do and start thinking what they were going to do what happened they won the war lewis turned with longfellow and mendoza to biomed the trio studied the sick bay module which stood on stilts a foot above the snow crouching lewis could now see there was one point at the rear where a metal culvert led from the sick bay floor down into the snow stepping back to view its roof he noted there was a tube of utility piping that reached to the arched ceiling above conduits spreading like branches some kind of artery ran up the back of biomed like a spine it was here he was certain that pika went in and out with everyone suspect no one had been trusted to have access to their power supply the necessary exception had been their generator mechanic norse must have coerced him into showing the way coerced him into getting the spryte biomeds door was half open the snapped lock had made it impossible for the fugitive to secure it after himself the three men went inside it was much as before except that skinners bed was empty medical supplies remained scattered drawers askew the shelves where lewis had been tackled were still toppled the cold had invaded and broken liquids had frozen into thin platters lewis went to the rear room poor nancy hodge lay in the wreckage of her life her corpse stiff from cold in the confusion that had followed the murder her body had been shockingly forgotten now shed have to wait even longer for commemoration lewis stepped over her to the cabinet hed seen dragged askew he saw the panel in back of it was now removed cold air swirled into biomed from the dark air beyond had pika been forced to show this entryway to norse lewis poked his head in and looked downward no light but a faint glimmer from spaces beyond he couldnt risk his own light if he came upon norse he wanted it to be a surprise which meant claustrophobic gloom again i hate tunnels he murmured to longfellow well it cant be a very long one ill go first no i will because it was my idea just in case he uses that gun taking a breath he climbed into the shaft and dropped down the short ladder inside it finding himself in a utility culvert that led in both directions under the archways pipes ran here more than hed ever suspected existed the station was as complex as a spaceship he wondered if tyson had hidden in here somewhere after cameron was stabbed there was enough light from the opening overhead to dimly see and he considered for a moment which way to go in the direction of the fuel arch it was dark with a sound like water running unlikely norse would go that way it was opposite of the garage back under the other archway toward the generators and spryte there was a dim light of another opening he began crawling in that direction longfellow and mendoza following it was a tight grubby cold place the thing lewis hated most but pika must have come this way on his regular rounds to keep the plant running had norse and abby passed here too it occurred to lewis that maybe the psychologist had known about this escape hatch all along that maybe thats why hed agreed to pulaskis determination to seal up the archways to lock them in the dome but why would pika tell him lewis came to an opening overhead that light issued from and could hear the reassuring drum of the generators beyond at least norse hadnt cut their power cautiously he poked his head up and glanced around as expected he was in a corner of the generator room no one he pulled himself out of the tunnel and crouched near the reserve generator the electrician and astronomer came up beside him you see anything out of the ordinary longfellow crept from machine to machine the middle one was drumming faithfully no wires no bombs no monkey wrenches i think hes left them alone lewis was surprised maybe norse didnt care if he left witnesses maybe he was tired of killing maybe there was some booby trap they couldnt see we have to make sure mendoza said we do that by catching him lewis replied the three men began cautiously moving toward the gym and garage giving the others time to circle around in the snow suddenly there was the sharp pop of a gun lewis reflexively dropped at the bang flinching from the expected whine of a bullet had norse spotted them the others fell with him but there was no buzz no thud of a projectile striking a hard surface and he realized the bullet would have reached him before the bang anyway the shot had been aimed at someone else had norse gotten in a struggle with abby his stomach tightened at the thought of it come on he hissed lets rush him determined to risk a confrontation he moved forward the others scuttled after him ahead there were footsteps and the slam of a door the gym was dark the door to the garage beyond closed lewis trotted ahead and then tripped on something in the gloom sprawling damn raggedy ann the cpr doll he reached around no someone still warm and sticky his heart hammering he moved his hands along the head and body despite himself he felt a flood of relief it wasnt abby turn on a light he whispered longfellow felt along the wall until he found a switch all of them blinking in the glare the body was pikas they saw sprawled as he tried to run back toward the generator room his arm was outstretched as if trying to score a goal and his back was bloody norse had cut him down in midflight the poor little bastard his other arm was tucked under him and clutching something rough and heavy as tightly as a football lewis reached under and tugged it free it was the meteorite then they heard the snort and roar of a revvedup spryte chapter thirty norse didnt open the bay doors that allowed him to exit the halfburied garage he crashed through them as a precaution against surprise always a step ahead his spryte burst through in a blaze of light spraying snow and plywood fragments like a tug butting a wave the machines headlights momentarily blinded the ring of winterovers whod hunched against the icy darkness to wait for their tormentor and the violence of the breakout startled them the machine lurched over the lip of the garage ramp and rocked back down jerking a sled of fuel and supplies behind it the engines howl and the clanking of the treads made it sound like half dinosaur half tank when the beams finally swept by them and the cab was silhouetted against the stars the ambushing group could see there were two people inside abby swaying uncertainly and norse hunched at the wheel it was obvious the psychologist planned to charge through the station and head toward vostok as quickly as possible no pause to say goodbye pulaski was the first to stand up running to take position in front of the lumbering tractor like a matador in front of a bull the old soldiers blood was up now his opponent finally plain and visible come on he roared to the others help me stop him one by one the rest of the group rose out of the snow with their crude spears and clubs rushing to surround the rumbling machine norse sounded the horn of the spryte at pulaskis challenge an angry elephantine trumpeting and then accelerated to run the determined cook down the diesel snorted with power its exhaust a black cloud the commando waited until the last second crouching as if willing to be hit and then darted to one side as the machine ground by running back along its length in his heavy boots snow kicking up in lively spouts a flying leap threw him upon the fuel and food sled that norse was towing and the other pursuers roared at the sight then pulaski regained his footing and sprang forward like a cat a boot dancing on the trailer hitch until his gloved hand could catch a handhold on the main cab if he could stop the spryte the others could help him swarm bob clenching a vent opening he swung himself firmly aboard the snow tractor and worked along the drivers side a hammer readied in one fist the rest of the winterovers were pursuing now like a pack of wolves yelling and whooping because they hadnt come through the tunnel none of this group knew that norses gun had already murdered pika the cook got to the cab door and norse snarled soundlessly at him swerving the tractor in a vain attempt to throw his attacker off pulaski hung on and swung the hammer heavy glass shattered breaking the sprytes cocoon of warmth and the cook reached inside to either fumble with the door lock or drag norse bodily out through the windows splintery teeth the others would never know for sure the breakage gave norse a clear shot there was another bang the bullet cuffed the cook off the cab and sent him flying there was something graceful to his arc like a backward dive off a board but when the old soldier fell into the snow it was heavily his body instantly still now it was norse who howled an animalistic cry of rage and triumph and he gunned the machine even harder jouncing across the sastrugi drifts toward the summer camp his spryte was well on its way toward leaving the pole dana and geller reached pulaski first the cooks hood had been thrown back and the crest of his head had turned molten where the bullet had hit him hot blood steamed like acid into the snow he was dead a few of the others threw things the clubs and spears banging off the sides of the spryte as harmlessly as if it were an armored car then it was beyond them red taillights a taunt driving on into the night norse was getting away always a step ahead he roared suddenly there was a different snarl a coughing rumble that rose to a whine and another single headlight blazed over the rim of the snow at the entrance to the garage snowmobile it burst up through the wreckage of the garages bay doors as if catapulted leaping a drift and coming down in a wild skid its treads biting and its single ski pointing toward its quarry it was lewis in hot pursuit longfellow and mendoza came charging along after him on foot the others began running again too trying to catch the churning tractor hes got abby geller roared at the geologist as lewis shot by him he shot cueball stop him and well finish it the blinded skinner was dancing from leg to leg to the sounds of pursuit howling in the cold get him get him get him the snowmobile was far faster than the spryte and lewis pulled up alongside the machine quickly eyeing the cab trying to decide what to do norse pointed his gun out the window and lewis fell back how many shots did he have one for pika one for the cook but if hed reloaded lewis hefted the meteorite as he decelerated considering what choice did he have he swerved around the back of the sled and came up on the machines other side where abby was riding praying shed jump at what was coming next pulling alongside the galloping treads he chose a place to aim and then with grim deliberation threw the rock into the gearing there was another bang a squeal of metal the rock caught in the bogie wheels of the tread and jammed it so the spryte swerved wildly the other cab door popping open there was a spurt of dust as mickey mosss jewel was crushed into powder even as the meteorite disintegrated a broken tread slithered off one side and the snow machine spun helplessly abby was thrown clear and flopped onto the snow apparently stunned or killed the sprytes one working tread sent it wheeling in a tight circle like a dog chasing its tail the trailer tipping over and the hitch snapping free the machine was mortally wounded a window shattered a tread gone its extra fuel lost the others ran up as it careened surrounding it norse was wrenching with the controls cursing in frustration it was like a boat without a rudder then the psychologist realized the inevitable and sat back suddenly cutting the engine so the spryte ground to a stop its lights dimmed lewis cut the snowmobile too it was quiet norse was trapped the others stayed back several yards wary of the gun their lungs laboring in the bitter cold surrounding the broken spryte like hunters around a mammoth lewis got off his machine and ran for abby fearing shed been shot falling to his knees in the snow beside her he gingerly turned her over it was raggedy ann the cpr doll norse was laughing at him the psychologist had climbed out of the cab of the machine and was standing on the sprytes roof his parka hood back and his head lit by a halo of stars he had his crude homemade pistol pointed casually outward well aware that the others had recollected their hurled weapons and were in a circle around him now arms poised to throw he might get off one shot maybe two then it would finally be over wheres abby lewis called as he shakily rose trying to catch his breath you didnt do as you were told norse replied it was quiet again the only sound the hiss of lightly blown snow slithering over the drifts lewis took a step toward the spryte i didnt really expect to get away the psychologist finally went on i knew that when i was forced to eliminate gabriella the game had gotten out of control but ive made my point havent i wheres abby i didnt want to kill anybody not really norse turned slowly facing each one of the surrounding group in turn still strangely in command with the force of his personality i wanted to kill the pomposity the pride the hubris the academic arrogance the smugness the indifference it was the station that killed you people not me the delusion that a place like this can work lewis was trembling with impatience and outrage desperate to know what had happened to the woman whod saved him but he had to communicate with this man and that meant tolerating him for a few moments longer its over doc he tried his face battered his voice hoarse give it up and maybe we can get you help come spring norse looked down at him remote lordly distracted what possible help could i get from you learning how to live norse shook his head snowflakes dancing past his brush of regrown hair you still dont understand do you i already died long long ago they were quiet then watching each other what did you put in the tractor treads norse finally asked the quiet of the group their will against him was unnerving him the meteorite lewis said and its gone yes destroyed yes fitting no good riddance lewis said i hate that rock everyone does where did you find it with pika where you murdered him he betrayed you you know we cant know anybody can we wheres abby dammit did you know that pika sold you out for a few pounds of space rock quiet little pika who never seemed to know what was going on yet when i offered him the meteorite he showed me the way past the barrier into the fuel arch i told him i was just fueling the jerricans to escape i told him i was going to take him to vostok he ran away from me to try to fix things with you when he learned the truth but its always too late to fix things thats what ive learned lewis had a growing feeling of chill dread what truth that im still a step ahead of you lewis that ive always been a step ahead and the fact that youve cornered me out here brought me down like a pack of yapping mongrel dogs means nothing because ive already erased all of you did you kill abby his voice was hollow he felt sick i loved abby she failed at loving me so im giving her the quicker end i opened some valves and the fuel level is rising in the arch creeping up her parka where shes tied and shell either drown in jet fuel or ignite like a torch when it flashes into fire either way its relatively quick and really quite merciful compared to freezing to death in the cold im just letting her think about her rejection of me before her death comes believe me youll envy her in your own last hours i lied about what it would have been like if wed left you on the stake freezing is a terrible way to go bob its not too late lewis tried tell us what youve done help us make it right we can fix it the arch is filling with spilled fuel norse nodded solemnly the dome is becoming a bomb if youd left things alone you would have incinerated in the galley before you knew what was happening which was the mercy i had planned for you now you can watch it from out here your shelter vaporizing the living will envy the dead the group looked up at him in disbelief but why dana finally asked her voice quavering because people dont work because it all falls apart on the way to pluto there was a low keening sound as the winterovers began to comprehend what he must have done an enveloping dread at their own fate unfortunately you didnt give me time to stop and destroy the generator at the hypertats so theres a chance you can linger for days maybe weeks so im really leaving you with a final choice the dilemma is my final gift to you you can go back into the dome and try to save dixon and risk dying with her or you can retreat to the emergency camp and try to save yourselves he reached in his parka and they stiffened but it was only to pull out a sheaf of paper as youre freezing to death you might read some notes i made it explains why youll choose to save yourselves why our collective failure was inevitable why your mistake was in trusting each other trusting anybody every one of us is selfish at the final moment so dont pity abby pity yourselves he glanced at his watch im guessing the rest of you have about thirty minutes tell us how to shut it off dammit shouted geller this way said norse and with that he turned the gun pressed its twin barrels against the roof of his mouth and fired chapter thirtyone the top of the barrier that sealed off the fuel arch had been crafted enough to keep out intruders but not to keep out air there were cracks to see through and enough of a stench of petroleum to announce the explosive danger the surviving winterovers had spilled down the entry ramp to the archways and were bunched at the makeshift fuel arch wall puddles leaking ominously from its base and the barrier groaning at the weight of the rising fuel behind it the group boosted lewis up to a crevice so he could shine a light into the gloom beyond he reeled from the fumes shouting down to the others to break out the fire masks then he took a fresh breath held it and aimed his light inside the sight was sickening the fuel arch had become a black combustible lake the tanks emptying to fill the quonsetshaped structure a third of the way up its walls partway down the tunnel he saw a slumped figure tied to some of the tank plumbing the fuel lapping at her chest abby something was bobbing in the fuel beside her he played his light across it and recognized a halfinflated weather balloon what the hell wires went every which way into the fuel and above it and just as lines of longitude converged at the pole the wires converged upon some small implement hung above the rising lake he shone his light on that trying to figure out what it was with recognition came fear the flare gun lewis dimly recalled norse asking it be brought to him what fools theyd been as the fuel level rose the balloon was rising with it one of the wires leading into the ooze was slack but as the balloon floated upward norse had turned the entire station into a time bomb lewis pulled his head back dizzy from the fumes thinking desperately then he told the others to let him down did you see her molotov asked lewis was coughing nauseous from the poisonous fog one step ahead norse had claimed shes there and i cant tell if shes still alive the whole arch has become a lake of fuel with gases above it norse wasnt lying he opened some valves the fuels rising and i dont see how we could find the valves in that goop to shut the flood off jesus geller said listen thats not the worst of it the bastard has rigged some kind of trigger i think im not quite sure how it works but one of jerrys weather balloons is floating on the fuel and as it rises a wire is tightening on the trigger of the flare gun what dana cried when the fuel level gets high enough i think the flare goes off oh my god linda gasped its some kind of trap a simple one guessed gage perlin their plumber like the way a float in a toilet tank rises high enough to trigger a valve to shut off the refilling water he was thinking a wire from the trigger goes to a pulley at the bottom and up to the balloon however he rigged it norse has been thinking about this for a long time lewis said he wants us to abandon abby he wants us to abandon the dome he looked at the others he wants us to give up what else can we do asked hiro with resignation i dont think we have a choice jed mendoza added yes we do spoke up molotov the russian looked grimly resolute glancing up the wall in speculation there is always a choice i made a choice when i wrongly accused lewis here i made a choice when i helped create this mess now i make another choice you americans go back i will break inside and swim to her it was the growl of a bear angry at his own mistakes the decision of a man eager to either make up for the past or be annihilated by it wait said lewis thinking furiously isnt that what hes counting on us to do treading fuel when the gun goes off what we need is to keep the toilet tank from filling if we can spring a leak in the arch the fuel will start draining out as fast or faster than its pouring in from the tanks right it stabilizes drops and then we go get abby jed objected longfellow their electrician a single spark its risky as hell even if we get abby we may lose the fuel unless we can somehow pump some of it back in but if we dont we lose the dome geller said they hesitated we lose more than that dana said you mean we lose another person said lena that is what i am thinking that i am tired of losing people no thats crazy protested linda i know its terrible but well lose everyone if we stay here damn right calhoun warned we go up in flames id rather freeze would you steve asked dana norse said thats worse well we go to the emergency camp then at least its a chance we lose us all staying here i think if we dont try here we lose our soul dana said i agree with alexi i was wrong too i want to save whats left calhoun groaned but didnt reply they could hear the sound of swirling fuel lewis looked at the others their hesitation their despair half determined half panicked the archway is buried in snow he reminded the only real exit for the fuel is right here where were standing im proposing releasing it in here letting it dam up against the generator wall and the outside ramp and building a temporary dike to keep it out of the dome proper then i go in after abby there was a long silence an unspoken debate thats just crazy linda moaned yes like running naked to the pole the others glanced around starting to make mental measurement of what they had to achieve well if were going to do it then lets do it mendoza finally said grimly determined come on amigos six of us with me to build the dike the rest of you breach that wall most of them began to move calhoun and linda still hesitated watching the others ah the hell with it surrendered calhoun at least it will be quick he pointed up the wall all right start with that beam there that will give access to this panel theres enough weight from the fuel that it will help pry er loose geller added and at that linda brown blinked and acquiesced i know some crates we can drag to help build a dike she said fatalistically then drag shouted dana we dont know how taut that wire is masks and tools were passed out extra gloves were stuffed in to make a barrier between prying crowbars and bare metal in hopes of minimizing sparks the large rampway doors were dragged open letting in the sharp outside cold but helping to dissipate the fumes the removal of calhouns beam started a small breach in their barrier fuel from the arch began spraying out in a ghastly plume spattering the snowy floor of the archway intersection behind them pools of congealing petroleum began to form the work stopped for a moment the winterovers uneasily eyeing this new fountain and its rich stink hurry up dammit geller roared weve got to move they started again with new ferocity bolts were screwed out and a panel of plywood began to bulge pulling its own nails squealing as it bent as it did so the flow of fuel turned from fountain to pulsing flood its weight pushing aside the barrier and pouring out onto the snowy floor in a dark river swirling past biomed and reaching the far generator wall where it splashed as oily surf and began pooling into a new lake an entire panel came off and the flood quickened an artery of syrup their lake deepened even as the rise of the one in the fuel arch began to reverse they were wading in a petroleum sea oily waves oscillating back and forth in their enclosure the fuel lifted biomed off its foundation and sent it floating bouncing and scuttling against one wall the spreading fuel would have poured into the dome proper if the makeshift dike hadnt delayed it small rivulets broke through that thin barrier and ran toward the galley and the science building as the pool spread norses triggering balloon bobbed in place a moment and then began to sink lewis played his light over abby wondering if she was still alive how taut is the wire geller yelled were still here arent we calhoun grunted the fumes built half poisoning them lewis was increasingly terrified thered be a spark okay weve got a breach thats enough he decided the rest of you retreat they didnt have to be told twice the survivors threw down their tools and waded for the ramp the fuel swirling around their thighs a combustible fog roiling ahead of them up into the night if it ignited theyd be vaporized they splashed up the slick ramp falling and grunting crawling up the oily beach into the dark and cold of the outdoors soaked from fuel and coughing and woozy as they pulled off their masks their reddish black patina grew gummy in the cold and began to freeze smoking or nonsmoking a coughing calhoun tried to crack lewis watched them go waiting for the tidal current swirling out from the fuel arches to subside as the two pools equalized the flood became sluggish its overall depth cut in half more oil was breaking through their hasty dike running into the dome but that served to keep the fuel from deepening again as the tanks continued to drain still no explosion it was time lewis waded to the breached wall the fuel was thick and syrupy with cold fogged and tarlike it was a prehistoric swamp viscous and evil he pushed his past the break and shone his light around the archway walls glistened with the sheen christ what a mess with their tanks emptying he didnt know how they were going to survive the ice but at least theyd so far evaded the fire he could plainly see the trapped woman he pulled his mask aside for a moment abby there was no answer he waded into the fuel arch and felt his way to the catwalk mounting its stairs and pulling himself along it where the fuel was now just ankle deep he could see the high tide mark of the petroleum on the walls the liquid dripping the balloon like a distant buoy he counted the tanks off as he advanced coming to the one where cameron had been killed it was here that abby hung like a tired scarecrow the balloon was sinking beside her the wire to the trigger of the flare gun slacker now but a board with another tighter wire was floating beside it the contraption looked more complex than it had to be he vaulted over the rail into stomachdeep fuel and waded toward the woman she was limp as if dead fuel having stained her to her chin her body looking small and wilted the flood had stopped an inch from her mouth abby no response he slapped her she jerked into crude consciousness and began coughing he unstrapped one arm then another and she fell into his arms lewis had never seen anything so implacably heartless as this insane execution he dragged her to the catwalk pushing her up onto it and leaning her against the railing she doubled over and vomited when she came up gasping he put an extra oxygen mask over her face abby sucked in air reeling tears streaming down her face where did he turn the valve wheres the valve we need to save what fuel we can she shook her head where which pipe she pulled away the oxygen mask gasping to speak the wire the flare i know we got the fuel level to go down we beat his clock she shook her head vigorously no two wires one if too high a board if too low it drops pulls wire lewis saw what she was pointing at norse had anticipated them again a second wire on the trigger was tightening as the fuel level fell and its board sank with it good god hed brought nothing to cut it with run she put on her mask and he pushed her frantically down the catwalk the grating was slippery but the fuel had drained below it now gripping the slick rail they ran as best they could banging into the sides of the arch looking back at the poised and hanging flare through a stinking fog of petroleum fumes the slack wire growing tauter as the board pulled down then they descended the catwalk stairs and went through the breach wading across the petroleum pond to the ramp leading outside it was molasses clinging to them beseeching them to stay behind them fuel was running across the hardpacked snow toward the modules its fumes curling upward to the roof of the dome it was a gray haze in the dome lights the generator still chugging obediently behind the other wall the pair crawled up the slippery ramp both slick with stinking fuel the wetness beginning to freeze on their clothes go go go lewis shouted to the others get as far away as you can someone screamed they were running then a reflected flash as the flare gun went off releasing red light like a glimpse of hell with a gassy roar the fuel arch blew up the shock wave of the blast kicked abby and lewis the last few feet up the ramp and knocked the scattering group as flat as a strike of bowling pins the violence hit an instant before the sound did and then for another instant everything at the pole was noise the pulse of superheated air that was now beyond the flattened winterovers kicked up a wall of loose snow that expanded outward across the station like the penumbra of a star an expanding blizzard rushing a half mile in all directions before puffing out the snow over the fuel arch erupted like napalm its wall of flame shooting skyward in an upside down curtain biomed disintegrated instantly its fragments spewing into the entryway the opposite wall guarding the generators blew inward into kindling and a gout of flame and plasma gases seared into the generator room like the exhaust of a rocket melting the electrical connections and setting the gym ablaze in an instant power to the dome was snuffed out fire leaped over the crude dike and flashed through the dome itself the gases igniting and the resulting energy punching vents in the dome as if it were made of foil smoke and heat shot up through the ventilation hole at the top of the structure in a volcanic plume spattering the complex with a rain of debris thousands of icicles broke off and rained down on the arena below like breaking glass a maniacal tinkle against the thunder the fireball knocked the habitation modules askew from their foundations pipes were torn off electrical cables snipped and each metal box was seared with flame roasting from orange to black in seconds crates flared into torches banked ice cream flashed into steam for a minute the entire dome was an inferno yet the explosion was a mere spark in a universe of implacable cold antarctica for a brief moment punched aside imploded back inward once the shock wave passed the ice was determined to reclaim its dominance snow turned to steam and slush the most volatile gases had vaporized and what was left began to burn more sluggishly as the heat consumed itself by turning a tinderdry environment into a melting one the blast had created a stinking lake fuel leaked down into the ice cap and spread into the surrounding snow flames roared smoked melted and sputtered out the ruptured tanks burned fiercely sending a column of smoke boiling a mile high into the sky but the blaze retreated to its heart almost as swiftly as it had expanded with it went the stored energy that was to have kept them alive for the rest of the winter thered been a flash of oily violence and now a grim guttering their lifeblood had been consumed shakily the survivors stood miraculously none had been seriously hurt and none had caught on fire the searing heat was already a dim memory replaced once more by relentless cold they shivered their spaceship had been destroyed wordlessly geller handed over to lewis some papers hed snatched from norses dying hand there was some kind of scribbled account of a mountain climb lewis saw as he leafed through them and a cover sheet with a scrawled message thus samson killed many more when he died than when he lived chapter thirtytwo the dying fire lit their way as the tiny tribe trudged wearily back toward the spryte they were silent in their weariness skinner using the shoulder of an exhausted hiro to guide him back across the snow so many had been lost more than a third of them the rest alive staggering like blackened zombies exhausted shivering left to what kind of fate when they got to the snow tractor geller climbed up on it and caught the corpse of norse by the boot dragging him off the cab roof without ceremony his blood was frozen so there was no trail his limbs were already stiff he toppled like raggedy ann into the snow and man and mannequin lay together id leave the sonofabitch for the buzzards but there aint buzzards down here the maintenance man said bitterly its just his shell lena whispered the demon is gone lewis stooped to look at the tractor treads gears were bent a sprocket broken the track had snapped still the basics were there can we fix it the support personnel clustered around maybe calhoun said he glanced back toward the burning dome maybe the garage escaped the worst of it with some tools if we can get the generator at bedrock running what the hell for geller interrupted why the hell try calhoun shrugged i mean can you fix the spryte to run a thousand miles clarified lewis towing that sled and maybe another with a shelter and some food and tents drive to vostok like bob was going to do or better yet drive to the americans at mcmurdo calhoun looked at the rest of them emptied by the struggle its winter jed i know it would be hard more than hard mendoza spoke up wearily some of us are banged up pretty good clydes blind abbys half dead wed have to melt drinking water ride out storms winds can hit two hundred miles per hour on the beardmore glacier windchill is what two hundred and fifty below wed be dependent on a single engine i know it would be risky but six or eight of us in the cab in shifts dana said coming to life at the thought of escape the rest towed in a covered sled better than scott had scott died and that was summer better than amundsen had then he lived several of the others were nodding at dana escape yes but not mcmurdo across the mountains vostok molotov said suicide countered hiro we would have no chance lewis looked at the huddled group they were as haggard as war refugees spent fearful it was calm now but the next storm would be along soon enough yet the emergency hypertats appeared to be intact and with them the generator that meant heat and some food norse was dead the immediate emergency had passed they had time to repair the spryte time to try to rig a radio and computer from the outer buildings time to make a less exhausted decision we cant agree now he said we cant think straight now theres no need to decide now the first thing to do is get warm what are you saying that we need to get back to bedrock they staggered toward the emergency camp arm in arm body leaning on body skinner kept his hand on hiros shoulder stumbling after him lewis half carried the woozy and nauseous abby and kept thinking covetously about the wounded spryte it hurt to even walk away from it maybe they could rig a radio to let everyone know what had happened and to alert potential rescuers of their plan to attempt escape maybe the rescuers could arrange some airdrops along the route it would be wildly desperate but it was a chance to go home home it was hard for lewis to remember what it looked like smelled like the scent of earth grass flowers he ached for it could hardly remember it home he imagined being in such a place with abby not the stricken woman he was dragging but the bright funny optimistic woman hed first met what would that be like yet just the quarter mile to bedrock was endless every step was leaden every footstep sidelighted by the oily flames still burning in the arch the majority stumbled into the huts while molotov and mendoza called on the last of their reserves to help lewis start the generator again it was easier this time having been run by lewis not that long before and the generators cough and rumble was like the restart of a ruptured heart their own blood surged at the sound of it heat and light were the gift of life then they went inside logistics expert linda estimated that they probably had enough fuel and food at the camp for a month survival after that would require an airdrop theyd lost their cook their doctor their two best mechanics theyd lost much of their clothing and supplies the survivors broke open a cache of emergency clothing and began to shed their oily garments and toss them outdoors for later cremation water was heated people exhaustedly stripped washed and redressed without selfconsciousness or modesty helping each other numbly small kindnesses enough to bring a tear of gratitude most were shaking from cold and shock some granola bars were passed out and hot tea then they slept for twenty hours slept as if dead lewis came awake first nestled next to a drowsy abby he couldnt remember their falling asleep next to each other he couldnt remember much of anything his life had become a blur around the pair the others were jammed onto the floor of just one of the huts clustered in their need for human proximity cave dwellers must have been like this he thought huddling together against the cold of the night prehistoric thats how far theyd fallen abby shifted too nuzzling against him her body warm promising a future that still seemed tenuous and remote did you dream she whispered sleepily he shook his head still groggy of home i think she was silent for a long time clutching to him their chests rising and falling in unison wheres home jed she said softly he lay there listening to the breathing and snoring of the others and thought about her question where indeed he had no family no house no address no sense of place he lay there in darkness thinking first about her and then about himself where could they make a home she fell asleep again resting against him he gently got up swaying a bit from lingering exhaustion and carefully stepped over the prone forms of the others some were half awake now some exhaustedly asleep but all were quiet lost in their own thoughts or dreams waiting to see what was decided next a head or two rose up at his passing but no one spoke at the end of the hut he dressed the ritual that cameron had taught him at a simpler time which seemed eons ago the layers of clothing the boots the hat the mittens he stepped into the hypertat air lock closed the inner door behind him and taking a breath opened the outer one he stepped outside into the midnight cold of the pole the temperature hit him again like a slap little different than when hed first walked off that airplane and yet it wasnt alien anymore just a new edge hed come to a place where people didnt belong and now perversely was used to it lewis filtered cold air through his gaiter filled his lungs and looked around the fire was out the plateau lit by galactic milk the station was a ruin of silvers and grays as soundless as the moon what had he hoped for a place uncomplicated pure lewis slowly turned taking in the geography of the battered station they had no thermometer registering temperature anymore and so the cold was simply cold embracing leaching and yet not as savage as that night when theyd all run from the sauna he was surprised once more by the light how the night could repeal itself and become less threatening the galaxy was a banner of illumination the snow fluorescent in its gleam the base was wounded unlit stark and yet even now the pole was one of the most lovely places hed ever seen astonishing in its cleanliness spangled ethereal crystalline as long as they lived there it was still a spaceship drifting through space the aluminum dome still looked whole in the pale starlight and of course it mostly was perhaps the worst breaches could be patched or the galley module stripped of food and parts like crusoe they had a wreckage of supplies to pillage there were the cargo berms the mothballed quonsets of summer camp the science buildings it would be hard but there was an enormous residue of equipment and dozens of structures with which to eke out a winter perhaps they could stick it out if enough food and fuel were parachuted in aid as distant as it seemed was over the horizon people had endured worse they could also freeze he knew just one generator now their last spryte crippled their two best mechanics dead their quarters claustrophobic their unity far from certain norse had mocked a group that had never really congealed had they finally become a club the bigger question was where he belonged lewis had come to the pole looking for some kind of fulfillment escape and an end to escape bizarrely he may have finally found it in the stations neardestruction in the heart of a nightmare hed found a woman to love tentative acceptance lifechanging experience meaningful work he actually cared about the damn place he still cared about his weather readings he looked at the sky was the world warming hard to imagine down here still he wanted to know wanted to help others know if they stayed maybe he could record more readings send them to sparco when the winter was done and someday toast poor old mickey moss the things that had made the astrophysicist human and the things that had made him special enough to push for this base lewis looked across at the spryte hed recaptured with a certain melancholy it would have been more fitting perhaps if the psychologist had finally made it to vostok and eventually faced a realization that would have tormented him for the rest of his life that the others had stayed and lived and come out of everything robert norse had thrown at them stronger than before that the three hundred degree club really worked maybe i busted up a fivemilliondollar rock for nothing he whispered to himself half smiling at the bitter thought but then maybe norse had come to the same dread realization just before hed pointed the barrel of his pistol into his own mouth that the flaw wasnt in society but in himself it was a gamble to continue the winter lewis knew their position was precarious it was a bigger gamble not to he came back inside slowly undressed stepped over the drowsy forms of the others and lay down next to abby she snugged him to herself with her arms warming him drowsily awake herself again lewis kissed her hair maybe this is home he murmured she squeezed him a tight hug of fear and hope
