scanned by highroller and proofed more or less by highroller andre norton and mercedes lackeys elvenblood chapter sheyrena had grown very weary of coos of admiration over the last hour or so human voices harsh and heavy by elven standards did not normally grate on her ears but they did today oh my lady there has never been a gown so lovely i swear the nameless blond slave out of her mothers household shook her head over the shimmering folds of sheyrenas gown she probably spoke the truth by her own standards it was heavy damascene silk of peacockblue shot through with threads of pearly iridescence the color was far more vivid than anything ever seen in nature and a more wretched color for me could not be imagined it would of course completely overwhelm her she would be a ghost in the stolen costume of the living truly gushed another you will ravish the mind of every lord who sees you only if they have taste for a maiden who resembles a corpse bedecked for her funeral no amount of careful makeup would ever give her the coloring to match that gown it was suitable for the vivid beauty of a human concubine not an elven maid and particularly not one who was pale even by the standards of her own race it was typical of her father to have chosen something that would display not her but the power his power that made it possible sheyrena an treves closed her ears to the chattering of her human slaves and wished she could be anywhere but where she was the windowless pale blue marble walls of her dressing room were far too confining at the best of times now as it was crowded with the bodies of not only her own halfdozen slaves but an additional four from her mothers retinue she was not entirely certain there was enough air to go around there was too much perfume and heat in here she wished vaguely for an escape from all of it if only she could be outside sitting watching the butterflies in that meadow lorryn discoveredor riding along the wall around the estateshe thought wistfully for a long moment she was lost in her dreams of escape her mind far from this room and all it contained as she imagined herself riding lorryns spirited gelding in a headlong chase along the sandstone wall the wind in her face and lorryn only a pace or two ahead of her lorryn if only you could come and rescue me from this oh that is a foolish thought you cannot even rescue yourself from the bindings of custom two of her own chief attendantscastoffs from her fathers harem twin redheads whose names she could never keep straightsaid something to her directly and waited for a response shaking her out of her dreams she shook her head slightly and emerged from her thoughts please my lady it is time for the undergown the righthand girl repeated quietly with no expression whatsoever sheyrena stood up and allowed them to bring the undergown to her the slaves were all used to the way she sank into halftrances by now and if they felt any impatience with her they were too well trained to show it no slave in the household of vlayn tylar lord treves would ever dare to display anything so insubordinate as impatience with one of his elven masters sheyrenas handmaids always wore the identical expressions of insipid and vacuous pleasantry that one would find on the face of a formal portrait that was the way her father wanted it but it always unnerved sheyrena she could never tell what they were thinking if i knew what they were thinking i would at least have some idea of how to think of them then again i doubt that their thoughts would be very flattering there is not much in me i fear to inspire a good opinion obedient to their directions she turned toward the four who bore the gown as carefully as a holy relic and lifted her arms silk slid softly against her flesh muffling her head for a breath as three slaves pulled the sinuous soft folds of the seagreen undergown over her head and arms they drew it down in place allowing the skirt to billow out around her bare feet the sleeves and body were cut to fit tightly with a plunging decolletage the skin flared out from the hips billowing out into a long trailing train in the latest style so that i look like a green twig being tossed atop a wave very attractive how can they keep from laughing at me another selection by lord tylar of course to show that his daughter was no stranger to the highest of fashion never mind that the highest of fashion looked ridiculous on her on the other hand did she really want to look attractive no no i don t i dont want a husband i dont want any changes as pathetic as my life is now i do not want to find myself the property of some lord like my father and since father chose all of this for me he can hardly blame me for looking ridiculous that in and of itself was a relief if sheyrena failed tonight her father would be looking for someone or something to blame and it would be best if she gave him no excuse to place that blame on her lord tylar had made it clear to his wife and daughter that this particular fete was of paramount importance to the house of treves the glee on his face when he had received the invitation not only to attend but to present sheyrena had only been equaled the day that he learned that the price of grain for slavefodder had tripled due to a blight that his fields had been spared while lord tylars lineage was good it was not greatand his monetary wealth was due entirely to his successes in the marketplace lord tylars grandfather had been a mere pensioner and only astute management had brought the house of treves this far he was not one of the original high lords of the council but a recent appointee and under normal circumstances he would not ever have found himself in the company of the house of hernalth much less invited to their fete turn please my lady the invitation came not by teleson but by messengeran elven messenger not a human slave which showed how lord tylars status had increased since the disastrous conflict with the elvenbane scribed on a thin sheet of pure gold it could only have been created magicallyan indirect and subtle demonstration of the power and skill of the creator vkass ardeyn ellord fortren lord hernalth requests the pleasure of the company of the house of treves at a fete given in his honor by his guardian vsheyl edres lord fortren on the occasion of his accession to the lands and position of the house of hernalth he further requests the boon of the presentation of the daughter of the house of treves at this fete no need to mention dates or time even the least and poorest of the pensioners on lord tylars estate knew the date of lord ardeyns accessionfete just as they knew why the heir to the house of fortren had inherited the house of hernalthover the strenuous objections of lord dyrans brother it might be added please raise your arm a trifle odd that his given name is treves there had been strong words between lord treves and lord edres in council and lord treves had gone off in a huff taking what little he owned under the law becoming a pensioner under the auspices of one of lord edress opponents she could only hope that such an unpleasant coincidence might cause lord ardeyn to regard her with a less than favorable eye for by asking that she be presented lord ardeyn had made it very clear that he was not only holding a celebration he was seeking an appropriate bride turn a little more please it had been nearly a year since lord dyran and his son and heir had died and the inheritance had fallen into dispute but the councillord tylar among themhad eventually ruled that the estate and title could only be inherited by the oldest surviving sonunless there were no surviving sons to inherit and while it was presumed since there were two bodies that dyrans heir valyn had gone up in smoke with his father there being no evidence to the contrary there was still valyns twin alive of sound mind and body living in and the designated heir to the house of his grandfather that made young ardeyn a double heir and doubly desirable in a marriage alliance little matter that lord edres was quite vigorous and unlikely to make ardeyn a doublelord any time in the next several centuries ardeyn now had all of lord dyrans considerable holdings in his own right that made him the equal of his grandfather in status and standing lord tylars support of ardeyns claim had been noted and now would be rewardedthough it was vanishingly unlikely that the reward would be a wedding to sheyrena lord ardeyn was too highplaced for that and lord tylar still an upstart though a valued upstart lower your arm now my lady please and no doubt every unpledged elven maiden of appropriate rank has gotten an invitation to come and show her paces for the benefit of lord ardeynor rather his grandfather there was no doubt in sheyrenas mind who was going to be making the choice of a bride for ardeyn only those who were fortunate enough to have no parents or guardians ever made the choice of a spouse for themselves if the young lord was lucky his grandfather might consult himbut the probability was that he was so ruled by lord edres that he would tamely accept a wedding to a mule if that was what his grandfather dictated just as i will tamely accept a wedding to a mule if that is what my father dictates no matter how i feel about it for my feelings are of no consequence she reflected with resignation as the maids laced the bodice of the undergown so tightly as to make it a second silken skin the effect was not to make her somewhat meager charms seem more generous but rather the opposite although the invitation had said nothing about other maidens being presented at this fete it didnt have to it was the word of every bower across the land that lord ardeyn was looking for a bride and a profitable alliance not necessarily in that order there would be dozens of unwedded and unpledged elven women there tonight from children still playing with dolls to widows with power and property of their own there was only one lord ardeyn however which meant that it was inevitable that many other unwedded elven lords or their parents or representatives would be appearing at this fete as well looking for prospective brides it wasnt often that there was an occasion grand enough that all the houses could put aside their various feuds and pretend civility for one short night any number of alliances might come out of this fete old conflicts might be resolved the train my lady please to lift your foot and entirely new ones created the maids indicated that she should turn a full circle the silken folds of the skirt swirled around her and settled again with a sigh they held up the overgown and once again she held still while they eased it over her head for all the world like a giant doll they were all dressing the heavier silk of the overgown poured down over her body and added its weight to the invisible burden of misery on her shoulders so i am to be trotted out like one of fathers prize mares for all the unattached lords to check my paces and my teeth just as lorryn is trotted about like a prize stallion displayed to the fathers of all the maidens in our circle fathers will is everything she was too well schooled to show her distaste but her unhappiness sat in her middle a lump of sour ice and made her throat ache with tension the maids fussed with the lacings on the side of the overgown as she closed her burning eyes for a moment to fight for control and serenity it was hard hard to maintain that wellschooled serenity especially in light of the ordeal to come she had never been comfortable with strangers the few times that her father had summoned her to be displayedpresumably with an eye to a possible marriageshe had wanted to crawl under the rug and hide the prospect of being trussed into this torture device disguised as a gown and spending the entire evening displaying herself to dozens hundreds of strangers was enough to make her physically ill and this lacing must be tighter please try not to breathe heavily her mother had been trying to convince her for weeks that this was going to be a golden opportunity for her this would be her one perhaps her only chance to make a marriage that would satisfy her father and herself this was a rare chance to actually meet some of the lords looking for brides before one of them was foisted on her she might actually find some young elven lord there that she liked someone who would allow her to continue her excursions outside the bower rather than confining her to the space within the walls of the womens quarters as so many elven lords insisted was proper her mothers arguments had included those and many other persuasive blandishments in the same vein her mother claimed she understood sheyrenas feelings of doubt the unsettling thoughts that had been moving through her mind of late and her reluctance to contract any marriage and what would mother know about it viridina an treves has never had an inappropriate thought in her life she has always been the perfect obedient lady pliant and pleasant willing to be whatever her father and her lord wished her to be how could someone like that ever understand the restless thoughts passing through her daughters mind these days hold your arm here please my lady right now sheyrena would have given everything she owned to be able to catch some kind of illness as the humans did in order to have an excuse to stay at home but for all their outward fragility elven women were as immune to such things as the males of their kind and its too late for me to manufacture mindstorms like lorryn has no one would believe a bout of head pain coming now was anything other than a ruse she turned at her maids direction raising and lowering her arms while they fussed with the sidelacings and drew the long floorsweeping sleeves of the overgown up over the tight undersleeves and fastened them to the shoulders with lacings of gold cord do i look as stiff as i feel i wonder she was torn by conflicting emotions while it was humiliating to know that her father could not possibly have concocted a less flattering costume for her and that she was going to look her absolute worst in front of a horde of strangers still looking her worst would make it less likely that anyone would find her even remotely interesting better to be thought of as the sickly looking stick than to find myself find herselfwhat betrothed to someone like her father perhaps mother would say that wasnt so bad a prospect there was resentment in that thought but then mother has never cared half as much about my welfare as she has about lorryns if he stood in my place this evening would she be so quick to urge him to be bartered off to a bride if my lady would hold still for a moment but viridina was not her daughter viridina was used to her constricted lot in life sheyrena had a brief glimpse of a wider world in the last year or so and she did not want to give that up in many ways it was much easier to be lord tylars unregarded daughter than his wife viridinas entire existence was bound up by so many rules and customs that she could scarcely breathe without risking the breach of one or more of them that most of those customs dated back to a more hazardous time when women were in constant danger mattered not a bit to her lord husband they were customs and therefore they were to be followed to the letter but sheyrena had little or no importance to the house until recently her older brother lorryn was the important one the heir the male there were more unmarried females in lord tylars social class than there were males he was too proud to send her to wed a lesser lordling and dared not look higher and lord tylar like all the rest of the lords of the council had been very involved with first the rumor then the fact of the elvenbanes existence please lady a step to the right then had come the second wizard war which had occupied his attention to the exclusion of all else so sheyrena had been ignored as long as she was properly dutiful properly trained properly behaved she had found that on the whole she preferred her own company to anyone elsesexcept possibly her brothers she hadnt made any effort to find friends or companions mostly because she had no interest in the things the others of her generation occupied themselves with attendance at a handful of parties had quickly taught her that she was the kind who would settle into a corner and remain there during the entire duration of the event uncomfortable and alone wishing she could go home and this fold should go so she didnt enjoy the loss of control that came with intoxication she didnt see what made gossip so fascinating she was too plain to attract male attentions unwanted or otherwise and the games that the others seemed to find amusing just left her wondering what it was they enjoyed so much and why something so unchallenging to the intellect should be amusing on the whole she would much rather be left to find a corner of a garden read and dream her strange thoughts there had been a lot more of those strange thoughts in the last year although they had begun the day she had first learned flowersculpting a stitch here i think she had begun by resenting those trivialseeming lessons that her father had ordered her to begin lorryn learns how to shatter stone with his power i learn flowersculpting she would never know if her magic was the equal of lorryns because no elven maiden would ever be taught anything but useless skills like flowersculpting waterweaving and the like oh she had heard vague rumors of a few a very few elven women who wielded their power like a man but she had never met any and she doubted that any of them would be willing to share their secrets with her yet before that lesson it would never have occurred to her that she had a certain power in her own hands that no elven lord would ever suspect for it was during the course of that lesson that she realized something strange exciting and a little frightening the same skills i used to shape the flower could be used in other waysstopping a heart for instance those useless lessons if she ever needed that power those lessons might not be so useless after all what is this a thread no cut it off she had not mentioned her revelation to her mother knowing that viridina would have been horrified and she had not really known that the idea would work until a few days later when she had found a bird in the garden that had flown into a window and broken its neck without thinking she had moved to end the poor things painand stopped its heart she had run back to her own room in horror fleeing what she had done but the deed remained and the power and the knowledge of what she had done since that moment she had not been able to look at anything the same way she had surreptitiously experimented with her power working with the sparrows and pigeons that flocked to the garden at first she had only made tiny alterations in their color or the length of their feathers then she grew bolder until now her garden was full of exotic creatures with feathers of scarlet and blue gold and green with trailing tails and flaring crests all of them tame to her hand something told her that making subtle changes with her power could be as importantand as dangerousas the kinds of magic that lorryn wielded and yet at the same time she was afraid to stretch out her hand and take the ephemeral power that beckoned her no other elven woman had ever dared do soperhaps there was a reason perhaps this beckoning power was nothing more than an illusion of strength true she could make a colorful bird out of a sparrowbut what good was that what did it prove if my lady could remove her foot from the sleeve please but what if it was not what if it was real what if she had discovered something no one else knew her secret thoughts weighed in her soul and made it impossible to accept anything at face value anymore hardest to bear was the way her father treated her mother and herself this very gown was an example of how little he thought of them how little he trusted them with anything of import to sheyrenas certain knowledge the only time he ever came to viridinas bower with a pleasant face was when he wanted her to come play the proper wife before his influential friends in private neither of them could ever truly please him he preferred the company of the human slaves in his harem and constantly compared viridina to his latest favorites always unfavorably not that i envy them she thought glancing out of the corner of her eye at one of the redheads fathers tastes are fickle and his favorites never last long and when his favorites were out of favor lord tylar seemed to take a malicious delight in sending them to serve his wife or daughter in the bower sheyrena had never been able to guess whether he did so to try to torment them with the still lovely presence of his former leman or to torment the former favorite with the presence of the lawful wife who could not be displaced perhaps it was both viridina accepted this quietly and without a single comment ever just as she accepted with the same serene resignation everything else that life bestowed on her she was not envious of the harem beauties either there was really no difference in the world of the harem and that of the bower except that viridina could not be supplanted they had neither more freedom than their putative mistress nor less as sheyrena had gradually come to understand the distinction between the bower and the harem was that the bower was a harem of one only when it came to lorryn and lorryns wellbeing did viridina show any signs of interestthough a furtive obsessive fearful anxiety as if she was terrified that something would happen to him she watched over lorryn with the care and concern she could have shown if he were an invalid rather then the healthy creature he was or did his attacks of kryshein mean he was not as healthy as sheyrena thought was there some secret trouble with lorryn something rena could not be told but if that was true then why hadnt lorryn told her he never had kept any secret from her before viridina might accept her lot as an elven lady but it was more than sheyrena could stomach for herself better to be ignored as the daughter than humiliated as the wife of someone like father she was surrounded by all of the slaves now each of them making minute adjustments to the gown the lacings as if she were nothing more than a mannequin inside it and the gown itself was the important guest sheyrena had a sudden absurd thought that perhaps this was the real truththat the gown had a life and purpose of its own and she was nothing more than the vehicle it required to propel it to the place where it would be admired yet in a sense that was the whole truth the gown represented lord tylar his power his wealth his position she was nothing more than the means to display all these things a convenient bannerbearer it was the banner that was important not the hand that held it after all anything would have served the same purpose if id been as feeblewined as ardeyns mother he would still have had me trussed up in this gown and sent off to the fete and if he were as wise as any of the high lords he would have found a way to command my silence so as not to distract potential suitors from the message of his importance she and her mother were nothing more than things to lord tylarnot that this was a new thought but it had never been driven home quite so obviously before they were possessions gamepieces and their whole importance lay in how they could be played to the best advantage she was encased in the layers of this gown as she was encased in the layers of his power over her and nothing would ever change that she knew that and yet a persistent little voice deep inside kept asking why not because that is the way things are she told that little voice they have always been that way and they will always be that way nothing will ever change them certainly not one insignificant female for females are of no consequence to anyone but the little voice would not accept that answer as her slaves directed her to sit again so that they might dress her hair it replied oh no then what about the halfblood wizards what about the elvenbane she is only one female sheyrena had no answer for that certainly the high lords had been certain they had disposed of all the halfbloods long ago and had thought they had made certain no others could be born the halfbloods with their melding of human and elven magics were holders of the only real power that had ever threatened the elven lords rule over this world they had conquered so long ago yet despite all the precautions more halfblooded children had been bornworse had escaped to grow into their powersand had survived to learn how to use those powers one of those children had been a girl who had by ill luck or conscious direction matched the descriptions of a savior in human legend called the elvenbane she had found allies the high lords hadnt even dreamed existed dragons sheyrena sighed as she thought of the dragons her chest constricted by the tightly laced dress not that she had ever seen one but she had heard plenty of descriptions oh how she would love to get just a glimpse of one sinuous graceful glistening in the sunlight with the colors of precious gems as they flewdragons lilted through her dreams at night sometimes leaving her yearning after them when dawn came sometimes with her cheeks wet with tears of longing and loss turn your head this way my lady it was the dragons that had turned the tide for the wizards and made it possible for them to hold off the armies of no less than three of the high lords there had been a dreadful slaughter that included many elves chief among those was the powerful if halfmad lord dyran sheyrena had heard it whispered that it was his own son who had slain him that hardly seemed possible and yet who would have thought that dragons were possible a year ago in the end the high lords were forced to accede to a truce the wizards retreated out beyond the lands that the elves claimed and the elves pledged to leave them in peace my father claims we drove them out and that we only let them go because it wasnt worth pursuing them she allowed herself a treacherous iota of contempt the last time he entertained guests he went on for hours about it they all did youd think we actually defeated them from the way father acted and that little voice inside spoke up without prompting maybe they arent as much in control as they would like to think it whispered insidiously maybe they arent anywhere near as powerful as you think maybe you arent as insignificant as they would like to make you think thats all very well she told it sullenly but what exactly am i supposed to do to prove how free i am the voice finally went silent then having no solutions to offer after all it was nothing more than her own stubborn rebellion still that was a point lorryn called the second wizard war a draw at best a rout at worst and he did not mean for the halfblood side what if the power of the high lords had weakened did that mean there was room for a female to make a life for herself in the midst of the high lords scramble to retain what they had bend your head please my lady but how that was the real question how to escape the dreary life that had been laid out for her from the moment of her birth these plans had a life of their own rolling along whether or not she agreed to them and father can force me if he wants to that was another fact he could visit any number of unpleasant punishments on her if she refused to cooperate he could confine her to a single room on starvation meals he could even lock a slavecollar on me and coerce me to obey with magic she had heard rumors of that happening to some maidens faced with exceedingly unpleasant husbandstobe it was easy enough to conceal such a device in a piece of elaborate jewelry such things were constructed for favored slaves all the time she felt her throat close and her breath come shorter at the very idea she quickly controlled herself before the slaves noticed no there was no escape for heronly the minimal freedom she had now as the daughter rather than the wife but if only there were not that i have any idea what i would do she admitted to herself it was just that she had been feeling so stifled for such a long time locked up in the bower doing next to nothing listening to the gossip of the slaves i want to do something with my life even if i dont know what i don t want to become another pretty puppet like mother that much i do know i couldnt bear that but as she watched the slaves braiding and arranging her hair in the mirror she was struck by how much she did resemble her mother and an uncomfortable thought occurred to her had lady viridina always been the perfect elven lady or had she been forced to pretend that she was until the last of her spirit faded and the pretense became reality the facade became fact could that happen to me a very uncomfortable thought that sheyrena turned away from it nastily there was not and never had been a sign that lady viridina was anything but what she appeared to be sheyrena was not her mother viridina could never understand her if only id been born a boy another thoughtpath this one worn by travel if only she had been born a male lorryns little brother instead of his sister they were nearly as close as brothers anyway for despite custom to the contrary because of his mothers obsessive need to oversee his welfare lorryn had spent plenty of time in the bower instead of being sequestered away with a series of male tutors viridina encouraged this and even dropped her fanatic watchfulness whenever her son and daughter were together he had shared plenty of lessons with sheyrena as they grew she had trailed along after him countless times dressed in his castoffs without anyone seeming to notice even now he smuggled her out in disguise as a male slave sharing rides and hunts with her whenever their father wasnt in residence discipline was relaxed whenever lord tylar was gone there wasnt such a close watch kept and lorryns age and status kept awkward questions from being asked she enjoyed the rides although the inevitable conclusion of the hunts generally made her feel sick and she avoided the kill whenever possible it was lorryn who had told her most of what she knew about the real conclusion of what he called the second wizard war please close your eyes my lady sheyrena obeyed the request and continued to follow her own thoughts she assumed lorryn picked up most of what he knew from the other ellords the young heirs and younger sons that he saw socially most of what lorryn had told her she suspected was not anything their elders would approve of her hearing very little of it was flattering lorryn and his contemporaries did not have a high opinion of their elders intelligence or ability she had the feeling that lorryn secretly admired the nowdeceased valyn lord dyrans heir who had actually joined forces with the wizards turning traitor to his own kind lorryn swore that he had done so to save his presumably halfblooded brother mere though how he could know that she hadnt a clue he seemed obsessed with that part of the story but as for her she could not hear enough about the dragons oh the dragons the slaves were working on her face now with tiny brushes and pots of cosmetic trying to give her some semblance of a living person that was going to be difficult to do her hair was the palest whitegold imaginable and her face completely without color in its natural state her eyes so pale a green as to seem gray anything they did with cosmetics was doomed to look artificial at the best she would resemble a porcelain statue at worst a clown at the moment she was inclined to hope for the clown lorryn had also been the one to tell her about the elvenbane who summoned the dragons some of what he had told her she had also overheard when her father had made conversation with guests but not that her father never even acknowledged that any such creature existed that wasnt particularly surprising the elvenbane was female and halfblood and must represent everything lord tylar hated and feared but if i could choose anything other than a boyi would choose to be her oh how that would shock lady viridina but that was what sheyrena dreamed in the secret dark of the deep night that she was the elvenbane powerful in her own right bending the world to her will and her magic riding across the sky on a dragon that was the way to live if i was the elvenbane there would be no father to stop me nothing i couldnt do if i wanted to i could go anywhere see anything be anything that i wished she settled back into her daydreams as the slaves worked on her face tiny brushes flicking across her cheeks lips and eyelids with the kiss of a thousand butterflies she envisioned herself mounted on a huge scarlet dragon soaring under a cloudless sky so high above the forest that the trees blurred into a mossy carpet of green and there was no sign of walls or buildings in her dreaming the dragon carried her toward the mountains she had never seen which rose to meet them towering spires sparkling with fantastic crags of crystal and rose quartz amethyst and a polite cough woke her out of her dream regretfully she opened her eyes and regarded the handiwork of the slaves in her mirror it was appalling it was also the best they could do and she knew it her eyes were washed out by the heavy peacockblue they had painted on her lids her cheeks had hectic red circles that looked as clownlike as she had imagined and her rosy pouting lips simply did not look as if they belonged on her face she dared not approve it but she did not disapprove either if lord tylar didnt like it let him be the one to say so when she said nothing the slaves went back to the final arrangement of her hair left alone it was her one beauty but they were building it into an edifice that would match the dress and as a result it looked like a wig made of bleached horsehair they had piled most of it on the top of her head in stiff curls coils and braids leaving only a few tendrils stiffened with dressing and trained into wirelike spirals to trail artificially about her face now they were inserting all the bejeweled hair ornaments her father had dictated heavy gold and emerald of course if i had been dressing myselfi would have chosen the pale rose silk with flowers and ribbons pearls and white gold nothing like this i would fade into the background but at least i would not look like a clown by the time they were done no one would ever recognize her which was just as well she wouldnt want anyone to recognize her looking like this it wouldnt have been so bad if only lorryn could be with her hed have been able to make her laugh hed have helped her to keep her sense of humor about it all and he would have kept anyone she actually disliked from getting too close but lorryn was subject to spells of terrible pain in his headthe one affliction that elves were subject toand he had been overcome by one of those spells just this morning its just as well i wouldnt even want lorryn to see me looking like this lorryn lay on his bed with one eye on the door one eye on his hardwon book about an ancient and extinct tribe of humans called the iron people and one ear cocked for the sound of footsteps he had carefully positioned himself so that he could drop the book to the floor and fling his arm over his eyes at the slightest sound or movement of the door to his bedroom fortunately lord tylar was more likely to come striding into his sons chambers with a fanfare and an entourage than he was to try and catch lorryn unawares he hated having to feign kryshein a dreadful head pain accompanied by disorientation that had no counterpart in any human illness and was supposedly brought on by overuse of magic this deception meant he dared not leave his bedroom even after lord tylar left for the fete he never had suffered from this particular affliction though many elves didit was considered to show either a great deal of ambition or the precocious onset of magical power in a child viridina had chosen to have him pretend to kryshein attacks long ago precisely because such attacks were crippling easy to counterfeit and impossible to disprove and because to be afflicted by kryshein implied that lorryn was a powerful mage lord tylar was predictably and perversely proud of the fact that his son suffered from the affliction he particularly hated having to feign yet another attack on this occasion he had wanted to attend the fetenot because he was particularly looking forward to what was going to be a tedious evening at the very best but because he had not wanted to leave poor little rena to fend for herself lord tylar would not be bothering himself about her whereabouts and welfare he would be cultivating lord ardeyns other supporters lorryn knew what happened at huge fetes like this one they were too large to properly supervise and things happened when people became intoxicated rena could find herself being teased or humiliated made the butt of unpleasant or cruel jokes or fending off the unwanted advances of halfdrunk old reprobates or callow young hotheaded fools the ancestors knew he had made his share of drunken unwanted advances when he was younger before he learned his limits no real harm would come to her of course there would be plenty of lord ardeyns sober underlings on the watch for a male trying to carry off an unwilling or inexperienced elven maid before anything could really happen one or more of them would move in separate the gentleman from his quarry and substitute a human slavegirl before sending him on to his original destination in the garden or other secluded place the virtue and presumed chastity of the elven maiden would remain intact no one worries about what the slavegirls think about the situation poor things no rena would not be allowed to come to any physical harm but she could be hurt or frightened and he did not want to see either she was so fragile so vulnerable shed be all right even at a wilder affair than this if she were just a little braver ancestors i wish shed grown a bit more spine sometimes she acts as if she just might actually start to assert herselfthen she just folds up and does what anyone tells her to do she wouldnt need me if shed just learn to stand up for herself that was an uncharitable thought and he felt ashamed of it immediately after all when would rena ever learn to stand up for herself that was absolutely the very last thing lord tylar wanted her to learn a properly submissive daughter well bred well trained meekly bowing to whatever her father wanted from herthat was what lord tylar wanted and that was what lord tylar was likely to get too lady viridina was already risking her very life for the sake of her son and she had very little time or energy to spare to worry about her daughter a light tap at his door two knocks a pause then three more made him drop the book and slide off the bed even as viridina opened the door a crack and slid inside she was gowned and coiffed for the fete in silver silk and diamonds she could have been a living statue of crystal carved by the hand of a master i cannot stay she said in a low urgent voice i only came to tell you that i overheard tylar on the teleson and the guess you made was right so the high lords have set a trap for any halfbloods among the youngsters attending this fete he felt his blood run cold at the nearness of his escape i wondered when tylar gave all those orders about rena he could have made her look any way he wished with subtle illusionsunless there was going to be some reason why he dared not his mother nodded solemnly there is to be an entire gauntlet of illusionbanishing spells in place cast by the most powerful members of the council through which every guest must pass there is a rumor now that it was valyn and not his slave mero who was the halfblood as if they couldnt believe that a fullblood would revolt against a mad sadist like dyran lorryns lip curled with contempt but viridina shook her head no it is just the old men being afraid pretending that it was not revolt but the inherent evil and instability of a halfblood but now having decided that there was one halfblood among the young lords and ellords there may be more they are afraid and acting out of fear lorryn coughed they might be afraid but they are right he reminded her with gentle irony there is at least one halfblood among them viridina swiftly crossed the space between them and placed a finger on his lips before he could say more there are ears everywhere she whispered warningly not here he replied with a certainty she could not sharecould not for she was only elven he was halfblood and had the magics of both his mother and true fatherand his true father had taught him how to use the latter before viridina had freed him and sent him away to join the outlaw humans that had escaped their lives of slavery there was not a single mind in this manor he could not read if he wishedand he knew there was no one listening to them i must go soon she said then bestowing a faint smile on him i only came to tell you that you were right and we must walk even more carefully from this moment on i still do not know how you guessed he made no reply to that only bent to kiss her hand she turned it and laid it against his cheek for a moment in affection he stood up again and began to pace when tylar asked me to help create renas ornaments with my magic i first suspected a trap why go to all the effort of making real solid creations when simple illusions would be just as effective and a great deal easier to wear she nodded slowly the crystals woven into her hair sparkling with the movement his nerves were not going to be eased by pacing but at least it gave him some release for his energy when i learned from you that tylar had ordered you to lend rena some of your maids to enhance her looks with paint and powder the suspicion deepened into certainty that was when i knew i see she exclaimed an illusion laid over her features would have been much more effectiveand much more flattering than anything those poor clumsy creatures can do with cosmetics how clever of you to know that he shrugged not clever simply observant so i went out of my way to create impossibly ornate jewelry for rena of heavy gold filigree and emeralds not only necklace and rings but an elaborate belt that reached to the floor bracelets and hair ornaments his constructions would last for three or even four weeks and exerting himself gave him every excuse to have an attack of kryshein as a consequence tylar would be able to brag about his sons prowess as a mage while offering the reason for his absence and since the trap was supposed to be secret no one would guess the real reason why he was not at the fete only rena would suffer for this and only a little that did not make him happybut he had a great deal more to worry about than renas welfare it was beginning to look as if his own secret was in jeopardy he is ridiculously proud of you she replied curling her lip a little the mask of serenity cracking then she sighed your true father would be much prouder of you and with more reason he started lady viridina did not often mention his real father she had conceived him by a human slave a trusted man who had come with her from her fathers estate when tylar became increasingly abusive over her failure to conceive at all the man had been completely devoted to her what her feelings had been for him lorryn did not know and probably would never learn for the one mind in all of this place he refused to ever try and read was hers viridina did not discuss such things with her son and he would not violate her privacy all he did know was that at some point before she became tylars wife she had disabled garths slavecollar freeing his human magepowers of thoughtreading and that garth had used those powers to serve and protect her she had confessed to her son that she had never expected him to live past infancy everything she had ever heard about halfbloods made her certain he would be weak and sickly and would die before he reached his second year do you ever regret he began never she said flatly never once her powers of magic were at least the equal of tylars they might even have been superior when lorryn was born he already wore the illusion of full elven blood and she maintained that illusion day and night waking and sleeping until he was old enough and strong enough in his powers to maintain it himself tylar was overjoyed at the strong healthy son she presented him withand if she was dismayed by lorryns vigor she was too careful to show it ironically she gave birth the following year to sheyrena tylars true daughter who was as fragile in appearance as lorryn was vigorous two children were enough for tylar who openly preferred the amorous company of his concubines he left viridina alone after that i can never repay what you he whispered she interrupted him fiercely you are my child she said a hint of the fiery will that had fueled the fight now showing in her eyes you are my child all mine not his there is nothing to repay the force of her words stopped him dead in his tracks he was not sure about that although she could never have predicted what happened later everything would have been fine if events had proceeded normally viridina had no trouble holding her illusion on him he would have had no trouble maintaining it there would have been no need ever to worry that their secret would be discovered except for the elvenbane i must go she said then and turned swiftly slipping out the door before he could even reply he resumed his pacing except for the elvenbane one small girlchild and how much havoc that single child wrought in many ways that small girlchild had been very good for the house of treves if it had not been for her there would never have been a second wizard war and the ranks of the high and securely placed would remain exactly as they had been for the last halfcentury or more but there had been a second wizard war and the ranks of the high were decimated by the failure of battles and policy lord tylar had been waiting ready to pounce and pounce he had but the girl had made every elven lord painfully fearfully aware that the day of the halfbloods was not passed that there had been halfbloods born smuggled off and hidden in the wild lands all along the secret was out and now with the wizards out of reach the elves were assuaging their fear by searching for those halfbloods they could punish for merely existing in the abstract of course he could not blame them how could any of them feel anything other than fear for people who had not only the elven magics to call on but the forbidden magics of the human slaves magics kept in check only by the controlling collars locked around the necks of all slaves as soon as they were old enough to be trained in the abstractwell there was nothing abstract about his situation that was the problem and it was all the fault of one flamehaired girl he could not bring himself to hate herafter all she probably had as little control over her situation as he had over his but i wish she could have appeared in someone elses lifetime or at least wish she could have appeared after i found some way to dispose of lord tylar and was securely lord treves myself a cold thought that but inescapable he had been forced to watch the humiliation of his mother and sister for far too long lord tylar had never shown him so much as a single instant of affection he was another prized possession no more and no less but lord tylars cruelty to the possessions he no longer prized was more and more pointed and he no longer prized lady viridina it had occurred to lorryn recently that he and rena were not the only vehicles for alliancebymarriage there was lord tylar himself not while lady viridina was alive of course but but elven women are notoriously fragile and once rena is wedded and out of the manor and i am packed up to one of the liege men for more lessons in the management of an estate there would be no awkward witnesses except for human slaves of course but they were easily silenced if this had occurred to lorryn it had certainly occurred to lord tylar lorryn had seen the elven lord eyeing his wife with a light in his eyes that lorryn did not particularly like of late so without saying anything to his mother he had begun planning ways to turn the tables on her husband and make him the disposable one all those plans had been overturned by the advent of the elvenbane of course he flung himself down on the bed all interest in his book long lost oh if only she could have appeared some other time well she had no choice and neither did he now his plans were much different now they were concerned with his survival somehow he was going to have to negotiate this difficult time until the older elves lost some of their fear and stopped looking for halfbloods in their own ranks his stomach turned over as he thought of the consequences awaiting him if they found him or elseim going to have to plan something more basic how to get away and where to flee considering the number of times ive had to feign illness to avoid exposure lately maybe i had better begin planning an escape right now while i still have the leisure to plan it chapter the slaves drew their mistress to her feet and led her over to the floortoceiling mirror to survey their handiwork for herself rena stared at the reflection in the mirror and felt her stomach churn with dismay the effect of hair gown jewelry and cosmetics was just as dreadful as she had imagined no she decided after a moment more of contemplation it isnt as bad as i imagined its worse both gowns were of silk the undergown lighter in color and weight than the overgown they were supposed to create a flowing line as if she was a wave upon the seacurving over her body gently and voluptuously hinting at what lay beneath without actually revealing anything instead they hung upon her slight frame falling straight from her shoulders hinting at nothing beneath because there was frankly nothing there to hint at both gowns boasted long trains that were supposed to sweep gracefully behind her trains that would be pure hell to manage in a crowded room she kicked at the trains a little sourly all very well if you are someone like my mother with prestige and presenceor if youre a real beauty like katarina an vines people notice not only you but whether or not youre dragging six ells of fabric behind you and they take care not to step on it ill be lucky if someone doesnt halfdisrobe me by treading on my train while im walking the seagreen silk of the undergown was plain decorated only at the hems and cuffs with borders of plain gold but the silk of the peacockgreen overdress was patterned with iridescent emerald threads woven in a motif of moonbirds the symbol of the house of treves if anything this was worse on her slight body than plain silk would have been since the pattern had been woven large and there wasnt a whole moonbird visible in the dress until you got to the train it was supposed to show that she was the pride of her house instead it looked rather as if someone had made her dress out of leftover drapery fabric or else people are going to wonder if weve taken to displaying our symbol decapitated detailed or dewinged the darkness of the color made her pale skin appear even whiter than usual she did look like a corpse thanks to her stiff expression the cosmetics only made her look like a corpse that had been painted for the funeral charming absolutely charming but as long as i don t try to smile at least i wont look like a clown her hairno she didnt want to think about her hair it was a disaster an artificial construction cemented over her head a monument to vanity an architects worst nightmare but from her point of view it was worse to wear than it was to look at the emerald and gold ornaments were so weighty that she feared she would have a headache long before the fete was over an enormous emerald necklace lay heavily on her white throat and looked far too much like a slavecollar for her own comfort huge bracelets encircled her wrists under the oversleeves rings weighed down her hands and a belt that clasped tightly at her waist with a long end that hung down to the ground in front made her feel chained to one place i hope no one asks me to dance i cant move in all of this each of the emeralds was the size of her thumbnail at least and the gold that anchored them was often in palmsized plates the jewels might have been suited to a particularly vain warrior or a very vivid and strong concubine they certainly were ill suited to her she sighed and turned away from the mirror it didnt matter anyway she didnt matter she was nothing more than a display the very best thing she could do tonight would be to stay seated somewhere where lord ardeyn or any other wouldbe suitor could admire her jewels her gown and the power they impliedpower that any children she bore would be presumed to inherit after all lorryn had inherited that power hadnt he the maids waited for her to say something either in praise or blame she waved a heavy hand at them my father will probably be very pleased with you she told them unable to offer either on her own behalf myre please stay the rest of you may go the maids curtsied with relief evident on every face and swiftly left the room leaving only renas favorite slave myre behind the girl was not one of lord tylars former concubines one of the few who wasnt and that alone would have endeared her to rena myre had other virtues however there was nothing particularly distinguishing about myre she was neither plain nor pretty tall nor dwarfish her hair and eyes were an ordinary enough brown that was the outside an exterior that rena now knew was purely protective that was because myre was the only one of all her slaves who actually knew some of what was going on outside the walls of the estate although she was very mysterious and elusive about her sources of information what was the most important though was that she was willing to share that knowledge with her mistress she had begun by calling that news tales and stories but that particular pretense had been dropped a long time ago with the rest of the maids gone rena dropped her illusion thin as it was of satisfaction then chuckled as myre made a grimace of distaste i know rena said to the human i know dreadful isnt it you make me think of a sacrificial virgin from one of the old religions myre replied shaking her head a sardonic smile on her lips some poor little slip of a thing all weighed down with the gifts to the gods so that she sinks properly when they push her into the gods wellbrr not so much important for herself but as the bearer of the gifts yes i was thinking much the same rena sat back down carefully is there any way you can make these things a little more balanced i feel as if i might fall over at any moment ill see myre responded readily you know i think i might be able to lose some of those horrid hair ornaments i doubt lord tylar will bother to count them i have never envied you my lady but tonight i am very glad that i do not stand in your place the hairsculpture must be horrible to wear and the hair ornaments too heavy to think about she cocked her head to one side hmm i believe i can rid you of about half of them and still keep the entire dreadful effect oh please rena begged shamelessly lorryn made them theyll go away by themselves in a day or two and you can tell me news if you have any some the slave carefully removed one of the ornaments dropped it and kicked it behind the dressing table ive heard that the wizards have found a new stronghold and are settling in it that is theyve found a place where they can build a stronghold and theyve sent word so that escaping halfbloods can find them there the dragons are actually building the stronghold for them or so it is said i suspect its true they are rena didnt care about the wizardsbut that the dragons were still with them helping themhow can a dragon build though wouldnt that be terribly hard to do with claws and all myre laughed and kicked another ornament into a new hiding place i thought id told you that when i told you about the war dragons have magic too besides the magic of calling lightning they can shape rock to whatever form they like its as easy for them to mold rock as it is for a slave to mold clay into a pot rena saw her own pale green eyes widen as she stared into the mirror no you didnt tell me thatyou didnt tell me they had magic i mean flying and calling lightning is wonderful enough but magic of their owntheyre like one of the great dursans from evelon myre shrugged as if it didnt matter much to her well i suppose its a magic thats logical even necessary for something that big to have anyway think about itif you have to live in a cave wouldnt it be a good thing to have some way to make it more livable the slave disposed of another pair of hair ornaments then loosened the necklace somewhat as rena nodded i imagine youre right rena responded its just that every new thing you tell me about them is more wonderful than the last oh i would give anything to see one even at a distance the slave laughed dryly the way things are going youre likely to get your wish since they dont seem disposed to hide themselves theyre likely to start flying over the estates someday you really are attracted to them though arent you rena just nodded lorryn nowif he were here she knew what he would be asking the girl about the elvenbane he was as obsessed with the halfblood wizardgirl as rena was with dragons never mind that it was forbidden to even mention the name of the elvenbane to the slaves and that if they were overheard the fact he had done so would get myre in serious trouble not that myre would ever get herself in jeopardy shes too canny for that she always made sure that there was no one to overhear any of these conversations still lorryn took risks she never would but rena would rather hear about dragons a safe enough topic even if there was someone to overhear whats a dursan anyway myre asked as she took a comb and carefully rearranged renas hair to disguise the fact that ornaments had been removed and whats evelon evelons where we came from the girl replied absently her own thoughts caught up in a vivid image of a dragon sculpting a mountaintop into an image of itself i dont remember it of course and neither does lord tylar because we were born here but all of the really old high lords of the council dolike lord ardeyns uncle its supposed to have been a dangerous place so dangerous we had to leave or die dangerous myre persisted her eyes narrowing how rena shrugged lorryn says it was all our own fault every house had at least a dozen feuds on the boil and they didnt fight those feuds with armies of slaves or with gladiators because there arent any slaves there there arent any humans houses train their children as assassins or have magicduels or create horrible monsters to turn against other houses only half the time those monsters get away and become dangerous to everyone some of the houses got their emblems from the monsters they created the dursans are something like a dragon i suppose they look like huge lizards but they dont have wings theyll eat anything in sight and they breathe fire they made dragons tooonly the dragons flew away entirely the dursans began to have magic fascination magic so the histories say and that was one reason why they became more dangerous than before huh myre smoothed renas hair but she wore a closed inwardturning expression so was that why you all left this evelon in the first place i suppose so mostly we left because we could rena didnt blame her grandfather for leaving either if evelon was as terrible as viridina had said it was lorryn thinks the houses that left were probably the weakest the ones with the least to lose by trying somewhere else he says thats why there are so many lords here with very little magic every once in a while your brother makes sense myre replied sardonically so the weak ones fled and left the field to the strongwho will probably destroy themselves and everything around them as they fight each other i dont think i would care to live in evelon either you sound like lorryn now rena observed with a tiny laugh thats the kind of thing hed say as i said every once in a while he makes sense myre put down the comb and examined her handiwork so i take it thats the reason why no high lord will ever have a direct conflict with another why its all done through intrigue and battles with armies of slaves or gladiators rena nodded its not a law so much as an agreementin fact in the old days when we were first building our estates the high lords would all join power so that everything was done quickly now though it was her turn to grimace well pigs will don courtgowns and play harps before someone like lord syndar would lend his power to help lord kylan i hope that the dragons are better at working together than they are ive been told they are myre offered ive been told they lend their powers to each other and that there are never any petty quarrels between them that only betrayal of the worst kind can force them to become enemies they say that where the dragons are there has been peace for thousands of years thats supposed to be why they helped the halfbloods the wizards were just trying to live in hiding and it was the lords who attacked them to destroy them i suppose the dragons must have felt sorry for the halfbloods and disliked the lords who were trying to hurt them i wish we were like that rena sighed and studied her reflection if we were like that i wouldnt be served upon a platter to make some drooling old dotard a tasty bride she thought glumly if we were like that i could do what i wanted to do and father would leave me alone to do what what do dragons do when they arent helping the wizards she wondered aloud oh marvelous things myre replied immediately fancy flying playing games exploring using their magic to create beautiful sculptures telling stories all kinds of wonderful things it would take me all day to tell you rena swallowed around the lump in her throat that the vision of such freedom had conjured up if only i could run away somehow run away to the land where the dragons come from if only i could go somewhere where id never have to obey father again where there arent any rulesthe rules and her fathers will weighed her down as truly as the terrible jewels he had created for her weighed her down how could anyone fly beneath such a weight but wishing to run away was as useless as wishing for a dragon to come carry her off one was as likely as the other how could she run away shed never even been off the estate she had no idea how to fend for herselfwhich was precisely what she would have to do to keep from being found and brought back before she got more than a foot off the grounds running away was as out of the question asas pigs donning courtgowns and playing harps what was moreshe had already drawn these preparations out as long as she dared much longer and her father would come here to find out what the delay was about and he would not be pleased to find her completely gowned and jeweled staring into the mirror she rose once again with dignity if not with happiness dont wait up for me myre tell one of the others to wait in my rooms until i come home that would at least save myre from the tedium of a long and boring evening alone in these echoing rooms who myre asked promptly rena shrugged i dont know and i really dont care pick someone you dont like tell her i ordered it no slave would dare direct insolence to the daughter of the house so if there was anyone giving myre trouble this would be a subtle way for the human to have a little revenge all of the closets and drawers would be magelocked by renas absence so there would be nothing to do but sit and wait in this eternally peaceful and eternally boring dressing room until rena returned myre grinned slyly and bowedand if there was a touch of mockery in her bow rena was not going to say a word about it without waiting for an answer she turned and waved her hand at the door which opened at her signal and stepped through it into the hallway of pink marble like her rooms the hallway had been created by the previous owner of this estate a high lord with far more power than lord tylar had every room had doors that answered only to the signals of those with elven blood or powercurtains that would only pass those who were keyed to them sourceless lighting illuminated the entire manor until and unless someone with elven blood wished a room in darkness so there were no windows in this place not even a skylight slaves lived and died here without ever seeing the sun once they were brought from the pens to be trained some aspects of the manor were still as they had been when the original owner died lord tylar did not have enough magic to change them that rena reflected was probably a good thing she had visited other manors where one never knew what was going to lie just outside a doorsometimes it might be a hallway sometimes a ballroom sometimes a precipice not a real precipice of course but the illusion of one was quite enough to frighten rena out of her wits for a moment or twowhich had been the whole point of the socalled joke no this was a perfectly ordinary pink marble hallway lined with alabaster ums which led to an ordinary pink marble staircase which descended in a gentle curve to the next floor her own escort of human guards fell in behind her as she passed them just before she got to the landing of the staircase moving silently and hopefully lord tylar and lady viridina would be waiting for her at the foot of it having just arrived there from their own preparations rena had been counting on her fathers vanity to keep him at his preening she paused at the head of the stairs and took a deep steadying breath head high walk slowly try to remember that stupid train try to forget about the stupid escort pause between each step she took each stair of the curving staircase carefully and stopped at the halfway point to listen to the voices ahead of her lord tylar was holding forth on something but he sounded pompous not irritated which meant she wasnt late thank goodness for small favors she took the rest of the stairs at the same deliberate pace knowing that if she rushed and looked the least bit undignified lord tylar would be annoyed with her he was going to have enough to be annoyed with her about before the evening was over best not to give him more than she could manage he was watching for her her heart sank as she saw him turn toward the staircase as soon as she came into sight and examine her every move with a critical eye her stomach tightened and she found it hard to take those deep serene breaths hes going to hate the dress the hair the cosmetics hes going to hate how im walking it was an automatic reaction one she had every time she had to confront him how could she help it all he ever invoked in her was dread he was a handsome man even by elven standards but even by those standards his expression and bearing were chill and detached he stood much taller than viridina and his daughter by a headandahalf his pale gold hair was worn as his grandfather had worn his as if to invoke the memory of that formidable man cut unfashionably short and without the usual diadem or fillet that current mode dictated his long chiseled face bore no signs of emotion whatsoever but rena knew him well enough to be aware that the slight narrowing of his brilliant green eyes meant he was looking for faults to criticize he and lady viridina were dressed in the same colorsor rather lack of themof icewhite and gold his costume hinted at armor without actually being armor hers was a more elaborate version of the same gown rena wore on lady viridina however the gown of pearlywhite silk with iridescent moonbirds looked beautiful the only touch of color that either of them wore was in the emeralds and beryls of their jewels again the ladys jewels were copies of renas but she carried them as if she did not notice their weight in the slightest lord tylars jewels were simpler and fewer belt a single ring a single armband and a torque about his neck rena paused on the last stair to wait trembling inside for her father to speak silence stretched the moment into an eternity as she strove to keep her trembling invisible good he said finally with grudging approval you are actually presentable she kept her relief as invisible as her trembling and took the last few steps across the marble between them thank you my lord father she whispered she hadnt meant to whisper but somehow she couldnt raise her voice any further than that well lets not stand here all night he turned before he even finished the sentence and strode off down yet another pink marble hallway this time heading for his study and the transportation portal in it he could never have mustered the magic for a direct portal to the council hall but one had come with the manor the treves portal would take them to the council hall and from there they would use the hemalth portal to the estate permitted to pass there by the magic signet impressed into the invitation only those who had access to such portals would be able to take such a direct and immediate route to the fetethe ones who did not would be forced to take tedious journeys across country until they reached the estate the hard way it was a measure of the power the house of hemalth held that there were plenty of elven lords praying for the opportunity to make such a journey the ring on renas right index finger was not one of lorryns creations but a simple signet with a moonbird carved into the beryl not an emerald held in the bezel that would be her key to the portal that would allow her to return home without it she would be stuck in the council hall until someone came to get her while emeralds were prized for their beauty and sought after by the human slaves permitted jewels it was the more common beryl that was truly priceless to the elven lords for only beryls could take and hold magic power or be used as the containers for spells women wore emeralds useless lovely emeralds men bore beryls as the outward signature of their power rena trailed along behind her father careful not to step on the train of her mothers gown with the guards following in her wake the door opened as lord tylar approached and me little parade massed through it into the room beyond there wasnt much to mark the room that her father called his study as anything of the kind it really held nothing but a white marble desk and a couple of chairsno books certainly no papers he left all of the tedious business of dealing with accounts and the like to his supervisors and underlings the pink marble of the floor of the hall gave way here to soft thick carpets of leathered gray and the pink marble of the walls to some unidentifiable substance the pale gray of rain clouds there were two doors to this room both of a darker gray than the walls the one they used to enter and the one that stood directly across from itbut the second was no door at all but the portal lord tylar stopped in front of the portal his hand on the latch and turned back to frown at his daughter rena shrank into herself a little involuntarily hold your head up he reminded her sharply and smile without waiting to see if she followed his orders he opened the door and stepped through it he did not hesitate a momentbut then he was used to portals by now the doorway held only darkness and it was as if he had been devoured by that darkness the moment he stepped across the threshold rena had never actually used this or any other portal before although lorryn who had told her it was nothing to be afraid of still something inside her quailed before the lightless emptiness of it and she would have stepped back except for the presence of the guards behind her who are probably there to make sure i dont turn and bolt back to my room lady viridina seemed oblivious to her daughters fear she didnt even hesitate simply followed her husbands lead stooped and gathered her train up gracefully and stepped across the threshold into nothingness rena froze one of the guards cleared his throat ostentatiously she started and turned to look at him knowing her eyes were probably as wide and frightened as a rabbits if my lady would please to follow the lady viridina he said in a voice harsh with many years of shouting orders his bland but implacable expression left no doubt in her mind that he had been ordered to pick her up and carry her across if she balked that indignity at least she would spare herself she bent as her mother had though with none of viridinas grace picked up the end of her train in hands that were damp with sweat and crushed the silk to her meager chest then with her eyes shut firmly so she would not have to see what she stepped into she crossed the threshold myre took a great deal of satisfaction in delivering renas orders to tanhya leis a particularly nasty piece of blond work that myre had been longing to get stirred into mischief for some time now mischief after all was a timehonored draconid tradition and this was one tradition myre saw no reason to abandon tanhya had been banished from the harem for deliberate sabotage and now was trying to make everyone elses life miserable engaging in histrionics and trickery in an effort to regain the comforts of her rightful place she wouldnt get it of course she was far too common for the tastes of lord tylar and she probably would have been disposed of soon anyway but nothing would convince her otherwise in fact she was quite certain the place of chief concubine now occupied by a slim and dignified brunette was hers by right where she got that particular illusion myre had no ideabut forcing her to spend her evening cooling her heels in lady sheyrenas dressing room should give her plenty leisure to nurse her grievances with any luck shed have come up with some plan or other to rid herself of the obstacles in her path that would be even more entertaining than her last attempt at eliminating keri eisathe one that had gotten her banished in the first place really myre chuckled to herself as she watched tanhya returning to the dressing chamber her back stiff with anger how dense can even a twolegger be youd think shed have known that stupid cooks helper of hers would be caught and that hed talk once he was caught i dont care how good you are in bed thats not going to keep your paramour from telling everything he knows when his tail is in the fire after all it was trying to seduce one of the guards into spoiling keris looks and making it look like an accident that got her sent down here in the first place one more incident and tanhya would probably find herself sent to the breeding pens no elven lord would ever take the quarrels between the women in his harem seriously enough to invoke the ultimate punishment on the perpetratorsbut no elven lord would ever allow someone like tanhya to inconvenience him either and right now being without keri would be a serious inconvenience for lord tylar this was all the more amusing to myre because keris rise in the harem was due to her own interference keri had been simply very attractiveuntil myre slipped into the harem one night and did a little careful rearrangement of her face from sculpting stone it was a simple matter to move to sculpting flesh and anyone who knew how to shapechange would find it very easy to make that transition if the power was there in the first place next morning lord tylar found himself possessed of a real beauty and keris rise from nothing to chief concubine had upset the established order of the harem that had put the idea in tanhyas head that she could become chief concubine as easily as ken and the fight was on strangely enough it never occurs to the elven lords that the same powers their women use to sculpt flowers could be used to make beauties of their human slaves that had been very early in the game when myre had first insinuated herself into this particular household as only a dragon couldshapeshifted into the form of a human slave her only thought at the time had been to see how much she could learn and how much trouble she could cause for the elves she hadnt picked this house for any particular reason other than the fact that lord tylars overseers were not terribly careful about keeping track of ordinary female houseslaves the elder dragons would have a fit if they knew she was not supposed to be here at all in fact and certainly not in the form of a human she was supposed to be shapeshifted among the wild alicorn herds that was what the elder dragons of the lair thought she was doing theyd have had seizures if they knew where she really was since the second wizard war the young dragons of the kinthose that had not deserted the lairs of the kin to help the halfbloodshad orders that were not to be violated stay away from the elves it was bad enough so the elders thought that the elves knew that dragons existed it would be worse much worse if the elves had any idea of their shapeshifting abilities or how easily and thoroughly their very homes could be invaded only the oldest and most clever of the dragons would be permitted to walk in shifted form among the elvesonly those with experience in keeping themselves safe and only for the purpose of gathering informationthere would be no interference in the lives of human slaves or of elves hah as if alicorns had anything worth learning about like tanhya pretty outside crazy inside and just about as much sense and speaking of tanhya she has her little circle of supporters and one of them is our supervisor if i dont want to end up doing some mindless chore until bedtime id better get out of the way before maryan finds out who delivered the bad news to tanhya the best and most entertaining place to get out of the way as myre knew from long experience was the roof not that a human slave had any business being on the roof but she wouldnt be a human slave once she got up there she went up two staircases and a ladder and out the rooftop hatch and a moment later there was one more ornamental moonbirdrainspout up on the roof than there had been before from this vantage myre had an unobstructed view of the grounds of the rear of the manorthe place where things actually happened that is not the pleasure garden but the kitchen garden the stables the beginning of the slave quarters with all the masters gone but lorryn the only activity would be among the slaves she watched the slaves scurrying about their business with avidity after having been one she had quite a few motions about how the kin could use the natural abilities of humans it would be very pleasant to have someone around to oil her skin and groom her for instanceto heat water for a really good hot bath instead of making do with the odd hot springto hunt her kills for her and skin and prepare them in nice bitesized chunksto keep her lair swept and clear of vermin the old ones are crazed cowards or both she thought resentfully just because the elves know we exist that doesnt mean they have a clue about what we can do they cant detect us when were shapechanged among them our magic isnt an illusion that can be broken and unless they somehow get the idea that we shift mass into the out theyll never know what to look for her thoughts ran down old wellworn paths of discontent and rebellion with proper manipulation the kin could easily wear down both sides of this conflict halfbloods and elves alike until they were both so worn out with the struggle that we could take over both sides at once then we would be the ones to dictate terms and peace and the humans would probably be so grateful that they would serve us better than slaves it was a glorious thought ripe with a hundred possibilities all of them currently blocked by the elders stubborn refusal to see any other path but that of caution myre was not alone in her restlessness by any means she had her own coterie of followers among the younger dragons who chafed at the restrictions that the elders placed them under they wanted the right to range freely in any shape they chose and there were at least one or two who found the idea of having twolegger servants as pleasing as myre did all of them had decided that the elders were too conservative and needed to be replaced in their roles as leaders of lair and kin there was only one little problem with this the older a dragon became the more powerful he grew a dragon never really stopped growing and with age came physical strength skill in magic and power of will no one dragon no group of dragons myres age could ever hope to defeat an elder no group of dragons maybe if someone had looked up from the garden at that moment he would have seen the waterspout gape its beak in something like a smile but it doesnt have to be a dragon does it the elders feared elves and wizards alike and with good reason small and physically weaker than dragons their magics were nevertheless quite formidable even by draconic standards one against one and the dragon would winbut elves and halfbloods would never fight a dragon in a single combat ive seen what they can do elves and halfbloods alike if i could get a halfblood on my side and trick it into helping me get rid of the older dragons i could pack the council with my friends theres a lot of discontent among all of the kin not just the ones in my band they dont see any reason why we need to redouble our efforts to keep in hiding now that we arent a secret anymore i dont even have to do much just weaken the elders cloud their minds or something and take over quietly and easily by the time they figure out whats happening it will be too late to stop me the only dragons who would have opposed her were no longer with the kin anyway but that particular observation brought her no joy only a sour feeling in the back of her mind those dragonsled by her own mother who should have been supporting myre instead of agonizing over the wayward behavior of myres brother kemanwere part and parcel of the cause of the very restrictions myre now suffered under if mother hadnt brought that damned halfblood cub homeor if someone had just had the decency to get rid of it instead of letting keman make a pet out of itnone of this would have happened now the waterspout snarled silently that halfblood cub had grown up to absorb the attentions that myres mother alara should have devoted to myre herself right from the very beginning it was all just one more example of how everything that keman did only caused alara to spoil and cosset him more and everything myre did was somehow wrong even when the cub had finally overstepped even the generous bounds alaras indulgence set and attacked myres best friend it wasnt killed as it should have been it was only sent out into the wilderness to fend for itself then what did keman do but follow it and what did mother do not abandon the brat to his own devices she followed him then when he defies the entire lair and then runs away she keeps the rest from going after him to punish him the way he should have been in the first place myre seethed at the memories of how alara had spoiled keman and ignored her her stomach burned with anger and her talons clenched so hard on the stone of the roofedge that it began to chip beneath them keman always keman and even when the brat came back and myre finally put him in his place defeating him in single combat did alara at last come to realize which of her two offspring was really the superior no instead she and half of the elders went kiting off after precious little keman and in the process of helping protect him and his pets revealed the existence of dragons to the very creatures they had been trying to avoid for centuries it was enough to make a sensible dragon want to rend things anger was making her lose control over her shape and with difficulty she calmed herself down after all it wasnt as if she was all alone lori was twice the mother alara had been to her lori thought that myre was absolutely right in everything she had said and doneand lori was supporting myre in her bid to become the lairs new shaman not that mother ever gave me one iota of training oh no that was all for dear keman and his pet and after all at least now that everything was turned so upside down there were more opportunities than ever before for an ambitious dragon to gain power in the lair you just had to be clever about it and once ive got the lair under my talonsif kemans very lucky i might leave him and his pets alone for a while once she had a halfblood of her very own it would only be a matter of time before she had the lair once she had the lair and the rest of the kin saw how successful she was it wouldnt take long before other lairs followed her as leader then ill have them all elves halfbloods and keman and his pets not even mother or father dragon will be able to stop me she had come here in the first place simply out of a spirit of rebellion but once she actually came to realize what the situation was in the house of treves this great plan all fell into place for her that was why she stayed here cultivating sheyrena she knew something that poor pathetic little sheyrena didnt renas brother lorryn was a halfblood he had no contact with the other wizardsin fact until the elvenbane showed up elvenbane pah trust that little nuisance shana to come up with a name like that for herself lashana wasnt good enough for her oh no she has to have a name like some creature out of a legend he hadnt even known there were any other halfbloods in existence he had no way of getting to the new citadel now even if he had contact with them he was too busy trying to keep from being caught but the odds against him were lengthening myre knew even if he didnt that the high lords council had declared that all male elves of a certain age were to be tested with illusionbreaking spells paranoia ran high among them at the moment especially after myre had seen to it that a particular rumor started that was a good touch planting the story that shanas ally valyn was really a halfblood if dyran who supposedly hated the halfblood worse than anyone could have had a halfblood heir where else might halfbloods be lurking lorryn knew that something was up though hed severely curtailed his visits to his friends and had stopped attending official gatherings altogether myre had a pretty good idea that the fete this evening was going to be one of those times and places where the young males came under magical scrutiny if lorryn also knew or guessed this it was probably the reason why he had an attack of kryshein at the very last minute myre was calm again contemplating the jaws of the trap that were closing around lorryn with satisfaction he cant hide forever sooner or later the high lards are going to send someone to test him in person here and it will all be over for him and i will be there to play savior she had been filling renas head with stories about the dragons as well as the wizards painting idyllic pictures of life in the lairs and in the new citadel those stories were surely getting back to lorryn when the jaws of the trap closed she would be there in the very nick of time revealingwhat i think ill keep the fact that im a dragon to myself for a while at least until i have him safely into the wilderness unless i need to shapechange in order to actually get him out of here right now rena has every reason to trust me shell probably believe me if i say im an agent of the wizards when i offer to rescue lorryn lorryn would have no reason not to trust her after all myre could spirit the halfblood out get him into the desert and then start working on him once he was weakened by thirst and hunger hed be easy to manipulate ill tell him that there are dragons who are against helping the halfbloods and that im trying to get them out of power its even true once i have his help i can depose the elders then ill either have figured out how to keep him under control or ill just get rid of him the sun descended slowly setting the thin clouds on the horizon aflame as myre contemplated her eventual triumph the first portal transition left rena shaking the second left her partly stunned with confusion she followed in her fathers wake with her mind still spinning too numb to really take much in the reception chamber was about the size of her fathers study in fact in other circumstances it might be lord ardeyns study they were ushered out immediately and into a dimly lit hallway so she didnt get a good look at the room she did notice an odd little tingling of magic along her skin as she passed the door as if someone had cast a spell on her but it didnt seem to mean anything and she dismissed it from her thoughts she hardly noticed her surroundings at firstthe corridor her father led her through was very dark which seemed odd but that might just have been for effect it was only when her foot brushed against something soft something that hopped away that she looked up startled and realized that the corridor she was walking through was formed by the trunks and interlaced branches of enormous trees that the carpet beneath her feet was a thick cushiony moss and that the room they were entering was a huge glade a sylvan paradise a scene out of the days before the first wizard war a perfect illusion of an evening sky complete with full moon and sparkling stars stretched overhead rena only knew it was an illusion because the stars were scattered randomly across the heavens and not set in the constellations she knew from her wanderings with lorryn where the walls of the ballroom would have been there were only tall trees straight and perfect their boughs holding the round globes of glass in which magically created multihued light was held captive the springy floor boasted flat white flowers spread out on the surface of the moss which opened their five moonround petals to the false moon above and gave forth an intoxicating perfume when they were trod upon lord tylar and lady viridina were already lost in the crowd rena had the presence of mind to step aside into the shelter of the trees before stopping to gawk she had never seen illusion or createdmagic on a scale like this before in her life truly lord ardeyn had spared no expense a spectacle like this must have taken the talents of a dozen mages the equal of lorryn perhaps more an odd chirruping sound overhead made her jump she looked up and met the bright shining eyes of a bird with plumage as fantastic as anything she had ever created in her garden it chirped at her again and before she could even mink to call it to her hand it flew down to her shoulder and from there to the hand she held automatically outstretched she began to pet it a smile coming to her lips without an effort it had a long sweeping tail a high upraised crest and pale pink feathers as soft as thistledown it leaned into her caress and closed its eyes with pleasure crooning musically to itself a moment later a young doe stepped out of the shadows and begged for a caress of its own as rena continued to look around she spotted more tamed birds and animals wandering among the guestsmostly being ignored which was a pity for they seemed to crave attention and petting there must be a spell on them to keep them away from the refreshments and to keep them from soiling someones clothing she thought practicality intruding on the romance and sure enough just as that occurred to her the bird took off and sought a perch a little distance away making a discreet deposit before returning to her hand this was exactly the kind of fete rena had read about from the old days when the elven lords were secure in their power and before they had begun to feud among themselves again was lord ardeyn trying to imply something by this oh probably not hes probably just trying to impress the high lords who remember what the old days were like would my lady care for wine rena controlled herself this time and did not jump or let out a squeak when the voice came from behind her the doe scampered away and the bird took off for the branches as she turned to find herself confronted by a creature that did not in the least resemble the human slave she had expected instead the servant politely offering a tray of exquisitely fluted crystal goblets had the head of a stork feathercovered hands and arms and two definite claws instead of feet but the feathers were brilliant blue and scarlet the head boasted a crest never worn by any stork rena had ever seen and the body beneath the tunic in hernalth colors seemed human enough yes she said as the birdman cocked his head to one side and examined her with one bright eye i believe i would thank you the birdman extended the tray gracefully and stalked like a stork wading through water off toward another guest rena blinked and watched him go after a moment it occurred to her that her mouth felt terribly dry and she sipped her wine it didnt taste like anything she had ever drunk before but that was no surprise elven feasts and fetes were full of these little subtleties the wine was faintly sweet with a perfume like the flowers it tingled on the tongue and left a crisp refreshing aftertaste behind as her eyes became accustomed to the light and she began to distinguish the servers from the guests it seemed that there were no openly human servants here tonight they had all been transformed by illusion into halfbird or halfanimal creatures or even halfinsect she caught sight of one with huge faceted eyes begemmed antennae and gently waving butterfly wings it seemed that lord ardeyn was making a deliberate attempt to conjure up the glory days of conquest when human slaves were never allowed into the presence of their masters without some illusion or disguise to cloak their nature as long as she had the wineglass in her hand none of the tamed birds or animals would approach her when she gave the empty glass to another halfbird servant a fox came out of the trees and rubbed against her legs like a cat she bent down to pet it and it arched its back against her outstretched hand she would have been perfectly happy to stay at the edge of the woods and play with the animals but if father finds me here instead of out there hell be angry with me glumly she accepted another glass of wine and tossed it off without pausing to admire the taste hoping to drink down some courage with the sparkling vintage then with much reluctance she made her way toward the center of the glade working her way through the strolling guests in their rainbowhued costumes with some difficulty no one seemed to even notice she was there she might just as well have been one of the servants there was a cluster of multicolored lights there illuminating a small number of musicians and a group of people whose understated elegance told her without words that they were very important indeed only a person of supreme importance could afford to look unimportant at a gathering like this one lord tylar was among them managing to look dignified although rena knew from his very faint frown that he was vexed about something maybe hes annoyed that he overdressed whatever it was the frown did not clear away when she appeared standing uncertainly just within his line of sight so it was either something she had nothing to do with or she was the cause and her mere appearance had not set things straight whatever it was that had brought that frown to his face if it was her fault she would probably find out about it when they arrived homeunless she did something else that was worse between then and now he gestured to her abruptly and she managed to make her way through the crush to his side still as far as she could tell without anyone noticing that she was there he took her arm as soon as she was near enough and pulled her through a gap between two of the other guests she found herself standing beside him and facing two men one young one very oldshe knew that the second was very old because he actually showed the signs of age no elven lord ever did that until he was near his own end no matter what the humans were led to believe elves were not immortalthough to shortlived humans they probably seemed that way both men were engrossed in conversation with three ladies one of them the vivacious katarina an vines who was smiling raptly up into the younger mans face lord ardeyn lord edres may i present my daughter sheyrena lord tylar said into the first break in the conversation the older man smiled into her eyes the younger bowed over her hand without looking at her at all lord ardeyns attention was fixed entirely on katarina to the point of ignoring everything elsenot that rena could blame him why would anyone even look at her when katarina was in the same room charmed lord ardeyn said absently then resumed his conversation with katarina who had no need of cosmetics or jewels to enhance her beauty im very pleased to make your acquaintance my dear lord edres said taking her hand as quickly as lord ardeyn had dropped it the wrinkles around his eyes deepened as he smiled at her i hope you will enjoy our little fete he actually kissed her hand as rena blushed with confusion then released it and turned to her father you have a most charming child tylar the old man said transferring his smile from the daughter to the father sweet modest fresh and innocent i am sure she will make a good match for you that was clearly a dismissal and lord tylar was not too dense to know it that is my hope my lord lord tylar replied and with a tug on renas arm took her out of the circle of ardeyns intimates she cringed inside waiting to hear his immediate censure but to her immense relief lord tylar was not ready to take her head off for not captivating the guest of honor that went better than i expected he said quietly as he continued to draw her along to some new destination fortunately for her neck he was important enough that people noticed her trailing train and did not step on it lord edres seems to like you i suppose you must remind him of his daughter oh charming i remind him of a halfwit who cant even dress herself without help i didnt really hope that ardeyn would pay you any attention it seems that other girl was one of the first to arrive and he hasnt left her side all evening lord tylar made a sound that for any other man might have been taken as a small sigh of regret well i cant fault his taste youre hardly any competition for that beauty even though she had thought that herself it hurt to hear it from her father now she blushed again but this time with shame never mind there are plenty of other young lords here and i havent seen one of them that would make a bad alliance he stopped and gave her a brusque push in the direction of another group this time of dancers go on get over there let yourself be seen talk to people you know what you have to do or you should by now with those gentle words he left her striding purposefully after another knot of men with that indefinable air of importance about them leaving her standing stupidly at the edge of the group of dancers this time someone did step on her train fortunately she wasnt moving oh bother ive gone and done something stupid again the young man said a little thickly and she immediately suspected hed been drinking too much he managed to get himself off the train without tangling his feet in it and turned toward her giving her a better look at him he wasnt very handsome and his eyes had the sort of vagueness about them that she tended to associate with too much to drink in other wordshes the same version of lord ardeyn that i am of katarina a bad blurred copy and rather flawed excuse me awfully would you terribly sorry and all that im a clumsy brute or so they all keep telling me he laughed a little a high titter and she realized at that moment that it wasnt the wine that was making him sillyhe was that way all on his own correction on his copy of lord ardeyn they forgot to pour in the brains as well i dont suppose youd care to have a dance with a clumsy brute now would you he asked hopefully with another titter for his own cleverness perhaps if youd loop up that tail thing i wouldnt get tangled up in it again and we could have a pleasant turn or two around the floor eh he stared at her hopefully and added they say im a silly ass but they all admit im a good dancer under other circumstances she might have declined his awkward invitation with an awkward refusal of her own but she felt rather sorry for himhere he was quite probably dragged here by his father as she had been dragged by hers and for the same reason he was supposed to be making the acquaintance of eligible females with good alliance potential in fact it has to be harder for him i just have to stand here properly modest and hope someone notices me he has to make advances so she smiled kindly at him and his dull eyes lit up with pathetic cheer as she nodded he must have been turned down an awful lot this evening to be so happy to dance with me im not exactly a prize beauty his name it transpired was vkeln gildor erlord kyndreth scion of one of the older and more powerful houses and he was probably quite a disappointment to his noble high lord father everything he said to her about his lord father indicated that the patriarch of the family had more than once wished there were some way he could prove poor gildor was someone elses offspring she felt so sorry for him that she even danced with him again several times and let him bring her wine and a few refreshments he wasnt a really good dancer although he wasnt a bad one either passable that was what her own dancing master would have called him he didnt know anything but the most oldfashioned of dances either which left them standing on the sidelines watching more often than not he tried to make clever conversation but he was unfortunately just as dull and stupid as she had feared he was still he was company of a sort and be seemed to like the tame animalsthough he kept talking about how exciting it would be to hunt them instead of petting them and as long as she was with a male she was obeying lord tylars orders and he certainly couldnt take exception to that finally though he spotted an older man making his way purposefully toward them and said with a trace of apprehension oh curse it theres my lord father and it looks as if he wants me its been grand and he was off like a called dog bumbling his way through the crowd as if summoned to his fathers side by a whistle without another word to her she sighed and worked her way back through a thin crowd of onlookers toward the edge of the illusory forest evidently her lack of charmsor perhaps lack of statuswas noticeable even to a dolt like gildor he hadnt even offered to introduce her to his father which probably meant he didnt think she was worth introducing to him well the rabbits and birds didnt care if she looked like a wax doll in an absurd costumeand while she stood here in the shadows of the overhanging boughs there wasnt anyone treading on her train if this had been some other occasion she might even have managed to enjoy herself the birds and animals were very sweet the expected headache did not manifest itself due either to myres careful work with her hairdressing or to the rather excessive amounts of wine shed been drinking in fact she felt very flushed and not entirely steady now that she came to think about it maybe all that wine had been a mistake im not used to drinking this much but gildor kept pressing wine on me rather desperately actually i think perhaps hed been told to make sure whatever lady he was with always had a glass of wine in her hand when she wasnt dancing that was probably a good idea really if he made sure his partners were tipsy enough they might not notice he was such a dolt anything seems amusing when youre intoxicated she thought seriously about asking one of the servants to find something for her to sit on and was just at the point of intercepting one when her own father came striding through the crowd clearly looking for her he sported her too as the animals scattered into hiding perhaps sensing her surge of apprehension he made straight for her with an air of determination as the crowd of young onlookers parted respectfully for him he took her arm again and this time she was grateful for his support and did not resist at all as he pulled her along back toward the entrance to the ballroomcumglade are we leaving father she asked hopefully he didnt notice the hope in her voice i wont be getting any more business done tonight he said shortly and the wines flowing a bit too freely for my liking its time we all went home has he noticed that im tipsy she thought panic making her go cold ardeyn has some fairly wild friendshes in thick with lady trianas crowdand i dont want you around them if they start to get rowdy he continued ive heard tales of that onewell never mind hell be safe enough shortly the match with the house of vittes is all but confirmed i expect therell be an announcement tomorrow why am i not surprised she wondered if she ought to make some kind of comment but he didnt seem to expect one its not the best matchyou would be better insofar as inherited power would gobut its satisfactory and the old man seems bent on indulging the boy by letting him make his own choice the tone of his voice said what his words did not id never allow my son to be spoiled in such a fashion yes sir she said automatically he hardly noticed viridina has already gone ahead i was just looking for you finally as they broke through the edge of the crowd and entered the deserted corridor he turned to look at her did you do as i told you did you make yourself agreeable to some of the young men now she was more than grateful to gildor the dolt and not just for his company he had made it possible for her to tell the truth to her father yes sir she said earnestly i was even asked to dance several times lord tylar did not smile but there was some grudging approval in his nod good that was the last thing he said to her he simply towed her along like so much baggage through the first portal across the floor of the council hall and through the second once on the other side of the two portals and back in the pinkmarble hall of his own manor he abandoned her taking her escort of guards with him and leaving her to make her own exhausted way back to her rooms and the sullen ministrations of the blond slave waiting there for her whether it was the wine or her own exhaustion she hardly noticed the girls surly manner it barely intruded on her dazed thoughts and when her head touched the downy pillow of her own bed she fell asleep immediately and did not dream at all chapter rena woke by herself which was unusual morning generally brought three slaves to wake her early on her fathers standing orders he felt that no girl should be allowed to lie abed much past dawn he said such practices encouraged indolence she had no idea why he should feel that wayhow could she or her mother possibly be more idle than they already were but idleness was not indolence nor was it laziness being forced to sit with folded hands did not mean they were indulging themselves probably it was just one more way to impose his will on them it really hardly mattered since if she happened to stay up late in bed reading she could always dream in the garden once the servants were done dressing her today was an exception however either she had somehow awakened much earlier than usual orfar more likelyhe had left orders to allow her to sleep late to recover from her unusually long evening and the presumed excitement of the fete at least he was treating her with the same consideration he would give one of his prize horses this morning she touched a carved flower on the headboard of her bed and a dim pink magelight just enough to read by appeared just over her head it was impossible to tell exactly what time it was since she couldnt see the water clock in the sitting room or the sun outside the manor but she had the feeling that it was an hour or two past dawn rather than before dawn there was a faint headache just behind her eyes but otherwise she was none the worse for all the wine she had drunk last night that was a pleasant surprise i know that lorryns complained about feeling much worse than this after a party either that wine wasnt as strong as i thought it was or i didnt drink as much as i thought i had probably the latter if lord ardeyn had invited the little circle of sybarites that hung around vdann triana lady or was it lord falcion she would not be in the least surprised to find that his guardian had discreetly substituted a less intoxicating version of drink than the strong wine elven lords usually preferred or at least had done so for the early part of the evening even rena had heard stories about trianaa particularly disreputable lady who had shortly after the defeat of lord dyran insisted and gotten the right to drop the title erlord from her name and claim the house of falcion in her own right triana was said to indulge in every excess known lorryns friends were children playing kissing games by comparison most of her circle were the offspring of parents who were only a bare step up from being pensioners on some greater lords favoror were rare third or fourth children useless to their parents since no lord would ever divide his estate and no lord would wed his child to a landless spouse unless he had no other choice they could afford to debauch themselves no one cared what they did and no one would ever give them a scrap of responsibility most of them spent their time in endless parties or traveling from city to city staying at the town houses of friends or the friends of their parents they were generally granted just enough wealth to keep them busy in the spending of it and not enough to get them into real trouble which is a pity surely one or two of them are brighter than poor gildor and would make a much better heir to his fathers estate than gildor would for that matter i can think of some girls that would do better than he would she grimaced at the thought of gildor the salvation of his attention would probably be shortlived knowing lord tylar true she had followed lord tylars orders the letter of them anyway but it had only been the merest chance that led even a nonentity like gildor to pay any attention to her for all the rest of the younger erlords she might just as well have been one of the tame animals the odds of anything at all to satisfy lord tylars demands coming out of last nights fete were slim indeed if im lucky father will have enough on his mind that hell just leave me to my own devices again if im notwhen no inquiries come about me hell blame me and mother for it hell probably even forget the fact that katarina completely captured lard ardeyn and blame us for not somehow enthralling him theni suppose ill have to resign myself to a year of dancing lessons music lessons walking lessons talking lessons dressinglessons at least it would be something to do but all those lessons would take away her precious free time there would be no more rides with lorryn unless he could somehow spirit her away from her teachers there would be no hours in the library browsing through books collected not only by the house of treves but by the house of kaullis before them there would be very little time for the garden and her birds and yetit would be freedom of a sort for there would be no time for any of that if she was no longer sheyrena an treves but lady sheyrena wife ofof someone else eventually lord tylar would decide shed had enough lessons especially once her teachers pronounced her proficient and he would leave her alone again how can i not be proficient she asked herself wryly ive had more lessons on being the perfect lady than any three other girls combined if lessons could make me captivating katarina would never have stood a chance against me and if it took lessons to earn her the tiny amount of freedom she enjoyed now then she would endure the lessons as worth the reward freedom always seems to come at a cost and the more the freedom the higher the cost she thought with a sigh and what would true freedom cost me i wonder probably more than i would ever want to pay i suppose butit would be nice to know it was available she reached under her pillow for the book shed put there one that was supposed to be a story of romance and treachery did they always go hand in hand from the time when all the elves dwelled in evelon if she could not read about dragons this was the next best thing and while she had a little free time to read she would make the best use of it that she could a suntailed hawk soared high above the valley on the watch for unwary rabbits in the meadows below lashana linked her mind loosely with his enjoying the sensation of flight without the work she had been doing quite enough of work lately and it wasnt over yet with poweror the appearance of power anywaycame a terrible amount of responsibility this was a beautiful valley and whether or not the rest would admit it a site much superior to that of the original citadel old habits died hard and they would probably build their new fortresshome here with all the concealments of the old but they wouldnt necessarily have to the elven lords were far from here and neither she nor any of the other scouts had seen any signs of habitation for several days journey in any direction the dragons were of the opinion that this site was blessed with a temperate climate the forest that grew so thickly here was of mixed deciduous and coniferous trees and was very very old game was abundant and would continue to be so if it was carefully husbanded and harvested the one problem would be how to acquire foodstuffs other than meat the wizards were so used to purloining what they needed from the stores of the elves that very few of them were woodswise she doubted that more than three or four knew what wildgrowing forest plants were edible they could clear some few acres and plant crops therebut that would be an open sign that they were living here and she doubted most of the older wizards would even consider such a move not to mention the fact that planting tending and harvesting a crop is hard physical work and very few of them would care to subject themselves to anything like manual labor still at the moment all those decisions lay in the future for once she would not think about the future for once she would simply watch the land through the eyes of a hawk and take in the beauty of the river below the blue of the sky the stately trees reaching up well elvenbane how does the business of being a hero set with you shana released the hawks mind turned away from the hawk itself and frowned at the great dragon kalamadea who was currently shifted into the form of a crinklefaced old halfblood wizard in this form he had the bright green eyes and pointed ears of a presumed elven parent but the coarser features weathered skin and gray hair that would have come from a human mother father dragon i wish you wouldnt call me that she said crossly i dont like it why not kalamadea replied sitting down beside her on the ridge of rock that crowned this hillside it suits youor you suit it what hero or elvenbane i dont like either of them she replied turning her gaze back toward the sky searching for that hawk again i dont like being called elvenbane because i dont want people toto look at me as if i was some sort of icon of destiny im me plain ordinary lashana and i cant help it if some people seem to think i match a crazy legend that you dragons made up in the first place there are plenty of people who could be made to fit that particular legend anyway why not call shadow the elvenbane or zed or even denelor but you are the only one who actually instigated and led a revolt against the elven masters to the betterment of at least a few fully human slaves kalamadea replied roguishly tugging a lock of her long hair playfully and the only one who brought the dragons to help her oh please she groaned giving up the search if i hadnt done something you would have found a way to interfere again and you would have led the others to help the wizards somehow you know you would have would i was kalamadeas only reply but i am no hero shana and neither am i she said stubbornly then with a heavy sigh added and im no leader either i wish i was i wish id been trained for this handling people i hate to have to put all my trust in parth agon after the way he tried to use me but at least he knows how to make people do what he wants them to do people are used to thinking of him as the senior wizard anyway often as not they just obey him without thinking twice about it they dont listen to me oh they say im their leader but i cant even get them to see sense when its right in front of their noses look how i managed to find them the best site in the whole world a huge cave complex above a river in a rich valley and still they have to argue about building the new citadel here and that caellach gwain is not helping matters at all you do better than you think you do kalamadea began when he stopped in midsentence shana followed his gaze catching sight of a dragonin full impressive draconic formand his halfblood rider kiting up the slope of the hill below where they sat riding a rising thermal just above treetop level ah he said squinting into the bright sunlight your foster brother and your young friend i think there must be word from the rest of the wizards a good guess since the dragon was smallish by draconic standards and bright blue and the rider no larger than shana herself they glided up the slope swiftly and with a thunder of wings and a wind that blew bits of grass into the air landed beside kalamadea and shana in the clearing along the top of the ridge the slight darkhaired rider tumbled off of the blue dragons back quickly enoughdragonriding as shana knew well from experience was far from comfortableand joined the two of them as the dragon shifted shape into wizardform to take up less space shana averted her eyes while keman took his new shape that of a short brownhaired muscular young halfblood the peculiar rippling and changing that accompanied the transformation always made her stomach queasy if she watched too closely i have good news and bad news mero announced as he got within easy conversational distance close enough for the emerald eyes and barely pointed ears that marked him as a halfblood to be clearly visible the good news is that even caellach has finally accepted the caves as the best site for the new citadel keman found a spring at the back of the complex and brought the water up through the floor with a constant source of fresh water right in the heart of our holding theres no reason to look anywhere else for a home and the bad news shana asked knowing from the tiny quirk of shadows mouth as he tossed his long hair out of his eyes that it was likely to be more humorous than truly bad the bad news is that the only place he could bring it up into was that group of caves you wanted for your own lair mero told her the quirk turning into a grin that displayed a strong set of fine white teeth sorry about that its now all underwater very cold water i might add she groaned but only halfheartedly the complex of caves she and the other three had found here was vast enough that there were plenty of other choices for everyone and still the caves would not be more than a tenth occupied dragons wizards former human slaves and all and even though it was a great deal closer to the elves than shana really liked it was well outside the borders of any lands the elves actually held under control if it hadnt been for the dragons though the caves would have been a very poor choice for a new home wizards though the halfbloods were they could not bring water where there was none nor could they shape rock with anything other than physical tools and their hands their magics were of illusion of attack and defense of the ability to move objects or people and very occasionally of the ability to create something if they had been searching for a new home without the dragons they would have had to build everything on their own and unmodified caves made for damp and often hazardous dwellings and everyone agreed that the new citadel should have an internal water source for obvious reasons after centuries of living in the comfort of the citadel the first wizards built they were not prepared to use either their hands or tools expect shana reflected and not for the first rime before she turned their world upside down the wizards had lived a life of relative luxury and indolence anything they needed they had used their magic to steal from the elves the citadel was already built and built to lastthey had not even bothered to keep it repaired and when something happened to make one room or suite of rooms uninhabitable the wizard in question simply moved there were dozens hundreds of rooms unused and unoccupied since the wizard war for those tedious little chores of cooking and cleaning there were always the apprentices halfblooded children spirited away by wizardagents before they could be discovered and killed by their fathers and masters that was the price of becoming a wizard to pay for ones apprenticeship by being the servant of an acknowledged wizard until the rest of the brotherhood accepted that you had mastered your powers there were always plenty of apprentices denelor shanas own master hadnt lifted a finger to clean his own quarters even for decades it hadnt always been that way when the wizards first banded together there had only been the experienced and the inexperiencedthere were no apprentices in service to masters they had all worked side by side to create the citadel in the first place and then to engineer the revolt against the elven lords and free themselves and the human slaves well i certainly took can of that shana could not help but feel a certain grim satisfaction for all that she really liked old denelor she had not much cared for playing servant to him and there were plenty of other wizards who had taken shameless advantage of their situation now they would all be working side by side again like it or not the few humansformer slavesthat were with them now were mostly children and even the hardesthearted wizard would not put a child to that kind of work only an elven lord would be that cruel to force little ones less than ten years old into the hard manual labor of an adult no the caves would have been fit only for use as temporary shelter at best if it hadnt been for the dragons the dragons not only could shape rock with their magic they enjoyed it keman had appointed himself to the search for water as soon as one of the older wizards had objected to that lack the others would mold and shape the place to the liking of each individual and to their own uses now the wizards themselves could devote their efforts to finding supplies of food to furnishing their own quarters and to working out a way to acquire the things they used to steal from the elves in a few months they would have a new headquarters that was better than the old citadel certainly it would be more defensible i like this place keman said simply as he dropped down beside the other three shana followed his gaze over the rolling hills covered with mixed grasslands and forest and nodded so far as she or any of the others had been able to tell there were no signs that anyone had ever lived here before if there were any of the monsters that lurked near elvenheld lands they were few and kept in hiding the elves were probably operating under the assumption that the wizards had found a place to build a settlement by now but they couldnt know where it was exactly and with luck the wizards would be able to keep it that way hadnt they kept the existence of the citadel a secret for centuries the citadel had been surrounded by elven holdings too surely they would be able to keep this place from being found out at least for a while i like this place too mero said unexpectedly i just wish we could get rid of about half the blockheads we had to drag along with us a little less complaining and a little more work would get things done a lot faster shana made a sour face i know what you mean she replied if i hear one more graybeard whine about the old days and how much better everything was i may pack up and leave again i can do just fine in the woods id like to see any of them manage to find me too then let them do without their leader for a while and see where it gets them see if any of them can figure out how to keep everyone fed and all when they dont even know how to hunt dont tempt me to join you mero replied i may not be used to dragging around in the wilderness but camping out in snow and rain is preferable to listening to them complain about the tiniest inconvenience they could be dead instead of building a new home and that would be a whole lot more inconvenient than anything theyre having to do without right now he shook his head ill never understand them i guess look at everything youve doneyou broke the siege you made it possible for them to fight the elves to a standstill you helped drive the bargain that kept the fullbloods from following uswe all four scouted for months and months to find this placeso whats their problem cant they be content shana shrugged she didnt understand it either she was used to living in far more primitive circumstances than this would bein fact for the first fourteen years of her life she hadnt once had cooked food for the dragons that cared for her ate everything raw and she had done the same but mero poor valyns halfblood cousin had been used to the soft life of the special servant of an elven lord and had adapted to scouting and roughing it just fine why couldnt those whining wizards do the same for fires sake if they were so deprived why didnt they just use their magic to recreate everything theyd left behind because theyd have to cooperate pool their power together and use the trick i learned with gemstones to concentrate it thats why they will never cooperate with each other as long as each is so jealous of his own power and theyll never admit might have learned something useful it was kalamadea that answered them both i believe the source of their discontent may only be because we are no longer in immediate peril he said thoughtfully scratching his chin with one finger once the danger was past the old inflexible ones stopped recalling that it was shana who was their chief aid against the elves started to recall that it was shana who brought the elves down on them in the first place and remembered all the comforts that she has therefore deprived them of it seems logical for them to think of shana as the author of their misery rather than the elven overlords mero snorted all the more reason for you to take me with you if you decide to leave these complainers behind they might decide that if youre not around they should blame me shana laughed and patted her friend on the shoulder its a bargain she told him lightly if i bolt ill take you with me keman rolled his eyes upwards if you bolt youd better not forget to tell us he exclaimed we dragons are only here because of you little twolegger and theres no reason to stay if you leave you think we want to have to listen to them whining without you to keep them off our backs i cant imagine why anyone would shana told her foster brother not for more than a heartbeat anyway caellach gwain surveyed the cave that would be his home for what was left of his life and seethed with resentment the dragon that had prepared it for him had smoothed the floor and walls it was true had drilled a ventilating shaft right to the surface and it was no longer as dank as it had been hed been promised that later another dragon would return and shape a little cubicle into a bath and necessary and another into a fireplace and chimney the dragons swore that there would be no trouble in creating a real sanitation arrangement nor a good heat source but it was still a cave with his few belongings heaped pathetically in one corner and nothing was going to make it into anything but a cave it was not his comfortable suite of four real rooms with real walls floor and ceiling of warm wood in the old citadel there was no furniture and there would be none until someone learned how to make it no bed no tables no chairsno rugs no fireplace no cushions no blankets no one to clean for me or cook for me and everything topsyturvy with brats that should still be apprentices playing at being our leaders and people who should be leaders forced to take their orders caellach grimaced angrily and if it hadnt been for those same brats i would be sitting in my favorite chair with a nice cup of tea right now or perhaps a glass of mulled spiced wine his mouth watered with longing he had not forgotten that this shana creature was the reason they had all been forced to flee the citadel in the first place and he was not about to let anyone else forget it either if she hadnt rashly used the old transportation spell to bring her and her three idiot friends straight to the citadel the moment she thought they might be in a trifle of danger the elves would never have known that it and the wizards in it even existed things would still be the way they always had been the way they should be comfortable safe and secure they kept telling him whenever he tried to insist on his rights and get his apprentices back to their appropriate work that things were different now and he would have to see to himself he didnt see why things should be any different especially not now wasnt it the duty of the young to see to the welfare of their elders hadnt it always been that way and the elders paid for that with their wisdom and experience which was only right but apparently that wasnt the way this new order operated anyone who is ablebodied will have to take care of himself hed been told rudely well get you started but youll have to make your own quarters after theyre roughed in and youll have to see to your own needs the nerve of them he seethed that had to have been on that shanas orders she had never liked him because hed put her in her proper place more than once hed be willing to bet that her own master denelor wasnt doing without the services of his apprentices and just what was he supposed to do to make this into something livable anyway he couldnt steal what he wanted from the elves the way he had in the old days that was part of the bad bargain that shana had made to get the elves to agree to leave them alone anyway the moment i did theyd know where we are now that would be stupid even by that brats standards was he supposed to go cut down trees and build his own bed chests chairs was he supposed to weave his own blankets were they all mad of course theyre all mad he told himself grinding his teeth they wouldnt have done this if they werent mad they wouldnt have fought the elves in the first place theyd have rendered that shana creature unconscious and left her for the elves to find they had no reason to suppose there was more than one halfblood after all she should have willingly sacrificed herself to save the rest of us it was her duty not dragging us into a war we didnt plan on and never wanted not turning our whole way of life upside down just because she thinks shes better than her elders he felt a flush of anger crawling up his face and forced himself to calm down it wont be this way forever he promised himself it may not even stay this way for long the other senior wizards have been listening lately when ive tried to show them reason there are probably a lot of them looking at holes in the stone and thinking now that i was right shana brought all this on us theres no reason for us to listen and obey when shana and those dragons start upsetting the proper order there was every reason for the older and wiser wizards to start returning things to the proper order they were no longer under a state of siege nor were they trudging through the wilderness it was time to set things right again and if parth agon would not take care of the task caellach gwain was just the man to see that things did get back to normal but meanwhile he surveyed the hard stone floor with ill grace supposedlyprovided that their so wise leader hadnt appropriated the children for some other necessary taskthe human children had been sent down to the river in the valley to cut reeds for bedding supposedly they should have made several trips by now and there should be many bundles stacked up on the riverbank waiting for someone to come get them that floor was going to be cursed cold to sleep on without something between him and it he started to call for one of his apprentices to start fetching bundles of reed down here recalled that he had no apprentices now and stopped himself with a growl well at least she cant forbid me to do this the logical way he thought hotly cursed if ill carry all those bundles down here by hand he didnt need a scrying crystal to locate the bundles of reed that was for mere apprentices he was a senior wizard and above such crude necessities he simply concentrated and called upon his powers a glowing ballshaped haze of light appeared in the center of the cave and within a heartbeat or two the unmistakable shapes of reed bundles formed within it he wondered for a moment as the power drained from him a bit how many he should take as many as i can fetch he decided and well just let them see who the senior wizards are he made a mental grab for his target and with an audible thud a dozen bundles dropped to the stone floor bringing with them the scent of fresh air and river water he surveyed his prizes with smug satisfaction he had really only needed three bundles of that size for an adequate bed but but they can cut more theyre not even apprentices and for once im going to nave the comfort i deserve after all it was only what was rightfully due him so now we have water denelor told shana gesturing at the filling pool of spring water with a smile of tired satisfaction on his round goodhumored face he was thinner than he had been months of hiking across the wilderness had trimmed off the excess pounds hed carried and had tanned his skin to a warm brown against which his thinning hair seemed whiter than ever i think i can even replicate some of the old magics with help eventually and well have real running water all over the citadel hot and cold in a few years when i was an apprentice i used to have to work on the plumbing so im partly familiar with it a look of determination replaced the smile what the first wizards learned to do surely we too can rediscover shana smiled back her old mentor denelor had done an amazing job of adapting to this new life she would have expected him to throw in his lot with the old whiners but instead he had turned into one of the first to try and work out a solution to problems as they arose in the meantime he was saying i can get water to a kitchen area and a bathing area next to it tomorrow the dragons will be sculpting rubs with drains for baths laundry washing things and the means to actually drain the dirty water away without contaminating our fresh water theyre already putting in chimneys and fireplaces todayfor now to heat the water all we have to do is heat stones and drop them into a filled tub we wont be able to cook a stew or a soup or brew more than a cupful of tea though until we find a way to get big pots food wont be a problem she assured him theres plenty of game in the forest plenty of edible plants down there too i suspect you wont even have to actually hunt just bring in the game magically the way we used to steal supplies and you know itll arrive dead denelor chuckled obviously he still remembered the way shana had casually magicked in a huge buck elk when she first arrived easily ten times the weight he her master had thought she would be able to handle shana had known better of course but he didnt believe her until she demonstrated her ability at least it wont be mutton he replied comfortably that is one aspect of the old citadel that i will not miss it was convenient to have that flock of sheep there but one grew very tired of everlasting mutton he turned to go back up to the next level above this the one where living quarters would now actually start since this lowest level had been usurped by the water the other two followed their footsteps echoing up the slanting tunnel does anyone here actually know how to make anything mero asked you know make pots build things with their hands youre going to need a lot of things from bed frames to clothing and you wont be able to get them from the elves anymore can you make things magically that will last the elven lords can some of them denelor shrugged and eyed his rather worn tunic ruefully i dont know he admitted i must admit that i had an idea that was very very tempting though were forbidden to steal from the elvesbut is there any reason why we cant steal from ourselves shana frowned im not sure i follow you she said doubtfully as they reached the place where the tunnel flattened out and other cave mouths opened up on it well we dont think the elves looted the citadel after we left it correct her former master said we dont even know for certain if they actually found it since they were really looking for us and not our hiding place shana nodded they could have destroyed everything in sight just out of spite though if they did find it she warned theyre like that yes but i dont think they actually found it and im sure they never had time to really do much but superficial damage denelor persisted im sure that they have some kind of magical guard placed around the forest and im sure they have regular patrols there now but i rather doubt they have a mageshield about itand even if they did shana i am sure you can break it she flushed i wouldnt be too sure about that she demurred but i think i see where your reasoning is going and honestlyi cant think of any reason why we shouldnt start systematically bringing things out i know its a long way from here to there but with several of us younger wizards combining our powers and using gemstones i think we can do it it would make our lives a great deal easier especially if we start by bringing out furnishings and whatnot for the whiners mero put in sourly shoving his hands in his breeches pockets and grimacing then maybe theyd shut up for a while denelor sighed shana knew he had been hearing nearly as many complaints as she had the thought had occurred to me too the talk about how shana has deprived them of their rights might die down a little could you get your little circle of friends together shana the ones mat know how to work with stones i think youre right they will be the only ones with a long enough range to successfully scry out the place and bring things back she grinned and theyre also the only ones whove crawled all over the citadel down all the unused passages i think youre right even if the elves got in there and did some destruction they wont have gotten into the older sections and there are still furnished rooms and the like back there old caellach may not get his bed but well get him a bed and whatever other gear he thinks he needs too kitchen things first please denelor admonished objects that we all need that will benefit all of us together then ill tell the others that they can bring you their lists and they can ask you politely if you can fill them when you arent too tired she caught the twinkle in his eye as he said that and if they dont ask politely we can decide were too tired hmm oh denelor if you werent on my side id be worried denelor shrugged but he had a wry grin we dragons have a solution too keman said shyly there are minerals gems in these hills gold we think we can bring those things up shapeshift into elven form and go into one of the elven cities to trade for things we all need if you cannot bring them from the citadel cloth and tools would be the best we thoughtfoodstuffs seeds for planting perhaps denelor brightened at that oh now that would be excellent he exclaimed his voice echoing a little in the stone of the kitchenchambertobe that solves a problem of continuing supply much as i hate to admit it shana i dont think that there are many of us who would know an edible forest plant from an inedible one and one cannot live on nothing but meat without getting sick i was afraid youd say that she replied with resignation oh well she took a moment to order her thoughts in the short term the best i can do is get my circle together and start bringing things over from the old citadel then she decided aloud if the elves didnt loot the place there was a lot of stored food there that was too bulky to take with us in the evacuation that would be flour tubers other vegetables dont forget blankets denelor reminded her you will gain a great number of friends if you bring blankets in quickly stone is cold to sleep on what about the sheep she asked slyly thats wool for future blankets mutton for future mealsi can bring them in alive now you know and there are a couple of the human children that can perfectly well tend a flock of sheep they do reproduce themselves you know he grimaced involuntarily and she giggled oh he sighed i suppose you must after all but dont worry master denelor she told him with a chuckle theyll be much too valuable in this situation to start slaughtering you wont be forced to eat mutton any time soon thank goodness for that he muttered as she moved off down a side corridor trailed by keman to find zed the first of her circle of young wizards nowmay the powers grant that we do not find ourselves in a position where even old mutton would be a feast working together the young wizards were able to find and fetch a fair number of articles that very dayand as denelor had requested the first object brought by magic from the old citadel was a huge kitchen kettle and the last a pile of blankets from the storeroom the latter were snatched up greedily by the old whiners caellach gwain predictably among the first shana noted that there wasnt a single word of thanks from any of them but she kept silent about it in part because she was too tired to make an issue of the slight and the next day fortified by a good breakfast of oat porridge made in the very same kettle they had brought in first from the oats they had brought in as the last task she and her group started in all over again those who were the very best at scrying examined rooms they were familiar with in order to identify what was there and whether or not it might be useful they confined their attempts at first to objects that would not be harmed too much if they were clumsy with their magic and which were not too heavy that had been shanas plan she reasoned that until they knew their limits it was better to bring in a few things at a time than to overstrain themselves trying to lift too much their first targets were therefore the kitchen and the storerooms and they systematically looted both of everything that was still there unbroken or unspoiled by vermin the elves it seemed hadnt found the old citadel after allalthough they certainly would have if the wizards had remained there rather than fleeing that was a cheerful discovery it meant that virtually everything was still there in tact and that eventually everyone in this new citadel would have his belongings back although she still didnt understand this preoccupation with possessions that the older wizards showed keman and the other dragons seemed to understand they couldnt explain it to her though and after several tries gave up let me just put it this way kalamadea told her finally with surprising patience the older the wizard the more likely he is to want desperately all his familiar thingsand the more likely he is to be less troublesome if he has them around him hes like an old dragon curled up with his hoard dont try to understand why just accept it and use the fact she nodded with a wry shrug it would be a small price to pay for peace she supposed even though this price represented quite a bit of effort on the part of her and her friends effort for which they would probably not even receive thanks and it was very very tempting to put the whiners on the very end of the list but if she did that they could and would accuse her of playing favorites and while they were waiting they would be whining even more and probably causing more trouble storerooms first though she told the dragon fiercely things we can all use before personal possessions denelor agrees with me on that kalamadea just shrugged it is your magic and that of your friends he replied and backed out of the bare little cave she had taken for her home kalamadeas and kemans were both nearby and she suspected that kalamadea had been the one who had smoothed the walls and the ceiling built in the sanitary facilities and the fireplace it looked vaguely familiarvery near to the room he had once occupied in the warren of caves in the old citadel in fact but at the moment it held only a bundle of reeds and the two blankets she was using as a bed and her scant pack a bed would have been nice and she had to admit that the old wizards werent entirely wrong about longing for some of the old comforts of their previous lives extra clothing would be nice too she reflected wistfully all that she had now had served her over rough country for the better part of two seasons and it was much the worse for wear she had often thought about piecing together another dragonskin tunic from skin the others had shed such a tunic would have held up to briars and rainstorms with equal ease shed never had time enough though maybe now she would still first things first there were plenty of storerooms to empty as they honed their skills at magically transporting a variety of objects longer distances than any of them had ever dared to try before this none of them would even have dreamed of trying if shana in her apprentice days had not made an experiment with a tiny cache of gemstones to see if any of them could be used to increase her power and range she had discovered that yes they could and had begun teaching the use of stones to her peers when a group of human children with the human wizardpowers on one of the elven estates was about to be eliminated she had insisted on leading a rescue to save themthus being the one to meet with valyn and his halfblood cousin mero as they made their own escape from valyns father and that fateful meeting had carried with it the seeds of the destruction of the old ways of hideandconceal of the wizards of the citadel within two weeks denelor had the kitchen bath and laundry functioning with human children employed in all three as well as some of the older wizardsnone of whom qualified as whinerswho were not fit for heavy labor by that time shana and her crew had begun looting the private quarters of the senior wizards themselves favoritism or notthe first ones they ransacked were their own and denelors though they kept very quiet about it transporting the belongings directly to the appropriate rooms rather than bringing them into the central chamber they were all starting to call the great hall after that though they stifled their irritation and started on the whiners things beginning with caellach gwain and he did not thank them in fact he was rather irritated with them for bringing his property to the great hall forcing him to use his own powers to take it to his rooms shana was so annoyed with him that she ground her teeth until she had a headache that brought the whole circle to a halt she was after all the strongest power in it and without her the others couldnt move much more than a single pillow or so at a time that irritated her even more until zed as the oldest called for a break so that they could all soothe roused tempers and perhaps get something to eat and drink it took more than bowl of soup and a cup of willow tea to soothe shanas temper but at least she managed to get rid of her headache if not her irritation im sorry she apologized as she came back to the circle and took her place on a cushion with the rest in the exact middle of the huge room her voice echoed quite a bit since the roof was quite high and had been left exactly as nature had carved it i shouldnt let my temper get the best of me around him zed only snorted contemptuously but said nothing shadow patted her hand and shrugged the rest grimaced or smiled as their natures dictated there was really nothing to be said after all caellach had been unbearably rude but someone with the kind of power that shana controlled had to have better control over her emotions than she actually didat least where caellach was concerned she knew that and so did they what if caellach had annoyed her while she was in the middle ofsaycreating a defense against attackers that would be a poor time for a headache well we fetched the old buzzards things and we wont have to deal with him anymore daene one of the older girls said at last she winked openly at shana and wrinkled up her snub nose hes good for three or four days at least fussing with his furniture and all like some old hen with her nest and a new load of straw to put in it we wont see him for all that time ill wager the comparison apt as it was for caellach cackled exactly like an irritable and irritated old hen made even shana smile at last as the rest chuckled youre right and wed better be grateful for the peace while it lasts she replied well lets get to work on someone whos likely to at least thank us parth agon do you think do any of you remember what his rooms look like to scry for them i zed began shana the shout from the doorway echoed across the entire room the shouter followed scrambling in the door and across the stone floor of the great hall all out of breath shana the little human boy gasped again forcing his words around his panting shana denelor and the big dragon want you down by the river theres a stranger at first she didnt quite understand what he meant then theres a stranger here oh no here in the wilderness where there should be no one but the wizards and the few humans that had fled with them who was it and more importanthaw had he found them kalamadea she called to father dragon with her mind is there danger should i bring weapons no danger yet i do not believe he replied the same way but i want you to see him and speak with him you have more experience than denelor or me with full humans a full human but how had he gotten here was he an escaped slave before the others could react she had vaulted to her feet and was running out the door the great hall was the very first real room in the citadel from there a long and winding trail led up to the surface leading through caverns that had been left more or less in their natural state the only concessions to habitation at this end of the citadel were the magelights at intervals and the smoothing of the path this place was like the limestone and alabaster caves that she had lived in with her foster mother and the rest of the dragons there were hundreds of fascinating formations she had promised herself that she would examine properly one day but not while she had so much work to do not while there were strangers showing up out of nowhere she burst out into the pool of sunlight directly in front of the cave mouth and flung herself down the path that led to the river a path they had cut carefully so that it was screened and protected by the trees and busheshoping to avoid detection from the air unfortunately this plan made it impossible for her to see denelor and the others down at the riverside i wish i knew what to expect i wish i knew how he got so close to us without any of us seeing him i wishno point in wishing just get down there now she pounded down the path at her fastest run feet thudding into the dirt breath coming hard even though she was running downhill when she made the last turn the river came into view a patch of brilliant sunlight reflecting off the water at the end of a tunnel of trees there were several figures down there dark against the bright lightand something low and long and dark in the water itself or at the very edge of it as she ran closer the shape resolved itself into a hollow object pointed at each end with a place to sit she had never seen a canoe herself but she did recognize what it was from descriptions in some of the old chronicles a boat but of coursewe werent looking for anyone on the river she could have flogged herself in vexation for not taking the precaution of putting at least one sentry above the river too late now there were only three people standing beside the canoe which had been tied to a stake driven into the riverbank denelor kalamadea in his wizardform and the stranger they were all obviously waiting for her and neither denelor nor kalamadea looked at all tense as she took in that she slowed to a walk so that she would not be completely out of breath when she reached them and so that she could get a good look at the stranger before she had to speak to him she got her first surprise when she realized that although he was fully human his neck bore no slavecollar and no signs he had ever worn one for the rest he looked like a field hand or a caravan trader his eyes were an ordinary enough brown his hair black and his hair had been pulled back into a tight braid to show mat his ears were not in the least pointed he was moderately tall very wiry and muscular dressed in a rather tattered linen tunic and trews of cloth so old and faded it wasnt possible to tell what the original color had been he had a bow slung across his back a long knife in a leather sheath at his ropebelt and what appeared to be clumsy boots made of rawhide on his feet he hadnt shaved in several days but despite his scruffy appearance her first impression was that he was not dangerous at least not at the moment but what was his purpose here could he be a spy ah shana denelor said genially waving at her to come closer and then turned back to the stranger collen this is lashana the stranger nodded his eyes narrowing not much tlook at ye be he said to her in the elven tongue strongly accented wouldn hev figgered little bit lak ye woulda caused smuch trouble bin a mort uv tales abaht ye though i take it youve heard about me then she replied dryly concealing her agitation from him she still had no idea what he was doing on the riveror who if anyone he served he nodded and his thin lips curved in a reluctant smile hardly thought when i seen smoke on th ridge id be passin greetins wit sech troublesome an savage rebels lak collen is a scout for a trading party shana denelor said easily and her eyebrows rose with alarm as she stepped back an involuntary pace oh not a bondling party the wizard amended hastily as collens grin turned into a chuckle cant you see hes got no collar no elfstones about him shana flushed with chagrin as she had seen for herself the neck of the mans tunic was open to his breastbone and he wore absolutely nothing else that could have served in place of the collar that could have bound him to an elven overlord his belt was rope the sheath of his knife was leather the knife itself had a plain wrapped handle with none of the dangerous spellcarrying beryls set into it and in any case if hed been a bondling she denelor or kalamadea would surely have sensed the blankness that meant there was a spell on him that blocked all the purely human powers of magic they all knew the shape of that particular blankness oh aye collen said agreeably no collars no leashes we be jest as dangerous a lot of savages as ye i spect an the cateyes knew we was here her eyes widened this was the one thing she simply had not expected you meanyoure wild she exclaimed her voice shadowed with disbelief oh shed heard that socalled wild humans existed but after tasting the efficiency and ruthlessness of elven rule for herself she hadnt believed they were capable of anything more than scrabbling out a bare and brutish existence and that was only allowed so that the elven lords would have something to hunt now and again that ran on two legs rather than four then again she chided herself as collens grin widened at her reaction the wizards existed for hundreds of years without the elves knowing there are wild humans beyond their lands we already knew that why not wild human traders to serve them oh aye collen repeated its none so bad a life lak call oursels outlaws though has a better soun t it he shrugged some on us be scaped some born free lak got no land no set home an we rigger we hev t move about a bit but got no overlor neither collen would like to talk trade with us i think we should invite these people to come talk to us shana kalamadea said gently breaking into her daze i think we might have something we can offer each other and since he already knows were here theres no point in trying to hide the citadel the dragon added deep inside her mind the more we show them the more impressed they are likely to be and the less likely to betray us ah of course kalamadea she said to both statements how far away are the rest of you not far be here fore sundown lak he replied with a nod lemme put out flag theyll pull in here without waiting for their consent he pulled a faded red rag out of the canoe and tied it to a branch where it would be seen by anyone passing on the river itself there she be he said with satisfaction nowwe jes wait lak she itched to touch his thoughts to see for herself if he was telling the truth did she dare if she did would he know and how would he take it fine denelor said easily ill just go up and tell the others to fix a meal for our newallies he raised an eyebrow on the last word collen shrugged canna speak fer the lot he replied laconically could be for sure an ye got stuffs t trade well be greeable t tradin for em that apparently was enough for denelor who strode back up the path at a much brisker pace than he would have been able to set a year ago collen folded his arms and leaned back against the trunk of a willow watching both shana and kalamadea bloods he said finally heard on ye heard on the troubles ye set last summer but never saw none i could say the same about outlaws shana retorted mildly can i test him out should i ask him if i can he grinned as if he found the retort amusing kalamadea simply examined him calmly as calmly as he regarded nearly everything from impetuous young dragons to elven magecraft why the river he asked finally mun leave no tracks on water came the easy reply ah kalamadea said butthere are no elves here nor bondlings either collen nodded aye but we trade wit th collared mun leave no tracks no way fer collared t follow lak they can follow they got no hold on us they got no hold they gots t trade fair shana nodded too for collens reasoning made excellent senseand it made her a bit more inclined to trust him if he did not trust the collared bondlings he traded with it showed a good strong sense of selfpreservation and a disinclination to place any possible power in the hands of those controlled by elves so why should you trust us she asked after all you dont know uswe might be elves in disguise he laughed aloud at that throwing his head back and closing his eyes oh aye ye mot he chortled cept there be a reason i be scout and whats that shana asked since he was obviously waiting for her to do so i got the humanmagery little blood he said deep in her mind grinning as she started thats how i tell niki back wit th rest t come on lak an i know ye be blood cause i keened ye when ye made talk wi the old one then so ye got the humanmagery an ye got no guisespell bout ye she blinkedand so did kalamadea taken quite aback by the voice that resonated in his mind as well a remarkably strong and controlled voiceas indeed it must have been controlled for him to have called to the absent niki without either of them overhearing him soye want t be seein inta my head he asked genially go on got nothin t hide given the invitation she did not hesitate but reached out with her own thoughts to touch his before he could withdraw the invitation perhaps because it was so strongly on both their minds she touched a memory rather than a thoughta recent memory by the power and newness of it so powerful was it so charged with emotion that she found herself actually caught up in it as if she were living the moment with him looking out of his eyes the tension was just short of unbearable and collens heart pounded his chest was tight and he was a little short of breath as he crouched in his shelter he waited and watched from behind the concealing bushes for his bondling contact with the traders their trade goods mostly furs spices a few very odd precious gems were all hidden beneath a brush pile nearby the rest of the group was hidden down by the waters edge he alone would take the risk of immediate capture that risk was always there every time he met the traders not even his powers of humanmagery could warn him if this time they planned to betray him for he could not hear their thoughts past the blankness imposed on their minds by their spellbound collars other traders had been captured in years past by other groups of handlings the particular furs he and his clan brought to trade were very valuable to the handlings and he didnt think they would risk the loss of their sourcebut you never knew especially not since the elvenbane and her wizards had sent everything so topsyturvy and given the cateyes their comeuppance there might be enough profit in capturing wild humans this time that the loss of the supply of furs would be no great problem especially if one of those wild humans was also a wizard his stomach knotted as he heard the sound of cautious footsteps coming toward him his contact had arrived and with him the moment of truth he stood up slowly and stepped forward out of the concealing branches of his bushes with a wrench she pulled her mind out of the memory and back to the real world collen looked into her eyes and nodded knowingly as she shook her head to try to rid it of the last clinging vestiges of that terrible tension its death fer ye bloods wi th cateyes lak wi us wi th humanmagery he said ye seen whats lak fer us so ye got here or nowheres an no point in us gettin up t games wi ye i reckon since ye messed wit yon cateyes me an nikid be no match fer ye he continued eyes twinkling still we be traders lak i reckon we mot do some business eh how many of you have the human magics kalamadea asked slowly don see no reason t giv ye th lie collen told him candidly ony me an niki there be four hands on th rest uv th boats an no more wit humanmagery than us give boats lak twenty twentytwo thats a goodsized group big enough to protect themselves but not too big to hide shana reflected and smiled well i hope they arent too far away she told him my curiosity is about to drive me to distraction for answer collen gestured at the river and just at that moment the first of the canoes came into view the remaining five canoes were much bigger than collens little boat big enough to hold six people and a fair amount of baggage the person in the prow of the first spotted collens rag and directed the rest with silent gestures to row their boats into the shelter of the willow branches there the first boat in held five people including niki who greeted collen with restrained enthusiasm niki proved to be a woman and from the family resemblance she could well have been collens sister the rest of the canoes held four people each with one child in three of the boats and two in the last that also surprised shana she wouldnt have thought outlaw traders would bring their children with them on the other hand it might not have been safe to leave them anywhere the boats were wood each carved from a single tree trunk and from the size of the boats the original trees must have been quite large the rest of the outlaws were just as scruffy as collen but although their clothing was shabby it and they were immaculately clean shana and kalamadea waited with no signs of impatience while the traders beached their canoes on the riverbank and took great pains to conceal them using branches and netting they worked in silence for the most partprobably out of habit shana had noticed that voices tended to carry across the water disconcertingly well and these were people who clearly were used to concealing themselves and their movements as a matter of course when they were finished they dusted their hands off and stood up and kalamadea indicated that they should follow him which they did without a backward glance but they know that we had to flee the elves so they know that were in danger too if were discovered i would think though that they might worry about us getting rid of themno maybe not i doubt if they have anything we want at the moment so what would be the point of us attacking them or so shana reasoned there would be no point in the outlaws attacking the wizardsthey were patently outnumbered and they probably knew it collen dropped back to walk beside her its im hopin we can do a bit uv trade ye an we lak i said he told her quietly we trade furs an oddities t th collared im hopin ye mot hev summut a bit better nor furs shana thought about that we might she said cautiously andthere is something we have that might be useful just for you and your peopleweve got a kind of arrowtip thats as fatal to elves as elfshot is to you and me collens eyes widened at that the first time he had shown any kind of surprise no lie no lie she confirmed one scratch and theyre down a good hit and they are dead we both know i think that it takes a lot to kill an elven lord she was not going to tell him where the wizards got their arrowtipswhich were actually formed from the tips of dragonclaws if he asked about the dragons well she would let kalamadea decide what he should hear or see but there was no harm in trading him some of their special weaponry it had no particular efficacy against halfbloods whose constitution and lifespan were nearer the human than the elven anyway and if he ever needed such a weapon it would be criminal not to have put in his hands and one more dead elven lord is all to the good that was how shana felt about it anyway shed only seen one of the elves ever that had been worth anything at alland it was all too apparent from everything she had learned then and since that valyn had been an anomaly among his kind an elven lord with a conscience and a heart i be damn glad t hev that lady collen breathed fervently an that be a fact she nodded pleased at that point they reached the mouth of the caverncomplex the entrance was quite impressive being about three stories tall opening into the side of the hill and surrounded by heavy woods neither the wizards nor the dragons had done anything to alter the entrance and from here there was no sign of the magelights or the smooth path deep within kalamadea conjured a handlight and continued to lead the way shana called up a light of her own and brought up the tail the ground was a bit uneven here and the traders stumbled now and again their footsteps echoed in the vast darkness as they descended and a couple of the children whispered nervously to their parents as they paced nervously into the cool and gloom shana smiled to herself they were in for a surprise the pathway down made an abrupt curve doubling back on itself and that was where the magelights began out of sight of the entrance the dragons had placed their lights with care illuminating not only the pathway but the most impressive of the cave formations as well for the first time shana heard the voice of someone other than collen in this group as first the children then the adults began to talk quietly to one another pointing out this or that formation in tones of awe and wonder but the best was yet to come as the cave narrowed and finally widened out again into the great hall magelights were everywhere in globes along the walls and even in the cluster at the top of the ceiling the humans blinked as they emerged into the spacious hall and stared about with as much shock as surprise denelor had been as good as his word he had arranged for tables and benches lights and plenty of foodand a good number of the wizards to share the meal including parth agon the eyes of the children and adults alike went wide at the sight of all the people but collen seemed to take it all in stride he left shana and went to the head of the group made a nice little speech of gratitude to denelor and then ushered all of his people to the seats awaiting them very clearly no matter what he had claimed earlier he was not just the scout for the traders he was their real leader well that tallied with the glimpse shed had into his memory with customary tact denelor had seen to it that not only was parth agon seated with himself shana and kalamadea at the strangers table but so were several of the human children shana had rescued and brought to the old citadel the sight of other full humans seemed to reassure collens folk they relaxed and so did collen they were hungry but not starving they ate well but did not bolt the food nor stuff themselvesexcept at the sweet course when their greed was frankly shared by the wizards as well the trader children and the former slaves began eyeing each other halfway through the meal shyly and there were signs of tentative overtures on the part of the strangers children as well as shanas brood she didnt get much of a chance to watch the children however for as soon as collens appetite was satisfied he cleared his throat in a significant manner and got the attention of all of the citadel adults at his table i tol these three down by river we be outlaws traders he began taking it on himself to repeat what the others might not yet have heard clearly he was not assuming that they all had the same ability as shana to speak mind to mind some on us be freeborn some on us be scaped we trade lak wit collared that be workin fer th cateyed parth agon the only one at this table other than the children for whom this really was new information considered it and nodded so long as you keep them from following youwhich presumably is not difficult if you travel by wateryou should be safe enough soi take it that you trade whatever odd things happen to come your way and they in turn take the goods back to their overlords summat lak that collen agreed we got an unnerstandin lak wewere willin t chance risks they aint we bring in thins th cateyed don see much furs mostly but now an agin its summat odd they tell th cateyed twas they went an fetched the things an they keep quiet bout us we get what we can make can grow lak now we aint t only freeborn out here youre not parth agons eyebrows rose though it was obvious to shana how could you be a trader with no one to trade things to collen shrugged tothers tis th odd clan family all farm folk lak couple herders couple hunters trappers an we trade wi em all they bin here since there was dirt got nothin th cateyed want t go huntin after not no kinda threat wouldn know one end uv a spear from tother so they aint gonna fight them cateyed pointyears they got to figger us traders is bad since we got runaways mongst us so we don let em know wes here but themnay they aint no threat an cateyes don care if they be out here so figger we make same deal wi ye as we got wi them an ye can find summat ttrade we take it downriver an get what ye canna make nor grow tell us what ye need we get some ye get some fairly standard offer fairly made parth agon said at last denelor oh ive been in favor all along denelor replied quickly theahstorerooms wont stay full forever he said nothing about the complete lack of crafting or farming ability among the wizards he didnt have to parth agon knew that lack as well as he eventually the wizards were going to have to learn to work with their hands but the longer it took to come to that eventuality the better off they would all be the more time we have the more time we have to get some practice in id really rather not trust my soup to a wizards first pot a very good point parth agon actually turned to shana before he checked with kalamadea shana you couldif you wantask him mind to mind she said forthrightly collen has the human magecraft and you know he wont be able to lie mind to mind but i dont think that will be necessary he has a great deal to gain by dealing fairly with us and a lot to lose if he doesnt the only question iswhat have we got at the moment that we can trade that wouldnt be traced back to wizards parth agon mused aloud shanas mind ran to the metals and gems that keman said lay in these mountainswould the dragons be able to get enough out at this short a notice to make it worth the traders while and would it be wise to divert them from the important work of shaping the citadel it took a long time to bring up gold and longer to extract gems that much she recalled from her years of living among them how much of the dragons precious time could they all spare keman coughed shyly and they all turned to look at him you know he said ducking his head a little you could say that our troubles started over that bit ofof hide that the elves called dragonskin the stuff shanas tunic was made from when she was taken captive the elves wanted that stuff they sent out all sorts of expeditions looking for the source of itand we have more of it right here dragon skin collen looked very puzzled can ye show me what tis ye be callin dragon skin just a moment keman slid out of his seat and ran off returning in a few moments with a strip of his own shed skin wide as a humans palm and about as long as a mans arm since it was kemans it was a brilliant blue overlaid with a shimmer of rainbow hues collen bit off an exclamation and reached out involuntarily to touch it then pulled back go ahead keman urged handing it to him its pretty tough collen took the strip of skin gingerly testing the strength and suppleness and running his hands down the smooth scales where ye get this he asked his eyes filled with wonder evidently although he had heard of the second wizard war he had not heard of the existence of real dragons had the elves decided they were illusions or had they made up their minds that the dragons had been constructs artificial creatures made by some of the strongest wizards if they had that certainly eased some of shanas guilt about the situation she still felt bad that the dragons had been forced to abandon their longheld secret to help her and her friends she hadnt wanted the elves to know about the dragons any more than the dragons had and for good reason the elves would never tolerate a race as powerful as the dragons or allow them to continue to exist in the same worldand as keman had said they wanted the dragons skins they would quite happily kill every dragon alive for the sake of the skins he cant know about you keman she told him make something up quick its from a lizard and we use magic to make it prettier keman lied blithely we can make a lot of it and we have quite a bit on hand now its very useful he glanced over at kalamadea who nodded agreement its tough besides being pretty if that be sothen ye got th bargain collen exclaimed his hands closing possessively on the piece of skin when keman showed no interest in reclaiming it we kin get bout all ye mot need wi this as the trade goods what about our settling here denelor asked is that going to be a problem we didnt see any signs of habitation in this valley and we plan to be as discreet as you would in our place i think we can make sure the elves dont find us collen shrugged as if it was a matter of complete indifference to him maybe it was i think ye got yersels a fair home sure an we won be disputin it wi ye an theres none i know of that hev a claim here tis all yours fer the claimin lak be nice t know that his part o th rivers safe from cateyed spies eh so we could say thatthis is a kind of welcoming then parth agon said mildly oh aye the human trader laughed as if parth had told him a joke oh aye an wellcome indeed chapter sheyrena could hardly believe her luck when the day after the fete absolutely nothing happened she had spent the day in a state of dulled dread expectingat the leastto be called into her fathers presence and interrogated about just whom she had spoken and danced with and what they had said worse were the fears that lord tylar would somehow discover her lack of conquests and call her to account for that instead there was no summons not even a note she was as usual ignored with the sole exception of the fact that she was permitted to sleep late her day passed precisely as any other day she walked in the garden and tended her birds had her lessons in music and etiquette and made her daily call upon her mother in her mothers bower only there did she have any reminders that this was not quite an ordinary day she and lady viridina discussed nothing but the gowns the other elven ladies had been wearingspeculating on how they had been made and of what materials deciding whether or not the particular style would be suited to rena or the lady herself in other bowers with a collection of elven ladies there would have been other comments too of coursecomments on how poorly suited the gowns of certain ladies absent from the current group of course had been either in terms of style or in terms of the wearers endowments lady viridina did not encourage gossip however so none of that entered the discussion in her bower nor were there any discussions of which young lords seemed to have paired off with young ladies that in lady viridinas opinion was also gossip and of no ones concern except the parties involved the truth of the matter in the bower today was that lady viridina discussed the gowns and her slavesofthewardrobe murmured appropriate comments rena simply listened and not very attentively oh normally she enjoyed the topic as much as anything except riding with lorryn but today she had rather not be reminded how wonderful the other ladies lookednot when she had suffered in all ways by comparison she had thought until last night that she had no pride left to bruise but that was simply not true it had hurt to look into the mirror and see a laughingstock it still hurt this morning i wish there were a way to destroy that horrid gown she thought resentfully i dont ever want to see it again viridina didnt seem to notice her silence though which was just as well as she rattled off details of trains and trimming it occurred to rena that her mother was oddly distracted as if lady viridina also had something weighing heavily on her mind and was trying to disguise the fact with idle chat shes probably worried about lorryn i suppose i rather doubt it has anything to do with me after what seemed like half the day viridina finally dismissed her daughter and rena was free to return to her garden and her books there with two of her birds sitting on her shoulders she carefully worked out the spell that had been used on the birds at the fete the one that made them fly off to make their droppings then return that was the most useful spell she had ever seen and it was definitely going to come in handy here she set it on only one of the birds at firstshe didnt want to hurt them by getting the spell wrong after allbut when it worked perfectly she quickly made it part of every flying thing in her garden now she could pet and play with them to her hearts content and never have to worry about the results one of the prettiest an especially gentle little thing with bright red feathers and a hooked bill loved to sit on her shoulder and press his face and body against her neck for hours at a time shed been reluctant to let him do that for very long and especially reluctant to allow him to sit there when she was reading since she tended to forget where she waswith the result that visyr would usually do something unfortunate before she noticed and she would have to run and change her gown before either her mother or her father saw it there were days when shed had to change her gown no less than three times so that afternoon was an occasion of perfect enjoyment for both of themfor rena could sit in the garden with her book and visyr could sit on her shoulder and be petted for as long as he liked she discovered that his capacity for being petted was a great deal greater than she had ever suspected he was the perfect tranquilizer and she ended the day in a calm and cheerful mood she woke with the same apprehension as before though for her dreams had been filled with images of lord tylar and the punishments he was creating for her for not having caught a husband but once again her fears were all for no causenothing happened that was out of the ordinary during the entire day the next day and the day following were repetitions of the same most important there were no expressions of disapproval from lord tylar rena began to relax slowly as she attempted to puzzle out just what was occupying her father at a guess the political connections that her father had made at the fete were proving to be so engrossing that he had forgotten his original intentionthat of ensuring she found an advantageous alliance that would indeed be typical for his thinking anything having to do with her and her future or lack of it would always take a poor second place to lord tylars personal aspirations and that was precisely how she wanted things at the moment the more he thought of himself the less he would think of her the only cloud on her cautious happiness was that lorryn was still recovering from his illness and had not come to visit her normally he would find an excuse to stop by her garden at least once during the day and more often if he planned to include her in a surreptitious excursion indeed the word from the slaves was that he had not even left his suite since before the fete there was no hint that his case was more serious than she had been told only that he had exhausted himself more completely than anyone had initially thought she would really have been worried sick about him if there had been any indication that something was wrong with him as it was she missed him not only because she truly loved and admired him but for his conversation the slaves were hardly up to much clever repartee and he was the only person besides myre who didnt treat her as if she had the same mental capacity as a child even her mother spoke to her as if she were always as dazed and absentminded as she had been over the past few days still he shouldnt have been sick for this long attacks had never laid him low for more than a day before she fretted over him as she walked in her garden and stared in the direction of his suite what had he done to himself was this why her mother was upset and covering her concern with false cheer she went to bed on the evening of the third day following the fete in a state of anxiety herself when repeated messages to him brought only the reply that he was a little ill but would be all right eventually eventually just how long could eventually be she even forgot most of her worries for herself in worries over her brother but the morning of the fourth day brought an end to her peace of mind in the form of a message from lord tylar it arrived with her breakfast an elegantly written note folded and inserted beneath her platelord tylar never delivered messages in person if he could avoid it she picked it up and unfolded it expecting the worst you will come to lady viridinas bower at the hour of the skylark to discuss a matter of some importance that was all it said but that was enough to completely shatter her illusions of peace she stared at the note her hand shaking only a little and carefully put it down her appetite quite gone discuss oh no that was hardly what would happengiven that the note was in her fathers handwriting and with his personal sigil impressed into the paper no lord tylar had orders for her and her mother was the one as bound by his will as any of his slaves who would deliver them having lady viridina deliver these orders only proved that they were going to be unpleasant he always had his wife handle domestic orders that were going to bring trouble he felt it was her job to ensure his domestic peace even if it was his orders that were about to destroy that peace her stomach churned and knotted as she tried to guess just what the matter of some importance was had he finally noticed that there were no suitors clamoring for her had he gotten back reports from some of his underlings that showed she had spent more time with the tame animals than with any male she would not have put it past him to have set spies on her or questioned his associates about her movements unreasoning dread blossomed in her heart an evil flower of darkness and foreboding was he going to order a whole new round of lessons for her designed to mold her into something more desirable than she wasor and one of her nightmares of the first night returned to make her unreasonable dread only too reasonable there was something worse much worse that he could do to heror have done the nightmares she had been enduring had been about a possibility mat she had not even considered had not even remembered until her own evil dreams brought it back to her if he was not happy with her and saw no possibility of voluntary improvement there was one other step he might take it was drastic but he was ruthless enough to take it if he could find a mage powerful enough to oblige him she had dismissed the possibility because she could not imagine him ever devoting that much of his profit and resources to her but if he was angry enough economic considerations might vanish before the prospect of having his will thwarted by his illmannered unsatisfactory daughter he could have me changed the change was something only whispered about in the bowers no maiden of renas acquaintance had actually known a girl who had been changed but everyone had a cousin or a friend who did if a maiden just was not satisfactory to her fatheror more rarely a wife was not satisfactory to her husband and the husband could get her father to agree to the changethere was a remedy great elven mages had created beasts like the alicorns in the past after all creating them out of common beasts of the fields and hadnt she herself changed the drab sparrows and pigeons into charming companions changing a maidenmaking her more beautiful more gracefulwas just a bit more subtle than creating an alicorn especially if one is not terribly worried about damaging her so long as it doesnt show a maiden would never have to gallop across a battlefield after all and if afterwards she was just a bit delicate a bit sickly so long as she could bring forth one heir that was really all that mattered once the heir had been produced another wife could be foundor done without as the case might be a maiden was taken away so the whispers went and when she returned she would no longer be merely attractive she would be a beauty a living work of art she would be incapable of a clumsy movement of a missung note of a social mistake she would always be graceful and gracious she would never lose her temper never weep never complain but show the same smiling face of peace and contentment wherever she went in public or in private to her peers or to her slaves she would obey her fathers or her husbands every wish willingly and immediately she would become the perfect wife the perfect lady in every possible way the trouble was the change worked in the mind as well as the body and maidens who underwent the change were rumored to lose some vital spark of themselves they had no ambitions no interest outside their own bowers and no creativity if given a work to play or a piece of embroidery already designed and ready to sew they would go about playing the piece or embroidering the design with mechanical perfection but they could not design a piece of embroidery for themselves or compose their own music even if they had been superb artists or musicians before the change nor was that all their pleasures turned to simpler things they lost interest in anything that was an intellectual challenge they generally stopped reading or writing left the household accounts to underlings often left anything vaguely creative in the hands of their slaves and saw no reason to leave their own bowers except at the insistence of their husbands their lives became centered on three things their appearance pleasing their husbands and childbearing they became obsessive about jewels and gowns often changing four and five times in a day they would throw themselves off a cliff if that would make their lords happy and they longed for nothing more than to bear as many children as they could and as quickly in short they were as controlled as the human concubines and just as compliant it was no accident that while the change was worked on a maidens body her ruler saw to it that it was worked on her mind as well why alter the body only when with an exercise of magic discontent improper ambitions and inconvenient interests could be wiped away as cleanly as if they had never existed in the first place one could completely remold a maiden or a wife to suit ones own needs how convenient for their lords shed had that nightmare about being changed enduring the pain of the change itself and the horror of feeling her mind her self drain away and had done her best to forget the dream and how vivid it had been now it came back to her with redoubled clarity as if it had been not a dream but a premonition her hands and heart went cold as ice she fought her fear down no lord tylar wouldnt have her changed surely it was very difficult and very expensive either in terms of strict recompense or in terms of the demands the mage would later make on the customer only the greatest of mages dared to meddle in such ways and the greater a mage the more power and prestige he already had surely there was nothing lord tylar could offer that would tempt one of the high lords to help him in such an undertaking but her body would not respond to her desperate reasoning her body and her heart were afraid deeply deathly afraid her throat closed so tightly that she could not even swallow her face felt like a mask of wood stiff and unmoving and her mouth went dry her breath came in short frightened gasps as if she were a rabbit at the end of a chase her heart pounded as she again reached for the piece of paper she reread the note searching for a clue and finding nothing butthere was no indication that he was going to have her changed and surely hed have let something slip if that was his intention wouldnt he have told her to dismiss her slaves or insisted she not speak to lorryn for that matter if he intended to have her changed why send her to her mother to be told about it in the first place why not simply have a pair of burly guards come and take her away without any warning by letting her know in advance that he had planned something for her he actually increased the chance that she would cause a scene when she learned what it was perhaps she told herself frantically it was something simpleran ordinary scolding for not living up to the standards her father had set for her for not carrying out the orders he had given her gradually her breath eased that made more sense that was logical lord tylar always took the easiest route to anything and he always left the scoldings to lady viridina her throat opened a little as she forced calm on herself yes that must be it lady viridina was going to deliver a lecture on duty and how she had failed in that duty then perhaps would come another round of the lessons she had foreseen unpleasant and timeconsuming but not a disaster just something to be endured until lord tylar forgot about her again and he would forget about her especially if she kept herself out of sight as long as there were no choice matrimonial prospects in view she was no real drain on his resources and she was ornamental enough in a plain quiet way she occupied lorryn and kept him from getting into trouble by doing so she could even be trusted to oversee some of the household on the occasions when he needed his wife at his side surely that is all that this note means if it were something that would be as expensive for him as having me changed wouldnt he want to deliver the orders in person and see to it that i was conveyed away with a minimum of fuss and damage wouldnt he want to oversee every tiny detail from telling me what was to happen to seeing the end result for himself he would be here to make certain he got his moneys worth so she tried to convince herself although her heart was not so easy to calm it was hard to get her fear down to even a manageable level it took every bit of will to rise from her uneaten breakfast and pretend that she was calm and collected she ordered her dress with extra care her voice so subdued with dread that it was hardly more than a whisper she allowed the slaves to tend to everything she was afraid that her hands would begin to tremble so that even the simplest task would be impossible in a haze of fear and depression she took herself to her mothers bower at the appointed hourwhich was directly after the breakfast that she could not force herself to eat at least she would not have to wait to hear her fate she walked down hallways in a state of tension that made every tiny detail stand out her mothers bower was not entered by a conventional door but through one of the magical curtains of sheeting energy that also protected the harem from intrusion a slave was there to meet her and steered her away from the sitting room to another part of the bower entirely and lady viridina received her daughter in her own study though the room bore very little resemblance to lord tylars study this was a stark room small with only a desk and two chairs of the simplest design the floor walls and ceiling were a uniform cream the desk and chairs a slightly darker shade of the same color viridina was reading something as rena came in she gestured to the single empty chair without speaking and rena took it obediently without a word of her own she sat there stiffly upright with her hands folded in her lap her whole body so taut with tension that she felt as if she vibrated with every heartbeat finally lady viridina put the paper down and looked up at her daughter her face and eyes completely inscrutable my lord tylar wishes me to tell you that he is very pleased with you she saidwords so surprising that it was only by force of will that rena kept her mouth from dropping open with shock hes pleased with me with me how why what did i do what does he think i did it seems that you spent a great deal of time with vkeln gildor erlord kyndreth at the fete her mother continued and waited for an answer rena nodded numbly was that all it was just that she was kind to a bumbling idiot a handsome bumbling idiot granted but then there were no such things as uncomely elves except maybe me the house of kyndreth is an ancient and powerful house lady viridina continued not quite as powerful as that of hernalth but older there is a great deal to be said for their lineage and lord lyon is accounted a power in the council his favor is eagerly sought after again rena nodded unable to imagine where this was going had gildors father been grateful that she had spent any time at all with his songrateful enough to have complimented her to lord tylar perhaps even grateful enough to be willing to support lord tylar in the council well you seem to have impressed lord gildor in many ways her mother said without so much as a lifted eyebrow and it is difficult to impress lord gildor enough to cause him to remember any experience for more than a few hours or so it is said according to your lord father there was no hint of irony in her mothers voice and nothing in her expression to suggest humor rena hardly knew what to think she certainly had not expected either candor or irony from either lady viridina or her father lady viridina regarded her with a penetrating gaze as if looking for any hint that rena found her comment amusing at any rate you did impress the erlord and as a consequence you have impressed his father which is much more important again she waited for a reply yes my lady rena managed to say naturally it would be more important to impress lord lyon poor gildormust be very difficult to deal with for his own lord father he seems a she sought for a word to describe him that would have at least a hint of flattery amid the terrible truth that the young erlord was a fool an amiable young lord and he certainly seems eager to please his lord father as is only right of course but i would say that he has very little ambition or wit or intelligence her mother nodded and now she smiled thinly good you understand the situation then vdenn lyon lord kyndreth made your father an offer for your hand last night on behalf of his son naturally lord tylar has accepted on your behalf he is very pleased what is more lord lyon seems to believe that this acceptance puts him in your lord fathers debt she took the words as if they were blows to her face and body and with nearly the same shock offer for mefrom gildor accepted shock turned to horror and rena was paralyzed quite unable to speak move or even think past the reality of her mothers words she had been sold away all in an instant without any warninggiven toto gildor aan idiot who cant even remember what he did a few hours ago a dolt completely controlled by his father a booby whowho has barely more sense than a child still in the nursery whose only interest is hunting and who hasnt a single clever thought in his head a fool who is cruel without even knowing that he has hurt someone she was too stunned even to tremble and evidently her mother took her silence as a sign of agreement she smiled more with relief than with pleasure i am pleased to see that you are properly grateful to your lord father and to lord gildor your good sense does you credit and is a testimony to your training she stood and handed rena another folded piece of paper this one sealed with lord tylars formal seal the formalities must be observed of course and with someone of lord gildors lineage that is more important than usual everything must be done properly with the appropriate care on our part go to your quarters and have your slaves gown you for a formal dinner she ordered as rena stood in automatic response to her mothers movement you will be leaving by means of the portals to go straight to lord lyon and lord gildor yourself bearing the acceptance as is right and proper your escort will come to take you there in an hour that was clearly a dismissal and rena walked blindly out of the study out of her mothers bower and down the hallway to her own suite still wrapped in a cocoon of stunned numbness the next few hours were a blur lost in a haze of shock she kept thinking that this was just another nightmare that in a moment she would awaken in her own bed this wasnt what was supposed to happen it was like some horrible twist on a romantic tale wherein the high lord falls in love with the daughter of one of his underlings and petitions to wed her why oh why had lord gildor chosen her train to tread on why couldnt he have blundered into someone elses unwanted daughter she must have given her slaves orders and they must have been sensible for the next thing she knew she was gowned coiffed and bejeweled and standing next to her escort in front of the portal someone must have seen to it that she had the most flattering of her formal gowns brought outperhaps one of the slaves had taken pity on her this time there were no cosmetics her hair had been done in simple braids twined with strands of pearls and fastened at her neck in a complicated knot and her dress was of heavy pink silk with a high neck and long sleeves that swept the floor a belt of pearls held it close in at her waist and more pearls circled her throat she faded into the walls of her chamber but at least she didnt look like a clown she thought she recalled myre issuing orders and being obeyed while she stood sat and turned in a state of mental blankness she simply could not remember exiting her chamber and now she stood on the threshold of the portal there was a sealed scrolltube in her hand an elaborately decorated ivoryinlaid gold scrolltube she didnt remember picking it up someone must have put it in her hand without her being aware of it and as she raised her hand to touch her temple dazedly there was a new ring on her finger this one of white gold set with a beryl engraved with a winged stag lord lyons seal it must be how else would she be able to use the portals to cross from here to lord lyons estate it must have arrived with lord lyons messenger she had no time to muster any other thoughts her escort moved carrying her with them and she was through the portal there was no intermediate pause in the council chamber this time perhaps that was the reason for the signet ring to enable her to go directly to her destination she emerged into a reception room it was like no other room she had ever seen though it was not one that had been altered by magic this was a chamber with leather furnishings and hunting trophies everywhere the blankeyed heads of dead animals stared down at her from walls paneled in dark woods whole dead animals and petrified birds had been made into lamp holders table supports or grisly display pieces hides with the heads intact carpeted the floor and the whole of one wall was taken up with a mounted pair of stud alicorns locked in combatone with a coat the black of ebony and one white as a cloud both had mad orange eyes that glittered with malice and there was bloodor something made to resemble bloodon their twisting spiraling single horns she shuddered and looked away anything that could possibly be hunted was here in some form and had been made into a trophy of some kind alicorn horns made a rack holding boarspears ivory and horn inlay covered every inch of the furniture that was not already upholstered with hides some finished as smooth leather and some with the hair or fur left on teeth snarled at her from all corners stuffed snakes twined around the bases of quivers mounted beside their bows racks for knives and swords had been fashioned of antlers everywhere glassy eyes stared at her and she fancied that their stares held anger bewilderment or accusation the place felt haunted by silent rage a silent human servant appeared bowed deeply and gestured for her to follow she did so glad only to be free of that room of accusing eyes was this lord lyons way of impressing his visitors or did he truly take pleasure in having victims of his hunting expeditions displayed in a place where he could view them frequently was she to become just another such trophy the servant led the way down a corridor paneled in more of the dark wood lit by globes of magelight caught in sconces made of yet more antlers and carpeted with bloodred plush she gave up trying to reckon how many deer and elk the sconces represented lord lyon was one of the older high lords and he had many long years of hunting behind him he might even be displaying only a fraction of his trophies here given how long he had been alive what a horrid thought what was he trying to say with this room of death it was the first thing any visitor arriving by portal would see after all was he showing them wordlessly just how ruthless a foe he was did he mean for them to be impressed with his physical skill or with the mental ability it took to stalk and kill so many creatures the corridor seemed to go on forever the lights brightened as she reached them and dimmed behind her so that she could not tell where the real end of it was it said something for the dazed state of her mind that somewhere along it she lost her escort of guards and she did not even notice that they were gone until the human servant stopped at a doorway and waited for her to join him this was no ordinary door of course as soon as she stepped in front of it she saw that it was an inlaid geometric mosaic of thousands of tiny bones all of them vertebrae fitted together with exacting skill to cover the entire face of the door with bone ivory the design was probably supposed to signify something but what that was she had no notion the servant opened the door smoothly and bowed for her to enter she stepped hesitantly through into the halfdark beyond once again she found herself at the edge of a sylvan glade beneath a full moon there were no tame animals here though and the moon and stars overhead were all too clearly magelights most of this was illusion and it was not as per feet an illusion as the fete had boasted in fact given lord lyons power and prestige it was probably not as perfect an illusion as he could create if he cared to an unseen musician played quietly on a dulcimer and the branches of the trees moved to a breeze that did not stir even a hair of renas coiffure the door closed behind her in the center of the glade was a table set for three magelight caught in a candelabra of antlers centered on the table though it did not appear that the occupants had been served yet there were two people there already the dim light made it impossible for her to identify either of them but she assumed they were gildor and his father she stepped forward a few paces and the light at the table brightened the two occupants of the table turned toward herand she saw that one of them was really a female a human female sharing the board at what was supposed to be her intimate betrothal dinner with her lordtobe she froze where she stood unable to go on or to turn and leave the light was bright enough now to show humiliating details the human was very beautiful exquisitely and expensively gowned and jeweled in crimson satin the color of blood with rubies and gold circling her throat and her wristsand from her posture and gildors obviously his favorite concubine a concubine at what was supposed to be her betrothal dinner for a moment she wondered wildly if her mother had gotten the time of the invitation wrong or if she had somehow misheard her orders butno that was not possible the escort had been waiting for her the acceptance ready for her to take with her the ring that allowed her to come here readied for her hand there was no mistake here far from suffering from the paralysis and fear that had held her until this moment her mind suddenly leapt free of its bonds of dazed indecision she saw everything with heightened clarity and her thoughts raced as if she had been playing the games of intrigue for decades perhaps it was only that for the first time in this awful day she had confronted something she could act upon rather than being in a position in which she had no control whatsoever this was no accident nor had gildor thought of this arrangement on his own he could not simply have invited his concubine his father would never have permitted such a thing and the servants would have reported such a social gaffe immediately long before sheyrena arrived lord lyon had orchestrated everything so thoroughly thus far that this insult to her dignity and pride could only be due to some plan of hisor of him and lord tylar combined it could not be designed as an affront as suchlord lyon would not go through all that he had just to insult a nonentity like her and if he wished to insult lord tylar he would do so directly and not through her he was the more powerful of the two and it would be a social gaffe on his part to insult her house through a female its a test and father must have had a hand in it only he would think of using a human concubine as the tool and weapon she was being presented with a situation designed to test precisely how biddable how obedient to her lords wishes she would be in the future gildor was clearly not capable of making any kind of decent decision to present him with a bride who had a mind of her own and a will of her own was to concoct a recipe for disaster a willful wife could show him to be the fool that he truly was and with no difficulty at all almost as bad a willful wife might learn to manipulate him if i make a fuss if i take insult with this and walk out what would that mean probably that she was going to be too much for gildor to cope with she was tempted to do just that but if i do if anything would tempt lord tylar into having her changed it would be just such a reaction she had her orders after all she was not supposed to have any pride that could suffer insult if she dared to think for herself she was a danger to her fathers ambitions as well as to gildor and with lord lyons help and influence backing him her father would be able monetarily and politically to afford having her changed so that she would no longer cause problems for her betrothed lord lyon clearly needed with some desperation a bride who would not challenge gildor or attempt to usurp his own power through gildor and if he could find a maiden whose father countenanced sending her away for the change wouldnt he seize such a chance with both hands a changed bride would be a bride who also would be unable to manipulate gildor and use him against his fatherand one who would make gildor completely happy a perfect bride in other words insofar as lord lyons purposes went on the other hand she could prove at this very moment that she was as pliant and meek as her father and lord lyon demanded if i just walk right up there as if there were nothing at all out of the ordinary with my being asked to share my betrothal feast with my betrotheds favorite lover ill be just as good as a changed bride if she acted as if she simply didnt notice the insult as if this was a cheerful little dinner party it would mean that she was safe she would obey her lord in the future and not embarrass him in public she might be clever enough to try to manipulate gildorbut lord lyon was probably operating under the assumption that if she had been kind to him without knowing who he was she was doubtlessly too stupid to be that clever her cold had given way to the heat of humiliation as she stood there however not even lady viridina had ever been forced into a position like this if i goif i walk out of here and go straight home again she would be forced to wed gildor anyway but there wont be enough left of the real me to care for one short moment that almost seemed preferable to her current situation then she shook herself mentally this was only a betrothal hundreds of things could happen between now and the actual marriage gildor might die if he spent most of his time in hunting he stood a reasonable chance of discovering that he was not as good a hunter as he thought her father might die which would leave lorryn head of the household and he would never force her to wed this lout she might die she and lorryn together might find some way of getting lord tylar to break the betrothal she might find a way to make gildor disenchanted with her lord lyon might make some disastrous move that would reduce his power and make gildor a lessthandesirable husband for her in regard to lord tylars ambitions at the very worst she would be wed to the dolt and if the marriage proved childless lorryn might be able to free her from it sometime in the future or gildor could die and meanwhile lord tylar looked upon her with grim favor she might win a few freedoms out of this it was hard hard but she forced her feet to move forward one slow step at a time she forced a fatuous false smile onto her lips gildor rose as she approached the concubine did not this did not escape rena and her cheeks burned with further humiliation sheyrena gildor said with childish enthusiasm welcome please come join us the empty chair moved back of its own accord for her and she took her place in it moving stiffly the concubine a stunning ravenhaired beauty with the healthiest set of pectoral endowments that rena had ever seen in her life smiled maliciously at her and did not even incline her head in a token bow she knew who the real power was here she was the favorite sheyrena was the convenience this is jaene the chief of my household jaene this is sheyrena he grinned foolishly at them both without a doubt he was completely unaware that there was anything wrong with the situation i hope youll come to be very good friends youll be seeing a lot of each other from now on jaene smiled the same cruel smile rena had seen on her fathers face as he assigned yet another of his castoffs to lady viridinas household im sure she purred im sure we will oh surely the chief of his household as if the household of an erlord ever could consist of more than his harem his personal servants and his huntingmaster did his father tell him to tell me that probably and if i pretend to believe it ill prove that im as stupid as he is sheyrena could not bring herself to say anything nor could she bring herself to actually hand the sealed scrolltube to gildor cheeks hot she simply placed it on the table between them avoiding jaenes eyes altogether another invisible servant made it vanish before she could snatch it back gildor settled back into his chair a smug expression of blissfully ignorant happiness suffusing his features making him look particularly handsome if one didnt gaze too closely at the vacant eyes well have to do this often he said to no one in particular just one happy little family jaenes smile widened just a little whatever you wish my lord she replied with mock submission ignoring sheyrena altogether sheyrena nearly choked fortunately a plate settled in front of her saving her from having to look anywhere else that was just as well she found it hard enough just to look at the plate she did not say more than two words during the entire painful mealnor did she eat more than a single bite before her throat closed in rebellion jaene continued to smile poisonously and eat slowly deliberately making each bite a display of sensuality gildor inhaled vast amounts of food oblivious to the tension at the table invisible servants came and went with multiple courses all of which were probably succulent they certainly smelled inviting and they looked beautiful they might just as well have been straw for all that rena could taste of them she tried a bite or two but gave up when her throat refused to unclench enough to allow her to swallow and thereafter simply pushed the foot around on her plate with her fork until the servant came to take it away she did drink the wine feverishly and a servant kept her glasses full a different wine for every course she probably drank too much of it for it made her a bit dizzy but it did not impair her enough to make her lose control of her tongue she only wanted it as a kind of anesthetic to keep the pain of the moment at bay she said nothing kept her eyes on her plate and endured the invisible musician played on supplemented by a harpist the trees swayed in the breeze that was not there the unseen servants whisked full plates from under her nose replacing them with more full plates jaene continued to smile looking more and more catlike with every passing moment as she turned her posture into a lazy seductive lounge she had allowed the neckline of her gown to slip and gildor was staring at her cleavage with a rapt attention that nearly matched that which he had given the food she might just as well not have been there by the time the unendurable meal was halfover only the wine gave her the strength to sit there and endurethe wine and the certainty that no matter what she did she or her body at any rate would be wedding gildor if her father had any say in the matter she had only the choice that would permit her to keep her mind intact the choice that proved she was obedient her father wanted this wedding she might get a little of what she longed for only if she earned it with her silence and of course except for lord lyon her father had the only say in the matter finally as she gulped yet another glass of wine and her feeling of dizziness increased the dessert course arrived the invisible servant whisked away the last plate and replaced it with a tiny white sugar alicorn romantically idealized a ring balanced delicately on the end of its single horn the ring was made of heavy white gold and was engraved with winged stags and moonbirds she knew what it was the betrothal ring of course if she accepted it and put it on it sealed her fate she hesitated for just a moment holding back her fate for an illusory heartbeat as long as this thing was not on her finger she could pretend that she was free but im not i never was never will be numb and dizzy she took the ring and fumbled it onto her finger then with her fork she slowly and deliberately crushed the alicorn to tiny sugary crumbs she had thought that her ordeal was over but gildor showed no signs of rising and neither did jaene in fact gildor showed no signs of noticing that she had even accepted his ring she was forced to sit there crushing the dessert into smaller and smaller bits while gildor stared at his concubines bosom and ignored her she could not leave until gildor produced a written and signed betrothal contract for her to deliver to her father and he didnt seem to be prepared to do that while jaene sat there and fluttered her eyelashes at him finally with the alicorn reduced to powder and her temper smoldering under the influence of the wine she decided shed had enough let gildor explain why he hadnt presented her with the contract she had gone out of her way to observe the formalities she had obeyed far more than the mere letter of her orders she stood up abruptly and the chair she had been sitting in fell over as she shoved it violently back gildor and jaene suddenly turned to stare at her as if they had only just noticed that she was there it is very late she said rather thickly as the wine made speech a bit difficult i beg your pardon my lord but i am not often abroad from my fathers house and am unused to such late hours i must go the moment the last word left her lips the room changed the glade the sky and jaene all vanished leaving only the table in the middle of a room paneled with dark wood floored with black marble the table had not been set for three but for twojaenes place setting and chair vanished with the human two servants stood to one side gildor blinked with confusion and a tall and powerful elven lord stepped out of the shadows lord ffather gildor stuttered wheres jaene gone wheres the glade lord lyon ignored his sons questions turning to regard rena with a slight bow of amusement forgive the deception child gildor insisted upon the slaves presence but of course i would not have inflicted such an insult upon you it would have been unacceptably rude oh no of course not while you could create an illusion instead one good enough to fool gildor i thought you were a better mage than this silly setting showed but she bowed her head meekly and clasped her hands in front of her she was afraid to speak lest her own mouth betray her but the effect of the wine was swiftly burning away with her anger at such a doubledeception she had been used she had to endure it but she didnt have to like it now lord lyon turned to his son let this be a lesson to you gildor no slave must be permitted to eat with her masters ever he said sternly and no slave should be given the kinds of liberties you would have given this jaene and have given her in the past it makes them proud and insubordinate i had her sent away while you were eating once you learn how to keep your females in line you may have her back once you learn to curb your hounds you may have them back and apologize to the lady who just had her dress drenched with piddle out of the corner of her eye she saw gildor flush and bow his head yes father he murmured submissively but he did not apologize to rena not that she expected him to my apologies if your feelings were abused dear child lord lyon said smoothly but you have displayed a proper maidenly modesty and forbearance that do you credit here he held a scrolltube out to her this one just as elaborately decorated as the one she had brought but with designs of moonbirds and winged stags together she took it automatically and although it was cool it felt as if it burned her hand as she clenched her fingers on it please convey the contract to your noble father with my thanks lord lyon said as gildor stood dumb the older man took her free hand and kissed the back of it a mere brushing of lips across the skin tell him for me that he has just such a daughter as both of us hoped and i am pleased to welcome you to my family that was the signal that she could escape she murmured something appropriate and took her chance to flee her escort met her outside the door and ushered her toward the portal with what would have been unseemly haste if she had not wanted to be out of there as quickly as possible she wanted to fling the horrid tube away from her but before she even entered the portal the chief of her guards took it from her nerveless fingers then sent her through with a nonetoogentle shove attendants swarmed her on the other side a display of special attentions she had never been granted before and which was probably due entirely to a message from lord lyon that she had been a good and obedient little girl doing precisely as she had been told they hurried her off to her rooms and once there fussed over her as if she were some kind of prize object she let them exhausted by the tension and the need to keep her own emotions in check she was too tired to think clearly its over that was all that was important for now they bathed her not permitting her to do anything for herself in a bath foaming with perfumed oils they dressed her in a silken nightgown she had never seen before a gown luxurious enough to wear as a dress they combed out her hair shining each strand with soft cloths lightly moistened with scent they rubbed scented creams into her hands her feet and her legs they gave her tiny dainties to eatjust as well since she hadnt had more than two bites of dinner to hold off the effects of all that wine they handed her an exotic drink to soothe her throat and her nerves foaming sweet and warm that was the only thought in her mind as they pampered and preened her and finally put her to bed its over she fell asleep immediately before the lights went out while they were still crowding the room putting things away but when she woke with dawn still an hour away alone in her room it was with cold dread it wasnt over she had been sealed to lord gildor and last night signaled the preparation of the sacrifice that was why all the pampering there would be more such an attempt to make her into as comely a creature as possible without an actual change there would be less in the way of freedom not more she had been maneuvered into precisely the position she was most afraid of and this was only the beginning after the wedding it would be worse she had deceived herself with her thoughts of greater freedom as the erlords lady if living under her fathers roof had been difficult living under lord lyons would be harder still there would be no lorryn to whisk her away on occasional escapes lord lyon would have her watched every moment to make certain that she was the obedient little fool he thought she was every book she read would be scrutinized every exercise of her powers weighed and measured every hour of her day would be spied upon she would have no secrets for lord lyon would be certain that a secret meant a secret plot against himself there was only one ruler in that house and lord lyon would permit no other if she wanted to survive she had only one choice she must conform completely she must become a copy of her mother serene obedient and dead inside there was only one person who could possibly help her lorryn hes clever hell think of something just as she thought that there came a faint tapping on her door three taps a pause then two then one she flung herself out of bed and ran to let her brother in for one joyful moment she was certain he had heard of what had happened and had come to tell her how to extricate herself from her plight but as he slipped inside and shut the door quickly behind him he turned toward her with a face as pale and as fearful as her own rena you have to help me he whispered hoarsely his voice choked with tension his eyes huge and darkcircled in his white face i dont have anyone else to turn to the shock was worse than being plunged into icecold water lorryn helpless with no one to turn to and i do she thought and shook her head i waslorryn what on earth could i do to help you whats happened to you possibilities swarmed her mind had he been indiscreet with someone who had a powerful father had he gambled disastrously and lost had he gotten into a quarrel with another erlordoh dear ancestors had he quarreled fought and the fight ended fatally she blurted the first words that came to her lips did you get in trouble with he shook his head violently it isnt anything you can guess he replied and seized both her hands to pull her over to a seat on the couch opposite the bed trust me it isnt anything you can even imagine im in terrible dangerim he swallowed audibly and passed the back of his hand across his forehead something was supposed to happen at lord ardeyns fete the high lords of the council were testing everyone under a certain age as they arrived to see if they were halfbloods in a disguise of illusion she nodded remembering that tingle of spellcasting she had felt as she arrived and remembering too that she had wondered why her father had ordered cosmetics for her instead of an illusion of better looks well i didnt go to the fete and late last night three members of the council arrived here with orders to test me for illusion he went on beads of sweat starting out on his forehead she shook her head i dont understand she said bewildered what could be so bad about that she couldnt help thinking about her own plighthow could anything lorryn faced in the way of some kind of test be worse than the trap she was in they cant test me he said hoarsely his hands clenching on hers until she made a sound of pain in protest and he released his hold rena they cant test me if they do theyll find out i am halfblood she stared at him the words refusing to make sense how can you be a halfblood she asked stupidly mother lady viridina is my mother he said woodenly but lord tylar is not my father my father was a human slave master of her household she kept the illusion on me until i was old enough to hold it on myself i am a halfblood a wizard and when the council finds that out once again shockand the fact that this time she might be able to do somethinggave her mind speed and clarity theyll kill you she breathed oh ancestors lorryn howwe have to do something cant mother help you he took her hands in that crushing grip again but this time she hardly noticed despair had turned his features into a mask of pain mother cant save me this time father locked her in the bower until the testing is over you are the only person i can turn to cant you hide me among your servants or something can you i have a better idea she replied quickly as she made then discarded a dozen plans in a heartbeat he couldnt hide here he had to run away and if he ran he had to take her with him she calculated quickly at least i think i do one of my maids always seems to have all kinds of information about the dragons and wizardsits reliable too ive checked it against all the things youve found out what has that he began then blinked oh oh of course if she has a way of getting information she may have a way back to the source a glint of hope entered his eyes do you think shes an agent of the wizards rena shrugged the idea had never occurred to her before but it certainly made complete sense what else could she be shes terribly forward not much like any slave ive ever seen shes not one of fathers castoffs and anyway they have a different kind of insolence the wizards must have spies among the slaves right or how else would they know what we were doing and how else would they know who the halfbloods among the slaves were to rescue them she told me that the wizards were always rescuing halfblood children from the slave pens didnt they rescue the elvenbane that way he nodded and his face took on a grave intensity they couldnt have known about me because i wasnt a slaveunless this myre of yours was sent here because they thought that either you or me might have had human blood it makes sense she agreed it makes even more sense when you think about all the stories shes told me about the dragons and the wizards all the news she brought me about what they were doing she says theyre building a new stronghold right now in fact and that the dragons are helping them it was her turn to clutch his hands we should run away both of us lorryn we should go to the dragons both of us he said sudden doubt in his voice but you arent if you disappear what do you think will happen to me she countered fiercely before he could object father would never believe that i didnt know something he wouldnt use a coercion on his own lorryn began oh yes he would she said with a savagery that took him aback he wouldnt hesitate not for a moment and especially not with three members of the council breathing down his neck years of resentment at lorryns preferential treatment came to a boil and she gave him truth after bitter angry truth he was ready to wed me to the first drooling dotard or prize idiot that made an offer he was willing to use coercions to get me to the fete and he was quite prepared to have me sent away to be changed if i didnt please lord lyon last night youve never seen him fling his used concubines at mother and expect her to smile and take them into her service youve never listened to him insult both of us and expect us to nod and agree with him that we are useless worthless emptyheaded idiots youve never had to sit at dinner while he told his friends that you were hardly satisfactory but if any of them were willing to take you off his hands hed be grateful and youve never sat there in silence because if you dared to look insolent hed magelash you as soon as you were all in private magelashing she added bitterly leaves no marks after all no scars that might disfigure a potential bride lorryn looked stunned and shocked i didnt know he began in a whisper it didnt matter she replied with bleak forgiveness you couldnt have done anything except get yourself in trouble i learned quickly enough to be meek silent obedient and invisible just the way he wanted and something he didnt have to think about then he left me alone but it doesnt matter she repeated all that matters is that i have to escape with you because he will use coercion to find out what i know if you leave me behind so take me with you i still have those boys clothes that you gave me we can find myre and find out what she knows he nodded slowly if she can help usif she knows how to find the wizards she must rena replied or where would she be getting all her news ill ring for her dont bring the others he said in alarm as she reached for a bellcord if you call servants to come boiling in here theres no way well keep this silent she shook her head exasperated didnt he know anything about the way a bower was served there were times when a lady did not want anyone except the personal servant of her body to come anywhere near her dont worry myres bell goes only to her room thats the price of her privacy and her status as my personal maid they wont have changed that much yet it occurred to her that the timing of this crisis was nothing short of a miracle so far as their escape possibilities went one more day and myre would likely not be her personal maid anymore lord lyon would surely send over slaves of his own to assure her continued obedience and docility there had been something in that drink last night that had made her sleep like a stone surely there would be more such drinks to ensure she had no second thoughts on the betrothal and in another week she would be so busy with wedding preparations that lorryn would have been unable to come anywhere near her during the dayand at night there would be real guards mounted on all entrances to her rooms nothing was ever left to chance in a situation in which the bride might becomeawkward and after that she would not even be here she would begin a round of visits to her own female kin then to lord lyons there would be fetes in honor of the betrothal and long talks with each chosen female on the duty of wives to their husbands that round of visits would end not here but at lord lyons estate where the wedding would finally take place no the timing on this could not have been better and here was the escape she had longed for dreamed ofeven prayed for although the elves had no deities to entreat and felt such superstitions were the product of inferior minds perhaps the humans were right after allsomething did listen to prayers myre appeared within moments of her sounding the bell looking a bit outofsorts but not at all disheveled it had never occurred to her before but myre always looked like that no matter how odd the hour when rena summoned her did she never sleep or was she something other than what she seemed did wizards sleep for instance myres eyes widened just a trifle to see lorryn sitting on the couch but she nodded as rena motioned for silence theres no one listening not even with magic lorryn said wearily believe me i would know myre stared at himthen slowly smiled so wizard she said softly i heard about the three council members arriving last night but i had thought it was because of sheyrenas betrothal sheyrenaswhat lorryn said taken aback never mind it doesnt matter rena told him fiercely men turned to myre please she pleaded you seem to know so much about the free wizardswe have to get away from here we need your help myres smile broadened as if none of this surprised her in the least indeed she said calmly i would say thats an understatement the slave sat down on the edge of the bed as if she were the master and not the other way around then againright now she is her posture certainly seemed to confirm every speculation rena had just made about her no slave ever unlearned discipline to look the way myre did now so i do believe i can help the slave said leaning back on her hands and regarding them both with an amused eye as relief made rena feel faint the first thing well need is a weapon or two and after that she smiled as if at a secret only she knew just how good a swimmer are you chapter the discovery of a few wild humans out here was startling in its way although shana had assumed ever since they began their search through the wilderness for a new home that sooner or later the wizards would come across humans that had never been subjugated by the elves this world was simply too big and the elves too few for them to have either conquered or destroyed all humans in it now that they all knew the facts though this discovery was very intimidating from everything they learned from collens clan there were many more humans out beyond the lands she knew than shana had thought here was a groupone of manythat existed simply to trade with the other wild ones collens family of traders had been unable to tell the wizards anything about the grasslands to the south of the citadel or who might be living there now he and his kin stuck to the river seldom venturing beyond it he could only tell her that there were many groups of nomadic herdsmen that roamed the plains and that once in a great while some of these sent representatives to the river to trade with his people shana had taken that lack of information as a reason to escape the citadel on a scouting expedition and mero keman and kalamadea had not been much behind in volunteering as well the retrieval of personal belongings was proceeding at what shana considered to be a reasonable rate but it was not satisfying caellach gwain and his cronies who seemed to see no reason why they could not come barging into any given session with demands that the circle of young wizards bring back a particular object right now nor despite much urging both polite and brusque would they stoop to the use of stones to amplify their powers or to work in a circle to combine their abilities as the younger set had learned they had much more important work to do fetching things was a job for apprentices or so shana was told at least once a day what that important work was shana had yet to learn to give them the benefit of the doubt they might be working on ways to defend the citadel or keep the magics practiced within it cloaked she herself had seen no evidence of that however nor had anyone else shed spoken to unfortunately for all it was most likely that the important work consisted of arranging their personal quarters to their liking and trying to bully the dragons into making changes and additions before those changes were scheduled caellach himself had treated shana to a lecture on the duty of an apprentice to her masters and a tirade on how an apprentice who had singlehandedly brought about the wreckage of her masters lives should be grateful they still permitted her to walk among them shana decided then and there that she had much more important work to do than fetching things as wellseeing if there were any more wild humans to the south after all it stood to reason that the plains could support any number of groups of nomadic herdsmen and one of those groups might retain knowledge of human magic from the times before the elves arrived the elves didnt own the world though they might think they did and what they knew about it was probably only a fraction of what there was to know shana had another reason for her expedition though it was one she kept to herself realistically speaking even though collens traders had been friendly there was no law saying that the next batch of humans that stumbled on the citadel might not be hostile according to the old chronicles humans had warred with other humans long before the elves came here fullblood humans might consider the halfblood wizards to be as bad or worse than the elves themselves her absence would give the circle a clever excuse not to accede to caellach gwains more unreasonable demands if they didnt feel like it if shethe most powerful of the lotwasnt there they would naturally be very limited in what they could bring caellach had already gotten far more than his share of their time and effort if they told him that getting the particular trinket he had his heart set on would mean that he and the rest of the wizards would be enjoying a dinner of oat porridge instead of nice fresh gameand that they would be certain to let everyone know why there was oat porridge on the table that nighthe would probably go away and if the old whiners didnt like that answer there was no way they could refute it since they hadnt bothered to learn the limitations of the new ways of using magic what was even more delightful it was not a situation they could win by addressing that ignorance if they learned the new ways they would obviously be capable of doing their own retrievals denelor had promised that was how he would deal with the situation and even parth agon who had grown heartily tired of their demands had agreed to back him up the chief wizard had changed a great deal in the days past and in shanas opinion it was all for the better she frankly had not expected it she had really thought he would become more like caellach and not more like denelor having him on her side instead of opposing her had made her situation marginally more comfortable i will tell them that since they have proven that they are ready to learn new magics they must of course practice them diligently parth had said without cracking a smile as the chief and most senior of course i have the obligation to set such an assignment on those who are my junior and how better to practice than by retrieving their own gear the rest of the circle had greeted the solution with sighs of relief and everyone even old denelor had been amused by the thought of caellach gwain begging one of them to teach him the use of stones the most important of the supplies had been brought to the citadel and certainly by winter their stocks would be adequate to hold them for a while collen would be returning with the fruits of his trading in a few weeks and that would further supplement their stores some judicious experimentation was going on in the way of finding edible forest plants by following the tracks of wild boar and bringing back samples of everything the boar ate shana was not particularly needed as leader or as figurehead for any of that and if she was out there looking for allies or possible danger no one could say she was shirking her duties shana left the new citadel with something of the sense that she was fleeing into freedom she had been all too aware of the oppressive weight of responsibility on her shoulders responsibility she had never wanted and was only too glad to leave behind her in the caves so now the four of them were far from the stronghold past the point where the forests faded into prairie in the grasscovered foothills with nary a tree for miles keman and kalamadea rather than assuming their halfblood forms were in their own skins though riding dragonback was uncomfortable it was easier than walking for leagues and leagues under a hot sunand it was much easier to spot things from the air terrain like this was ideal for aerial scouting for nothing escaped the sharp eyes of the dragons and there was nothing in the way of cover to hide beneath in the land below them game was plentiful enough here herds of wild horses of other grazing animals even of alicorns the dragons had no trouble feeding themselves and resolved to tell the others from their lair about the abundance of game here their search thus far however had turned up nothing other than those herds of grazers there hadnt been so much as a single human herdsman or signs of one since they left the hills they were all four lounging next to a tiny springfed pool at midday taking a rest shana and mero were disinclined to fly in the heat of the day there was no way to keep a hat on ones head while flying and the suns rays reached a punishing strength by about noon the dragons loved the heat and were only too happy to provide shade for the two halfbloods while they spread their wings and soaked up sun basking contentedly the pool watered a small stand of scrub willow judging from the number of tracks in the mud it played host to a vast array of animal life in the course of a day and night a tiny stream threaded away from the pool into the grass its path marked by more scrub brush as it snaked off in the general direction of the fardistant river the waisthigh grass all around them was full of insects that chirped and droned and thronged with tiny birds that flitted from stem to stem and happily ate those insects shana watched one of them balanced on a long stem of something that bent and waved beneath his light weight singing his declaration of territory to any invading males a hot breeze rose up making the grass stems bend carrying the scent of drying grass and the dampearth smell from the pool toward shana you know there is one thing ive wondered ever since i found that one horrid heavy old chronicle about the elven invasion shana saidnot to mero but to kalamadea the one that was about as thick as your leg kalamadea im sure you probably saw it reading it was the best cure for insomnia i ever encountered hmm the one by laranz the insufferable father dragon said lazily his eyes closed to mere slits as he absorbed the sun and heat he kept his size close to that of keman for this trip but his natural size was far larger and if he had taken it now he could have provided shade for a small army dragons grew as they aged and father dragon was the oldest dragon shana had ever seen or heard of he had meddled shifted into halfblood form in the first wizard war and he had not been young then shana had found his personal journals in the old citadel after the wizards rescued her from an elven auction block and guaranteed discovery of her elven breeding they formed part of the reason why she was here right now who were the grelriders and how in the world did they manage to keep the elves from conquering them when they had no trouble eliminating just about everyone else youve seen grels of course kalamadea said after a long pause at least youve seen the desertgrels the ones that the traders ride shana nodded the caravan of traders that had captured her when she was first exiled from the lairs had ridden grels and used them as packbeasts well the originals of those grels are about as different asas an alicorn and a goat kalamadea told her the elves took some liberties with them the original grels are just as ugly but not as tall and cant go without water for quite as long the grelriders used them as mounts for controlling their herds they started out as nomadic cattle herders but when the elves began their conquests they withdrew from the civilized lands altogether they didnt even trade with other humans in or around elven territories anymore they just went away as far away as they could that makes sense shana said after thinking about that in their place id have done the same the way those elves use illusion youd never know if the trader you were dealing with was human or one of them spying on you the best way to eliminate spies from outside is to eliminate all contact from the outside kalamadea gave her a lazy grin full of teeth youre thinking he said with approval well the grelriders originally used only their grels for herdriding and for packing but when the grels turned out to be useless for fighting they developed a special kind of cattle they used for warfare they called them warbulls roughly twice the size of a horse with long wicked horns the grelriders taught them to use those horns in combat and even an alicorn couldnt kill a warbull but that cant be the reason why the elves couldnt conquer them shana persisted kalamadea nodded slightly the real reason was probably fairly simple but laranz would hardly have wanted to admit that they were nomadic after all which meant they had no cities for the elves to attack the elven lords didnt fare well when they lacked a large specific target and as far as i know the grelriders simply rode away when they got tired of fighting the elves general consensus is that they went south that is all i know about them huh shana plucked a grass stem to nibble on and settled herself a little more comfortably in kalamadeas shade leaning up against the dragons scaly flank his hide felt cool under her hand probably because he was absorbing the energy of the sun and storing it deep inside dragons could do that it supplemented the energy they got from their food which was probably the only reason they didnt eat the countryside bare of game the grelriders intrigued her the chronicle had hinted that the grelriders had some sort of protection against elven magic but hadnt offered any details given the writers pomposity that was possibly because he didnt know any details and would never have admitted that still no matter what kalamadea thought it seemed to her that anyone who pretended to the title of truthseeker as the chronicler had would not have mentioned arcane protection unless he had some reason to you dont think were likely to meet up with these grelriders do you mero asked slowly as if he were following shanas thought shana favored him with a lifted eyebrow why do you think i chose this direction in the first place she replied collen knows the river and the people who live near it and he didnt know about any grelriders so that left south she waved her stem at the rolling plains it would take people who were nomadic riders to live here i think its a bit difficult to hide out here and if there were any numbers of settled people the elves would find them and eliminate them i want to find the grelriders kalamadea i hate to contradict you but i think you might be wrong about why the elves couldnt conquer them i really think they know something we dont mero sat up suddenly looking at something on me southern horizon a view that was blocked for shana by kalamadeas bulk i dont know if were about to find grelriders shana the young wizard said slowly but there is certainly something on the way towards us she scrambled to her feet and moved around kalamadea to where she could see what mero was looking at it was a cloud of yellow dust rising up against the empty blue of the skya huge cloud of dust and although it was fairly dry out on these plains nothing would produce a dust cloud of that size except an enormous herd of thousands and thousands of beasts she shaded her eyes with her hand and tried to see if she could come up with any clueseither visually or with other senses was there anyone with magic out there or were there any humans with the mindpowers only human magicians had she ought to be able at least to catch a stray thought or two from whoever or whatever was kicking up all that dust she came up against a curious blankness beneath that cloud that in itself was odd she couldnt detect even a single thoughtand in the past she hadnt had any trouble reading the shapethoughts of creatures as small as a grounddwelling rodent are you notsensing what im notsensing she said quietly to mero who nodded neither of us can sense anything either kalamadea said speaking for himself and keman there are animals that can make themselves blank to the sense of magic power he reminded her and there are beasts whose thoughtssuch as they arecant be detected either remember that leaping thing in the forest the one that almost ate valyn and me she nodded but those were created either by accident or deliberately using magic and if there is a herd of creatures like that out there we need to know about it she raised an eyebrow i think we need to go take a look this prairie land was not entirely flat that was just as well because shana didnt want to get any closer to the strangers than she was right now the ridge theyd hidden themselves on to wait for the makers of the dust cloud to arrive was just high enough to afford a bit of a prospect the four of themnow all in halfblood form since it was rather hard to hide something the size of a dragonlay on their stomachs in the scant cover of some scraggly bushes growing at the top of the ridge prom this vantage they waited with mounting impatience while flies buzzed around their ears and ants explored the regions inside their clothing the objects of their study might well be the fabled grelriders but if that was so they had abandoned the grels entirely in favor of their cattle there wasnt a grel in sight only shaggy cattle bulls cows calves and oxen and there were thousands of them in the lead of the group and riding guard along the side were men and women with skins of the deepest brown shana had ever seen a brown that was a scant shade lighter than black they all wore armor tight scalemetal corselets that covered their torsos metal gorgets and arm guards on the lower and upper arms most wore widebrimmed hats against the sun but the few without head coverings had their hair cropped to scarcely more than a dark fuzz and none of the men had even a trace of a beard or a mustache the beasts they rode were bulls with huge wickedly pointed horns as wide as shana could reach with both hands outstretched as far as they could go the tip of each horn had been sheathed with metal the point on the end looked needlesharp the cattle were of many colors from a solid brownish black like the skins of the riders to pied in red and white to a few who were probably pure white under the coating of yellow dust in the middle of the riders was an enormous cattle herd of cows and calves all of the beasts were very hairy and not very tamelooking between the herd and the riders were the wagons wide platforms supporting square felt tents with peaked roofs and pulled by teams of four and six oxen hitched abreast the herd the riders and the wagons filled the plain for as far as shana could see no matter what your chronicle said these people arent barbarians shana mero whispered to her take a look at their metal work at the fittings on that tentwagon she had to agree with that assessment the work on the armor was some of the finest shed ever seen and the wagontent was of a very sophisticated design both the armor and the tents boasted refined abstract decorations showing not a hint of crudity either in pattern or execution well look how the guardriders are organized she countered theyre not riding randomly each one has a place and an assignment no i agree with you that writer was just being pompous again these people are quite civilized these people are behind us kalamadea said in a tone of strain she turned to find herself staring at the point of a spear held by one of the halfdozen warriors who had crept up behind her little party while they watched the group below the warriors were all quite alert quite competentlooking and she could not touch the minds of a single one of them when she tried she touched that curious blankness she had met before behind the spearcarriers the bulls stood patiently watching them and their masters she had the feeling that they wouldnt stay patient if she and her crew charged however on the other hand they didnt have much choice if they didnt make an escape attempt now they probably would never get another chance assuming they werent killed outofhand mero launched the attack before she could say anything he flung a levinbolt at the nearest fighter it crackled through the air between him and the warrior bluewhite as lightning and just as powerful the levinbolt touched his armor and was deflected off into the grass leaving a scorched mark theredespite the fact that the warrior made no move to counter it himself worse he didnt seem at all startled by the attack he hadnt moved not even to step back involuntarily it was as if he had known he was safe from magic attacks blast mero had taken care of any chance to parleyand it was obvious these people werent going to be spooked off by a display of power id better try something quick shana flung an attack of pain and blindness at the mind of the one holding the spear on her at the same time that mero flung a second magical levinbolt this was a combination of the elfshot magic that the elven lords used and a mental attack of the sort the human wizards chose it should have worked felling her attacker even if he was protected against elven magic he shouldnt have been proof against the combination of elven and human magics he didnt even blink the attack went into that curious blankness that surrounded his mind and was absorbed effortlessly she stared back into the deep brown eyes of the warrior facing her and took a deep breath i think were in trouble keman said quietly getting slowly to his feet as the warrior nearest him gestured he should do so with his spear shana did not bother to thank him for the observation i think we should surrender kalamadea added as yet more riders thundered up on their shaggy mounts spears at the ready i really do think we should surrender fine shana snapped without taking her attention from the spear pointed at her throat nowjust how do you pro pose we do that these are strangers they dont know our language and we dont know theirs one wrong move she didnt bother to finish the sentence myre had led her two charges down into places that rena had never dreamed existed in the estate cellarsnot all of them very nice most of them very dirty the maid hadnt really wanted to take rena along at all even when rena used the argument shed used on lorryn but she had finally agreed when lorryn told her flatly that he was not leaving without rena the maid had changed what had always been a faintly superior attitude to one that was faintly insolent yet rena could not find it in her to object they were after all at her mercy she didnt have to help them they threw together what supplies and weapons they could as myre led them to rummage through the storerooms their short time before the household woke stretched considerably by lorryn and a magic he used to keep the inhabitants of the house sleeping soundly and a lot longer than they normally did they didnt dare go out of the house itself for there was no way of extending the magic to the stables and slave pens and beyond so all of the useful weapons and gear not to mention horses that lay outside the house walls might just as well have been on the moon for all that they could reach it they fled into the cellars carrying crude packs made up of bedding with straps improvised from belts rena carried the food they filched from the kitchen knives a firestriker and a single metal water bottle shed found in the cellars lorryn carried his bow and his arrows knives and sword his own clothing and bedding and things myre had found for them rope a small axe a huge square of waterproofed silk and their heavy cloaks which were too bulky for rena to take there were exits to the outside from the cellars doors through which barrels and boxes were delivered without having to take them through the kitchen or any other door myre tried all of them until she found one that was unlocked they scrambled up over a pile of roots tumbled down through a hatchway from above when she tried that and found it open the roots were filthy and hard as rocks and rena could hardly imagine how they could be made edible they popped out of the hatchway into the dim gray of false dawn scuttled across the yard into the relative shelter of the kitchen gardens and from there followed myre across the paddocks and fencedin homefields toward the edge of the estate each field was bounded by hedges and ditches bringing irrigation water ideal cover for someone who was escaping except that they were going in the opposite direction from the gate and the road rena hadnt seen the point of that the estate was completely walled in and the only entrance was at the front of the manor but she was afraid to say anything myre could decide to leave her behind accidentally and in this halflight it wouldnt be difficult to do so then what would she do it would be rather difficult to explain what she was doing dressed in the clothing of a male slave carrying a pack with her hair hacked off at chin length even if she made her way back to her own quarters undetected the hair would still be difficult to explain and taken with lorryns absence would be bound to get her into immediate trouble finally they came to the wall made of smooth stone it was many feet thick at the bottom to prevent anyone digging under it it towered above them and as rena already knew the top was well protected by shards of glass set into mortar there was no way to climb it and no way around it but myre didnt seem dismayed instead she led the way along the fence as the false dawn gave way to the true bluegray light of early morning rena was getting more and more nervous in a little while the supervisors would be bringing the slaves out here to work the fields and they would be seen what was myre up to but myre clearly knew exactly what she was doing she led them to something rena hadnt even dreamed existed a place where a small deep ditch or aqueduct led under the wall the tunnel itself was as black as a starless night and seemed to be very long it probably led underground as well as under the walla clever deterrent to escape attempts water came up to within a half a foot or so of the ceiling i see now why you asked if we could swim rena said staring at it the water looked very cold wont there be bars or something across the mouth of this though i cant imagine father not barring this somehow leave that to me the slave replied then looked over her shoulder at rena with a sardonic expression on her face last chance to go back rena shook her head wordlessly now that she was in this she was hardly going to turn back no matter how difficult it got myre snorted dont say i never gave you a chance and with that lithe as an otter she dove into the water and disappeared a moment later her whisper echoed through the halfflooded tunnel under the wall are you coming or not lorryn took off his pack and lowered himself into the water letting the pack float behind him as he towed it by one of the straps it occurred to rena that his bow was going to be useless for a while after this at least until the bow itself and the bowstring dried out oh well what use would a bow be against fathers magic anyway the water came up to lorryns chin which meant it would be over renas head not a good sign he let the current carry him into the runnel and was quickly lost in the shadows rena hesitated only a moment longer it was growing light and it wouldnt be long before someone came along here she followed lorryn s example and took off her pack tying one strap to her own belt then clutching the side of the aqueduct she lowered herself into the water it was colder than it looked and quickly soaked through her clothing she couldnt feel the bottom at all and suppressed the urge to panic but she could not make herself let go of the side of the aqueduct her teeth chattered as she clung to the brickwork of the side and worked her way hand over hand into the darkness of the tunnel that was where she discovered that the ceiling quickly dropped much closer to the water than it appeared from outside and she found it was impossible to hold on to the side and still have room to breathe with a shudder she let go of her last handhold and let the sluggish current take her hoping shed be able to stay afloat she looked back over her shoulder the light at the end of the tunnel receded slowly though when she looked ahead no new light showed where the other end might be she was so cold now that her feet and hands were numb and behind her the pack was soaking up water and acting like an anchor slowing her down she tried to paddle forward without churning up the water too muchthinking that too much splashing might echo out of the tunnel and alert a supervisor to something irregular with the pack dragging at her it was hard work to keep her head above water she paddled more vigorously gasping for breath as the cold water lapped around her chin and lips finally a hand came out of the darkness and seized her shoulder she stifled a yelp knowing it had to be either lorryn or myre it was the former clinging to a metal grate that blocked the tunnel theres a door in the grate lorryn said spitting water his own teeth chattering its just under the surface its usually locked but myre opened it follow me by now there was enough light coming from the end of the tunnel for rena to see dimly lorryn patted her shoulder encouragingly then ducked under the water she felt his legs thrashing past her then his head reappeared on the other side of the metal grate she hung on to the grate and felt cautiously under the water with her free hand and the toe of her boot until she encountered the open space down there where the door must be by then lorryn was gone floating away out of sight she took several deep breaths and told herself that if lorrynwho was a worse swimmer than shecould manage this it should be easy for her then she ducked her head under eyes tightly closed grabbed for the edge of the opening and hauled herself through headfirst she had a moment of panic when her pack caught it pulled her back under before she managed to get a good breath fear chilled her more than the water she fought the pack strap mindlessly thrashing and getting pulled under again and again breathing in more water than air each time she reached the surface for a breath she couldnt even cry out for help she kept choking on the water finally her gyrations freed it quite by accident and she bobbed to the surface as it dragged downward on her belt she clung to the grate then panting until she recovered enough to follow her brother fortunately the end of the tunnel was not far away now she was able to make out another dim halfcircle of light up ahead of her and a pair of dark blots that must be the heads of myre and lorryn side by side in the middle of the light now she actually swam rather than letting the current take her or simply paddling like a child and in spite of the drag of her soaked pack she reached their side in a very few moments lorryn heard her coming and held out a hand to catch her as she peered past him she saw that the aqueduct gave directly out on a river the bank here was overgrown and the weeds hung down into the water forming a screen between them and the open water the sun was up but the day was overcast and it looked like rain heavy black clouds rolled sullenly across the small patch of sky visible from the tunnel and rena thought she heard the growl of thunder in the distance if you had to pick a day to run this was a good one myre said her whisper echoing down the tunnel we should wait here until the rain starts once theres a downpour going even patrols will stay inside until its overand a good strong rain will wash away tracks and scent if they try to follow us with hounds rena was already soaked and cold the prospect of traveling through the punishing rain of a thunderstorm wasnt a pleasant one but were running for our lives she chided herself immediately be sensible whats a little water if it will help keep father from following us the only trouble wasif the rain kept people inside it would follow that she and lorryn might be missed sooner i can probably count on father letting me sleep late this morning too after my little betrothal dinner but what about lorryn how soon would his servants come to wake him and would he actually be missed if he wasnt in his bed would they assume he was at a gathering and hadnt yet come home thunder did rumble in the near distance making her jump of all the things she had imagined she would do to find the dragons this situation had never entered her mind the girl dreaming in the garden surrounded by birds seemed another person entirely lightning arced across the sky overhead thunder exploded above them as rena shrieked involuntarily and the skies opened up now myre said fiercely and thrust herself through the weeds out into the pouring rain lorryn followed rena gasping and clutching at handfuls of clay and tough weed stems followed him myre was already halfway up the bank lorryn stopped only long enough to give her a hand out of the river before taking to his heels himself she scrambled up the bank behind him pausing only long enough to wrestle her pack back on she slipped and fell along the slippery clay bank so many times she lost count her hands stung and burned from weed cuts and nettle strings and they were the only parts of her that felt warm her sides ached and she was panting for breath by the time she reached the top of the steep bank and dove into the dubious shelter of a tangle of wet bushes beside lorryn myre was already peering through the rain looking for something rena was glad now that she had cut off her hair when shed put on the slaves old clothing at least she wasnt fighting masses of wet tangled hair we need something faster than our legs myre muttered horses maybe if we can steal them what about a boat lorryn countered there are usually small boats just downriver from here father keeps them there for pleasureangling and dallying on the river myre finally turned to look at him her dripping hair straggling over one eye just how ornamental are these boats she asked skeptically we dont want to float off in something that screams elven lord and i dont know the first thing about boats anyway ive used them lorryn assured her and it doesnt matter how ornamental they are i know how to use my magic remember i can make it look like then he stopped and myre smiled sardonically exactly and have your magic scream to anyone that can sense it that youre right down here he winced shamefaced well they arent that ornamental he muttered rena remembered the boats lorryn had taken her out in one a very long time ago for a long lazy afternoon on the water like every moment she had spent outside the bower every detail was etched into her memory there may be some heavier boats that the slaves use on the other side of the dock she said closing her eyes to call the memories up and if there arentwell pick the plainest and i can make it plainer i can fade the paint with my magic thats so weak i dont think anyone will sense it and we can use the axe to pry off any ornamental woodwork its all just tacked onto the original boat anyway myre turned to look at her with surprise she obviously hadnt anticipated rena being anything but a tagalong and a burden we can try that she said shortly we arent that far from the dragons anyway the dragons will be happy to see you and shelter you and once were away from lord tylars estate it wont be hard to get to them she peered out into the rain once more come on she said gesturing to them to follow and darted back out into the downpour the docks were there and so were the boats including those used by the slaves to catch fresh fish for their masters table lorryn and rena untied the stiff watersoaked ropes that held one of the boats to the dock at stern and prow myre stood in the middle of the boat and pushed it away from the dock with a long pole at lorryns direction there were oars but with this storm sending so much water into the river they didnt need them the current caught the light boat right away with lorryn at the rudder it moved out into the center of the river with everincreasing swiftness it was left to myre and rena to bail out the bottom while lorryn steered how long until were off fathers land rena wondered fretfully as she scooped water out of the bottom with a canvas bucket and tossed it over the side not only was rain continuing to pour down on them the boat itself leaked at every seam it was all she and myre could do to keep the water level from rising dangerously how long until the council members are told that lorryn is missing what will they do when they know will they go back to the council and report him orshe could not think of an alternative she could not think of anything at the moment there they are the shout rang across the water from the bank rena looked up startled through a short swath of dripping rainsoaked hair on the bank were riders all elves in full armor one of them was pointing directly at them rena felt a tingle along her nerves a shiver along her skin that had nothing to do with the cold lorryn swore they know its us he said shortly theyre using magic to identify us and was their magic strong enough to seize the runawaysor even kill them here and now myre looked around frantically as if for a weapon or a means of escape cant you make this thing go any faster she shrieked over the pouring rain and the thunder of course he can he has the powerdo it rena urged it cant matter they already know its us and where we are hurry lorryn dashed his hair out of his eyes with an impatient hand and let go of the rudder he raised both hands over his head as the riders on the bank milled then retreated obviously expecting an attack they must be some of fathers underlings or theyd attack us now hold on lorryn shouted rena obeyed instantly knowing from experience that lorryn never issued a warning unless it was necessary myre didnt respond immediately however she was still looking around fruitlessly for a weapon or a means of protection with a crack and a flash of light the boat suddenly lurched forward throwing rena into the bottom if she hadnt been holding on to the side with both hands shed have been thrown overboard just as myre was rena let go with one hand and snatched for the slaves clothing as the girl tumbled past her and over the side too late the last she saw of myre was the girls face floating above the water vanishing behind the curtain of rain as the boat accelerated with twice the speed of a running horse stop rena shouted to her brother weve lost myre he shook his head regretfully hands still held over his head face creased with concentration i cant he shouted back once i let this thing loose it goes until it runs out by itself rena looked back myre was out of sight and the elven riders mere dots on the riverbanka moment later they vanished too in the gray sheets of water pouring from the heavens the boat was still picking up speed they were on their own and her heart contracted with fear the boat didnt slacken speed until they had passed out of the storm and were well into some of the untamed lands held by no elven overlord by then lorryns face was gray with exhaustion and renas hands ached with the effort of holding on to the sides the river was full of debris and lorryn had been forced to make several abrupt corrections to their course to avoid hitting any of it corrections that would have thrown her out of the boat to be left behind like myre finally when the spell at last ran out lorryn used the slackening momentum took the rudder and brought them in to the southern bank of the river they both pitched their packs into the underbrush and clambered clumsily over the side onto the low bank lorryn pushed the boat away with a branch and let the river take it again they stared after it until it disappeared with any luck they wont be able to guess where we put ashore even when they find it lorryn said shouldering his pack that should give us some time i hope rena shrugged into her own pack wishing it held something dry and warm to wear she was so cold now that she had stopped shivering the cold went all the way down to her bones she couldnt have shivered now if she wanted to fear and chill held her in a kind of choked silence and stillness now where do we go she asked timidly trying not to sound as if she was accusing lorryn of anything we lost myre he sighed and stared off into the forest well she said the dragons werent far didnt she say they were south of here rena didnt remember anything of the kind but it hardly mattered one direction was as good as another as long as they went away from those who were hunting them she made a gesture of hopeless bafflement can youdo you know if theres anyone around here anyone who might come after us she was so afraidso very afraid enemies behind them the unknown all about them and their guide lost beyond hope of finding againwhat could they do any elves you mean i dont think its safe to use elven magic but theres that human trick of listening for thoughts that i can try he closed his eyes and his face took on that listening look i cant sense anything but the minds of animals we should be safe enough for a while maybe safe enough to find some shelter build a fire get dry dry and warm dared she hope that they might escape after all right now simply being dry and warm sounded like paradise you had better lead she told him youve hunted you know what to look out for and youre the one with the weapons at that reminder he checked his bow found it useless and drew his knife instead he looked as if he was about to say something else frowned as if he thought better of it and led the way into the underbrush theres no one within range of lorryns mind for now were safe she told her pounding heart her sinking spirit we can escape we can rena followed behind him wishing she werent carrying a huge weight of water along with the pack wishing this were all a nightmare as fear ebbed other discomforts began her stomach ached with hunger and her shoulders hurt where the packstraps cut into them right now marriage to lord gildor didnt seem like such a bad thing after all they might have come out of the storm but the day was still overcast and every tree dripped water down onto the deer path lorryn had found she had thought she couldnt be any colder or more miserable but every time another branch sent a load of cold drops down the back of her neck she discovered she was only beginning to learn what misery meant her boots didnt quite fit despite all the stockings she wore and she was getting a blister on one heel she could hardly feel her fingers she kept her eyes on her feet and the path in front of her as her legs began to ache joining her aching shoulders and a headache began as well she was so wet so cold if only she dared use a little magic well why not my magics are so small i can at least make myself a little warmer a little drier surely no one will notice that she narrowed her concentration and insinuated her magics into her clothing working from the skin out and the feet up driving the water out of the fabric fiber by fiber it was something like flowersculpting after all just shoving the water away from where she didnt want it slowly and patiently when it reached the surface of her clothing she let it bead up and run off at least while she was concentrating on that it was easier to ignore her aching legs and shoulders and it was working first her feet inside her boots then her legs then her torso and finally her arms were dry warmshe turned her attention to her pack shoving the water ahead of a kind of barrier she created at her back the pack got lighter and lighter as she squeezed the water out and before too long it was actually bearable to carry the lightened weight of it rena are you working magic lorryn said breaking her concentration she hesitated a moment just a little she replied meekly i was so cold and weti havent done anything wrong have i her eyes opened wide with alarm they havent felt it have they i its all right lorryn said quickly pushing aside a heavy branch with his free hand i wasnt sure you were working magic it was that faint i just felt it and thought it might be them looking for us it stopped when i asked you about it you broke my concentration so it must have been me you sensed she said with relief oh good i was just so cold and wet and i didnt think it would do any harm to drive the water out of my clothes you ought to do the same i cant he said in a very small voice she wasnt certain she heard him right you cant she replied with astonishment butyou made the boat practically fly and ive seen you do so many other things how can you they dont teach boys to do small magicsor the ones they call small magics he told her ruefully ill tell you what thoughwhen youre soaking wet those magics dont seem small id give anything for a pair of dry socks she laughed and was astonished to hear her own laughter well in that case you can give me something to eat and find a place to rest and ill see you get dry socks and dry everything else he turned back to look at her surprise warring in his face with amusement in that case let me say that you are the most useful escape companion that anyone could ever ask for better even than a fully armed warriorwho would be just as helpless as me and probably a lot more cross unspoken were other thoughts which she knew he had even though he was too tactful to say anything like myre hed been certain that she would be more of a hindrance than a help a rock tied about his neck and slowing him down she didnt mind now though that would have hurt earlier now he knew better and so do i and at that realization her heart and spirits began to rise just a little lorryn found shelter under the wreck of a huge fallen tree tiny magics dried his clothing and pack his bow and bowstring tiny magics dried the heaps of sodden leaves she piled up so that they formed a warming cushion against the damp air and earth tiny magics kept the insects away while lorryn concentrated on searching the woods for hunters both elven and animal every exercise of her magics made her feel better she was not as useless as father had always claimed she was she could think of solutions to some of their problems maybe she couldnt make a boat speed down the river at a breakneck pace but she could keep lorryn from catching cold and maybe getting so sick he wouldnt be able to move elves didnt get ill at least not very often but humans did all the time so lorryn probably would she held a bit of bread in her hand and nibbled it slowly this was slavebread heavy and dark and not the white bread eaten by the masters myre had said that was all to the good she claimed that the slavebread would make better field rations that it was more nourishing and that it would fill the stomach better maybe she was right it certainly hadnt taken much of it to satisfy the ache in renas stomach and she was finishing the piece lorryn had broken off for her more out of sense of duty than out of hunger the thought of her former slave made her wince with guilt oh ancestors poor myre i hope they didnt catch her i hope if they did she has the wit to claim we coerced her into following him surely myre so clever so resourceful could come up with a way to explain herself hadnt she gotten herself out of every other predicament and surely with two renegades to chase her fathers men would never bother with a mere slave surely surely lorryn opened his eyes i cant find anything out here except a pair of alicorns he said finally theyre young ones so they shouldnt give us any trouble as long as we stay downwind of them alicorns she replied her spirit shrinking a little again despite her earlier burst of confidence the stories shed heard about how fierce the onehorned creatures were had given her nightmares and the little tableau in the portalroom in lord lyons manor had only reinforced those stories arent they supposed to be able to pick up the least little bit of scent but theyre downwind of us he assured her and yawned hugely and i he yawned again and rena saw with concern how exhausted and strained he looked had he slept any more than she had probably not probably not for days lorryn were safe enough here for the moment arent we she asked and at his cautious nod continued well why dont you rest you did all that magicthen weve been walking for leagues he looked as if he would have liked to object but a third yawn overcame him i cant argue were warm and dry and theres no place better to shelter than what weve got at the moment so rest she urged i can watch for trouble ill wake you at the least little hint of it ill just lean back and relax for a little he said putting his pack behind him and suiting his actions to his words i wont sleep ill just rest a little he closed his eyes and as rena had suspected in a moment he was sound asleep she smiled and shook her head how could he have thought he could go on without a rest well it doesnt matter hes getting one now she looked over their primitive shelter and took a mental inventory of the materials at hand if he slept right up until nightfall could she improvise a better shelter out of sticks and leaves shed done things with flowers beforewhy not with leaves experimentally she took a leaf and sculpted it retaining its waterresistant qualities while she spun it out into something a bit flatter and bigger she took a second leaf did the same then tried to see if she could make the two join together to her delight she could i can make a whole canopy of this leaf stuff then get ordinary leaves to stick to the outside so that this will look like a place thats been covered with vines she decided enthusiastically it will probably all wilt in a day or two but by then well be gone she gathered more leaves and began making her green fabric of them fitting leaf to leaf to make a waterproof seal keeping her concentration narrowed in a way she had never been able to achieve when she was just flowersculpting she had so much of her mind fixed to the task in her hands in fact that she ignored everything else right up until the moment that a twig snapped and she looked up into the mad orange eyes of a white alicorn it snorted at her close enough for her to smell its hot breath she froze holding her own breath the long spiral horn rising from the middle of its forehead kept catching her attention as the alicorn watched her it gleamed softly a motherofpearl shaft that started out as thick as her own slender wrist and tapered to a wickedly sharp point the eyes an odd burntorange color like bittersweet berries were huge the pupils dilated the head was fundamentally the same shape as that of a graceful dainty horse but the eyes took up most of the space where brains should have been an overlong supple neck led down to muscular shoulders the forelegs ended in something that was part cloven hoof and part claw the hindquarters were as powerful as the forequarters with feet that were more hooflike a long flowing mane tiny chintuft and tufted tail completed the beast with one small detail which the alicorn displayed as it lifted its lip to sniff her scent inchlong fangs graced that dainty mouth giving the true picture of the beasts nature it was a killer they all were that was why the elves had given up the task of making them into beasts of burden or warsteeds in a moment it would charge her unless she thought of some way of preventing it a crackling of brush made the first alicorn raise its head but not with any alarm in a moment she saw why as the alicorn was joined by itshermate now there was more than double the danger a mated pair tolerated nothing that might be a threat within their territory she couldnt move to wake lorryn she dared not move to take up a weapon herself she had none of the greater magics but perhaps the lesser it was the only weapon in her pitiful arsenal that knack with birds and animals tentatively she reached out to the alicorn with her power using only the gentlest of touches i am your friend i would never harm you i have good things to eat and i know where to scratch the alicorn flicked her ears and her mate raised his head a little to peer more closely at her i am your friend you want to be my friend the alicorns hide shuddered and rena watched in hope and fear as a wave of relaxation made all of its muscles go a bit slack come be my friends both of you her magic drifted into their minds subtle like a whisper changing just a tiny thingthat killer instinct the urge to destroy anything that might prove dangerous their minds werent any smaller than a pigeons or a sparrows there was something there to work on she halfclosed her eyes watching both of them as her magic wove its way into what they were soothing the too sensitive nerves calming the wash of instant and hot emotions the mare took a tentative step toward her the stallion followed carefully rena reached into the pack beside her and took out another piece of bread breaking it in half they didnt react to her movement except for a slightly nervous flicking of their ears i have good things to eat she held out both hands each with a piece of bread in the palm invitingly shed never yet seen a horse that could resist bread the stallions nostrils flared as he took in the scent of the bread and he shouldered the mare aside coming to the fore his eyes fixed first on her then on the bread in her outstretched hand i will make you more good things to eat while she worked her magic in their minds to tame them she could not work another spell but if this actually succeeded she would be able to turn plain grass and leaves into alicorn treats that would be a reasonable recompense for what she wanted out of them come to me come help me and i will give you sweet treats to eat i will keep you warm and dry and i know all the right places to scratch flies will never bite you again she wasnt actually sending thoughts into its mind nor could she sense its thoughts the way lorryn could but her magic carried the promises she made to it and somehow made it understand that and the tiny gentling changes she wrought were all that was needed the alicorn stallion made up his mindnow that she had made it up for him he stepped forward briskly the mare right at his heels and walked calmly right up to the edge of the shelter he bent his long neck and accepted the morsel of bread from her hand his nose soft and velvety against her palm and only the barest hint of the sharpness of his fangs touching her skin a moment later his mate did the same they both stood staring at her for a heartbeat or two longer after the bread was gone she could still lose them they wouldnt attack her now but she could still lose them when she turned her magic loose they could flee well for that matter they could simply walk away and she wouldnt be able to do a thing about it her magic just wasnt coercive either they would serve her or they would not she let go of their minds she had done all that she could if they were going to flee they would do it now with a sigh the stallion folded his long legs and lay down at her feet the mare did the same placing her head in renas lap she looked up at rena with eyes that were more brown now than orange and she waited for rena to make good on her promise of scratches rena stretched out her hand and tentatively began to scratch the area at the base of the horn reckoning that it was one place the alicorn couldnt reach for herself the alicorns coat was just as soft as it looked much silkier than horsehair though a bit longer as well after a moment the stallion stretched his head forward to get his own share of caresses when they both tired of having their horns the area under their chins and their ears scratched rena took leaves and began sculpting them making them tender and enhancing the sugars in them the alicorns accepted these new dainties with greed eating until the area around the shelter had been denuded and their bellies were stuffed full then they both laid their heads in renas lap again and slept one on either side of her for all the world like a pair of huge homed pet hounds and when lorryn woke that was the sight that met his astonished eyes youre sure theyll bear us lorryn asked dubiously it was hard for him to even think of trusting an alicorn their reputation was such that if he hadnt been too stunned to move hed have tried to kill both of these the moment he saw them only renas assurance that she had changed them made himwarilytrust them after all elven lords had tried for centuries to change the alicorns and make them useful so how could rena have done what they could not then again they didnt ask a female to help did they of course not their magics are all weak useless as useless as keeping me from dying of pneumonia rena was a fount and a wellspring of surprises today they were certainly acting tame enough at the moment hed petted and scratched them at renas direction and they had actually behaved as nicely as any horse hed ever owned their coats were extraordinary softer and silkier than any horse and for once in his life hed gotten the chance to touch a stillliving horn it had been warm beneath his tentative caress very much a part of the creature rena shrugged as sure as i can be of anything i wouldnt ask them to behave like a trained horse though they wont take a bit or a bridle and well have to go in the direction they want but theyll take our weight on their backs easily enough i tried with my pack and it didnt bother either of them she patted the mare on the shoulder the beast didnt even move there was a certainty in her words and her actions that hadnt been there before today lorryn thought that over rena had blossomed in the last day into someone he hardly recognized not all that long ago he had wished that she would somehow grow some spine and stop being such a burdenwell perhaps this was a manifestation of the old admonition to be careful what one wished for it had taken this to bring her into her own but to trust her to tame an alicorn was the risk worth the benefits welltheyre faster than we are and they wont leave bootprints he said thinking out loud that alone i think is worth the riskeven if we have to go where they want to and since ive never ever heard of an alicorn trying to invade settled lands at least we wont have to worry about them heading for someone elses estate if youre sure they wont rum on us that is he couldnt help it those orange eyes seemed gentle but could he trust that they would stay that way that horn was as long as his arm and sharp as any spear and hed heard even the foals knew how to use their horns as weapons almost from birth add in the fangs and the foreclaws im sure she said firmly i tamed a shrike once and it was more vicious and had less mind than these do i can do it lorryn its one thing i am completely sure of she had certainly done wonders with her garden full of birds good enough he walked over to the stallion the bigger of the two and cautiously laid a hand on its shoulder it didnt even look up from the pile of grass that rena had pulled and changed for it to eat he hefted his pack in his free hand would it really bear the weight of him and the pack as well put your pack on him first she said just over the shoulders then get on slowly just dont make any moves that might startle him that wasnt going to be easy not without a saddle still he followed her instructions as she draped her own pack over the mares shoulders her pack like his was now arranged so that it was a tube with her gear in equal parts at each end and a flat place in the middle that had been his idea to make it as much like saddlebags as possible staying on bareback would be hard enough theyd never be able to stay on with packs strapped to their backs the stallion looked up craned his long neck around so that he could peer at the pack then resumed eating lorryn put both hands on the stallions warm back just be hind the pack this would be something like one of the exercises hed trained in just slower he only hoped his arms were up to it it was going to be a real strain on his muscles he hoisted himself up with his arms alone moving slowly and leaning his weight onto the alicorns back and slid his leg up over the alicorns rump at the same time he had a bad moment when the stallion jumped slightly and fidgeted as it felt his weight but then the beast settled again and he got his seat thankful hed learned to ride bareback rena was already in place looking uncommonly cheerful considering their current condition she also looked far more alive than hed ever seen her there was a faint rosy flush on her cheeks her green eyes sparkled and even her hackedoff hair looked better fluffed in untidy curls around her face than it had when it was beaded and braided and beribboned it was too bad all those socalled friends of his couldnt see her now theyd never call her plain again she was definitely in her element freedom suited her well have to wait until they finish eating she told him then theyll go wherever it was they were heading in the first place when we caught them she tilted her head to one side are you wearing an illusion she added changing the subject so completely she took him by surprise with a start he realized that he was it had become second nature he nodded i cant remember a moment that ive had it off he told her except very rare times when mother and i were checking to see that it was solid i even have it up sleeping can i see what you look like without it he considered her request and shrugged i dont see why not it took an effort of will to cancel the illusion on himself and he saw from her face that she was disappointed in the result he grinned at her reaction in part because he had expected it sorry little sister no fangs no bulging muscles no horns the best and easiest illusions are always simply enhancements or slight changes in what was already there you know she tilted her head to the other side birdlike and considered him from all angles before she answered him your hair is yellower than any boys ive ever seen except the humans she said at last your ears are blunter and smaller and youre just a bit more muscular but youre still lorryn id still know you anywhere he bowed mockingly exactly so and precisely the point i suspect mother may have worked some of those weak little magics on me as a baby to make the illusion easier to carrylightening my hair for instance and seeing to it i didnt turn into a musclebound gladiator but at just that moment the stallion finished the last scrap of grass and without any warning went from a standstill to a fast walk heading south the mare behind him he lurched onto a deer path with a halfrum as lorryn fought for balance lorryn clung to the slick back wishing the alicorn would at least tolerate some kind of bellyband to give him something to hold on to especially if it was going to move off without warning like that theyre going the way we wanted to rena exclaimed behind him pleased at least she had a little warning theyre also going a lot faster than i thought they would he exclaimed as the stallion moved from a fast walk into an even faster paceit wasnt a trot but it was just as fast as a trot fortunately whatever this gait was the alicorn moved more smoothly than any horse hed ever ridden and from the way it had its ears perked forward its head up and its tail flagged it could probably carry on like this all day if sonothing short of magic would have served as well to get them out of danger magicor maybe a dragon this is amazing he said after a while full of awe no wonder the alicorns were so hard to track and hunt no one had ever described them moving like this why they would be long out of reach before a hound picked up their scent even though the trail itself seemed fresh ive never ridden a beast like this in my life they are lovely arent they rena agreed her voice sounded wistful i wish we could stay with thembut i dont think the changes i made run deep enough to hold if they ever begin to hunt once they taste bloodi have the feeling nothing would keep them tame theres a feeling about that under the surface of them their instincts are very powerful and instincts are the hardest things to change well well have to make certain they dont get any blood he said firmly but that observation set his own thoughts running no matter how grave a situation there was always a stray part of his mind that would analyze everything his ancestors had bred the alicorns as warbeasts it might be that if that part of their nature could be expunged and the taste of flesh eliminated theyd revert to a gentler nature well gentle enough that girls like rena could tame them anyway it would certainly be a fine thing to have a mount like this with its great beauty and easy pace and total lack of any way to control it he reminded himself as the stallion made an abrupt leap over an obstacle across the path jarring him and making him lose his balance and fight to regain it no maybe not he realized a bit later as he ducked a little to avoid a lowhanging branch that the only reason the alicorns didnt absentmindedly scrape them off was purely because of the way they were built their necks were so long that their heads were very nearly even with the ridersand the horn more than made up for the difference anything lorryn would have had to duck under the stallion did too giving him a moment of warning so that he didnt brain himself on a branch if they ever got tired of carrying a rider they would have no problem getting rid of that rider perhaps renas bribery was the only thing keeping them tame ah another good reason to put off domestication they had set off in midafternoon by the time night fell between the mad boat ride and the alicorn trek they would have gotten far beyond where even the wildest estimation of their abilities would have placed them and they were going south into the lands no elven lord had ever set foot on the lands where the dragons and the wizards had supposedly gone that came from more reliable sources than myre it was part of the treaty between the elves and the wizards and in the space of a few hours thanks to rena he was a great deal more optimistic about their chances than he had been this morning he no longer needed to worry where they would find food rena had already proven she could change the leaves of the trees into treats for the alicorns presumably she could make them as nourishing for the riders as well a little bland not at all fete fare but i dont think im going to complain to the cook he could still huntthough on the whole it would probably be better to wait until the alicorns went on their own way before doing so he could sense the minds of even animals which meant he should be able to sense dangerous beasts or pursuit before it got too close even if they didnt find the wizards immediately they were not doing badly for now he reminded himself before he got caught up in unreasoning optimism its barely summer when winter arrives wed better have found the wizards we havent got real shelter and its going to be hard to magic that up out of the wilderness without someone noticing and coming after us im not certain rena can make dead grass or pine needles into anything edible and we dont have warm clothing except for our cloaks he noted something with half of his mind while the rest worried over the problems to come the alicorns had the same effect on forest life that a human or elven hunter would where they passed silence fell evidently they were just as fierce a predator as their reputation made them out to be off in the far far distance he heard birdsong and the occasional animal call but right here along this deer path there was nothing but the dull thudding of hooves on the bare earth and damp leaves we really did it didnt we rena said wonderingly into the silence the stallion flicked its ears at the sound of her voice but did not slacken pace wherever it was going it wanted to get there in a hurry he only hoped that his muscles and renas would be up to a pace like this we really did he called back softly we got away both of us and i couldnt have done it without you im glad you came he hadnt been at the time he hadnt been until the moment she dried his clothing for him cynically he admitted to himself that once she became a benefit to his comfort his attitude had changed but how was he to know that she would be anything other than a burden and something to be protected every step of the way she giggled it was almost me bursting into your room to beg for help last night you know she said unexpectedly he turned his head just enough so that he could look back at her while keeping an eye out for those pesky branches why he asked ii knew there was something besides the fete that had everyone in a state but i didnt know it had anything to do with you they didnt tell you she said astonishment writ large in her wide eyes how could they not tell you father was even letting me sleep late he grimaced lord tylar has never confided anything to me and he has always forbidden the servants to tell me anything he thinks i might object to i assume i would have objected to this i dont know she said hesitantly ii was betrothed to lord gildor last night he almost lost his seat over that gildor he spluttered gildor the brainless wonder gildor who couldnt find hishis behind with both hands and a map gildor the dullard the dolt the incredibly impossibly boring was there another gildor he didnt know about that certainly describes the gildor i saw she agreed and her eyes twinkled now you see why i was so insistent on coming with you and why i told you father would use coercion on me to find out where youd gone id rather face wild alicorns than go into gildors bower he shook his head im not certain this is preferable to marriage to gildor he retorted wondering if his anger at her deception was valid even as the heat rose in him after all he wasnt the one being told to wed gildor please dont be angry with me she pled wilting before the accusation in his eyes it wasnt a lie if he thought i did know he would have used coercion on mebut but its possible given his high opinion of females that it wouldnt even have entered his mind that you would be capable of such a clever deception he thought it over weighed lord tylars wellknown fear in the face of halfbloods with his wellknown contempt of women and concluded she was right not to take the chance ah you were probably right to assume he would anyway he replied and her face lightened hes not exactly rational about halfbloods hell probably be using coercion on every person on the estate thank the ancestors that mother is strong enough to resist him and clever enough to have something to give him that will clear her of guilt he wont dare offend her house by doing away with her as long as she can make it seem she went mad on being told i was halfblooded renas face went deathly pale whats going to happen to her she whispered as if lady viridinas part in all of this had never occurred to her lorryn wished he could be more reassuring but that was difficult on the back of a moving alicorn he tried to give her a smile that would convey the emotion its all right weve planned for this for some time she is going to concoct a false and very clouded memory for falord tylars benefit of the midwifeslave substituting me for a stillborn child you know dont you that he left her alone on the estate for the birth shell let him hear that under a coercive trance let him hear the midwife supposedly using her wizardpowers to make her forget then shell go mad with grief as soon as he wakes her and confronts her with it it was a thin enough story but lady viridina had never ever been suspected of so much as an improper thought by her husband and with the three council members there he would be forced to take it at face value the council lords will insist she be placed in protective isolation of course but that wont be so bad it would be better than death anyway and perhaps it would be better than being subject to her husbands every irrational whim and cruel trick but rena shuddered that means being confined to her bower with slaves watching her day and night she replied i would go mad but i suppose its better than better than the alternative the council will believe it he told her this time quite firm in his conviction ever since the elvenbane appeared theyve been seeing halfbloods under their beds and behind anything that goes wrong im sure theyll find a way to prove that this switchedatbirth nonsense is how dyran ended up with a halfblood as his own heir without ever being aware of the fact oh rena said looking a bit less dubious id forgotten about that actually theyll probably want to believe it and when they get done with him so will father very likely he agreed and mother is clever enough to carry it all off he sniffed its just a good thing they dont have the wizardpowers to read thoughts i hope they never get themselves some kind of tame halfblood then rena replied soberly and oh i hope mother will be all right at least you wont have to marry gildortheidiot he said quickly and got a wan smile in answer yes she got spattered by a shower of drops from a branch above her wiped them away and got back a little more color and a real smile and before you ask believe me life eating leaves in a howling wilderness is much much preferable to that chapter kalamadea and keman simply stood where they were like a pair of perfectly ordinary halfbloods and not a pair of extraordinary shapeshifting dragons what was wrong with them do something shana thought furiously at kalamadea shift fight them he should already have been flinging himself into the sky kalamadea did nothing except to look at her lashana these people are not afraid of magic and they are all carrying very sharp spears spears which may i point out to you will penetrate dragonhide i think shifting would be a very bad idea just at the moment they could certainly use those spears can you think of anything else constructive try as she might she couldnt even a dragon needed a storm to call lightning down out of the sky and the weather wasnt obliging with one perhaps the dragons could use their powers with rock to rum the ground soft beneath their captors feet but an agile warrior could certainly leap free before he was trapped and as for flinging himself into the skywell even a dragon needed time to shift these warriors would certainly react before then it looked as if giving up was their only option at least the warriors had not retaliated for the magical attacks the two wizards had made she stood up slowly and held her empty hands over her head in what she hoped was a universally accepted gesture of surrender mero and the two dragons followed her example it must have been the right thing to do since the warriors relaxed just a trifle although they did not lower their guard or their spearpoints they all stood staring at one another for several moments their captors were a striking people this close it was quite obvious that the dark skin was natural and not a dye or cosmetic their armor was of extremely fine make beautifully finished with firstrate craftsmanship beneath the armor corselets they all wore loose trousers of light brightly colored fabric and halfboots of felt shana wondered how she and her group looked to them finally one of the warriors said something to shana directly very slowly in a complex and musical tongue it sounded from the inflection as if it was a question she glanced over at kalamadea who shrugged it isnt a language i understand he said softly she turned to the warrior who had spoken and made a cautious gesture of apology sorry im afraid we dont speak your language the warrior muttered something his tone conveying his frustration and after a brief conference with his fellows gestured with his spearpoint nodding at the wagons below that was clear enough he wanted them to go down to the wagons presumably without making any more trouble i think wed better do as he wants shana mero said uncomfortably we might get a chance to explain ourselves later since there didnt seem to be any choice in the matter shana nodded then turned and headed down the slope of the ridge in the direction hed indicated leaving her gear on the ground where shed left it after a moment the others followed she glanced behind briefly and saw that two of the warriors had snatched up the discarded gear and slung it across the backs of their bulls before mounting up again all of the warriors took to their bulls before following the prisoners shana didnt think it would be a good idea to try and test the agility of the cattle by trying to escape cattle werent horses but shed already seen how agile these beasts were and over a short distance there was no way a human would outrun one curious eyes followed them down the slope of the ridge although no one stopped to question any of the warriors whod captured them the dark people had a very simple solution for the keeping of prisoners it seemed the warriors took them directly to a particular wagon the driver stopped it briefly while someone produced a set of iron collars and chains from within and they were all chained by the neck to the back of the wagon itself that was all there was to it but it proved to be very effective the collars were too well made to break the locks too intricate for either shana or mero to pick and both of them discovered to their complete astonishment that elven magics would not work on the collars at all they could still speak mind to mind thank goodness but at least as far as shana and mero were concerned the collars themselves were impervious to tampering the oxen kept up a slow pace but it was a very steady one they simply never stopped that too was an effective means of keeping them from causing trouble it wasnt hard to keep up with the wagon but that was all one could do even when shana and her group had been scouting theyd taken frequent breaks she and mero were not used to this kalamadea and keman didnt have much problem with the steady walking but mero and shana were tired and footsore by the end of the day when the nomads finally made camp if circumstances had been otherwise shana would have admired the efficiency of the nomads arrangements the wagons were pulled into a formation of several concentric circles and the wheels staked down the oxen were unhitched and taken to the common herd fire pits were carved out of the sod and cleared out down to the bare earth and that was all there was to it this was all done with the ease of something that was more than habit it was custom once camp was set up people could get about with doing their chores fetching water starting fires cooking the lot as it was shana was too busy sitting in the grass and rubbing her sore feet and calves to offer much in the way of admiration i hope someone remembers us and brings us food and water she thought forlornly not that she and mero couldnt both fetch for themselvesor at least she hoped they could it would be pretty rotten if all of the magic they knew was no longer working but she wasnt certain she wanted these people to know everything the four of them could donot yet anyway sunset was approximately an hour or so away and it was pretty clear that no one was going to even approach the prisoners without permission from some authority people would glance at them covertly but without wasting time to gawk and without interrupting whatever chore they were engaged in shana began to wonder if she and her group were going to be left all night chained like dogs to the tail of the wagon but it seemed that their original captors were not yet done with them six of the warriors appeared from between two of the wagons finally and marched purposefully toward them all four of them got to their feet warily as the six surrounded their prisoners just as warily so at least they think we might be dangerous i wish i knew if that was good for us or bad one of the dark peopleshana thought it might have been the one whod led the group that captured themunfastened all four of the chains and marched off with the four prisoners exactly as if they were his pets and he was taking them for a walk the other five warriors following with their spears at the ready made certain of the captives obedience the one with the chains did not however try to pull them along too quickly or torment them in any other ways it was all very brisk and businesslike quite impersonal without malice the camp was full of all of the normal noise and activity of any large group of humans although the language was nothing but sheerest babble to shana children dressed in short tunics of the same brightly colored fabric as the warriors trousers shrieked in shrill voices and played incomprehensible games that involved a great deal of running and shouting women in loose comfortable robes or wrapped skirts and men in more of the loose trousers walked by with burdens pausing to stare at the captives with curious wide brown eyes women nursed babies stirred pots suspended over fires or laid out bedding and clothing to air in the last of the sunlight young men idled about shoved each other and laughed young women pretended to ignore them and giggled together behind their hands there were no animals in the camp at all however and no sign of any other beasts than the cattle that seemed odd shana would have expected that they would at least have dogs the closer they got to the center of the encampment the larger more elaborate and more decorated the tentwagons became finally they reached the center and a set of four wagons that were the fanciest of the lot it must have taken teams of ten or twelve oxen to pull these monstrosities presumably these belonged to the leaders of this group of people shana noted that the four tents were set at the precise compass points they were taken to the easternpoint tent there was a clever set of folding stairs at the side of the wagon now unfolded that gave access to the tent door the man holding their chains climbed up it leading them the same way the other five stayed behind on the ground beside the wagon there was an extension of the flat bed of the wagon that formed a kind of porch all around the tent wide enough for them all to stand together on with the warrior holding their chains about an arms length away he paused at the entrance and called something from within someone raised the flap of the tent and they all paraded inside the tent was very dark after the bright sunlight outside it took a little time for shanas eyes to adjust when they did she saw that they had been brought before an older man whose closecropped hair showed a few threads of gray in it and whose many scars attested to the fact that he was no stranger to combat he had a rather square stern face and was as muscular as any gladiator although like many retired gladiators he had gone just a trifle to fat around the midsection he wore an iron torque iron bracers and a belt made of flat round iron plates cleverly hinged together all of this jewelry was elaborately engraved in abstract designs his eyesearingly scarlet trousers rather clashed with the orange and green cushions he reclined on there were two warriors standing on either side of him faces as impassive as statues and two more on either side of the tent entrance he studied all four of them for a very long time giving shana equal time to study their surroundingswhich she did making her study obvious as if she were here by choice the interior of the tent had been draped with appliqued hangings the floor covered with fine handwoven rugs both echoed the same abstract designs shana had seen in the rest of the camp there were lamps hanging from the ceiling too although they were not yet lit she had to wonder where these people got the metal the fabric and the wool for these things since there obviously werent any sheep around and nomads didnt normally operate mines surely they traded for itperhaps with collen he hadnt said anything about black herders but why should he he had no reason to disclose all his secrets to her especially not if he intended to trade wizardgoods to these folk and vice versa if that was sosince collen would be coming back down the river again after trading with the bondlings might they be heading for a meeting with him she hoped so he might be able to persuade these people to let the four of them goor at least to negotiate for a ransom their captor and the leader spoke at some length with a great many gestures and hand signals the leader went silent for a moment then barked an abrupt command and hangings behind him parted another warrior entered with two more prisoners similarly collared and leashed shanas eyes nearly popped out of her head with surprise as soon as she saw them and the other three had similar reactions elves they have elves as prisoners so it seemed since there was no mistaking elves for anything else slender bodies pale porcelain skin whitegold hair long pointed ears and those green catpupiled eyes the new captives couldnt be anything else both of them wore the clothing of their captors and neither of them seemed to be suffering any mistreatment though shana could not think if that was a good sign or a bad one but what were elves doing hereand more important how had these people managed to capture them like us maybe could it be possible these two came out here without human fighters to protect and guard them one of the prisoners ignored them but the others eyes widened as he took in the sight of them ancestors he exclaimed tell me you arent what i think you are then he shook his head sardonically never mind you couldnt be anything but halfbreeds to think ive fallen to this the leader of their captors interrupted him with a barked command he shut up immediately bowed soberly and with every outward evidence of humility and turned back to shana it seems were to be your translators wizard he told her with a sour twist to his mouth count yourselves damned lucky we didnt have anyone to translate for us and we had to learn everything the hard way his expression was a strange mixture of sardonic amusement and distaste much as i hate to admit this to a wizardyou are at least halfcivilized and it has been so long since i have seen a civilized creature i would be prepared to befriend even a bondling slave at this point now bow nicely to jamal hes the chief of these barbarians and he is very important they call themselves the iron people by the way shana and the others bowed as gracefully as they could encumbered as they were by their collars and chains their translator took a certain amount of amusement out of that the silent one ignored it all you might as well call me kelyan my titles such as they were hardly mattered a bean back home and theyre nothing here my sullen companion is haldor he poked the other with an elbow haldor looked up at them briefly and grunted shana keman mero and kalamadea shana introduced pointing to each of them in rum and watching jamal out of the corner of her eye he was listening and she didnt think that much got past those sharp eyes without being noted jamal wants to know where you come from kelyan continued thats his first question shana thought fast she didnt want to inadvertently lead these warriors anywhere near the citadel north she said briefly waving in that general direction the river that was a lot of territoryvague enough to be useless as a direction specific enough that if these iron people did trade with collen the direction might ring a bell kelyan translated jamal pondered the answer and barked another question he wants to know why you were here a sardonic smile he assumes that you are spies of course hes a war chief its his job to be suspicious the truth would serve the best looking for people to trade with she said trying to look clever and harmless we arent warriorswell look at our hands if you dont believe me therere no scars or swordcalluses we trade thats how we get what we need and were always looking for new people to trade with laying it on a bit thick arent you kalamadea asked kelyan snorted disbelief but translated anyway jamal made a bark of equal disbelief and said something else something long and complicated kelyan nearly choked his companion haldor looked completely disgusted he wants to know why you paleskin demons have taken to trade instead of warfare kelyan said unbelievable he thinks you halfbreeds are really elves before shana could say anything kelyan turned back to jamal chattering at high speed apparently just as eager to convince the iron chief that they were not elves as shana was jamal however was not going to be convinced he kept pointing at shanas ears and eyes and no matter what kelyan told him he clearly didnt believe it finally he shook his head and rattled out a series of orders youre going to be imprisoned with us kelyan said with resignation as haldor looked even more disgusted than before he wants the iron priest to have a look at youmeanwhile youre going in with us ah well at least youll be someone to talk to before he could finish two more warriors came from outside the tent and picked up the chains to lead them all away kelyan and haldor were taken out first the second warrior led out shana and her group a spectacular sunset painted the western sky in colors as vivid as the colors of the clothing about them as the warriors took them all to another wagontent this one just outside the innermost circle one that bore no decorations at all at the entrance the warriors suddenly dropped the chains and walked off leaving the six of them alone haldor turned his back on all of them and climbed into the tent kelyan seemed disposed to continue talking to them at least pick up your chain he directed and come on inside weve got food and water and the chiefs servants will be bringing more later and dont even bother to think about using that as a weapon and making a run for it he added as shana hefted her chain experimentally these people all learn to fight with chainweapons from the time they can crawl theyll have you before you get more than two circles away by leaving you here theyve signified that you are on your own recognizance and you have the freedom of the camp but if you try to escape believe me youll regret it sounds as if you learned from experience mero ventured as kelyan climbed the narrow stairs into the wagon kelyan waited until they were all inside before answering lets just say that ive seen what they can do he said as haldor flung himself down on a pallet with his back to them the inside of this wagon was furnished simply but with surprising comfort pallets cushions and piles of blankets and spare clothing in baskets all arranged around the edge of the round tent a lantern iron of course hung from the center and there was an iron brazier in a flat box of sand in the middle of the tent below it kelyan helped himself to a cushion and sat down on it inviting them with a gesture to do the same mero was the first to take the invitation sitting himself down next to the elven lord with a defiant air you seem very friendly towards us mero said with heavy irony i have to wonder what your motive is theres not a lot of love between your kind and mine id give a great deal to know how you ended up out here kelyan shrugged it hardly matters whether you lot are wizards or elves does it it doesnt matter what i am either were not home any of us were all prisonersand if you have half the powers your type is supposed to at least you can take some of the burden of entertaining these barbarians off the backs of myself and my companion haldor grunted but kept his back to them entertaining keman asked puzzled how we arent musicians or anything follow us later and youll see kelyan advised and turned back toward mero ill tell you the truth because i dont have a thing to gain by lying to you were both useless second sons of hangerson the most we can do is make pretty illusions we went off looking for something to make our fortunes with and this is what we found he gestured at his collar and chain weve been prisoners here for decades no one knows where we are and if they knew they wouldnt care speak for yourself haldor growled the first time hed actually said anything you can live in a constant daydream of being rescued by an army but i have better things to do kelyan snapped and turned back to mero right now im just happy to see someone with a veneer of civilization someone who might be able to tell me whats been going on without me back home he glanced over his shoulder at haldor someone who can speak my tongueand is willing to do so his expression took on an unmistakable air of hunger i want news im starved for news of home you wont like it shana warned kelyan grimaced probably not but then you never know its been a long time since i left you might tell me thatoverbearing brute lord dyran got skewered by an alicorn or something and that would make me very happy hes half the reason i ended up out here at the mention of dyrans name both shana and mero started and kelyan flashed an unexpected smile you know him so something did happen to the boor how pleasant i hope it was nasty itwas shana managed its very complicated though it will take a while in the telling let me just savor the moment then and give you some useful information while i do so kelyan smiled again the satisfied smile of a child surprised with a sweetmeat you know for my supposedly deadliest enemies im beginning to like you four quite a bit nowto begin with these people are the ones the oldest chronicles refer to as the grelriders although they havent seen a grel for a century or more ah kalamadea nodded satisfied i thought they might be they certainly match what was written first a piece of really important information they have something and i do not know what it is that makes them immune to magic so dont bother trying anything on them at shanas grimace he nodded i see you already discovered that the hard way she agreed rubbing her arms at least they didnt attack back so i suppose were lucky he laughed oh theyre utterly contemptuous of our magic they have legends of it but meeting with us has convinced them that the legends of truly powerful mages are exaggerations illusions do not deceive them unless it is an illusion of something that they expect to see and dont pay too much attention toah he thought for a moment for instance if one of them looked into this tent i could spin an illusion of jamal sitting here until i was blue and they would still see mebut if i happened to manage to get into jamals tent and sit on his couch of state they would believe it was jamal there unless they looked at me very hard which means theres no point in trying to make them think were oxen or invisible and trying to escape that way keman finished for him he nodded magical weaponslevinbolts and the likealso do not work on them right now they are all very much on edge and nervous because this is all foreign territory to them they normally live hundreds of leagues south of here but there has been a fiveyear drought in the south and theres nothing for the cattle to graze on down there they live by their herds nearly everything they have or use comes from the cattle they dont understand whats causing the drought and that makes them nervous as well theyre afraid that their ancestorspirits are angry with them and nothing i can say seems to make any sense to them may i assume you do know the cause of the drought kalamadea hazarded gently i can guess kelyan told him with some evidence of interest that fool dyran started meddling with the weather long before i was born and convinced everyone else to give it a trynow theres no such thing as normal weather anymore that was what ruined my family what used to be a very nice little manor ended up flooded so often it turned into a swamp and now its nothing but swamp and rain forest and that was probably no accident if someone in your family managed to get on dyrans wrong side mero put in with a glower the flash of anger in kelyans eyes would have been answer enough but he nodded to confirm meros guess well if too much rain has ended up there it stands to reason the water had to come from somewhere else kalamadea nodded but said nothing this arrangement of four tents in the center of the camp is very important kelyan went on the easternmost is jamalshes the war chief the westernmost belongs to the iron priest do not no matter what go into the northern and southern tents unless and until a priest takes you there those are sacred to the spirits and they will beat you to within an inch of your life if you desecrate the tents then theyll make you go through a ritual of purification that will make you wish they had beaten you to death he looked so grim when he said that shana had to wonder if hed learned that the hard way too a woman appeared at the entrance to the tent with a flat basket of finely woven grass kelyan rose immediately and took it from her bringing it back to the center of the group are you eating he called over his shoulder to haldor as he sat down haldor shook his head kelyan shrugged your loss he waved a hand at the basket it contained a pile of flat white rounds strips of what appeared to be grilled meat onions a set of round cups and a skin and a bowl with something white in it the flat things are bread more or less the strips are beef and they are tasty enough but tough theres butter in the bowl and the skin is full of fresh milk youll get flatbread and cheese in the morning and more milk he reached for a round of bread deftly wrapped it around a strip of meat and onion and poured himself a cup of milk down south they had beer made from barley but the barley ran out a while ago i dont know what theyll do up here before the drought the food was better than this there were farmers to trade with more variety he raised an eyebrow at shana who was juggling a hot strip of meat from hand to hand i dont suppose that drivel about wanting to trade happened to be true by any stretch of the imagination well she said getting the meat into the bread and blowing on her fingers to cool them as it happens it was wethe wizards i meanhad another confrontation with the elven lords this time the ending was a bit more on our side and the trucetreaty specified we could come down here and settle unmolested we have things we can trade and its easier to trade for things than use up magic creating them not that too many of us can create things but let him think we can like the greater elven lords hmm he said nothing more but ate quickly and neatly and washed his meal down with the milk shana did the same finding that the fare was not at all badalthough she could see that it would be very easy to tire of it quickly kalamadea and mero took more time with their meal as she and keman sketched in as much as they knew of the time that kelyan and haldor had missed i always figured that they couldnt possibly be getting rid of all of you halfbreeds he commented when they got to the second wizard war there are just too many accidents too many times that a concubine or a human fieldslave happens to be fertile when her lord takes a fancy to her and i figured that the results were being left out on the edge of the forest or something of the like theres always been rumors of halfbreeds in the forest living wild as wolves i cant say it surprises me since he was being so frank shana decided to return the favor your entire attitude towards us surprises me she told him i cant understand why you arentwelllike lord dyran because im not like lorddamneddyran he replied fiercely very few of those of us on the bare edges of society are at all like the high lords have you any notion of what its like to be elven and yet have next to no magic she shook her head dumbly i have mero put in quietly both shana and kelyan turned to look at him after all i spent most of my life in dyrans manor shana the elves base everything on how much magic a person commands if you have a lot you have everything if you dontwell ive seen slaves treated better than some of dyrans pensioners kelyan nodded bitterly and even haldor seemed to be listening and not ignoring them at least the slaves have set duties mero continued they arent expected to perform miracles with nothing and they arent punished or ridiculed when they cant make those miracles happen the slaves are ignored which is better than being watched when the watcher is someone like dyran i saw him set one of his overseers an impossible task make him work to exhaustion then accuse him of shirking and as punishment order an arranged marriage for the fellows daughter with another of his underlings who waswell just vile i watched him drive another quite mad then order his wife be taken away and given to someone else as a lady and at least the slaves of someone like dyran have mercifully short lives compared to the elven lords a pensioner can look forward to centuries of that kind of treatment kelyan nodded all through meros explanation exactly right halfbreed he paused and tilted his head in inquiry sorry ive forgotten your name youre very quiet mero the wizard supplied and smiled they called me shadow i am very good at making myself ignored kelyan gave him a nod of acknowledgment mero then yes exactly right there were plenty of dyrans slaves who would look at me with pity in their eyesand my father too before he worked himself into a premature senility he sighed well needless to say there areor at least there were when last i walked civilized landsplenty of younger elves who would be only too happy to find a way to limit the high lords magic and given enough time to think about it there are probably any number of them who could find it in their hearts to sympathize with the wizards and actually now that ive had a taste of being a slave myself i even find it in my heart to sympathize with the humans he quirked another of his ironic smiles at least dyran met a nasty end i will sleep very peacefully tonight knowing that he would have said more but another of the warriors appeared at the door to the tent pushing the flap aside and gesturing peremptorily kelyan made a face and got to his feet prodding haldor with a toe come on old thing he said with resignation time for our performances our masters are awaiting us haldor just grunted again got to his feet gathered up his chain and followed kelyan out want to watch shana said to mero in an undertone i really have got to see what it is theyre doing especially if were going to be expected to do the same he shook his head ill go with you keman offered ill stay with mero kalamadea said you two go see what you can see well see if we can come up with any plans shana didnt need a second invitation she gathered up her chain and followed the two elves keman on her heels just as kelyan had told her no one tried to prevent either of them from following the two elves as long as it was obvious they were not trying to escape the elves didnt go far only to about the third circle their destination was a tenta real tent and not a tentwagon the kind shana remembered the caravantraders using only much much bigger she reflected that it must have taken a dozen people working together to put this up as they neared it colored lights played on the tent walls from inside and music drifted through the quiet night air the elves went inside shana and keman followed them they stopped just inside the tent flap which was tied open inside it had been furnished much like jamals tent there were painted hangings decorating some of the walls rugs forming a floor and large piles of cushions for people to sit or recline on at one end was a group of musicians at the other someone dispensing food and drink servers brought both to the men and women who were dispersed about the tent most of them had the look of fighters most were relatively young some sat or reclined eating talking or playing games of chance some danced to the tune the musicians played but most were drifting toward the musicians end of the tent where the elves had just arranged themselves what do you suppose theyre up to shana wondered aloud i havent a clue keman told her but we ought to see if we cant get nearer they worked their way through the crowd carefully trying to attract no attention to themselves they managed to get into a corner where they had a good view but were out of the way the musicians finished their current piece and stopped clearly waiting for the elves to settle themselves there were six musicians two drummers two with string instruments one with a horn and one with something shana couldnt identify kelyan took a comfortable position and nodded to the head musician the one with the horn who started a new piece he played the first phrase alone and the others joined in after a few beats that was when shana understood why the riders were so intent on keeping the elves as their captives kelyan spun a complicated illusion of fantastic birds and creatures with the bodies of lithe young females and males but with butterfly wings he danced them around each other in time to the music to the evident pleasure of the watching riders it wasnt a very good illusion the birds and butterflycreatures were quite transparent easy to see through impossible to believe in but as an artistic piece and as entertainment it was excellent certainly it was something the riders would never have been able to produce for themselves when the piece ended the illusion faded haldor sat up face full of resignation as the next piece began his illusion like kelyans was a frail thing and quite transparent but his tiny horses of flame darting and rearing and galloping in the air were quite mesmerizing to watch shana tapped keman on the elbow and inclined her head toward the less crowded part of the tent as haldors piece ended he nodded agreement and they made their way to the end nearer the open doorway before you aski cant work any magic on the collar itself and im not certain i can shift keman said quietly kalamadea and i have tried i think it may be something in the collars she made a face of distaste well the elves manage it i dont see why these people couldnt too oh fire and blast it at least none of them know our tongue its easier talking man thinking at you we are going to have to convince this jamal that we arent fullblood elves and we cant do illusions keman continued urgently otherwise theyll have us sitting there making butterflies and flowers for the rest of our lives unless collen runs into them and arranges a trade or a ransom oryes well that isnt very likely at the moment she chewed her lip lets sit here and watch the people for a while maybe we can find out more about them something useful they didnt learn much except that the riders worked the elves to sheer exhaustionand that both haldor and kelyan grew depleted of magic and weary a great deal faster than either shana or mero would have under the same conditions even then the riders didnt seem disposed to let the elves go for the evening instead they were plied with food and drink allowed to rest for a bit then put back to work this did not bode well for the four of them if ever the riders discovered their real abilities jamal would not want to let them go ever it was interesting though that although the warriors did not wear their armor here they did retain their iron neckpieces and armbands and sometimes added a browband as well the women wore truly exquisite jewelry of black filigree some of it faceted and polished in places until it sparkled like gemstones all of the people here favored bright costumes of light flowing fabrics oranges reds and golden yellows in more elaborate versions of the garments shana had already seen them wearing during the day whos that keman whispered suddenly as there was something of a stir at the entrance to the tent she peered through the halflit darkness and made out a familiar face among the crowd pushing in through the entrance thats jamal she whispered back as the war chief and his entourage were offered a hastily vacated set of cushions by those who had scrambled to their feet but whos that beside him an older man with the physique of a blacksmith his short hair as white as sheeps wool had entered at nearly the same time with his own entourage while jamals followers were all clearly warriors though none of them actually carried weapons here this mans followers were all of his type they all wore an odd headdress of folded fabric and all wore spotless leather aprons they differed from jamals group in one other striking way they all wore iron torques from which a stylized flameshape was hung as a pendant formed out of the same filigree as the womens jewelry dont know keman answered but he seems to be just as important as jamal indeed there were as many people waiting to talk to the older man or hastening to serve him he and his entourage got the same deferential treatment shana didnt detect any open animosity between the two groups but she thought there was a certain undercurrent of tension when the two men glanced at each other if she were to hazard a guess about it shed say that the iron people had two leaders not one and that this older man was the second of them and that it was just possible that neither of them was entirely happy about sharing power well that was interesting it might be useful too if there was some rivalry there it might just be possible to exploit it the first thing to do was to find out just what exactly the function of this older man was then she could see if there was some way to use one of them as leverage against the other she turned her attention back to jamal studying him further he was the younger of the two and might be the more flexible and forwardthinking it might be best to appeal to him rather than to the older man hes watching us keman whispered urgently the old man hes watching us she transferred her gaze quickly the old man was watching them both closely eyes narrowed even as she looked he turned his head slightly aside to talk to one of his followers never taking that speculative regard off of them i wish i knew what he was saying keman muttered to her she nodded there was a great deal of intelligence in that mans face something about the determined set of his mouth and chin told her he would be a bad man to cross he would take his time about a solution to the problem you represented and when he had his solution he would methodically and thoroughly implement it and she could not tell what she and keman meant to him now more than ever she cursed the ability these people possessed that enabled them to keep her out of their minds i wish she replied fervently that i knew what he was thinking where did these new greeneyed demons spring from first iron priest diric asked one of the acolytes in an aside he took care to show none of his displeasure in his expression but he made it very clear in his tone of voice and more to the point why was i not informed of their capture lord as to the first i was told that they were caught spying upon the wagons this afternoon the acolyte replied keeping his voice down and cultivating a pleasant tone as if he spoke of nothing consequential at all as to the second lord i cannot tell you i only heard of them this very evening diric raised an eyebrow both at the words and at the precautionary tone of voice and took a sip of his beer savoring it carefully only he and jamal received beer there wasnt a great deal of it left and there was no more barley to brew more somewhere somehow the forge clan of the iron people were going to have to find farmers to trade with the people were running short of all manner of grain and grain products in a month or so there would not even be flour for bread for that matter they would have to find supplies of iron ore or better yet iron ingots the last farmers they had found to trade with had been clustered in a village six months travel behind themthe last miners nearly a year in their wake the forges had not been unpacked for far too long the warbulls would need horntips soon surely the women were already complaining that they needed new jewelry but jamal did not seem particularly interested in finding miners or farmers with whom to trade he seemed much more intent on finding someone to fight it was a good thing that the land itself had conspired against this particular plan the people could not have sustained a war with supplies in their current state the only creatures they had encountered on this endless grassplain were alicorns and these new greeneyed demons of which no one bothered to inform me until i saw them myself when i entered the gathertent he had a sour taste in his mouth that the beer could not remove and a bitter taste in his mind when he considered his war chief jamal was ambitious he had known that from the start the war chief had made no attempt to cloak that ambition and indeed most war chiefs were ambitious diric himself had outlived three of themambition was a good thing in a leader whose functions were all of aggression and defense but jamal was also popular and that was beginning to worry diric the fact that he had been able to convince his followers to conceal the existence of these new greeneyed demons was very disturbing he cast a veiled glance at the war chief who reclined at his ease and watched with a paternal smile on his lips while the unmated danced and disported with one another he had heard rumors that jamal had greater ambitions than any other war chief in dirics memory those rumors spoke of jamals dream of returning to the homelands laden with booty to unite all of the iron clans under his sole leadership no one had ever done that before the only body with any authority between the iron clans were the priests who oversaw disputes and made all needed arrangements whenever two or more clans gathered together never had any two clans agreed on a single leader before much less all the clans together had it been anyone else diric would have dismissed the ambition with a snort as idle dreaming the trouble was jamal was just charismatic enough to carry the plan off if he returned with the wagons groaning with foreign booty his chances of success were very good and then what need would he have of the iron priests diric asked himself knowing what the answer would be none of course and if he coveted the power held by other war chiefs how much more must he covet that held by the priests diric had not realized how much power the war chief already held until this very evening it had happened before of course that he did not hear of something until it happened to suit his rivalbut it had never happened with something as important as the capture of these greeneyed demons the original two demons had been caught in the days of dirics fathers father and were the forge clans treasured possessions until that time the fearsome pointyeared paleskins had been deemed only legends the kind of creature one frightened a disobedient child with diric knew the legends better than anyone else it was his job after all to remember them and recount them so that the iron people never forgot them the legends told of a great war with these demons who entered the world through a door between this world and their own the demons had coveted this worldhow not after alland had killed and harried the ancestors and their former allies the com people until the iron people were forced to flee into the south with their herds leaving their allies to hold the demons back so that they could escape only the cattle had survived that flight there had been another sort of beast commonly ridden by the warriors and used as a pack animal but these had not been able to bear up to the stresses of the flight or the hotter and wetter climate of the south in time the ancestors learned the twin secrets of the magicmetal and the mindwall and the few demons that followed after them were defeated and slaughtered the legends spoke of the contempt of the people and of the god the first smith for these cowardly demons who employed weapons that revealed that cowardice weapons that killed at no risk to the wielder but no one had believed in the legends of greeneyed demons except the priestsuntil these two had appeared the war chief of the time had made much of the fact that he had captured the terrible demons and enslaved them for the entertainment of the people but dine knew these two haldor and kelyan very well and he knew they had been little or no threat to a wellarmored warrior they were children youngsters on some kind of impulsive excursion and as unprepared for the iron people as the people were unprepared for them the accepted story of the encounter was that the magics of iron and the mindwall discipline had protected war chief alaj and had made it possible for him to overpower them diric had a rather different view of the encounter those two haldor and kelyanthey were not and are not as fearsome as their legended ancestors their powers are nothing like the powers those demons were said to call upon now either the legends greatly exaggerated those powers or these two were simply weaker diric was inclined to think the latter in general the legends as he had studied them made very few mistakesthey had not exaggerated the danger of the onehorns for instance nor their suicidal ferocity so why should the danger represented by the greeneyed demons be any less than the legends painted it by this point most of the people took the former view however they were used to having haldor and kelyan running tame about the camp and making their pretty illusions whenever the gathertent went up diric had not been particularly worried about that until now he had assumed that the iron people would never again encounter their old foes now he was not so sure and he feared that complacency could be a danger in itself he studied the two new demons they looked back at him boldly making no pretense but that they in turn were studying him there were two of them a male and a female and he was told by his whispering acolyte that there were two more males back in the prisoners wagon interesting that one was a female even more interesting that they did not seem to be quite the same breed as the original two they were darker for one thing the skins of haldor and kelyan remained white as a dead fishs belly no matter how much sun beat down upon them they were not nearly so fraillooking for another their hair was of colors and not like hanks of bleached linen fibers the females a brilliant scarlet was clearly the envy of many of the unmated women in the gathertent the males was a proper dark color although it hung sadly straight and did not wind tightly in proper curls then again the corn people were said to be as pale and colorless as the corn they grew could these new demons be only halfdemon could the demons have mated with corn people to produce these creatures odd the females hair he muttered to haja the acolyte i have never seen hair of that color they claim they are not demons at all but creatures of another sort haja replied softly our demons say that this is the truth in fact kelyan was quite argumentative about it and haldor was clearly insulted by the very notion i do not recall them ever reacting so strongly to anything before diric raised an eyebrow there would be no advantage that he could see for kelyan to claim that these creatures were something other than his own kind interesting are they to be housed permanently with the others he asked taking care that his voice did not carry beyond hajas ears so i have been told the acolyte replied it seems logical two of them did not fare well walking behind a wagon there is no reason to kill them with exhaustion when they make such good trophies but equally no reason to house them separately from the other two kelyan and haldor have made not one successful attempt at escape and jamal does not think that the addition of four more demons will make escape any more likely much as he hated to admit it jamal was probably right if magicmetal and mindwall had held the demons until now it should keep holding them i believe i will speak with them myself he told his acolyte tomorrow while we are on the march see to it haja bowed slightly there should be no difficulty he replied diric smiled slightly and see to it that jamal does not hear of it he added at least not until after the fact hajas eyes widened just a trifle and so did his smile the acolyte had been trying to warn diric for many moons now that jamal was too clever too ambitious and diric had apparently dismissed his warnings in actuality diric had given them some thought but he had not yet been convinced that jamal was a real hazard yes he said softly as haja nodded imperceptibly in jamals direction i believe that our war chief may be harboring other thoughtsthoughts that the first smith might not approve of the time may be coming when actions should be taken i will meditate upon the subject haja nodded in the meantime diric concluded sitting back on his own cushions with an air of relaxation he in no way felt you might go ascouting yourself and see if there are other demons where these sprung fromor perhaps a sign of our ancient allies the com people this would be priestly business of course it would be better if the war chief were not to hear of things wherein he has no lawful concern such as the questioning of demons haja asked with a smile and the scouting for corn people after all demons are rightly the business of the priests and the corn people are only legend which is also the business of the priests exactly so diric told him exactly so myre circled above the wooded hills too high in the sky for anyone below to see her real shape and fumed as she circled no sign not one single sign of lorryn and renaand she had only herself to blame that they had eluded her she was the one who had suggested escaping by water when the boat lurched forward so unexpectedly and threw her out she had been so stunned by the shock and the impact that she didnt even react to save herself until it was well out of sight then and only then did the shouts and arrows of the elves on the bank awaken her to the fact that she was in a certain amount of danger as the current carried her downstream she reacted immediately she took a deep breath dove under the water to escape the arrows falling around her and shifted once she was there into the form of a huge whiskerfish once safely in a form that could breathe water rather than air she set out in hot pursuit with great driving thrusts of her tail but that boat had been much faster than any fish that ever swam she didnt catch up to it for more than a day and by the time she found it a bare hour ahead of an elven pursuit party it was drifting and empty there was no sign of where it might have gone ashoreif there ever had been the rain had wiped such traces out completely she made a guess then and took to the skies but that had not been a particularly clever move either she was used to the barren scrubcovered hills around the lairs not these hills with trees so thick you could not see the ground beneath them why even a dragon in his proper form could skulk for furlongs beneath these trees and never fear being spotted from above still she circled for days hoping for a stroke of luck the betraying smoke from a campfire a single track of a shod foot in the mud of a stream bank but every sign proved to be made either by lone hunters or by more searchers sent to recapture lorryn and his sister and her temper frayed and snapped a dozen times over she managed to assuage some of her rage in huntingalicorns were particularly thick here and it was almost as satisfactory to break their necks as it would have been to snap the neck of that fool lorryn in desperation although she was certain that the two soft pampered creatures could not possibly have gotten beyond the immediate vicinity of the river she increased her range she saw nothing nothing whatsoever except for a group of ragged humans making their way along the river in crude boats whatever they were those humans were not wizards and myre doubted that either rena or lorryn would even have attempted contact with them assuming the humans themselves permitted such contact if they were wild humans uncollared then they certainly must fear the elves neither child was woodswise enough to hide an approach from feral humans who were used to living in these forsaken forests it was far more likely that these humans would evade the two runaways before lorryn and his sister even guessed they were there still perhaps she should take a closer look at them she circled again noting those same humans putting in at a point along the bank no sign of alarm there not a chance they had encountered the fugitives she ground her teeth together in fruitless rage she might as well admit it she had lost them and with them had gone her chance for her own captive wizard she had been so certain that she was in complete control of the escape that she had not anticipated that lorryn might do something unexpected and now thanks to that carelessness she had lost them she happened to look down at just that momentand even to an idle eye it was obvious that the little party of humans had suddenly and inexplicably doubled now what was this her rage evaporated and she sharpened her gaze focusing in on the group below nothe humans had not multiplied they had been joined by another group much better clad myres wingbeats faltered for a moment as she caught sight of forms much like shanas pointed earsbut dark complexions and hair in more colors than pale blond these were no humansthese were wizards i she had found the missing wizards and where the wizards wereso were the renegade dragons quickly she spiraled up until she reached a space above the clouds so high that the air was thin and hard to breathe and ice crystals formed on the tips of her wings now what she knew where the wizards weresurely surely she could use that somehow couldnt she she needed information and she needed to get it without a chance that she might be caught by keman or any of the others in short she needed a plan and this time she had better not underestimate anyone or anything this time her plan must be perfect and for a perfect plan she needed information but information was easy to gather so long as she stayed away from her fellow dragons she could shift into any one of hundreds of shapes to spy on the wizards anything from a human child to a rock formation so long as no dragon saw her she should be safe from detection well her first shape should be something with a good noseand inedible all those creatures living together should be easy to scent but she didnt want to find herself the target of some hunters arrows while she searched for them her mind made up she folded her wings and dove for a secluded vale just out of sight of that riverside landing the alicorns reached the summit of yet another hill they had phenomenal endurance and even with rena and lorryn on their backs they were able to make twice the speed of any horse shed ever ridden they had a kind of grounddevouring fast walk that they could keep up all day if they had to they needed to stop two or three times each day for food and water and then it was no more than the equivalent of an equine snack of course what they were eating was not grass alone but whatever they could catch that lived in the grass as well they were fast they caught and ate mice and voles as easily as any house cat at night they would disappear for several hours coming back with traces of blood around their mouths at least they came backand didnt consider lorryn and rena to be good prey rena had been revolted lorryn had been fascinated he told her that it was very likely that the reason why the alicorns were able to keep up that fast pace was that they were eating meat meat is a more concentrated food than grass he told her if they werent eating meat i expect they wouldnt be able to go on any longer or faster than one of our horses rena had already decided that she was no longer interested in having a tame alicorn meanwhile she was not possessed of the same level of endurance as lorryn or the alicorns they wanted to be off at sunrisewhich meant rising before sunrise just so they could manage a bite to eatand didnt stop for the night until sunset nothing in renas life had ever prepared her for this kind of endurance test she fell asleep exhausted and sore and woke very little rested she had long since given up any interest in the passing countryside even though theyd had more than one narrow escape from hostile animals and potentially hostile hunters now all she could do was cling to the back of her alicorn and use her own little magics to keep it tame all she really wanted to do was find the wizards so at last she could rest rest oh if only she could her entire world had narrowed to the need for rest every muscle ached and her eyes burned with fatigue there was a dull headache right behind her eyes and if lord gildor had appeared at that moment with an offer of a bed and a warm meal in exchange for a wedding she would probably have wedded him then and there well maybe not but she would have been willing to entertain the notion interesting lorryn muttered out loud as his beast reached the top of the ridge first whats interesting rena asked dully she couldnt imagine anything interesting out here theyd traveled through a pass in the mountains to come out amid a range of forested hills several days ago the hills were bisected by a wide river which the alicorns had followed for a few days shed had hope that they were about to reach whatever goal their tiny minds had setsince she didnt see any way that they could cross a river that must have been wide enough to have swallowed lord tylars manor gardens and all without a splash but yesterday the alicorns had plunged into the stream without any warning at all and had swum across it while she clung on to her mounts mane with one hand and her bundle of belongings with the other terrified that she would lose her grip on one or the other shed swallowed water more than once and her chest still hurt she hadnt said anything to lorryn though for fear hed decide to abandon the alicorns and continue the trek on foot he was thriving on the hard pace and she didnt want him to think that she was holding him back his surprise and approval of everything shed done so far was so sweetand she couldnt bear to do without it again it was the one sliver of triumph in the midst of the grueling journey well i think i know what the alicorns are doing where theyre going he replied as he studied the ground ahead of them were headed down into a great plain and ive been seeing what i think are alicorn tracks all along when we topped this ridge i thought i saw alicorns out there in the grass all heading south i think our mounts are migrating what she said surprise breaking her out of her weary apathy for a moment like birds exactly like birds he replied i think i know whats going on in their tiny little minds ive been trying to sense their thoughts but i couldnt make anything of them until just now you know that theyre predators sometimes yes she replied holding back a shudder i think that theyre predators during the winter when there isnt much to graze on combined grazers and predators during this migration and then become grazers all summer i think that while theyre grazers they form up into big herds but only then that would be so they can find mates and protect their young he sounded very pleased with himself that would be why our hunters scarcely ever see them in the summer and never with youngand why when we hunt them in the winter theyre solitary they act like predators in the winter then in the summer act like grazers to choose mates and bear and raise young well she replied as she thought about that from the standpoint of the fact that she knew theyd been created from other animals by some longago high lord the high lords wanted something that could feed itself in all situations so i suppose that makes sense but what does that have to do with us lorryn turned back to look at her bracing himself with one hand on the stallions rump not much except that were going to have to abandon these two before they reach a big herd i dont think the herd would tolerate us and i dont think you can gentle an entire herd of the beasts she thought once again of the blood on her mares muzzle and shivered no i dont think i can either but what about the wizards well ive been thinking about that he replied once we crossed that river i daresay were beyond any holding the elven lords ever claimed if we dont find any sign of habitation we can turn back to the river and follow it for a while i can start listening for thoughts which ought to give us a clue where they are and we can both watch for dragons ive been watching for dragons she replied truthfully and i havent seen any i havent sensed any thoughts but beasts since the river either he studied her from his seat on the alicorns back i also think i ought to put an illusion of full humanity on both of us just in case she covertly stretched aching muscles and gave him the same close regard i think you might be right she replied thoughtfully you look a little too elven plus were out where we might well run into free humans he reminded her ive read a lot of history from the first wizard war and before i know of several groups who were supposed to be out here at least back as far as the histories gothe grelriders and the corn people the last thing i want to do is frighten anyone orwell neither the riders or the corn people have any reason to think of elves as anything but enemies i would rather they didnt shoot at us before asking questions as if the alicorns themselves wouldnt encourage them to do that but she nodded her agreement and a few moments later sensed that tingling that told her lorryn was working magic on her i wonder if i could change my own shape the ears and the eyes anyway the way i changed my birds she thought better not try right now though its probably a very bad idea with all the other things im doing with my magics if she lost control over the alicorns best not to add one more ball to the lot she already was juggling she looked off to her right and saw with relief that the sun was near the horizon it would be time to stop soon we should talk about when we want to leave the alicorns he called back to her tonight after i make supper she replied she would literally be making supper out of the plants they would gatherand she would make some sweet treats to ensure that the alicorns would come back after their hunt that was another reason she was so tired the entire burden of their food supply rested on her slim shoulders and she had never worked so much magic before this shed never realized it would tire her out so much the more so the farther along they were i wish the alicorns were enough like hounds that you could get them to bring us something back he said wistfully he was probably as weary of grasscake and stewed grass as she was but the recollection of the mare returning one night with not only blood on her muzzle but a shred of what could have been cloth stuck in her teeth made her do more than shiver there had been a hunter on their trail until then and rena had been wishing that the alicorns could drive him off had the mare somehow sensed her wishes and followed through on them in her own way she didnt know and probably never would know but the hunter had certainly disappeared after that night i dont she said with a shiver i dont caellach gwain surveyed his audience with satisfaction so far he had most of the oldest and most senior of the wizards behind himeven those who had not cared to speak out before were more willing to show their true feelings now that shana was gone caellach only hoped she would stay away forever without her egging them on the youngsters were not so sure of themselves or of their powers only her inner circle continued in their impudent defiance of authority and they were kept so busy denuding the old citadel that they had little time for mischief among the others ill tell you how ive been getting my proper help back caellach told the others i started with the humans theyre so used to taking orders from anyone that looks even vaguely like an authority that they never once question me they just go and do what i tell them to he frowned slightly granted theyre bare children but even children can pick up after me or fetch my dinner doesnt anyone ever come looking for them ventured one of the others caellach shrugged maybe but they never come looking in my quarters i suppose whoevers in charge of these brats must think theyre sneaking off to play i just tell them that they are to say that a wizard had important tasks for them and that seems to take care of the matter he doubted in the confusion that the new citadel represented that anyone had missed the children he borrowed from the work crews there was a veritable swarm of human and wizard children and children were of very little use at anything requiring strength or stamina that left only what he would call household chores and why should they not be using their time properly in serving a single master rather than gathering reeds or some other such nonsense he said as much and the other nodded sagely pick out the frightened ones he advised the ones that try not to be seen that shrink away into shadows and corners when they get the chance theyre the most tractable and the least likely to be missed and thinkif theyre that shy well be doing them a favor keeping them away from crowds without a doubt those children need a firm hand someone to give them specific orders so they dont have to think he lifted a sardonic eyebrow at one of the others who looked a bit doubtful children should not think anyway they arent equipped to think they should learn listen and obey i suppose youre right the wizard said a bit doubtfully but still oh dont get sentimental over them theyre only human snapped someone else before the dissenter could come up with anything concrete to base his objections on its not as if theyre ever going to be of any real use to the citadel except as servants better they learn that little fact now while theres time to train them in their proper place more heads nodded agreement and the dissenter subsided caellach took control of the meeting again thats not the only reason i asked you all here he said in a low and confidential tone we really need to do something about the state of things here state of things one of the oldest quavered indignantly travesty you mean young brats carrying on as if they were seniorseniors being forced to fetch their own meals and sweep their own floors his unsteady voice rose full of unsteady wrath no respect no proper conduct no regard for custom thats whats wrong here i was willing to put up with nonsense while we were out there he waved his hand vaguely in the direction of the mouth of the caverns you expect a certain amount of disorganization and slackness when theres no real structure to living so to speak but now now were living in proper quarters and things should go back to the way they were it was good enough for our forebears by heaven and it should be good enough for us a rumble of illtempered agreement arose from the rest and caellach rubbed his hands together with glee better and betterthe complaint hadnt come from himand they all agreed with it but he held up a cautionary hand as the rumble grew louder i agree i agreebut we mustnt be precipitous here we may realize this is whats best for the citadel and all wizards but those proud little brats of lashanas think they know better and they have the dragons to back them up at the mention of the dragons the rumble faded into uncertain silence he hastened to reassure them it isnt impossible to put things right again he told them firmly it is simply going to take time we must be cautious and lay our plans with care eventually the dragons will become bored with us and find other pastimes orlashana might not return and they will go out looking for her a hundred things could happened to tilt the balance to our side and we must be ready to act when the time comes act decisively and quickly he had them again leaning forward listening to every word he said he allowed himself a slight smile we must all go and think on these things he told them i will call another meeting in a few days and i would like to hear your ideas at that point he met each of their eyes in turn and got nods some thoughtful some determined from all of them that was close enough to a dismissal that they soon drifted out by ones and twos some talking and some silent caellach waited until they were all gone struggling to keep his feelings of triumph from showing too plainly on his face now it was all just a matter of time and when that young pest lashana did returnif she didshe would find things changed and not to her liking two days later they reached the plain itself there was no sign of an alicorn herd nor of the wizards lorryn elected to stay with their mounts as long as possible and the alicorns themselves dropped abruptly from the fast pace they had set to the normal walking pace of a horse they no longer hunted at night and rena found them eating nothing more sinister than grass and the treats she made for them it was easier to keep them gentle too and between that and the easier pace she began to recover from the grueling marathon of their escape lorryn was certainly in his element she didnt think she had ever seen him so happy his hair was a wild mop his clothing as threadbare as the lowest slaves and he didnt look anything like the cultured elven lord hed beenbut there was a light in his eyes she didnt ever remember seeing before im not sure if i care whether we find the wizards now or not he called back to her on the third afternoon of riding through the waisthigh grasses i could live like this forever think of it as free as a hawk in the sky no one telling us where to go or what to do thats all very well now she said a bit tartly thinking about her uncomfortable couches on the cold ground but what about winter its going to get very cold down here once winter comes and i dont fancy huddling against an alicorn whos turned predator for warmth all night lorryn laughed at her and shook his head youre too practical rena too practical for romance anyway i can be romantic she protested stung i just like my romance with comfort attached to it but would it be romance then he countered whats romance without he suddenly sat straight up choking off his words as they mounted their ridge and saw what was on the next one in the next moment rena saw what had alarmed him sitting on what looked like very fierce cattle ranged along the top of the next ridge were a dozen people humans she thought but not like any other she had ever seen they were so dark of skin as to be black wearing brightly colored headcloths and loose trousers and they were armed with long irontipped spears ancestors lorryn breathed grelriders it must be i dont know of any other race with skin that color you know who these people are she whispered as the alicorns came to a dead halt and stood stockstill looking across at the six bulls and snorting a challenge i studied them when i was trying to study the wizards and the human cultures that used to be here he muttered back his face betraying only excitement i even learned the language there was a spell of tongues on one of the books that gave me nine different human languages i never thought id get a chance to use one though he broke off and waved solemnly at the riders above them calling to them in a peculiar liquid tongue i just told them that were from one of the extinct tribes that used to be allies of theirs he said in a hasty aside to rena i hope that worksaccording to the histories theyre notoriously one of the figures above them rode his mount a little ahead of the line and called something back lorryns face lit up it worked he exclaimed he just gave us the safe conduct to ride up to meet them are you sure thats a good idea she asked shivering with fear and trying not to show it we dont exactly have a choice he countered theyve already seen us and if we turned and ran theyd be after us in no time they have to be better trackers than we are so sooner or later theyd find us no we need to present ourselves as being too strong to harass he reached out as she rode her mare up beside him and patted her hand i know how you feel its a good thing im mounted or i dont think my legs would hold me up but we have to act as if we belong here that were their equals in strength he gave her a quick smile come on look brave think of gildor that made her smile weakly and he gave her hand another quick pat you can tame alicorns remember you have been the one keeping us fed and warm youre clever and brave and i wouldnt want anyone else at my side in this lets go as they rode up the ridge toward the waiting riders the bulls began to sidle sideways and back up rolling their eyes with fear the alicorns raised their heads and stared straight at the bulls lifting their lips to show their fangs and stepping like dressagetrained horses as they walked up the slope the nearer she and lorryn got to the dark people the more the bulls reacted with fear until all the riders had to dismount and hold the heads of their animals to keep them from bolting lorryn stopped at that and called out again to the rider who was apparently the leader ive told him that i dont want to frighten his mounts anymore he translated for rena as the leader of the group nodded and replied he thanks me and tells me that the corn peoplethats who were supposed to be fromare wise he says that they have heard of alicorns in legend and that they have seen enough of them since they began their search for grazing and sweet water to know that they are terrible enemies he wants to know how we tamed them he laughed softly weve impressed him i think little sister indeed the man looked impressed holding tightly to the halter of his bull which tossed its head and tried to fight him lorryn called something back and the man transferred his admiring gaze from lorryn to rena smile and wave rena he whispered i told him you were the one who tamed them she smiled a little woodenly and waved can you hold both beasts here he asked her after the man spoke several more sentences i think we have a rare opportunity here she wasnt certain what he meant by that but she knew that if she dismounted and stood with a hand on the shoulder of each of the beasts they wouldnt move i can she told him but i wish youd give me their language you are the one with the spell of tongues later he promised and slid off the back of his alicorn to approach the leader of the dark people she dismounted before the stallion could react to his absence and steadied both beasts while lorryn and the dark man spoke together she began to lose her fear and then her nervousness when she realized that the mans posture and tone of voice were both not only friendly but respectful and whenever he looked hi her direction or indicated her that respect only deepened lorryn returned to her ill tell you more later but i made out as if we were the last of our tribe and weve been looking for our ancient alliesthemto let them know how things stand in the lands the elves hold they are very impressed by tame alicorns and we have been invited to exercise the rights of our ancient alliance and join them these people are associated with their head priest a fellow called diric and they want us to meet him at least he paused and looked gravely into her eyes rena if this is not something you are comfortable with well go onbut with these people well have shelter and food and i think from my reading that well be safe with them its up to you she looked from him to the leader of the dark people and back again they were humanand alienbut at least they were people it would be better than riding across endless seas of grass on the backs of animals they might have to abandon at any moment at the moment it seemed the best choice what do i do with the alicorns she asked can you send them away he replied the bulls wont tolerate them thats what haja asked me to do anyway she nodded after a moment of concentration go tell him well come with them and give me a little time she waited until he walked off and joined the man hed called haja then turned her magic on the alicorns for the last time concentrating on increasing their urge to find others of their kind until it overrode everything else including the urge to challenge the bulls then she lifted her hands from their shoulders they halfreared startling the bulls and their riders and pivoted on their hind feet to point their heads west as soon as their forefeet hit the ground they were off not at a fast walk or a lope but at a run clawhooves flashing in the sun manes flying tails flagged they looked beautiful she watched them go with a little regret there had been things about them that she would miss but not enough that she wanted them back with her head as high as theirs she walked toward lorryn and his new ally and realized with a flush of pleasure that the murmurs she heard from the riders were sounds of admiration now if they could just hold their illusionsthis might have been the best thing to happen to them since they escaped chapter the iron people had not moved their encampment for days which was just fine with shana shed been afraid that when they resumed their wanderings the trek might take her little group even farther from the citadel than they already were but there was good grazing at this spot and water and as long as the grass lasted the iron people were not inclined to move on all to the good now they had time to make plans to get away shana was increasingly uneasy about being gone for so long not that she didnt think that denelor and the others couldnt handle everything on their ownbut butthings happen sometimes their feltwalled tent was surprisingly cool in the heat of midday the sides rolled up to let in a cool breeze at floor level and heated air rose to escape through the smoke hole with no real duties to perform they spent most of the time that they were not being questioned in the relative comfort of the tent after all where was there to go how much interest was there in watching cattle graze kalamadea was margin ally interested in seeing how the young warriors fought in their practices but those were always held in the cool of the morning and whatever the magic was that held their own powers in abeyance no one was practicing anything that looked or felt like magic near enough for any of them to detect it are you sure we should be talking with them around mero whispered nodding at the two elves drowsing on their side of the tent within two days of their capture a peaceful accord had been reached between the newcomers and the original prisoners the tent was divided down the middle by arranging the rugs to conform to that pattern the elves stayed on their side the wizards on the other haldor continued to ignore them kelyan after questioning all of them about the particulars of the wizard war and lord dyrans demise fell into a kind of apathetic stupor he said he was meditating but it looked to shana like he was staring off into space just like haldor she had to wonder if either of them was quite sane anymore after being held like this for several decades there was really nothing for them to do or to think aboutand if boredom was a real problem for elves in their own lands and in control of their own lives how much more so was it a problem for these two as she had studied them she had come to the tentative conclusion that they were hardly more than the shadow of real elves haldor in particular had retreated into himself until there was nothing showing of his personality anymore it was rather horrible really was this how they would act after being held captive for too long i dont think it matters she told mero truthfully neither of them seem particularly interested in getting free and it isnt as if were planning an escape we are trying to figure out how we can get the iron people to let us go with honor all the way around and that isnt going to get anyone in trouble were not doing anything to violate our parole so to speak mero shrugged then all right i see your point even if either of them told tales on us all the iron people would hear would be what they already know shana finished for him that we want to go back to our people that we were here to find trade and that we are not elves mero nodded well then if were going to approach anyone i think we ought to go with jamal he told them hes young hes in the process of changing their customsif anyone can be persuaded that it would be better to turn us loose against the custom of holding captives i think its likely him and hes very popular popular enough that people wont question it if he orders something that seems odd or unusual but kalamadea shook his head at that emphatically he is also grasping that one and he will not let go of anything once he has possession of it we are his so to speak and he will not release a piece of booty on the promise of trade to come andi do not think he is interested in peace with anyone i think if he learns of the existence of the citadel he will seek to conquer it not to trade with it i have seen nothing that makes me think otherwise he frowned and i do not like who he has garnered as his followers they are warriors all and when was a warrior interested in anything but war no i am for the priest diric he is one who thinks long and deeply and he does not ponder war without also pondering the losses that war entails it was kemans turn and he shrugged and looked confused i dont know he confessed except that i dont know how were going to convince either of them that we arent elves he looked back at shana diric spent more time with you than with the rest of us and so did jamal especially after they let the elves give you their language theyve asked you more questions than they have all of the rest of us combined so what do you think of them she chewed her lip thoughtfully initially i thought we should try to concentrate on jamal mostly because of jamals popularity but also because i thought diric would be like the old whiners i thought that diric would be very prejudiced against us just because were greeneyed demons and hed be more in favor of loading us down with more chains than with setting us free buti dont know if it was because im a female or some other cause but jamal has been incredibly arrogant with me and diric has never been less than courteous i think diric already believes we are something other than elves and i know he is far more interested in setting up trade with others than in going to war with them hes asked me any number of times about what exactly our people have to offer in trade he was very specific in what he was interested ingrain and metals for the most part though hell take raw wool linen and readymade goods when jamal wasnt trying to browbeat me he wanted to know about terrain and where i was from preciselyand what our people possess that sounds like someone looking for booty and an easy target to conquer to me too kalamadea so on the whole i am inclined to concentrate on diric myself kalamadea looked from her to mero and back again two for diric one for jamal and one undecided he turned to mero would you like to make further arguments to convince us or have we convinced you mero rubbed the side of his nose with his finger im not really strongly in support of going to jamal he said finally if the two of you are strongly in favor of diric im willing to go along with that he made a disparaging face after all even though i know more about life on an elven lords estate than either of you both of you know more about how to read a persons intentions from what he says and doesand doesnt say i am quite strongly in favor of approaching diric shana replied firmly as kalamadea nodded agreement diric it is then mero agreed at least he isnt as scary as jamal i always have the feeling jamal is a hair away from doing something i hadnt expectedand whatever it would be it would probably be unpleasant that may be another sign he is not a man of peace kalamadea observed shana didnt have anything to add to thatshe would have said that jamal didnt feel safe as if he could and would change his moods with lightning swiftness even though she had never seen such a mood change now to change the subject have any of you figured why neither elven magics nor human magics work on these folk kalamadea threw up his hands in despair i am baffled he replied in disgust i have never encountered anything like this and i am older than the oldest elven lord on this world i can speak mind to mind with you and shadow shana but i cannot touch the minds of any of the iron people i can mold a bit of rock to my will but the collar remains stubbornly immutable and i cannot shift now speaking mind to mind if enough like human wizardry that i can see how perhaps they could block my ability to do the samebut not the purely draconic abilities of rockshaping and shapeshifting it is most vexing shana nodded ruefully her own experiments had come to nothing as well and so had meros kelyan has no clue how they do this and i havent caught anyone actually working whatever magic they do that blocks ours im baffled too these collars are very old keman said softly shana turned to him in surprise why do you say that she asked he shrugged they cant be very new he said theyre iron and ive overheard people complaining that they havent had fuel or metal for the forges for months if you look at these collars though you can see that there is a great deal of wear on them enough that they could have been around for hundreds of years in fact i dont think they were ever intended for humans or elves at all i think they were meant for animals huge hounds most likely there may be some protection against control or against magic being used against the wearer in them but i dont think theres much more than that after all we can speak mind to mind with each other we just cant read them we havent tried anything else except shapeshifting and rockshaping and the rockshaping works shana nodded slowly so the reason our magic is blocked might be something that they are each doing for themselves and not the effect of the collar at all except in that our magic cant be used on the collar yes keman told her that is my best guess at any rate which would be the reason why the elves can continue to cast their illusions even though they wear similar collars kalamadea mused aloud that is logical but why can we not shift have you tried shifting to a form the same size as a halfblood mero asked suddenly intent or did you try something larger or smaller this is the smallest form we can shift to kalamadea told him andno the only thing i have tried is to shift to one of the oxen and i did not actually try to shift back to my draconic form until last night which is bigger much bigger so is the ox meros eyes narrowed it could be that the reason you cant shift is because your body knows very well that you wont break the collar before it strangles you in a larger form it isnt magic that stops you at all its instinct to keep you from choking to death kalamadea and keman looked at one another startled after a moment kalamadea nodded that makes even more sense he said slowly no matter what new form i shifted to if the neck is even a hair larger than my neck in this form that is precisely what will happen i will have to think about this and perhaps between us keman and i can arrive at a form wherein this will not be a problem he frowned the trouble is we have never learned to shift into anything that we did not have the pattern for in nature i am not certain that we could learn how to do so now i wish i could pry more out of diric shana said after a long silence i have the feeling that i would be able to figure this out if only i knew the right questions to ask she toyed with a lock of her hair i think hes feeling me outtrying to decide if he can trust us there is something going on here that none of us are privy to between him and jamal but its something that is going to cause us trouble i think theyre in the middle of a very subtle and covert struggle for power huh mero said that actually makes sense and matches what ive been seeing and hearing it matches what i know also kalamadea added i would not call jamal rash precisely but he would much rather control something directly and that means conquering it if he can whether it is the power over his own clan or the means of obtaining grain and metals both of which are in short supply among these iron people keman groaned and massaged his temple as if he had a headache this is not fair i hate being stuck in the middle of a power struggle at any time but why must i be stuck in the middle of one that hasnt got anything to do with me how do you think i feel shana retorted ive been in the center of power struggles since before i was born no one ever asked me if i wanted any part of this you have great hamenleai lashana kalamadea said with one of his inscrutable smiles i said so when alara brought you to the kin since you are such a center of great change you can hardly be anything but the focus of power struggles oh thank you she replied sarcastically sometimes i wish father dragon would take his position as chief shaman andah never mind foster mother is like that too she just doesnt get quite so pompous about it oh you are welcome he replied with equal irony but more humor i merely point out the facts lashana i am not responsible for them she only snorted fact or not we are here and i would like to do something to get us out of here so has anyone got any ideas about approaching diric there had been some disturbance outside shana had been ignoring it there were often disturbances outside the tent quarrels between young warriors noisy games by mobs of children the occasional cow taking it into her head to charge through the center of camp such disturbances usually faded after a while this one did not in fact the crowd noise had increased over the past few moments what is going on out there she wondered aloud getting to her feet she coiled the loose end of her chain around her waist and walked over to the entrance followed by the other three and the two elves they emerged into the bright light and heat of midafternoonnoon the sun struck her like a blow to the head and she shaded her eyes with her hand as she peered in the direction of all the noise now now that haldor had been coaxed to work something the elves called a spell of tongues upon them all and had imparted to all four of them all of the knowledge of the language of the iron people that either he or kelyan had she could understand the shouting are they saying something about corn people she asked kalamadea in puzzlement he nodded frowning furiously they are he replied and that is an impossibility they were a tribe that allied with the grelriders in their struggle against the elves but unfortunately they were handicapped by being farmers rather than nomads they would not leave their land and they had not really acquired the skills of warthey had always relied on their allies to protect them the corn people were slaughtered long before the first wizard war and their children made into slaves there are no more corn people he seemed so certain of it that she could not doubt him but that was certainly the gist of what the shouting was all about so if there were no com people then what the shouting neared clearly the crowd was headed in this direction a moment later the chaotic mob surged through the gap between the tentwagons in the middle of it all was a group of iron priests escorting a pair of goldenhaired paleskinned humans who stood out among the dark iron people like daisies blooming in a freshly turned field the two newcomers clearly were being escorted and were not prisoners the priests gave them all the deference of honored guests the folk crowding around them were excited at the sight of them and most telling of all they were not wearing collars and chains the entire crowd pushed and shoved their way past without anyone paying the slightest bit of attention to the prisoners except for one of the newcomers the male of the pair looked up catching first shanas eyes then merosand his eyes widened in shock his mouth opened as if he meant to shout something but it was too late he was already past carried by the crowd heading for dirics tent lorryn could not have been more surprised if he had seen lord tylar disporting himself among these nomads there had been two elves back there with collars on their necks and chains around their waistsand beside them what could only have been four wizards in like condition how had that come about and why i dont have time to worry about that now he reminded himself casting a nervous glance around the crowd he prided himself on being able to read people and he did not like what he sensed while he and rena in their guise of allies might be an exciting new novelty it was obvious from some of the subtler signals that the corn people had been considered somewhat inferior to the iron clans there was an air of amused superiority about the priests for instance now that they had gotten over the initial shock of the discovery and lorryn thought he knew why the corn people had been farmers and not nomadic herdsmen they had not been particularly good fighters though they had held their ground valiantly to protect the retreat of their allies into the south in the histories he had read the com people had always relied on the iron people to protect them from enemies paying for the protection in the grain and goods only a settled population could produce that meant it was all the more imperative that he hold his illusion of full humanity over himself and rena it also meant that once everyone got over the novelty of seeing the blond com people in their midst he and rena would be here on bare and wary sufferance after all what did they bring with them nothing no grain no hope of grain no skills of war only the ability to tame alicorns animals the bulls would not tolerate that wasnt exactly usefuland a demonstration of any other talents might well get them in more trouble than it got them out of the priests that had welcomed the two of them wanted to take them directly to their chief priestand lorryn agreed even though he sensed there was something that they were not telling him about that request it was somewhat unnerving to realize that he could not touch their minds no matter how hard he tried he was so used to being able to read peoples thoughts as well as their expressions that he felt curiously halfdeaf or halfblind was this how rena felt or the more ordinary human slaves without wizardpowers if so he felt terribly sorry for them they were ushered into a large tentwagon redolent with fragrant smoke and once the flap dropped behind them seemingly empty as lorryns eyes adjusted to the darkness something moved at the far end of the tent i think you are not what you seem tamer of onehorns a deep and amused voice said quietly from out of the shadows there lorryn started i he replied innocently how can i be something other than what you see rena clutched at his hand bewildered by the strange tongue and clearly ill at ease he peered into the shadows trying to make out the form of the speaker it was hardly fair that these people were so dark that made it hard to see them in this halflight someone stood up a human form detached itself from the shadowy form of a chair and moved forward i say you are not what you seem the deep voice continued because what you seem to be is one of the com peopleyet beneath that seeming i see something else something i would have been tempted to name a greeneyed demon had i not had four creatures like unto you brought to me within the fortnight a tall powerfully built man with closely cropped tightly curling graywhite hair stepped into the shaft of light from the smoke hole in the tent roof above and stood before lorryn arms crossed over his chest he leveled a challenging gaze at lorryn who froze so tell me what it is that you are tamer of onehorns he demanded tell me why it is that you and four of my captives share a semblance while this you call your sister looks all too clearly like the other twain i hold in chains he knows what we are he can see through the illusions lorryn thought in panic oh ancestors now what do i do well there was no real choice tell the truth it seems the only way out its a very long story he began tentatively for the first time the man who must be the chief priest cracked a slow cautious smile there is always the time for a long story he responded so lorryn began at the beginning the priest interrupted him often to ask very pointed questions and by the time he reached the end of his narrative the light from the smoke hole had crawled halfway up the wall of the tent and he was hoarse i cant think of anything else to tell you he concluded two of the people you have are elves what you call greeneyed demons the other four are obviously halfbloods like me it seems to me that the wizards would be very interested in opening up trade with you just as they claim they probably need all the allies they can get against the elves interesting the man stroked his chin and stared quite through lorryn i am inclined to believe you i must think on all of this you have told me clearly things have greatly changed since my people fled into the south his eyes focused again and he gave lorryn a look that made the halfblood quiver inside in all of his life he had never met someone with so powerful a personality hold to your illusion i think perhaps i am the only one to have seen through it since i was consciously disposing myself to doubt it as soon as word of your coming reached my ears the rest will see you both for corn people you will be on sufferance until i say otherwise oh just what i wanted to hear lorryn thought suppressing a shiver the war chief will find you of no interest the chief priest continued the corn people were never of any use in warfare and it is logical that he will dismiss you to my care be glad if he penetrated your illusion you would fare much worse than with me and i think your illusion would not last beyond his desire to taste the strangeness of your sister the priests arched eyebrows left no doubt in lorryns mind about what that had meant he fought down mingled fear and anger at the very idea the priest chuckled at his expression have no fear that she shall be subject to my whims boy my taste is for my life partner and wife which is just as well had she not chosen me she would have become a manhearted woman i think and gone running with the warriorsand she does not brook that i should look elsewhere than her he chuckled again as if the idea amused him stay you in the dwelling to which i shall send you while i ponder upon the problem you have presented and speak with the spirits of our fathers and with the first smith since they really didnt have any other choice lorryn nodded his agreement the priest went to the door of the tent and called out a soft summons another younger priest came at his call and ushered them out into the fading sunset taking them to a small tentwagon in the midst of many such all of the people here were attired like the priest with the same iron torque with the flamefiligree pendant the tent itself was plain enough just a few cushions and some colorful blankets with a cold brazier set under the smoke hole as soon as they were alone lorryn quickly explained to rena everything that had happened he halfway expected her to react badly to the news that they had been unmasked but she heard him out without making a single comment until the end it could be worse she pointed out if hes a priest he could have gotten quite a bit of prestige out of revealing us for what we are he didnt i dont think he will i think theres some kind of powerplaying going on between him and the war chief i think he might be holding us in reserve to be used against this man lorryn blinked in surprise where had she come up with that not that it wasnt logical in fact it made altogether too much sense but how had she seen it so quickly she might not be able to read thoughts but she could certainly read his expressions like one of her romances mother and i were subject to every shift in politics that lord tylar made she commented ironically we learned to read the state of things very quickly and from very small hints we had to we had no choice we had to be certain that if we said something complimentary about last weeks ally he was still an ally and not an enemy ah he replied at a loss for an answer then he was saved from having to give one by the arrival of a woman with a basket of food a soft white cheese and strips of dried meat the consistency of leather together with fresh water rena frowned as she surveyed their limited meal i could get very tired of that very quickly she said gingerly picking up a meat strip and nibbling on it i think perhaps id better work a bit of magic on a handful of grass or two every day i wouldnt argue with that lorryn agreedalthough to his mind the meat and cheese made a wonderful change from handfuls of grass hed begun to feel rather like a goat these past few days he yawned hugely only now becoming aware of how tired he was meanwhile maybe we ought to rest while weve been given the chance rena echoed his yawn as if she couldnt help herself i would have thought id never be able to sleep under a circumstance like this onebut but we might as well the circumstance isnt going to change whether we sleep or not he took up a meat strip and began to work his way through it valiantly the same goes for making the most of these meals rena took the strip away from him before hed even managed to worry a bit off before he could object shed handed it back try that now she suggested he didand to his surprise it was tender it still tasted like unflavored dried meat but now one could eat it without getting sore jaws i didnt know you could do that with anything other than plants he said in surprise she shrugged neither did i until just a moment ago he felt his eyebrows rising with every day that passed she offered yet another surprise now she was trying her magic on something that was no longer aliveand making it work what would she be able to do in a month enough perhaps for them to win free of these people it could be after all that they had been through so far he was not willing to put any limitations on her potential abilities anymore he managed to muster up the energy to work the spell of tongues on rena after a short nap before anyone looked in on them that was just as well for immediately after they broke their fast another young priest arrived to bring them to the chief priest for another round of intense questioning this time he concentrated as much of his attention on rena as he did on lorryn pretty much dividing his questions equally between the two of them not that this proved to make things any easier at least for lorryn he was constantly worrying that rena would say something wrongnot that he would know what was wrong or right but the priestwho finally introduced himself belatedly as diricwas far more intent on learning what she knew about the wizards than about anything else finally after hours and hours of this interrogation diric dismissed them into the cool of the early evening do not speak to anyone else particularly not the prisoners he cautioned sternly be polite to any of my folk who speak to you but answer to questions only that diric has not given you leave to speak otherwise you may go about the camp and observe whatever you choose he did not insult their intelligence by ordering them not to try to escape that was obvious it was equally obvious at least to lorryn that any attempt to use magic against the iron people would be as futile as his own attempts at reading their thoughts obviously if magic could have gotten anyone free around here neither the two elves nor the four wizards would still be captives he and rena wandered about the camp simply observing things for the rest of the evening no one stopped them or gave them orders to go elsewhere and people seemed quite willing to talk to them and answer their questions lorryn found himself fascinated in spite of their obvious danger he had never seen anyone who lived as these people did their entire way of life revolved around their cattle fully half their food came from the cattle themselves what lorryn had thought was wool felt that made the tents proved to come from the carefully husbanded winter hair the cattle shed in the spring while they might call themselves the iron people they could with justification have referred to themselves as the leather people lorryn had never seen anyone use leather in so many ways and for so many purposes often what he had taken for woven fabric turned out to be supple leather thin and fluid as any woven goods and cleverly dyed and embroidered to resemble cloth they had cloth as well but rena learned by asking a woman who was busy redyeing a faded shirt over a pot on the fire that it was all obtained by trade we have had no trade and no new cloth for many moons the woman said sadly stirring the dyepot with a stick we are not poor but we must husband our cloth as if we were the poorest clan among the people it is a sad thing they walked on through the warm evening breeze the sharp scent of the dye following them their next campfire proved to belong to some of the warriorsand there was a single woman among them a woman who wore virtually the same garments and armor as a man and who was treated exactly as another man there he learned what the manhearted women were that diric had obliquely referred to for she was one of themwomen who took vows to forgo marriage and children in order to join the warriors society there were not many of them and it was often difficult to pick them out from the young men so hardened were they by their intense training the term seemed to refer not to their courage but to the fact that their hearts chose a way otherwise reserved for men were there such things as womanhearted men when he asked that question the answer was a matteroffact of coursebut i doubt you could tell them from maidens he also learned that the smiths were as honored among these people as the warriorsalthough there had been no metal for the smiths to forge for some time a fact that made all the people restless and a bit uneasy their god was the first smith after all who had given to humans fire and the knowledge of metalcraft to be unable to worship this god by working in metal was unsettling to everyone in the encampment so the iron people were suffering many deprivations besides that of new cloth although women could be smiths as readily as men there were again differences in what they wrought based on their sex men tended to concentrate on arms and armorwomen on the iron jewelry that both sexes wore mens jewelry was utilitarian and based on armorwrist cuffs torques headbands belts and ankle cuffs womens jewelry however though also of iron was the most amazing stuff lorryn had ever seen as delicate as black lace the filigreework done by the women smiths would have attracted the envy of any elven crafter it was sophisticated and lovely and it would not have been at all difficult to start a fad for the jewelry among not only the elven ladies but among their lords as well the sound of distant music caught both his attention and renas they followed their ears to the tent where the music originated and that was where they discovered why the iron people had kept a pair of elven captives in the first place after the initial shock wore off and the initial feeling of smug selfsatisfaction at the fate of two who would in another time and place have been his enemies he was reduced to feeling an odd sort of pity for them both of them were hardly more than caricatures of what they must have been when theyd first been captured neither could survive in his own society anymore even if they somehow won free it was impossible to feel anything but pity for them but as he and rena returned to the relative security of their own tent he wondered how long he would have for the luxury of pity for anyone but himself for keman the arrival of the new humans that their captors called the corn people was only the second surprise of the day the first was something he had not even told kalamadea about because he was not certain what it meant nor what he was going to do about it one of the packbeasts oxen trained to carry enormous loads on their backs had a dragonshadow back in the longago time before he and shana had any notion that elves or humans existed shana had showed him how he could look for a dragon shapeshifted into something else by a kind of shadow it had a wisp of form that showed its true nature the more of its mass a dragon had shifted into the out the stronger the shadow would be although as far as he knew only he his mother alara and shana knew how to spot those shadows you had to know what you were looking for then be looking at the right time to see it it wasnt like breaking an illusion which only needed disbelief he was rather fascinated with the variety of livestock the iron people had bred for their uses taking the place of beef and milk cattle horses donkeys and grels he had taken to watching the herds idly trying to spot something new this morning he had been looking over the packbeasts a variety of shorthorned broadbacked cattle with stout legs and placid tempers when one of them caught his attention perhaps because it moved just a little differently from the rest that was when he spotted the other difference a dragonshadow certain that he was somehow mistakenor that the circumstances of their captivity were doing something to his mindhe watched that particular animal all morning right up until shana called him after her session with diric for their little meeting he returned to that herd looking for it as soon as the meeting was over it was still there and it still had a dragonshadow he sat down to watch it while the afternoon sun crawled across the sky and headed for the horizon oblivious to the heat to the flies that came to drink his sweat and went away disappointed he watched it from the best vantage points he could manage moving with the herd until he was certain it did not act like the others or rather it acted like the others its actions and movements were a little stilted a bit of a caricature after studying the beast for some time he realized that it had selected one particular ox and was copying everything that ox did acting a heartbeat or so behind it when it bent its head to graze so did the cow when the ox turned to look at something so did the cow when it ambled down to the river for a drink the cow followed and when it lay down in the afternoon to chew its cud the cow did the same a few feet away the cow never once took its eyes off the ox which was very peculiar behavior for a herdbeast and a female at that which meant that he wasnt delusional that dragonshadow was there the packbeast was a shapeshifted dragon but since it hadnt made itself known to him it wasnt one of the rebels who had cast their lot in with shana and the wizards they all knew what his halfbloodform looked like and one of them would have signaled to him as soon as they saw him so what lair was it from that was important if it was from his old lair it was likely to be an enemy and might cause trouble for him and for shana if it knew they were here if it was from another lair there was no telling how it would feel about them and it still might cause trouble for them so just at the moment it didnt look as if it would be a good dung to just stroll up to it and greet it in the dragonstongue or speak to it mind to mind best to keep quiet and study the situation perhaps so he continued to watch the beast as the sun sank and twilight turned the sky a deep blue adjusting his eyes to compensate for the growing darkness insects called from the grass around him and the herds settled for the night his secret weapon was kalamadea if this was a stranger the presence of kalamadea the oldest dragon in any of the lairs he knew could be enough to make it simply go away if it came to a conflict unless of course it was from his old lair in that case it might go away peacefully unless it happened to be one of a handful of dragons who would be only too happy to discover mat kalamadea was as helpless as he and shana and who would take immediate advantage of the situation he debated the question with himself as twilight turned to true night and as the moon rose to gild the backs of the cattle with a soft dusting of light without coming to any land of a conclusion he started to head back to the tent and the others but found himself drifting back toward the herd to stare at the notcow and ponder his options i wonder sheif it is a she and the sex as well as the form hasnt been shiftedis just as vulnerable as we are right at this moment as kalamadea pointed out when we were caught shifting takes time and if i raised a fuss about her she wouldnt be able to get away quietly the notcow was watching him as warily as he was watching her as a soft evening breeze ruffled his hair had she noticed his regard could she see dragonshadows too if she canthen she knows and if she knows she could get away as soon as i leave and she can work her way beyond the edge of the herds out of sight of the herdsmen that decided him he had no options now and there was no time to get kalamadea he was going to have to do something and hed better figure out what it was and quickly the dragoncow moved uneasily and he knew that she realized he was watching her she had just forced him to act he could only hope that what he was about to do would be the right action for all of them rhiadorana had chosen to follow this clan of the iron people mostly because they happened to be passing through her lairs territory during the season she had chosen to undergo her adult trial her lair had the custom of sending the adolescents out one at a time to spend at least a season shifted into a single formgenerally one in which they could spy on the doings of humans humans not elven lords the elves were too far away quite out of the lairs territory and too dull and predictable to prove to be any danger or even challenge to the lair there had been some rumors a few seasons ago to the effect that the situation among the elves had changed drastically but they were still too far away to bother with life in the mountains and plains of the south and west was quite exciting enough without going that far afield only to be disappointed it had been a real trial to control her shape for such an extended period of time but that was the point of the exercise after all it had turned out that she had made a good choice of subjects too for this clan driven out of their old range by an extended drought was doing some entirely new things for the traditionbound iron people if dora was any judge there was going to be a revolution here and the war chief was going to try to become the only leader of the clan shed shifted into a beast of burden that bore his brand upon her precisely so she could hear rumors about him and even some of his own intriguing and what she had learned was going to be very valuable to the lair he had ambitions did jamal he wanted to be the ruler of all the iron people and the way things were going he just might be able to achieve that goal especially if old diric underestimated his ambition or his guile this was an unusual clan even without jamal they were the only clan dora had ever seen that had ever taken elven slaves they could turn out to be unusual in other ways as well perhaps enough to be a threat to the folk that had been quite enough to keep her here many weeks past when she might otherwise have gone home the folk needed someone here at least to see whether diric or jamal won in the imminent power struggle so she stayed and was pretending to graze at the edge of the herd when the new prisoners were brought in they looked like elvesbut they werent elves no elven lord or lady had ever boasted tanned skin or hair of any color other than palest blond their ears were gently pointed not the lanceheaded shape of the aristocratic elves she had stared in bovine astonishment as they were chained to the tail of a wagon pending their dispositionand then as she stared at them more closely she got another shock two of them had dragonshadows she hadnt known what to think or do then immediate instinct urged her to come to their rescue but prudence dictated a more cautious course they might not want to be rescued they might be here on purpose this might be part of a plan of their own and by rescuing them she might spoil it they might also be on their own adult trials and to interfere would be to cast disgrace on them a dragon who encountered difficulties during her adult trial was supposed to get herself out of them that was the point of it being a trial after all how could it be a trial if someone else rescued you she didnt think any of the others had been planning to follow her to this clan of iron people but it was always possible that they had one of the two dragons had been watching her all day and she began to suspect that he had spotted her for what she was so since all the lair knew that she was making her own trial here he would recognize her this was not necessarily a bad thing unless he was not an adult this was not part of a clever scheme on his part and he planned to get himself out of his own troubles by making trouble for her she eyed him dubiously aware of a growing hunger that no amount of grass was going to cure she needed to kill and feast on real meat at least once every two or three days even in this form and she was overdue ordinarily she would simply drift to the edge of the herd work her way into the darkness shift and fly off shed be back before the herdsman noticed she was gone good for another two or three days of acting like a cow but with this stranger hereif she started to stray he could call attention to her before she could get away shouting to the herdsman as long as he was here she didnt dare move she cursed him mentally and wished she could call a thunderstorm out of the sky the way the shaman couldunder cover of a good downpour she could slip away with no trouble at all better yet with enough lightning hitting the ground even the besttrained cattle would stampede and she could pound away with them but she was not a shaman and there were no thunderclouds overhead the sky was horribly clear every star shining cheerfully and the only scent that the breeze carried was the scent of grass torn by thousands of busily chewing mouths her stomach growled cramping with hunger and revolting against the grass she had sent it the situation was getting desperate if he keeps standing there she thought frantically the only recourse im going to have is to shift into a onehorn and stampede the herd myself no matter if she would have to leave her post and perhaps fail her trialthat hardly mattered given that if he exposed her shed fail anyway wait a momentthe dragon was walking toward her he was going to accost her directly well my friend a voice said cautiously into her mind what are the two of us to make of this situation i cant escapebut neither can you while i watch you the voice was maleand it sounded older than she had thought but more than thatit was no voice she recognized how could that be where would a strange dragon have come from the very idea of a dragon she did not know wasimpossible who are you she asked before she thought her mind full of stunned amazement kemanorel formerly of lelanolaas lair he replied promptly and now of the wizards lair who are you what lair is yours she could not reply at first her knees locked and her mouth gaped as she looked up at him in his strange nothuman notelven form lelanolaas lair what was that she had never heard of any lair of the kin but her own and what in the name of fire and rain was a wizards lair more than one lair of dragons did that mean there had been more than one gate that brought dragons into this world could there be other lairs that her kin had never even dreamed existed rhiadorana she replied weakly after a long silence ofof the only lair i ever heard of it doesnt even have a name andi believe that we need to speak a long silence just as stunned as her own followed ibelieve we do came the slow reply after an agonizing wait and perhaps the best time is now shana was not expecting another summons from the iron priest so late at night so when one of the underpriests came to fetch her her immediate response was fear keman was not in his sleeping place she saw that with a glance had he tried to escape and been stoppedor worse killed or hurt why else would diric want to see her in the middle of the night kalamadea and shadow started up at the same time but were sternly sent back to their places by the priestwho besides carrying a lantern was armed and could enforce his will and probably had a halfdozen fellows waiting outside that he could call with a single word they both watched helplessly as shana crawled out of her bed and got slowly to her feet their eyes mirroring the same fear that clenched her stomach tight against her backbone the priest motioned her to follow she glanced back at the others shrugged and pushed aside the tent flap emerging into the darkness it was late very late the camp was entirely quiet except for the sounds of the herds in the distance and the insects in the grass the night air held that peculiar heaviness it only attained after the midpoint of the night damp and still and quite cold she shivered not just from fear and cold but with reaction at being wakened out of a sound sleep she felt unsettled nerves jumping as she walked at the direction of the priest and the expected halfdozen other guards the moon was gone and most fires were out the only light came from the priests lantern she yawned and wrapped her arms across her chest trying to regain some of the warmth of her bed and studied the priests face to see if she could learn anything from his expression he looked solemn but not angry not even terribly concerned perhaps this had nothing to do with keman then the priest brought her to dirics tent but for the first time he did not climb the steps to follow her insidehe simply motioned to her to make the climb herself watching to see that she did so the wood creaked under her slow footsteps she reached for the heavy felt of the tent flap and pushed it aside slipping into the incensescented warmth within diric was there sitting on a cushion and wearing a loose robe rumpled as if he himself had arisen from a restless sleep a lantern burned above his head he was not alone there was someone else standing near the entrance in a posture of waiting but the person with him was not as she first feared keman but it was a wizard not a human nor an elven lord the shape of the ears and gleam of emerald eyes as he turned toward her was unmistakable there was only one problem she and mero were the only two wizards in this camp and mero was back in the tent shana diric said softly into the darkness this is lorryn i requested that he drop the illusion he held over himself for now i believe that you know what he is though you do not know him personally after a stunned moment she saw past the ears and the eyes to the shape of the features and realized who he was you youre one of those barbarians that came in with the priests scouts she blurted he nodded his mouth twisted in a wry smile and my illusion of full human blood was not good enough to persuade priest diric he replied ruefully i was looking for you but i didnt expect to find you like this me specifically or wizards in general she asked distractedly as diric watched them both with a certain amusement wizards in general he began then peered at her more closely until his shock mirrored and echoed her own no he said then shaking his head in utter stark disbelief no you cant bethere must be more than one femaleredhaired so hes heard the description of me cant i she replied grimacing a little at her own plight and the embarrassment of being caught in it why not because the elvenbane couldnt be so stupid as to get caught on a simple scouting expedition well maybe the elvenbane couldnt but lashana is quite stupid enough to make any number of ridiculous blunders im afraid im just usually a lot more clever about getting out of them lorryn just stared at her and diric resumed control of the situation and the conversation with the aplomb of one used to control now i am convinced he said at last neither of you children are old or crafty enough to have feigned any of your reactions just nowand the tales i have heard from both of you are a match for one another you are not greeneyed demons you are something else entirely he motioned to a set of cushions near his own sit he ordered i spent most of this night sleepless pondering the difficulties that you present we must talk shana yawned unable to help herself as she dropped heavily down onto a cushion couldnt this have waited until morning she thought a bit resentfully i could not wait until morning diric said as if divining her thoughts in part because in the morning jamals eyes will be watching and his ears stretched to hear what i say by rousing you both from your dreams i can if i choose claim convincingly that the first smith sent a nightportent into my sleep that forced me to interrogate you both here and now shana nodded reluctantly lorryn waited to hear more i do not have the power here that i once held diric continued with a candor that shocked her and more of my power ebbs with every passing day if it were my choice my decision you would all walk free of this place at dawn to return to your own peoples and bring to us an alliance and a new trading partner but jamal rules here particularly where prisoners are concerned and it is his will that you remain forever visible signs of his power and prowess as war chief he has convinced himself that all greeneyed demons are of the ilk of the two we hold he is certain that this clan can conquer them all and take the riches of their lands from them lorryn shook his head violently at that sir forgive me but you have no idea what the really powerful elven lords can do he exclaimed urgently please believe me if your people come up against them directly you might kill some of their human soldiers but youll never get near one of them even without being able to use magic against you directly there is plenty they can do they can open chasms up under your feet to swallow your warriors they can diric held up a hand forestalling him you speak to one who is already convinced young one he said softly i know this as well as one can who has never actually seen such things with his own eyes it is jamal who must he convinced and it is jamal who never will be convinced save by a slaughter of our clan then what are we supposed to do shana asked only too well aware of how helpless they were you didnt bring the two of us here in the middle of the night to tell us that you cant let us escape and you know jamal is leading your people into a war they cant win diric gave her an approving glance no indeed i did not he said easily i brought you here to include you in myconspiracy if you will or to be included in your own wish to see you free i wish to have a trade alliance with your people i wish to avoid a conflict with the demons each springs from the otherso i believe we need to begin our discussion with thoughts on how we may engineer your escape for the second time in the past few moments shana felt faint with relief she concentrated on the spicy scent of the incenseladen air of the texture of the soft fabric under her hands of her own weight resting on the cushion to steady herself well need to work this out in such a way that no blame falls on you obviously lorryn said while she was still recovering she snapped herself out of her dizziness at that more importantlyif we want to throw some immediate doubt on the wisdom of jamals war plans shouldnt we make it look as if the escape was easy for us she added shouldnt we make it look as if we could have gotten up and walked out of here any time we pleased and we chose not to diric blinked as if her words surprised him and he nodded that would be a very good thing to have happen he replied solemnly a very very good thing indeed it would discredit jamals assumptions of our superior powers discredit anything so fundamental to the heart of his power and we might begin to weaken it lorryns brows knitted can i assume you cant offer us much in the way of overt help he hazarded diric nodded which didnt surprise shana particularly covert help then she suggested the key to these damned collars for instance they are interfering with some of our powers and if we want to make it look as if they have no effect on us youd better give us a way to get rid of them so we can act diric considered that for a moment i do not have the key he said after a moment then smiled but i am a smith after all i believe i can either make a key or pick the locks and jam them so that the collars look functional but can be removed at your will is that sufficient that will do she said with satisfaction well also need to get lorryn to us covertly so that he can learn to use wizard magics to their fullest mero and i know some tricks im sure he never picked up on his own to her pleasure lorryn gave her a halfbow i never doubted that he replied the best i can manage is elven magic and thoughtreading i may have some elvenlearning that may prove new to you however i have been well schooled in those powers i lived as lord tylars acknowledged son and heir until a few short weeks ago after all and i have all the training of an elven son shana felt her eyebrows shooting so high her forehead cramped now that is a story id like to hear she exclaimed and so you shall but no more this night diric interrupted now he yawned these words of yours have stilled some of my anxieties and now my own body is demanding the rest i denied it shana tried to hold back her own yawn and failed when lorryn added his it was obvious that none of them were going to be able to work or speak with unclouded minds i shall devise a meeting for you and yours shana and lorryn and his sister diric promised and i thinki think i shall facilitate that by granting the corn people a great honor in the morning he arched a brow at lorryn who smiled and asked the expected question and what honor will that be iron priest why i shall invite you to be of my household and share my tent diric replied and you of course will agree immediately conscious of the enormity of the honor and the protection my rank will give you of course lorryn said with an ironic bow and being as we are only com people not warriors with nothing of value to jamal he will see this as no more than your desperate scrambling for a success to equal his taking of four greeneyed demons as prisoners diric grinned broadly his white teeth shining in the darkness of his face he motioned to them to rise and did so himself shana heard his joints popping as he did so and wondered not for the first time just how old he was why i could almost believe you to be as crafty as an iron priest yourself oh wizard and i lorryn said with a chuckle that shana echoed as they both stood to leave could almost believe you to be as crafty as a halfblood oh priest myre flew lazy circles in the sky above the encampment full of those strange blackskinned people and watched everything that was going on below her it was no great task to sharpen her eyesight until an eagle would be myopic by comparison though she flew so high that she was scarcely visible even as a dot to those below her she could count the rings on a womans fingers the number of rattles on a babys toy and after dark there would be one more warrior prowling the pathways between the tents it was easy enough to counterfeit the iron jewelry so long as it didnt need to bear close inspection or the light of day she had learned a great deal this way not as much as she had in the elven tradecities however shed been dividing her time between the wizards citadel generally disguised as a rock formation in caellach gwains favorite cavern for meeting with his band of conspirators and the tradecities in several guises all of them rather clever but the best and most entertaining spying shed done had come when she chose another shape and another household to infiltrate that of a male slave in the house of renas wouldbe husband she stayed there longer than she would have likedbut what she learned made up for the danger from there she once again took wing and returned to the new citadel of the wizards it was easy enough to slip into the cave complex and hide herself among the rocks of the unfinished portions to eavesdrop that too took longer than she wished but was well rewarded she learned that shana and keman were not with the wizards she learned what direction they had gone in that was how she had found them following their track to its logical conclusion and she learned firsthand that the wizards themselves were spending far too much time debating who should be in charge and far too little time on their own defenses nothing that she had learned was going to be pleasant news for her big brother now that she had found him but she intended to deliver that news at a particularly bad time for him she was watching one tent in particular there was someone in it that she wished to have a chat with there good as she had hoped jamal strode out of his tent with a stifflegged gait that bespoke a fair amount of temper held firmly in check when he was in a temper he always went out hunting and he always went alone as she had seen before he paused only long enough to collect his bow and arrows from the weapons rack in its shelter at the side of the wagon and strode out of the encampment no one ventured to stop him everyone knew what he was like in this state and no one wanted him to vent that temper on anything other than a few wild beasts once jamal reached the grasses at the edge of the encampment he broke into the grounddevouring lope typical of these people when they were not riding their cattle they could cover as much ground as any wolf when they chose and right now jamal seemed intent on bettering his record excellent she needed him to be well out of sight or sound of the encampment for what she planned next she continued to circle but now the center of her orbit was jamal a tiny black figure flowing through the grass as a dolphin flowed through water soon soon abruptly he changed direction and as she saw which way he was going she thrilled with pleasure i couldnt have planned this better he was heading for a shallow blind canyon so remote from the camp it might as well have been in elven lands there was a spring at the back of it and two horns often came there to graze that was probably why he was going there she waited a falcon preparing to swoop as he reached the mouth of the canyon paused for a moment then moved inside yes she dove wings flattened tightly to her body falling from the sky a dark stone out of heaven wind rushed against her nostrils against her eyes forcing her to pull her second lid over them to protect them forcing the comers of her mouth back at the last possible moment she flipped and opened her wings backwinging in a thunder of wingbeats breaking her fall and turning it into a true and graceful landing at the entrance to the valley and jamal whipped around mouth falling open in surprise bow and arrows dropping from nerveless fingers as he gaped at the creature that had suddenly appeared to block his way he froze for just a moment then eyes narrowing he snatched up his weapons again and prepared to sell his life dearly myre laughed put your toys away my friend she rumbled at him in his own tongue and i call you friend most deliberately it is said among your people that the enemy of my enemy is my friend is it not jamal nodded cautiously clearly taken aback again as much by her ability to speak his language as by the speech itself well then myre chuckled i am your friend my enemies are yours shall i name them at his second nod she did so and watched as his own eyes narrowed in satisfaction at each name iron priest diric the two com people and she paused significantly the socalled demons shana and keman who are not demons but something else like you jamal said quickly and she gave him a mental accolade for his quickness one of them she told him whichi will tell you later but for now you and i have plans to lay between them we will both have our revenge and youyou will have the leadership of the iron people to share with no one jamal smiled and stood up now completely relaxed he saluted her recognizing a kindred spirit in a strange body she returned his salute and smiled her own smile things were going precisely as she had planned lifewas very very good chapter diric issued the promised invitation in the morning and lorryn and his sister arrived promptly on the heels of his messenger with all their belongings not that they had any real possessions to pack up and move even by the standards of a nomad they had been traveling lightly burdened when they presented themselves so promptly with shy smiles and their feet in boots that were wet with dew he wondered what shana was going to think when she learned that lorryns sister was not another wizard he welcomed them himself as was proper for people he had taken into his household and then left their disposition among his tents to kala his wife he would not usurp even a particle of her authority and where the management of tents and living arrangements was concerned tradition declared that the wifes word was the only word you are certain you do not wish to see them disposed she replied with a quizzical lift of her eyebrow so long as you do not put them in our bed i shall be content with your wise judgment he told her she kept that eyebrow raised many men do not see it that way was her comment diric snorted and that is both a shame and a disgrace what must they prove themselves men by giving no responsibility whatsoever to the women in their lives can their pride not bear it that their woman would dictate even the disposition of a pot or a rug the young warriors must needs be the masters in their tents was all she said as she left with the youngsters in tow before long i fear they must be such masters that they will admit no woman to their ranks diric could only shake his bead but it occurred to him that this was just another symptom of how jamal was undermining even the traditions of forge clan even the first smith had beside him the first wife who gave him the fire for his forges from the hearth that she guarded and taught him every secret that flame and coals held had she not constructed the bellows herself and tended them while he forged out the world while he created the sky the sun and the moon she caught the sparks of the forge and set them in the night sky as stars the smoke from the fire and placed it there as clouds while he forged the earth and the seas she created the delicate filigree of plants to clothe it when he turned his attention to filling it with life she added the ornamental touches of her ownsong and bright feathers for the birds horns and antlers for the grazing beasts scales and fur and hair in all the colors of water earth and sky the man who forgot all that was not only impious but a fool depriving himself of good counsel and a good friend whoever fails to honor his help and mate by honoring all her due authority has no sense and little judgment and besideswhy would anyone want to take on more work when there was someone there to share it hmm well it is not the work such fools are taking on but the power the women still must do the work handicapped by the fact that it is a fool who ordered it well that was but one more place where he differed from jamal and it was small wonder that the war chief could not find a single maiden willing to enter his tent as a wife given his wellknown feelings on the subject of a womans place perhaps that accounted for his preoccupation with conflict he scolded himself for allowing his mind to wander as kala led them away smiling their children were all grown and she often found time hanging heavily on her hands with only the tasks for two to occupy her she was never happier than when they had guests and this long trek so far from other clans had made the possibility of guests unlikely kala knew everything that was in his mind and he could not have trusted the security of these two paleskinned strangers into more certain and capable hands before long she would have seduced their trust out of them and it would be trust well placed kala could answer every question they had and surely they had many kala will also gleefully take it upon herself to clothe the maiden properly and it is just as well that she seems pliant and cooperative for kala will not be denied now he had another facet of his plot to think on how to manufacture an excuse to see the captives frequently they were technically under the jurisdiction of jamal and jamal would take it askance if he called on them too many more times the first smith did not send portents that often that diric would be able to use a portent as an excuse either there were no inquiries about my latenight summons though so that excuse does remain fresh to be used again next time however he must make certain to have some physical evidence of a portent priest diric the voice at his tent flap startled him the more so since it was an unfamiliar one he composed himself quickly perhaps he had been hasty in thinking his portentruse would not be needed enter he said in a deep even tone putting on all of the dignity of his office the young man who entered was arrayed as a warrior but his torque bore the crossed spears of the war chief which meant that he was one of jamals men and not say a herds man seeking divine consultation he gave the full bow of respect however if a fraction belatedly when diric bent a stem gaze on him so in that much at least i still have some power among the tents priest diric i am come from the war chief he said as he rose from his bow diric waited for the man to speak his piece but he seemed to be struggling with the words odd if this was a challenge from jamal would he be so reticent surely jamal would have sent a bolder man the war chief begs a favor of you a gift of your time the man said at last diric raised one eyebrow a gift of my time my time is always at the service of my people the war chief knows that what is it that required favor the man shifted his weight uncomfortably it isthe slaves priest diric the new captives he wishes you to assume the questioning of the new captives as to their origin and the disposition of their people now both eyebrows rose and dirics surprise was unfeigned i he replied incredulously i are not such questions the proper realm of the war chief the mans discomfort grew this is true yet he requests that you assume this questioning and send him word of what you learn diric assumed a stern expression what possible reason can he have for this my time is as valuable as hisand dedicated to the wellbeing of all the clan not only the warriors he had best have a compelling reason for asking me to devote my time to the questioning of demons for the purpose of making war upon them there is nothing in all of the edicts of the first smith that demands we make war upon demons for gain or for good now this was something of an aboutface for diric who had been trying to get more access to the prisoners not less but he hoped that the man would forget this and blurt something out under the pressure of the moment and besides there was a tale of the first smith and the clever sandfox if i protest like the fox that i do not want that rich red meat i truly hate that rich red meat and none but fools eat rich red meat perhaps the meat will be left unguarded he was not disappointed theythey will no longer speak to him priest diric the man got out under the pressure of his disapproving glare the female has told the males with her to refuse to speak to him jamal is reluctant to put them to the question for they could and would say anything to end it and he would have no way of telling truth from falsehood he gulped and sweat stood out on his forehead the female says that she will speak only to you from henceforth diric did not ease his glare in the slightest oh and for what reason does the female demon say she will speak only to me i do not think i care for thisit is altogether too suspicious perhaps the demons wish me some harm perhaps they fear the power of the first smith and seek to rid themselves of the first priest so that they can act without hindrance i do not want that rich red meat whatever shana had done it had embarrassed and angered jamalbut she had done it in such a way that losing his temper would have only brought further shame upon him oh she was clever that maiden mentally he applauded her while giving no outward indication of his glee she says the mans voice was a whisper now as shame for his chief became shame he shared she says she has given him repeated proofs that she and hers are no demons and that she is the war chief of her own people she says that he refused to treat her with the respect of leader for leader he treated her with scorn and she returns scorn for scorn she says that you gave her the proper respect of a warcaptive and that as a consequence she will speak only with you from henceforth she made this declaration this morning before many witnesses oh my how quickly she learns this clever maiden she has used custom against him in a way he cannot refute he wanted to laugh aloud but he kept his demeanor grave very well he replied after a moments pause as if he were considering the request i will speak with the prisoners on jamals behalf it could be that these are not demons and even if they are i will trust in the power of the first smith to protect me from their ill wishing perhaps courtesy will win from them what contempt would not he could not keep himself from adding that last the temptation was too great to overcome the warrior only ducked his head a little between his shoulders as if he could hide his shame by imitating a tortoise you may bring the female to me as i break my fast diric added and waved a dismissing hand the warrior seemed only too pleased to escape kala returned from settling their two guests burdened with his morning meal they are charming children and the girl looks well in that jabba of pale cream she said settling the tray beside him the one that i made for besheba but which she outgrew ere i finished the embroidery he nodded even though he hadnt the faintest idea what she was talking about most clothing looked alike to him except that it was new or old this color or that but kalas one failing was that she never could believe that i think she will be more comfortable properly clothed and it was kind of you to think on he said his voice warm with approval nowhere is a sudden change in things and i have need of your thoughts jamal sent to me a man but a few moments ago he described jamals messenger and the message while kala sat completely still absorbing all of it her dark eyes flashed with pleasure at shanas cleverness and she nodded her round head vigorously ah that was well done husband she exclaimed but not so loudly that her voice would carry past the walls of the tent or past the floor beneath now we may put forth your wn scheme the easier i wish you to remain with me for this little while he said making his wish a request if you can spare the time that is you are better with locks than i perhaps you can determine a way in which to unlock the collars and make it possible to remove them without revealing that they are no longer locked gladly she told him her smile widening making a white crescent across her face like a sliver of moon in the night sky i would like to meet this soclever maiden perhaps i should instruct her on the ways of a manhearted woman so that she can claim that distinction as well it would force jamal to acknowledge her as a warcaptive and not as a slave if she did that is well thought he chuckled very well thought it had not occurred to me jamal will be most discomfited you know he is not in comfort when he must speak even to our own manhearted women and this will vex him greatly he chuckled again thinking of jamals extreme discomfort if shana were to successfully claim that she was manhearted she would then officially be a warcaptive and jamal would be forbidden by law and custom to put her or her underlings to the question he would be completely unable to question her effectively and her mere presence would make him uneasy oh kala was a clever one you remind me yet again why i sought your hand he told her capturing her plump hand in his and squeezing it though i still cannot comprehend why it was my suit that you favored that is why i keep to your tent silly boy she teased returning the caress you value wisdom which lasts over a slimhipped and lissome figure which does not ahi hear them coming regretfully he released her hand and put on his priest face as he had expected shana arrived with a full contingent of jamals guards well that would be changed henceforth he would have his own men fetch her trusted men i believe i know who jamals eyes and ears are among the priests but i shall keep risks to a minimum so he regarded shana with a stem gaze i understand that you wish to impart knowledge to me she nodded and cast scornful glances to either side of her as if to make it plain that she was not going to speak even in the presence of jamals underlings you know the ways of courtesy to a warcaptive and a leader priest diric i will give you my word not to cause trouble nor escape to you and no other she replied shortly and shut her mouth firmly he wondered if her phrasing was accidental or deliberate for she had implied that jamal was ignorant of proper behavior he caught grimaces from one or two of her guards and hidden grins from others hmm and perhaps those last agree with her interesting i wonder how many of his own people jamal has offended with his highhanded ways he glanced aside at kala remembering their conversation all of the manhearted women i would think perhaps i should begin offering them the counsel of the first smith and remind them that the first daughter had a manly heart and fought beside her brother to great honor i do he told the girl gravely and i shall offer that courtesy to you now as i have in the past he looked to the guards you may go the warcaptive has given her word and her parole to me they were not slow to leave making him wonder the more were they that eager to return to jamal with word that they had completed their missionor was the embarrassment of the mission so distasteful that they could not have it done with quickly enough as soon as they were out of the tent and gone kala clapped both hands over her mouth stifling a giggle and shana relaxed grinning at them both did you see how they scurried away kala gasped around her laughter oh the shame they will not make themselves prominent to jamals eyes any time soon i think they will see to it that they volunteer for night watch and far scouting and nothing near to jamals tent or his regard you think so diric felt immensely cheered kala was better at reading the subtle signals of body and expression than he all to the good shana this is kala my wife kala this is our demon i am very pleased to meet you shana replied gravely and halfbowed kala waved an impatient hand at her none of that she exclaimed though diric could tell that she was pleased i am no demon lady to be bowed to nevertheless shana replied respect where it is dueand speaking of respect what did you think of my play we all matched wits after i got back and this was the one notion we thought would give us unlimited access to you diric nodded with approval it was a risk but no more than we already have undertaken and since you made your declaration public jamal could not do anything other than he did without incurring more shame or declaring open warfare between the two of us that would tear the clan apart and even jamal is not prepared to do that yet shana shifted her weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other precisely as the messenger had done earlier i knew it was a greater risk than youre saying she admitted i hoped that your people didnt have a tradition of torturing captives but i knew that was a possibility if jamal was so angry with me that his anger overcame his sense she was wiser than he thought and much older than her years then again she had been according to her own words a captive of the real greeneyed demons and perhaps she had seen cruelties among them that gave her that hardwon wisdom come sit he said instead neither confirming nor denying her statement kala is something of an expert in locks let her look at your collar as shana obeyed taking a seat on one of the fat pillows with no sign of reluctance he added we first unearthed them from the coffers of the first smith when we captured the two males they are very old and i had not seen the like before but it was in the orders of the priests that a store of them was to be kept intact to hold demons and that they were not to be melted down nor reused in any other ways shana tilted her chin to the side as kala examined the lock of the collar his wife made some soft sounds as she always did when she was looking closely at anything and in a moment she made a tching noise that signified her satisfaction simplicity she said in quiet triumph let me get my tools she rose and whisked off into the private quarters returning in no time with a leather pouch of the fine tools that all womensmiths used in making their jewels this lock is very fine very old she said settling herself beside shana and opening up the pouch to remove a set of probes it has the look of something made by a woman in fact it is a trifle more complicated than some i have seen but not as complicated as many i have made myself how old do you think it is shana asked with interest very more than that i cannot say kala probed at the lock with her probes held firmly in her plump clever fingers i suspect that it is old enough that when it was made it was the most complicated lock anyone of the clans had ever seen something like this would not wear out readily so it is hard to judge age by wear or lack of it the tip of her tongue protruded from the corner of her mouth as she concentrated and diric had to restrain a chuckle she always did that it always amused him and that amusement always annoyed her it does bear out a tradition among the women that it was the women who found the means to stop the greeneyed demons from exercising their power when captive oh shana said her tone very neutral kala looked up into her eyes and smiled slyly so you have tried some of your lesser magics and they worked hmm it is well you did not try the greater such as lightning it would have been a painful lesson kala grinned broadly as shana started it is the iron young maiden magic heats it when the wearer attempts to exercise it lesser magics only so much that you might think it no more than the doing of the sun but greater like calling lightnings down from the heavensaieeyou would be most unhappy if it did not kill you altogether she raised both eyebrows at the younger woman as my husband can tell you that as well as the mindwall came to all the first priests in a dream one night straight from the heart of the first smith and his wife but it was the women so the tale says that first thought of using collars on their captives oh this time shana looked chagrined and a little alarmed but what about the way that your warriors were immune to the magic we used against them ah diric spoke up that i know the answer to magic coming from outside is reflected from it so that the wearer takes no harm so you see between the collars and the armor and jewelry we are well protected unless unless magic is not directed against you but against what is around you shana supplied grimly believe me it would not take long at all for the greater elven lords to figure that out they have the advantage of having waged war successfully against your ancestors the ones who fled into the south with their cattle personally i mean it is not tradition that guides them but memory eh diric said sure he had not heard her correctly if your legends say that the demons live forever they are not far wrong shana told him so earnestly he could not doubt her many of the same elven lords who fought your ancestors are still alive and hale today i would not like to see what would happen if your warriors went into a charge on their bulls and a great fissure opened up in the earth in front of them since diric had in his time seen the tragic results of many stampedes in uncertain terrain he could and did know what would happenwith the addition of human bodies to the bovine ones he shuddered and welcomed the distracting click as kala forced the lock of the collar open she took it from shanas neck with another smile see how i trust you because my husband trusts you she remarked bending now over the collar in her lap you know all our secrets and if you were a true demon you would have us at your mercy shana only laughed and felt of her neck i would never have believed how heavy a simple iron band could be it is not the weight of the metal but the bondage that it represents diric said solemnly and she nodded but you have not all of our secrets there remains one do you wish to know it how you can keep me from knowing your thoughts she asked i wonder that you have that secret at all since the elven lords dont have that magic only humans do but humans can be enslaved by demons he reminded her they can even serve them willingly so we learned when we fought beside the com people and were forced to flee but the discipline of the mindwall is easy for one to learn who does not possess even the least and littlest bit of that magic himself our children all are taught it as they are taught to speak until it is as unconscious as breathing so how do you do this she persisted he laughed i thinkvery hard and in the front of my mindof just that a wall a simple blank wall so he demonstrated for her thusit is down thusi create it slowly do you see we call this being doubleminded hiding our thoughts behind the mindwall she frowned as he did it twice more and shook her head i see how you do it but to do it myself it takes much practice when you come to it late he assured her the priests who have the thoughtmagic test all the people at intervals and those who seem weak are given some personal attention to strengthen their wills now you know all shana sighed i knew it had to be something simple both the blankness and the problems with true magic i knew that the elven lords didnt like having iron or steel around them i just never knew why i always assumed that it had something to do with the fact that if they are hurt with the metal they can sicken possibly because bits of the metal too small to be seen poison the wound diric hazarded and then any magic they cast would turn upon the flesh that was woundedwell it does not matter now have you anything to offer me jamal will be expecting great amounts of information about your lands and peoplewhat am i to give him she grinned so hugely he wondered what the jest was i couldnt take the chance that you people might have a way to tell if i was telling the truth or not so i phrased that declaration very carefully my people would be very very pleased to see trouble come to the elves so what i really said was that i would tell you everything i knew about the greeneyed demons now diric saw the jest and stifled his own bellow of laughter behind his wrist oh most excellent and let us be most pedantic and thorough so that we have occasion for many many meetings ill tell you right down to the number of blankets in their storehouses if i know it she promised so where shall we start with the property of the demon closest to our current line of march who is also farthest from your people he said promptly if we must give him a target let us give him a true and tempting one diric she replied after studying him for a moment i come to like you more and more with every passing moment and i you oh crafty maiden he told her truthfully and i you keman got his turn later that afternoon he was looking forward to it with an anticipation that made his teeth ache he wanted out of that cursed collar so badly he could hardly stand it not only because he wanted to go huntin this form it was easier to live on the kinds of foods available to him than it was for dora in her bovine form but he still needed fresh raw meat in quantity every so oftenbut because he wanted to meet dora tonight facetodraconicface what he had learned of her last night had been something of a trauma to both of them she had no idea there were any other dragons in the world at all and he had no idea there were any lairs as far south as hers was without talking to one of her elders he was not able to determine if her people had discovered their own gate if they were a latearriving group from the peaceful haven that his kin had left because it proved boring or if she was even a dragon as he knew them after all dragons and elves were both immigrants to this place from elsewhere there might be yet another group of creatures that had found its way here but the time spent in her company had been far too short and despite all the momentous occurrences since sunset yesterday the meeting she had promised with him for this evening was still the thing that preoccupied his thoughts he begged shana to let him be the second one to have his collar removed using persuasion and some truth so that he could go fly with dora in his true form she had not been able to shift where he could see it last night because that would have been well within sight of both the herds and the herdsmen so he still had no idea what she really looked like the truth was that he had traveled over more of the elven lords lands than any of the four of them when he had made his search for shana after she had been captured by slavers he had not confined his travels to being in elven form either he had made plenty of trips in the air draconic memory for territory was excellent and very precise he would be able to draw maps that should send jamal into paroxysms of delight mero lorryn and kalamadea would be able to add their information that would send jamal into fits of greed as well all of them knew something about the properties that various elven lords held and what they didnt know they were equipped to make up it should be interesting it would be even more interesting if jamal actually got as far as attacking the elves one thing at a time for now it was most important that he get this cursed collar off diric was waiting with stylus and a set of smoothed slabs of clay so was his wife with her little pouch of tools both were smiling as he entered the tent make your rough maps on the clay diric told him without preamble this way you can erase or change things when you are certain of your map i will give it to one of my priests to be burned onto leather he nodded and sat down beside kala dirics wife after several days of living with these people he had begun to accustom himself to their idea of beauty and he could see that she had been a great beauty when she was young and was still quite attractive now she still moved with a precise and studied grace and when she smiled she glowed if her figure had spread with age if gray had crept into her coarse black curls it hardly mattered her eyes were the loveliest that keman had ever seen on a human or even an elven lord a beautiful deep brown as wide and guileless as a does this will not take long now that i have the trick of it she told himand a few moments later after skillful probing with her tools the lock gave a click and the collar came off in her hands he rubbed his neck reflexively with one hand and picked up the stylus in the other grateful now that his mother had taught him reading and writing as the elves practiced it these iron people still had no idea what he wasand he was not about to give that particular secret away and the sooner he got some maps into this clay the sooner he would be out of here free to meet dora for a flight and a hunt it took a little longer than he had really wantedit proved to be much more difficult than he had thought it would be to translate what he remembered from the air and the roads into scratches of the right relative length in the clay by the time he had filled the four clay tablets with maps of the territory between here and lord tylars estate it was fully dark this is very rough he warned as diric placed the last of the tablets into the hands of one of his underpriests there was a lot of detail i had to leave out because of the scale we were working in then you will have to return to give me that detail will you not diric replied logically indeed you and shana and the other two should all be here to give me that detail it will mean many many meetings i would think oh he replied feeling very very stupid for not seeing that very thing of course we want to have many many more meetings right as many as it takes kala replied and held out the hated collar here you are slip this on and push it closed you will hear it click as if it has locked but it cannot lock now it can only latch she showed him a tiny stud on the underside of the collar you push this and it will release and you can take it off thank you he said fervently and slipped the collar back on he tested her work by closing it then opening it again immediately and smiled with relief when it came open exactly as she had promised she only raised an eyebrow at that but made no comment other than you must promise to take those with you i would not want faulty collars in among the rest if all you say is true and if jamal has his way with his dreams of conquest we may well need true collars in the future thank you again he replied to both of them and slipped out of the tent door onto the platform into the cool breeze that always followed the setting of the sun he scampered down the stairs then stopped by the tent to see shana but kalamadea reported that she and mero were with lorryn i shall join them shortly the elder dragon added and what of you ahi want to hunt he said truthfully kalamadea nodded see to it that you go well beyond the herds before you shift then he only said and take the collar with you we do not want it to be found without you inside it not yet anyway keman promised and escaped while he still could dora was waiting for him where she had promised at the edge of the herds he was both pleased and relieved at that she could so easily have taken the chance of the day to make her own escape and he would never have seen her again something happened he told her as soon as he was near enough to recognize her among the other cattle diric is on our side and his wife is fixing our collars so that we can take them off surprise and delight colored her thoughts butthat means we can fly together you can escape not without my friends he replied immediately and perhaps a touch more sternly than he had intended she ducked her head in shamefaced apology i am sorry keman ii forgot about them it is hard to think of them when i do not know them the shame in her thoughts made him feel bad im sorry i snapped at you its been a very hard day he apologized and i havent hunted since we were caught i suspect im pretty sharpset by now my temper is none too certain when im hungry then lets go quickly she urged and he was happy enough to slip his collar shift into the form of a young bull pick up the despised circlet of iron in his mouth and join her in making her way to the edge of the herds she had done this before he hadnt so he followed her lead moving when she moved stopping when she stopped she waited at the edge of the herd for a very long time or at least it seemed that way to him the metallic taste of the collar in his mouth was distinctly unpleasant and he had to keep his head down as if he were grazing to keep it from showing it was very heavy too it made his jaws ache to hold it this way finally she moved out into the grasses slipping like a huge shadow as clouds crossed over the face of the moon he followed his body knowing how to keep his bulky form from making any noise as they moved away from the herd at a rapidly increasing pace soon they were running but they were too far from the herd for the herdsmen to see and if a scout or a herdsman heard them he would probably assume they were some other beast running free and not two of the cattle cattle and other herd beasts wanted to stay together most of the time they were uneasy when they were separated from others only a cow about to calve would wander off by herself and no cow about to calve would be running at a bovine gallop finally dora stopped in a small valley cut by a meandering stream here she said her flanks heaving with exertion and the sweat of her run thick in his nostrils if hed been in draconic form he wouldnt have been able to resist that scentshed have been his dinner not his dinner companion here its safe enough to shift she repeated and be dropped the heavy iron ring only glad that hed been able to keep hold of it all this time his intention had been to watch her as she shifted then to shift himself hunger overcame his intentions as soon as the ring left his mouth and he shifted into his real shape more swiftly than he ever remembered doing before when his sight cleared and sharpened the first thing he saw was a young and delicately made female of his own kind looking up at him with awe and delight he returned the look with interest elated that she was a dragon of his own kind if not his own kin easy enough to sharpen his nightsight now that he could shift without even thinking about it there was enough moonlight for him to make out colors and dora was particularly beautiful in that regard her main color was a soft violet with a dusting of gold over every scale her crest and her neck and spine ridges were that same gold over a deep purple most females were larger than males but dora was exactly the same size that be was and if she hadnt been holding her head and long graceful neck lower than his shed be looking him straight in the eyes the eyes were beautiful too a sparkling gold that matched her crest she was stunningand he felt altogether stunned he knew he had never seen a female as lovely as she never in all of his life my goodness she blurted still looking up at him you didnt tell me you were handsome well you didnt tell me that you were beautiful he replied as gallantly as he could while still feeling stunned she giggled and coyly bobbed her head glancing at him out of one eye in the most charming manner imaginable you must be faint with hunger to say something like that she replied breathlessly come on well hunt together she turned and launched herself into the air as graceful as she was beautiful and what could he do but quickly clasp the iron ring around his wrist and follow it didnt take them long to find gamethe plains near the iron people were virtually empty but that meant that the game that was usually roaming there had been driven out of its usual pastures into territory where the displaced animals were interlopers the newcomers didnt know where cover was where it was safe to rest and they were under constant threat from the animals whose territory was rightfully here in time theyd settle down but just now they were easy prey the carnivores of the plains were taking ruthless advantage of their vulnerability and so would keman and dora they each managed to bring down some sort of plains deer showing off he lifted his into the air to set it down next to hers so that they could feast together once the edge was off his hunger he kept giving her sidelong glances as he ate more than once he caught her doing the same every time he looked at her he got a strange fluttery feeling in the pit of his stomach like hitting a pocket of air turbulence but more pleasurable every time she looked at him he felt as if hed called lightning to chase him she had eaten last night she was quickly sated and nudged the remains of her deer over to him when she was through he accepted the gift with gratitude he was starving and no fluttery feelings were going to interfere with his hunger so what exactly happened she asked preening the blood from her claws delicately you said that last night diric suddenly came over to your side between bites he explained it all to her right up until the moment that hed left diric with the maps she listened carefully nodding from time to time and occasionally asking a question those questions showed that she knew more about these people than even kalamadea and that shed personally observed quite a bit more about the important individuals among them in the time shed been spying on them jamal is dangerous she said flatly when he was done the problem is he is also clever intelligent and very charismatic if he is clever and charismatic enough he could very well convince his people to attack these elves of yours if he is even more clever he will find someone or something to attack that will allow him a victory and some impressive booty then before anyone can react properly hell turn the clan around and take them back down to the homelands then what keman asked a little bewildered what would that gain him except for a few trinkets even if he looted all of lord tylars estate the gain would be next to nothing divided up among all these people but if he didnt divide it she countered if he kept it all in one big pile it would look very impressive it would awaken hunger for more in not only this clan but every other clan he showed it to oooh keman said then seeing exactly what she was getting at then once everyone wants some of the loot he makes himself the leader of all the clans and comes right back up here she nodded i dont know if these elves of yours could beat him if they are clever they probably could but i do know that with that many people coming up here looking for loot the clans are going to run into your friends unless they can pull themselves into that mountain of theirs and shut all entrances for a year he considered that they might be able to the rest of my lair could certainly make it very unpleasant for iron people trespassing near the mountain but here is the other thing she continued even if jamal suffers enough defeats that he decides to put the clans in retreat hell still be their leader once he reaches the homelands again hell start looking for something else to conquerand sooner or later hell find my folk keman shivered he remembered kalamadea telling shana quite calmly that the iron weapons the warriors carried could and would kill both dragons before they could shift and magic or no magic dragons in the sky were still vulnerable to powerful bows we have to stop him you have to escape first she pointed out and paused for a moment ill help you she finished as if with the words she had finally made up her mind you will his head reeled with delight youll come with me dont tell anyone about me yet she amended hastily please i have to think about all this firsti have to decide how to tell my folk that there are othersi i promise he pledged before she could go on you can stay secret as long as you like as longas long as i can see you every night he added shyly you would you want to she stammered of course but there was no more talk of plans or escaping for the rest of the night lorryn was not entirely sure how shana was going to react to his sister for that matter he was not certain how the young halfblood that was with her was going to react there was certainly nothing in renas true appearance to make anyone think of her as a threat but still well there was no hope for it the sooner they got the confrontation over with the better this section of the huge tent that kala shared with her husband that had been assigned to him and his sister was a far cry from the little tent theyd been given on their arrival hed always been under the impression that a tent was a tentthat there wasnt a great deal you could do to make one luxurious or even all that comfortable he knew now that he was wrong if he hadnt known they were in a tent and not say a pleasurepavilion he wouldnt have been able to tell the difference rugs softened the wooden floor of the wagon lying six or seven deep around the curve of the tent wall a finely woven mesh was fastened to ornamental wickerwork that came up to about his knee this was so that when the walls of the tent were raised to let in fresh air around the base of the tent insects were kept out the walls themselves were hung with tapestries that extended down to the top of the wickerwork hiding the rough felt of the tent walls and providing extra insulation against heat or cold beautifully made lanterns hung from the ceiling burning what kala said was scented butter whatever it was it gave a clear light and the scent in it perfumed the air with a faint but pleasant musk the ubiquitous cushions were piled everywhere their bedpads were soft and stuffed with dried grasses and herbs covered with finely woven blankets and furs he could not identify the tent itself was divided by felt partitions also covered with tapestries the walls moved slowly in the breeze blowing through the mesh on the exterior wall kala had provided rena with garments she said had belonged to one of her daughtersa daughter whod had a distressing tendency to outgrow clothing before it could be finished rena had changed into it gratefully the clothing shed brought with her was hardly suited to the summer heat of the plains lorryn thought she looked charming in itand as unlike a typical elven maiden as possible it only remained to see if the other two thought the same kala ushered the two halfbloods in leaving with a nod lorryn waved at the cushions and took one himself lorryn this is mero valyns half cousin shana said by way of introduction i expect you know about him some lorryn tilted his head to the side and studied the thin dark young man with the startlingly bright emerald eyes even as the young man studied him theyre saying now in the councils that valyn himself was a halfblood that he wouldnt have revolted against his own kind if hed been truly of elven blood mero snorted oh as if having dyran for a father wasnt enough to make anyone with half a conscience and any amount of compassion revolt both of those qualities are in short supply on the council lorryn reminded him welli told shana very little about the two of us so now that i have both of you here i should give you the tale in greater detail he did so omitting nothing about their escape except the fact that rena was not a halfblood it was a deliberate omission he wanted all this fresh in their minds when he did bring rena in logically since mero was cousin to a fullblooded elven erlord who had risked and lost all to save him they shouldnt be prejudiced against her on the other hand logic had very little to do with prejudice when he finished shana let out the breath shed been holding it sounds like quite an escape she told him a lot more exciting than my personal escape after the auction if it conies to that more exciting than the one valyn and i had too mero admitted we never actually saw our pursuers you know we just knew they were there would have been just as pleased to have made a quiet escape personally lorryn told them both shrugging although if we manage to come through this all right i will admit to being glad things worked out this way i wish i knew what happened to my sisters maid though he added with a frown she doesnt sound like anyone we know shana said after a sidelong glance at mero on the other hand there are ways that some of us can disguise ourselves that dont qualify as illusions so she could have been if she wastrust me shell be all right not even falling into a river would harm one of our people with that sort of power well that was something of a relief you just took one burden of guilt off my back he replied gratefully nowill discharge myself of another he raised his voice a little rena rena pushed aside the partition to her segment of the tent on the cue shed been waiting for and came into the light she looked worried hesitant and very vulnerable she also looked unmistakably elven shana only raised one eyebrow though mero sucked in a breath of surprise i wondered what you were hiding about her the wizard told him with a hint of smile its nice to see that valyn wasnt the only decent person of his blood around she stood up and extended her hand to rena with no sign of hesitation it is very good to meet you without illusions she said as rena took the hand gingerly and any sheltered maiden who could partner her brother through the wilderness as cleverly as you did is something more than she appears to be id like to hear your ideas so would i mero said and indicated a cushion between himself and lorryn would you join us yes thank you rena replied smiling and relaxing visibly i hope i can help at least a little you can help a lot lorryn said forcefully as she took the indicated seat with a sidelong glance at mero shana sat down again and he turned instinctively toward her the one thing that neither of you know and neither do i is the kind of magic that only the females are taught its very subtle it works on the level of the very small for instance where you or i wouldsaycollapse this tent by crushing it outright rena would do something entirely different id weaken all the supporting poles and ropes she offered diffidently as soon as the breeze came up the way it does every evening it would collapse now if the object was to trap people inside for a crucial few moments obviously her way would be better lorryn continued well only if you wanted to trap them at that particular time but i see your point shana replied then suddenly turned toward rena and stared at her whats the matter lorryn asked quickly but shana only shook her head nothing really she replied i justsomething about your sister seemed familiar for a moment thats all lorryn had the feeling that there was a lot more to it than that given the measuring glances shana kept casting on rena but since she didnt seem hostile only thoughtful he finally decided that it was probably some mysterious female thing that no male would ever understand and dismissed it from his concern anyway if what diric wants is some way for us all to disappear that makes it appear as if we could have done so at any time rena may be able to leave some signs that will confuse them no end he pointed out for that matter she could make changes in the food that will put jamals warriors to sleep she could collapse the tent after weve gone dont make too many promises lorryn rena interrupted blushing ill do what i can but im not a great wizard like lathe elvenbane is she said clearly unable to force herself to call shana by anything other than her title but shana only laughed believe me am not the great wizard that the elvenbane is she replied warmly with a friendly smile that brought another blush to renas cheeks and an answering smile to lorryns lips if i were do you think wed have been caught in the first place no the best thing we can do is to assess all of our abilities and use them to advantage there is a real value in being able to work subtle magics taming the alicorns the way you did for instance orsaystopping a heart shana cast that last out carelessly or so it seemed but lorryn caught a gleam in her eyes as she waited for renas response and to his surprise his sister went just a little pale but her reply was steady enough ithat had occurred to me she said softly i did try it once with a bird that was already dying never again though she had that surprised him more than almost anything else today its not a power to use lightly was all shana said but she said it so soberly that he knew deep within his heart that the burden of all of the dead of the second wizard war lay heavily on her soul and always would but sometimes her eyes looked far away into some bleak place where he could not go sometimes you arent given a choice if by using a power like that you could save an innocent life then she shook herself and returned to the present any way the last thing im going to ask you to do is use something like that onsayjamal he hasnt actually hurt anyone yet he might not he might be so frightened and alarmed by discovering were going that he might turn his people right back around and go home he might get a latenight visitation from his god telling him mat hes been a naughty boy anything could happen rena nodded but her relief at shanas words was written clearly in her expression mero reached out and patted her hand comfortingly she smiled shyly at him calling up a reassuring smile in return he did not remove his hand from hers oh really was lorryns startled thought and for just an instant all the instincts of the protective brother rose up in him but they subsided just as quickly why not after all when had she ever met any fullblood whod treated her with a fraction of the courtesy that mero had even in the few moments since theyd met he could simply be offering kindness to her oh yes and my ancestors on both sides will rise up out of their graves and declare peace between the races and what if something more did develop between them was it any of his business the little he knew of mero personally he liked certainly no one could live around shana for long and continue to harbor the usual elven prejudices about females but what was shana going to do about this had she even noticed a quick glance in her direction told him that she had noticed her eyes were on the linked handsand she was smiling ever so slightly well well well if shana didnt mind if she approved who was he to interfere and nothing at all may come of this anyway he reminded himself and turned his mind and attention back to the topic at hand after all nothing could come of this until they were all free and away from this place myre was altogether pleased with the way things were going at the citadel old caellach gwain was slowly undermining the authority of those that shana had left in chargeand with every day that passed that did not bring shanas return even those loyal to her lost some of their confidence careful never to go where one of the dragons might spot her she moved among them in the guise of a former human slave dropping little hints fragments of doubt perhaps shana had deserted them perhaps she had been captured by the elven lords perhaps she had fallen victim to some horrid monster of the wilderness something no one had ever encountered before with care and guile she spread the insidious doubtsthat no matter what the cause shana the elvenbane was never coming back caellach gwain bless his twisted old heart was quick to pick up on the rumors and spread them further denelor and the senior wizard were hard put to keep their hold over the others at this point let them come up against the first real danger or hardship and the unity of the wizards would shatter like shale and as for jamal she waited for him in her deadend canyon he had not yet been ready to ally with her at their last meeting but she sensed he was close he was probably waiting to find out just what it was that she wanted like any properly cautious creature the soft thud of hooves warned her he had arrived and she settled herself for a nice productive talk she had decided if he asked her what her reward would be for her aid that she would tell him the truth it was a truth that he would certainly understand the warbull with jamal leading it afoot plodded around a bend toward her he stopped at a prudent distance from her i am here he said simply as am i she replied with a nod of her head so i have offered alliance war chief you said that you wished to think on it have you thought i have his heavy brows drew together you have not said what it is that you will gain from this alliance it is said an ally who asks for nothing expects everything that is not a bargain i am prepared to make myre hissed laughter and a wise man you are but you war chief will surely understand what it is that i wantfor although to some it may seem insignificant it is a reward beyond price for me he waited silent for her to name that reward revenge she breathed and saw his entire face light up with understanding and appreciation you have as captives my enemy and my brother that is my reward a free hand with each done he said instantly and grounded the butt of his spear in the earth i swear it by the red earth and the black by the forge and the fire nowhow are we to make use of this alliance he cocked his head to one side quizzically you know for i have shown you that i can take any form i please she replied sofirst i shall go among your people in a form that none would suspect and i will listen and learn who is your friend who is your foe and who is undecided then when the time is right you declare for yourself the full power of the clan leadership with a dragon to ride as proof of your mastery you select a few who most oppose you and she delicately examined her talons i think i need say no more he nodded pleased i doubt that many will continue hi opposition once the first lessons have been dispensed he said with a bloodthirsty chuckle that would have sounded well in the throat of a dragon and after if you continue to walk in that formwithnosuspicion we will continue to learn who opposes in silence hmm precisely now it was her turn to cock her head to the side quizzically i assume you do have a form in mind oh yes now he laughed and that is the cream of the jest so let me tell you if shana had allowed herself any time to think of anything but their immediate problem she knew she would have been baffled bewildered and entirely turned round about by now she had thought that she was and would always be in love with valyn poor valyn who had sacrificed himself to save all of them from his father her friendship with mero had never turned to anything more than that after all nor did her friendship with zed or with any of the other wizards her own age she had told herself that love only came onceand that it was her job to take the life that valyn had given to her and make the best she could of it after a year she was even able to enjoy herself again she had thought that would never be so hearttouched again nownow she was not only no longer so sure of that she was no longer so sure that she had ever been in love with valyn at all infatuated of course emotionally at a boiling point certainly but in love perhaps not her first reaction when she saw lorryn without any illusion cloaking his features was to compare him to valyn and in that comparison he came out a poor second in a way it was inevitable that she should do so since his elven blood was so clearly in his features as opposed to mero who looked far more human or even me she reminded herself her hair had grown out enough that combing it out was a necessity and a chore but the time needed to untangle it gave her time to think about something other than problems and that flaming red hair coiling itself around her fingers was a stark reminder that there was very little of the elven maiden in her either lorryn on the other handwell compared to valyn he was a copy of a masterpiece by an inexperienced student his human blood coarsened and thickened his features just enough that it was very noticeable so her first impression based on looks alone was not a favorable one ah but then he opened his mouth that was when she realized that appearance was the smallest part of lorryn and that he could have been as coarse as a muddoll and she would have paid attention to him he listens to me which is more than valyn ever did most of the time he gives my ideas the same weight as his own and his own are nothing to be ashamed of she took a bit of leather cord and began braiding her hair working carefully to keep from making more knots than shed taken out he was sensible too just because he really liked an idea that didnt mean he wasnt prepared to give it up if someone came up with a reason why it wouldnt work he was willing to learn from all of them from shana who was female from mero who was younger than he from his own sister whom by all logic he should have held in the gentle contempt that all elven males held for their women not mat they hadnt had their share of fights well more like squabbles mostly because we were all tense but he had been just as willing to patch things up and apologize as she had been once their tempers had cooled and after the events of the past two years she had learned to apologize to just about anybody if it had to be done hadnt she learned to be polite to the old whiners she hadnt expected the same out of him however and nownow she was going out of her way to spend time with him she could have been spending alone she was fussing with her clothing and hair things she hadnt cared about in a year or more she had confided things to him that she hadnt told anyone elsenot facts but feelings the way she hated being the elvenbane the horrible weight it put on her when people expected miracles of her and the worse weight of rancor when they didnt she had confessed how the burden of responsibility often felt as if it was going to crush her spiritand precisely how poor a leader she really was when it came down to cases she thought he understood at least he listened he didnt trivialize what she was feeling she shook her head a little and tied off the end of her braid shed made a kind of appointment with him tonight him and him alone because there was something else going on with their little group of conspirators that could cause some difficulties if he disapproved she didnt know if hed noticed but it seemed to her that shed better talk to him about this business of mero and his sister just in case he hadnt although how he could not notice when the two of them were taking long walks in the moonlight before bed at precisely the same time she had no idea then again males were sometimes a bit more oblivious to that than females were or so shed heard she slipped out of the tent the empty tent mero had already gone off on his quest for exercise keman and kalamadea were hunting the two elves were entertaining their captors and would not be back until after midnight at best there was no one to notice her going kala noticed her arrival though when she presented herself to the priestguard at the entrance to dirics tent that wise woman only smiled assured the guard that dine was expecting the demon and waved her inside diric of course was nowhere to be found kala went off to her side of the tent chuckling at something under her breath shana was just as glad she hadnt insisted on playing escort this was going to be difficult enough as it was lorryn was waiting at the entrance to his slice of tent holding the flap of the partition open for her his golden hair shining with the sheen of the true metal in the lamplight i heard you outside he said by way of explanation she slipped inside and he dropped the flap behind her taking his favorite pillow and gesturing to hers so what was so important that you needed to talk to me late at night one eyebrow rose shrewdly without rena and without mero both of whom seem to have pressing concerns elsewhere or can i guess i think you already have she replied both relieved and a little deflated at the same time after the way shed been steeling herself to present the terrible revelation to him so my precious sister is falling in love with a halfblood if she hasnt done so already he shook his head dolefully aye me what is this world coming to it is the end of civilization as we know it unnatural depraved he pulled a long face and stroked an imaginary beard with feigned agitation in a clever imitation of a horrified elder of any race it was so clever that she broke into a fit of giggles he grinned and dropped the pretense as long as you dont mind how could i he countered mero is your friend after all and i dont know what he could have meant to you before this and im not asking he added hastily before she could say anything rena is her own woman and has the right to make up her own mind about who she ties herself to in any way the ancestors know she paid for that right he fell silent for a moment but she sensed he had a bit more to say she was betrothed to a complete idiot just before we ran away it was lord tylars idea a marriagealliance with a family that was older and more powerful than ours and he would have had her mind altered before if he had to if that was what it would take to put the marriage through she says that and in retrospect i believe her how could i not wish her well shana shrugged mero and i have never been more than friends although his cousin tried to play matchmaker between us it didnt work and the least said about that the better i know that he really likes rena as a person and i know hell never treat her as less than a person after that she shrugged again who knows whatever happens happens when we get back to the citadel though i dont think you need to worry about the wizards refusing to take her in not after what valyn did for us he sighed i have to admit that i had been worried about that if you wouldnt take her id have to go with her i couldnt abandon her too too she was aching with curiosity but she wouldnt ask not with the pain in his eyes so stark it matched any of her own burdens but he looked up from his hands and he offered her the answer like a gift motherelven lady viridinais my real mother it was my father who was the human he told her softly she sheltered me with illusion until i was old enough to understand told me what i was and taught me to protect myself i told you why we had to run that mages of the council were coming to test me for illusion to unmask me as a halfblood father knows that he is fullblooded i couldnt stay to be discovered but by running i practically admitted im a halfblood so that leaves your mother as having taken a human lover shana breathed and it would have to have been a deliberate pregnancy wouldnt it it means the end of everything for her he acknowledged bleakly she can feign insanity she can create a false memory for the council members of having her own child born dead and a halfblood substituted by the midwife if they choose to press the subject that wont explain why i looked like a fullblood from the beginning but if she pretends to go insane all theyll do is lock her up in lord tylars keeping but shell live out all of her time in three small rooms a prisoner in her own home denied anything but the most basic necessities lord tylar will never forgive her deception more than that he will never forgive the implication that he could not father a son he was more troubled and guilty than he appeared shana sensed that clearly he felt as if everything that was happening to his mother now was somehow his fault unfortunately there wasnt a great deal she could say and none of it would be very comforting or ease his burden of guilt so rather than mouth platitudes she kept her thoughts to herself and simply let what comfort could come from her presence ease him finally he looked up from his clasped hands with a wan smile i have one question for you shanabut im afraid its personal and entirely impertinent and i have no right to ask it oh then you might as well she told him im supposedly an expert in impertinence were you in love with valyn since she had just been pondering that very question herself it caught her unawares and she answered before she could stop herself if youd asked me that a month ago id have said yes she replied with an honesty that shocked her as she listened to the words coming from her own mouth nowim not sure im beginning to thinkmaybe not ah he replied and his smile became a bit less wan good good she asked sharply why good because it means i have a chance he said his own candor shocking her further as he unclasped his hands and captured one of hers i can do my best and see if its enoughbut it wouldnt be enough if youd been in love with valyn i cant compete with a ghost oh that was all she could manage as she stared at him with wide round eyes i see i think you do he stared into her eyes for a moment longer then got to his feet tugging her gently to hers meanwhile i think mero and rena have the right idea shall we follow their example sheyrena thought that she had never been so happy in her life as she and mero walked slowly in the moonlight soft breezes stirring scent out of the grass beneath their feet insects and birds singing all around them it was easy to forget that they were captives and simply hold to the moment she had spent her life grasping at moments of transitory happiness she was well practiced at it mero was completely unlike a hero out of a romancenot too surprising really since all those romances were written under the careful eye of elven males and while they would portray the kind of male an elven maiden would find attractive they would also portray the male other males would find appropriate he had not come into her life swept her off her feet and proceeded to wrap her in a cloak of protection and make all her decisions for her no be had been supportive but not precisely protective when her own uncertainties surfaced as they were all too prone to do he would give her a look or a handclasp that said without words you can do this you can contribute you are clever enough that was more important to her than all of the words of protection in the universe you can hold your own his hand held out to her was not the hand of the master but the hand to help her over a difficult spot one that expected her to do the same in return for him a pin for your thoughts mero said softly she laughed ohthat i am very glad that you are yourself if i werent myself who would i be he replied comically not that idiot i was betrothed to anyway she had told him all about that horrid betrothal dinner he had grimaced in sympathy but then he had pointed out how the concubine must be feeling in all this that she must surely be afraid of losing her position and when that happened it was a long long fall at the end of that long fall mere would probably be plenty of her fellow slaves who would be happy to see her brought down she had thought then of all her own fathers former concubines and had realized that much of their bitterness was due to that very thing how could they not feel bitter and what other recourse did they have to ease their broken pride but the kinds of subtle insubordination she had seen over and over her mother must have known matand it was why her mother had ignored it showing sensitivity that rena had not at the time imagined well im glad im myself too and i am glad that you are becoming more of yourself he squeezed her hand gently and she moved a little closer to him cattle lowed somewhere in the distance you are stronger every day you know you remember more and more often not to be afraid oh im a coward for all of that she told him but he shook his head no you only forget now and again that youre really very brave thats all he took the hand he held turned it palm upward and planted a kiss in it closing all her fingers around it keep that to help you remember she shivered with pleasure and happiness and felt herself blushing i will she whispered i know he replied and he did that was the glorious part he did know she held to the moment as she held to the kiss whatever else came she had this she would always have this chapter today while jamal was watching his warriors in their practice games the conspirators were meeting for the first time under blue skies rather than beneath the roof of a tent keman glanced around their little gathering uneasily he didnt like the fact that they were meeting in the open in a clear space between two of the tents belonging to the priests but he hadnt been able to voice his objections clearly he had been uneasy from the moment when jamal capitulated to shanas demand to speak only to diric there was something wrong there had been for some time but the wrongness lay only in the fact that things were going entirely too well that made his unease all the more difficult to justify jamal was silent where they were concerned he made no inquiries about them accepted the maps and lists of properties and the means used to guard them with no comment and didnt seem to care about anything else there was something very wrong about thatgiven the fact that jamal had been shamed before his own people by shanas declarations and jamal was not a man to take such things lightly he was a bad man to have as an enemy he would never forget a slight much less a wrong shana told keman that he was manufacturing trouble where there was none and asked him with a touch of acidity if things were simply not perilous enough for him but he could not get over the feeling that there was something they were all missing and the clues were in jamals behavior if they could only read them today had begun warm and was soon sweltering muggy without a hint of breeze heat shimmered the air above the grasses and sweat did not dry it only trickled down the body without cooling anything the tents had collected so much heat that not even the iron people could bear to remain within them even diric had agreed to shanas suggestion that they conduct their business outside for a change after all jamal and every warrior in the clan were supposed to be engaging in contests today to determine their fitnessthough fitness for what jamal was not yet ready to reveal not to the majority of the clan anyway it seemed safe enough for them all to meet in the open yet keman could not escape the feeling that they were all somehow following a plan of jamals devising if we could arrange for the roof of the tent to part as if we had all grown claws to rend it then wings to fly away shana suggested as keman returned his attention to the group or would it be better to look as if we had escaped into the earth instead that would be my preference kalamadea began perhaps by oh what a touching little gathering a slow drawling voice interrupted loudly kalamadea shana and keman all jerked upright as if their heads had been on strings pulled by a puppetdancer for the language of the speaker was not the iron peoples tongue it was that of the dragons and the voice was someone keman recognized only too well myre a tall woman of the iron people lean and muscular and dressed as a warrior leaned indolently against the side of a wagon it was no form that keman recognized and yet the woman had all of the arrogant stance that he associated with his sister and she had a dragonshadow you see lord jamal the woman continued in the tongue of their captors a sly smile on her face it is as i told you the priest confers with the demons to aid in their escape and as i claimed the two com people are not corn people at all but yet more demons even lorryns illusions were something the iron people were able to see through if they simply stopped believing in them jamals eyes narrowed as he stared at lorryn and his sister and he nodded slowly kemans heart stopped so i see jamal stepped forward a pace and stood with his arms crossed over his chest an angry smile on his face i see six enemies and one traitor orperhaps not i shall give you a chance to save yourself diric perhaps you have grown senile with age diric and these demons have deluded you perhaps it is time for the powers of the priest to pass into the hands of the war chief should you decide to come to your senses and grant me those powers i might forget this meeting this all had the sound of something carefully rehearsed as if jamal was reciting words he knew by heart butwhy diric stood up slowly his face as still as the iron of his forges you will have those powers only if you dare to challenge me for them young fool he replied his own voice as cold as the snows in the mountains and remember i can name a champion diric had been courting the manhearted women who were angry with jamals treatment of themand who composed some of the best fighters in the clan he could name one of them as a champion and not only would the fight likely go to her since jamal was somewhat out of practice but jamals defeat would mean disgrace in his own eyes as can i came the lazy reply and i chooseher and unexpectedly he pointed to myre i think you have no champion her like the war chief continued gleefully openly reveling in the shock of dirics face if i were you i should surrender your authority now it will go easier on all of you and myre smiled the smile of someone who knows that the dice are loaded that the game is already decided of all of them keman was the swiftest to realize what the sly smile on myres face meant and the smug one on jamals shes told him or she showed him he knows that shes a dragon and before diric could make the fatal error that jamal was probably expecting of naming one of the other manhearted women as his own champion keman acted he pulled open his collar threw the collar to the ground and shifted as quickly as he had ever done in his life forcing the others to spring to their feet and back away as his rapidly increasing bulk filled the space between the tents he shifted so quickly that it made him dizzy but he fought back his dizziness as he towered over them all the surprisebut utter lack of shock on jamals facetold him that he had guessed right jamal knew that myre was a dragon and he had seen the shift from human to dragon before but maybe myre had not told him there were two other dragons among the prisoners or else both of them had assumed that the collars were still functional diric chooses me he roared as myre belatedly followed suit shock still visible on her rapidly changing face i am the first priests champion then before myre could end her shift leap upon him and end the conflict before it could begin he took to the sky with a thunder of wings that halfcollapsed the tent nearest him a cloud of dust and dead grass billowed up around the place where he had stood and those closest to him threw up their arms to protect their faces from a pelting then the tents dwindled below him as he pumped his wings rapidly gaining altitude going from tents to toys to the merest mushrooms on the greengold plain beneath him altitude was his friend and ally myre had defeated him before in a straight combat she was bigger and heavier than he was even now he dared not allow her to close with him to take the fight to a point at which that weight and length could make a difference he would have to defeat her with brain not brawn running away little brother came the sneering voice in his mind running so soon leading the race little sister he taunted back having trouble keeping up with me been eating a bit too well lately havent you i thought that might be a bit of a paunch i saw perhaps a layer of fat around your hips hed seen no such thing of course but if he was going to force her to do what he wanted he was going to have to enrage her until she wasnt thinking anymore his best weapons were agility and speed he had to keep her in the air for that he had to keep her following him better give in to me before its too late brat she answered back furiously or else keep running and leave your pets behind i might let you go crawling back to those twolegger friends of yours while theres still something left to crawl back to something to crawl back to had she information that he didnt have about the wizards it certainly sounded like it he didnt reply no point in it if she wanted him to know something shed tell him she couldnt help herself and if it was bad news she would definitely want to tell him to demoralize him and make him stop thinking she was sending her voice out to every mind capable of picking it up too and he knew why she wanted shana and kalamadea to hear the trouble was she didnt know that dora was out there as well dora was his hidden ally the unknown factor that could defeat myres ultimate purposes even if keman lost this fight if the very worst happened and he was defeated even if myre managed to destroy or imprison all of them dora would know what it was that myre wanted to taunt keman with if it was information vital to the wizards dora would surely see that it got to them before it was too late wouldnt she he didnt want to call to her myre might overhear he had to keep all of his attention on what he was doing he could only hope and wait for anger to force the words out of his sister your wizards are in revolt against each other little brother she spat as below him she pumped her wings furiously to try and catch up to him the old ones want the old ways back again the younger are refusing to serve them and they are all so busy with their little internal grievances that they are not bothering to keep a watch on the elves and they really should lorryns escape has sent them all into a panic and they are already planning to unite their magics for the first time in centuries to track you all down and destroy you the council is moving to reconcile every feud and grievance that has ever erupted they are moving slowly but they are moving soon within a few moons by spring at the latest the third wizard war will beginand it will be the last wizard war his heart went cold she would not have said anything at all unless she was sure of her information and the feeling of familiarity with the council that permeated her thoughts made him certain that her information was as accurate as it was foreboding the elven lords refusal to reconcile their differences and work properly together was all that had saved the wizards from annihilation the last time with that factor gone he took himself firmly in hand this was no time for distractions never mind it hadnt happened yet and he had a fight to win before he could see that it didnt he continued to gain height wings pumping strongly heading straight up into the sun which gave him the added advantage that myre couldnt see him which meant she couldnt see what he was doing he had a considerable height advantage on her now would it be enough only one way to find out abruptly he flipped over folded his wings and plummeted straight down talons fisted in front of him like a falcons fisted claws not for nothing had he been studying the way that hawks and falcons flew and fought he would have to be the little peregrine here who weighed far less than the ducks he pursued more than that he would have to be the peregrine defending his nestlings from a goshawk he would have to outfly her to outfight her he dove at myre with the wind of his passage whistling in his nostrils and pulling at the edges of his wings he had to fight the pressure of the air to keep his wings tucked in tight to his body had to strive with aching muscles to keep his rear legs pulled in hard against his stomach myre still had no idea what he was doing she grew larger and larger in his sight squinting against the light wings pumping lungs panting as she tried to catch him then suddenly her eyes widened as she spotted him diving down at her out of the sun abruptly she turned her first instinctive action to turn tail and evade his attack too late with a thud that surely reached down to the ground he hit her in the back of the head with both fisted foreclaws knocking her into an uncontrolled tumble and surely bringing stars to her eyes but it would take more than one blow to the head to knock myre out of a fight and her instincts were sure before she could lash out with her claws and catch him he snapped his wings open again and turned the dive back into a climb the sudden pressure of air against his wings was so much like hitting a solid object that it made him gasp and his speed was so great at that point that he shot past her before he could begin climbing again he lost sight of her for a moment as he fought to control his own headlong climb when he found her again she was far below him but doggedly climbing to reach him once more she said nothing now though even when he taunted her about being too fat to fly though his chest muscles were afire with exertion and his wings aching with stress he smiled the only time myre didnt talk was when she was so angry that she couldnt respond but he knew he couldnt expect his attack to work a second timeat least not in the same way she might be angry but she was a good fighter and had probably gotten better since the last time hed dealt with her somake her think he was going to try the same tactic again feint to draw her out and switch to something else at the last minute that could work he turned head over heels again and dove a second time although this time he did not have the advantage of the sun behind him he had intended instead of thumping her in the back of the head to rake her back with his hindclaws perhaps even tearing the tender membranes of her wings but myre wasnt finished yet as he feinted then snapped his wings open an instant earlier than before she turned on her back risking all in a desperate attempt to grapple with him and carry him down he eluded her only by sideslipping violently and be lost all the advantage of the speed his dive had given him in that panicked maneuver she could have had him thenexcept that she had counted on being able to close and she lost even more height trying to recover both from the flip and the uncontrolled tumble it sent her into once again he raced for the sunbut slower this time his breath burned in his throat and lungs as he panted his wings felt as heavy as stones and his body a burden too great for his wings to carry now what now what i cant keep running like this she has more endurance than i do have to end this and end it quickly running me out of endurance was how she won that last fight finally it came to him it was desperatebut right now a desperate chance might be the only one hed have once again he turned and dove once again she flipped over to grapple with him claw to claw this time he let her catch him her foreclaws grabbed and locked with his her hind claws raked across his bellyskin sending rivers of agony racing along his nerves he screamedbut pulled her closer pulling her head between his wings and he sent the lash of captured lightning that was a dragons most feared weapon arcing between the tips of his wings catching her head in the middle her mouth snapped open in a silent scream her head arched back on her long neck until the back of her head met her shoulders her claws convulsed closed once as he maintained the arcthen when he released the lightning she went limp he was ready for that or else she might have achieved a pyrrhic victory by making them both tumble headlong out of the sky onto the hard and unforgiving earth he pumped his wings furiously as her limp body dragged at his holding both of them in the air in a controlled fall instead of an uncontrolled one instead of both of them tumbling and plummeting to earth he achieved a hard landing with her body still locked in his talons fortunately he had her to cushion his fall he was not feeling charitable enough not to take advantage of that just as well since she had started to come to just as they landed her head hit the ground and the force of the blow knocked her out again not for long just long enough for him to pin her to the ground helpless beneath his weight as the wizards ran toward them from the tents behind the wizards the humans of the iron people approached them cautiously shift myre he growled into a human do it now or i swear ill youll what she taunted although there was panic in her eyes as she tried to squirm away and couldnt youll kill me you havent the stomach ill break your wings he spat ill shred them and ill break every bone so that no matter how well you heal youll never fly again ill do it myre i will he saw by the fear in her that she believed himand of course it never occurred to her that she could simply shift to heal any damage he did to her father dragon knew that little ploy and his motherand of course he had been the first dragon to try it to his best knowledge but evidently myre assumed like most dragons that damage to her true self was permanent damage just as well beneath his talons she dwindled down and shrank into a helpless human trembling under his claws but staring up at him with hate in her eyes not a human of the iron people but a paleskinned slave of the elven lords now what she sneered up at him as he loomed over her are you going to eat me he closed his talons around her none too gently youre going to wish i had myre was all he said shana he sent out the thought even as he spoke get a collara new oneand bring kala and her tools by now the humans were encircling them where they both sat nearmotionless in the dry hot grass keman was not going to give up his draconic form until he knew that myre was no longer a threat the sun beat down on both of them without mercy but full sun was a friend to a dragon the hotter the better he felt the pain of his belly wounds aching with every tiny movement but the heat of the sun revived him even as it wilted myre in the form he had forced her to assume shana came running up with a collar in both hands kala followed at a slow and wary walk with her pouch of tools at her side the priests wife paid no attention to myreall of her attention was on keman she was afraid he knew that by the sweat on her forehead and the trembling of her hands but she approached him even though she was afraid proving that she was as brave as any person twolegger or dragon that he had ever seen put the collar around her neck shana he ordered aloud forming his words in the tongue of the iron people so that everyone could understand it lock it there she did so he dropped myre like the distasteful object she was and backed away a pace before myre could even think to try to make a break for it shana seized her and wrestled her to the ground sitting on her to keep her there keman shifted again concentrating not only on taking his halfblood form but on healing the wounds that myre had caused at the same time it made the shift harder but that didnt matter the freedom from pain as he took the final form made him faint with relief if anything kalas eyes were even wider as she stared at him in his wizardform you could break the locks on our collars to keep them open kala he said softly so that only she could hear can you jam them so that they can never open again as well she nodded slowly then while myre cursed and tried to throw shana off she turned and walked to shanas side motioning shana aside to hold myres legs kala solved the entire problem by sitting on myres back and holding her head by the hair kala was not a light person myres face reflected that as she suddenly turned very very red you will hold still creature kala said slowly and carefully shaking the hair she held so that myre winced demon or monster it matters not to me for while you are in the form of a woman and wear the collar you will remain in the form of a woman and there is no woman born i cannot deal with if you do not hold still i will not be responsible for what happens as i work some of my tools are very sharp myre froze not daring to move a single muscle that was all that kala needed and she released her grip on myres hair within moments she had inserted one of her probes into the lock of the collarjammed it into the mechanism and snapped the tip off flush with the surface of the collar only then did she stand up and allow myre to clamber slowly and clumsily to her feet no one will ever open that collar again kala said quietly you will remove it only when you may find someone willing to cut it from your neck that too will not be easy you will not be able to remove it with magic and it is tempered to resist the most determined cutter and while youre wearing it foolish one you will find you are unable to shift or to work any but the smallest of magics that was kalamadea coming up from the rear of the crowd i would not try were i you i am told that the effects are most unfortunate the crowd parted suddenly diric marched up the middle of the empty space followed by four of the manhearted women who had jamal surrounded he was not in chains but from his demeanor he might as well have been his shoulders were hunched and he would not look at anything but the ground but keman saw the fury in his eyes though he tried to hide it he was defeated but he would never forget this defeat and if he ever got a chance at revenge it would be terrible all the reason never to give him a chance then while you did battle in the air my champion diric said to keman gravely i did battle on my own on the ground he raised his voice hear oh my people of the foolishness and the pride of your war chief who would risk your lives and the lives of your families that he might achieve a fleeting glory for himself he began a highly edited version of everything that had happened since the wizards had been captured keman didnt pay too much attention to his speech once he realized what the gist of it was going to be instead he watched myre who despite the warning had evidently tried something a little more potent than anything he or kalamadea had attempted while wearing their collars she stifled a cry of pain blanched a dead white and the skin beneath the collar reddened and blistered he could have felt sorry for her if he hadnt still been so angry with her lorryn was staring at her though with his mouth hanging wide open whats the matter keman asked softly why are you staring at my sister thatthats my sisters maid the one that helped us escape he managed to stammer as he continued to stare butwasnt she a dragon a little bit ago shes also my sister and shes been trying to kill shana and anyone who was a friend of shana since before the wizard war keman replied grimly as lorryn turned toward him eyes wide with a thousand questions in them he just shook his head a great deal was becoming clear now but it would all have to wait ill explain it all later we have more important things to handle right now than her he ground his teeth together as dirics oration wound to its close with the declaration that jamal would be branded with the mark of a traitor and cast out from the clan right now he continued we have a war to prevent if we still can by the time night fell renas head was reeling this was too much to take in all at once her maid her friendor so she had thoughtwas really a dragon that much she could accept somehow for myre had known an awful lot about the dragons more than she should have even if she were an agent of the wizards but to discover that she was a bad dragon one whod meant mischief not good by helping them escape it shook her and it hurt her shed had so few friends and shed thought that myre was one of them despite the differences between them hadnt she gone out of her way to be kind to the girl hadnt she told myre all of her secrets the stories and romances all talked about the pain of betrayal well now she knew what they meant how could she trust anyone after this for that matter whom could she trust after this that was her initial reaction as she tried to take in all of the changes and make some sense of them but as the moments flew past and her mind began to work again she had to admit to herself that in the larger scheme of thingsher own hurt was a very little incident in light of the things that myre had revealed she had not heard the voice in the mind that her brother described but kalamadea shana lorryn mero and oddly enough diric all had the danger to the wizards in their new home was not on the horizonyetbut it most certainly would be soon you are free to go as soon as you want diric was saying once again they were in his tent but this time for comfort rather than secrecy jamal was already beginning his exilediric had not thought it a good idea to leave him within the clan where he might manage access to myre a new war chief had been appointed with dirics full approval myre languished in the prison tent with the two elves for keman had reckoned that leaving her in dirics custody was better than letting her wander around on her own with the collar locked around her neck she would certainly never be able to shift again she might be able to escape but where would she go in her human form that of the slave from lord tylars estates she would be pathetically vulnerable without being able to work magic to defend herself there were a hundred deaths she could meet with out in the wilderness all of them unpleasant so for the moment at least myre was no longer a threat to anyone later well rena was not so sure if it had been up to her myre would be locked away for the rest of her life in a very deep dark place with food and water lowered to her on a rope you have won us as allies according to all our traditions diric continued speaking mostly to shana and lorryn you defeated jamals champion in the view of everyone in the clan i do not know what we can do to aid youbut if there is anything we can offer you have but to ask shana started to shake her head rena couldnt help but see how her mood had darkened in the last few hours she was tense very tense and although she wasnt fidgeting rena guessed that if she had her way she would have been adragonback and gone right after the fight right now it looks like what we need most is an army i wont ask you to come up against the elves i wouldnt ask that of anyone we both know it would be a slaughter and what would be the point anyway but lorryn interrupted her shana wait a moment the elves are not prepared to attack now they are still trying to reconcile all their old grievances what if we interfered with that process how she asked skeptically i wont ask the dragons to go into their lands shapeshifted as elves its too dangerous now every elven lord that appears is going to be under the tightest of scrutiny and will have to be vouched for by a dozen others and if they went as slavesthey couldnt do a thing besides watch i cant ask the wizards to go in either not when the elves are watching for illusions how can we do anything from a distance lorryn and i can go rena offered shyly im not sure what he has in mind but we can do it he could be any young erlord or even a third or fourth sonno one pays any attention to them or to women either we could go a lot of places without ever meeting anyone who would recognize us mero reached out and caught her hand and squeezed it if they go in ill go with them he volunteered bravely as shanas eyes widened with shock i know plenty about the high lords and their estates and i know some about the cities too i could always pass as lorryns slave after all i am used to that role shana looked over at lorryn who was nodding you obviously have some plan she said slowly theres something you know that we dont one small thing yes he agreed and lord diric mere is something your people can give me that will help that plan along immensely the jewelry that your women make diric raised an inquisitive eyebrow this sounds more and more complicated he said i hope it is not so complex as to forbid success but lorryn shook his head actually it isnt all that complex at all he replied there is an ancient rift among the elven lords that no amount of negotiation is ever going to cure he told them all and that is the rift between the powerful and the weak now rena saw where he was going and she knew why he wanted the jewelry too the difference between the powerful and the weak is a matter more of magic than of wealth or property she said excitedly rather than waiting for him to explain those lords with a great deal of magic make virtual slaves of those with little worse than slaves in fact that is a chasm so wide that nothing could ever bridge it the hurts have gone on too long and have been made too deeply to ever be healed mero nodded its a rift that would never appear as long as the powerful lords can use their power against the weaker so i dont imagine that a single one of those powerful magicians is bothering to make any kind of reconciliation with those they consider inferior i doubt it would even occur to them among those who are oppressed by those with power are most of the women lorryn added nowwhat if suddenly all the power in the world meant nothing against those who have none of their own what iffor instance there was a fad for filigree jewelry among the not so welltodo what if those same souls learned that magic would have no effect on them while they wore it what if you got some of it into the hands of human slaves shana added her eyes glowing with excitement oh lorryn do you really think that the lesser elves would rise up against their lords if they knew they had an immunity to their power not only lesser elves but think about all the discontented sons who have nothing to do but be their fathers heirs with no true prospect of inheriting keman added theyre bored they are withering away with boredom and resentment they are tired of being given stupid little tasks as if they were superior slaves i was among those people when i was hunting you shana remember dyran and remember that if dyran was the worst of the lot there are at least a hundred lord tylars who are nearly as oppressive to their sons if they had an immunity from their fathers magics there are at least a handful of them whod make more than mischief while they deal with the revolt of their underlings and the insubordination of their women and children they cant do anything about the wizards lorryn concluded thats my plan anyway rena and i go back home i go into the cities and hunt up the disgruntled underlings the discontented heirs she goes back home spins some tale of how i forced her to come with me and inserts herself back into the social roundonly wearing this new filigree jewelry my idea is that we can silverplate it to hide the fact that it is made of iron that way no one but the owners will ever guess what its powers are the construction of it is exotic enough she ought to start a fad the women are mad for anything new rena nodded ruefully and he continued turning toward her the only problemit could be very dangerous to you rena i wont risk that if you really dont want to go his eyes were grave and his face troubled the plan will go better if you are in it but i can succeed at least in part alone until youre caught mero said grimly no if you go in i go too and i rena lifted her chin defiantly i think youre right revolt from the women is the one thing that the lords will not be looking for she thought for a moment to that longago time when she had been staring into the darkness of her room looking forward to a bleak future as the nearenslaved wife of a complete idiot what would she have done if she had known that she had a way to shield herself from anything her father or his could do to her what would she have said if she knew she could not have her mind taken away from her oh her father could still have used physical forcebut there were answers to that as well and if her mother could somehow have gotten an iron collar locked around his neck perhaps as he slept mother if nothing else i have to return to help mother she said suddenly i have to lorryn wait a moment let me think she closed her eyes for a moment and let her thoughts settle we can find out if the news got around that i escaped with you quickly enough she said finally if it didnti can start visiting some of my female friends the farther away from our estate the better i can show them my jewelstell them that they were betrothal giftsand let slip where they can purchase their own copies i wont stay more than a day at a time the men never bother with visitors in the bowers and they never remember a womans name as long as i dont linger ill be safe enough lorryn nodded and so did mero meros look of approval and encouragement was what she really needed to get on with the next part of her plan that gets the fad started so it can go on with or without me then i go home she raised her hand to stop lorryns protests i tell father that you kidnapped me just as you suggested all he has to do is cast a simple spell and hell know im fullblooded then i become important lorryn i become the only true child of his blood i can even tell them thats why you kidnapped me so that you could use me as a bargaining chip against him then i can slip some of the jewelry to mother and we can escape together the only question i can think of isare we going to make an organized revolt over this lorryn said finally turning to shana i dont see how we can afford not to she told him frankly once the secret of the jewelry leaks out the more powerful lords are going to start looking for ways to get around itand they can do that if they can ambush the wearers one at a time rena closed her eyes bit her tongue and tried not to show her fear this was no romance no dream in her garden this was real as real as their trek into the hills as real as the rug under her hand when they left this place and reentered the lands of the elven lords she would be in real danger she could die so could lorryn so could mero and he didnt hesitate there was an icy hand clutched around her heart a ball of cold clay in her throat and a frozen lump of lead in the pit of her stomach was it only a night or two ago that she had walked with mero in the moonlight and thought that for the first time in her life she was truly happy and now now we risk all of it but she couldnt do anything less not without making everything shed gone through meaningless there was for a brief moment while she strove to conquer that fear another force warring within her temptationto act like a real coward a selfish coward after all she was no fighter no hero like shana she could run back to her father and tell everything she knew hed not only welcome her hed reward her hed give her everything she ever wanted she could have all those things she daydreamed about her own manor where she alone would rule books music gowns and jewels and freedom to do exactly what she wanted these halfbloods these dragonsthey werent her kind why should she give them her loyalty and service when simply aligning herself with her real people would grant her all the freedom she ever wanted but the temptation did not last for more than the time it took for the thought to be born for it wouldnt be real freedom would it she would still be constrained by custom by law she might not be forced to marry a dolt but she still would not be free to follow her own heart but most of all it would be wrong she would have bought all of it with blood she would be as bad as the worst of her kind if she did that worse maybe they had built their estates on the blood and bodies of their slaves and underlings she would not buy hers with the blood and bodies of people who called her sister and friend she might be a coward and weak but she could not be a traitor the talk had gone on without her but she was well aware that she was of no particular help at this point she closed her will around the fear settling in throat heart and soul and listened with an outwardly calm face there would be several days of travel before they even reached the edge of the wizards lands she had that much more time to try and find some courage hopefully it would be time enough keman grew impatient with them all long before the others talked themselves out perhaps it was the excitementhed noticed that humans had to run a thing to ground before they tired of it if they were excited finally they talked themselves into circles repeating the same things over and over and diric declared that they were all too tired to even think properly he sent them to jamals tent which he had commandeered for them since the new war chief was happy with her own home and had no wish to change keman was pleased to see that each of them had his or her own little chamber now cleared of all the personal possessions of the previous owner and furnished with comfortable pallets and other niceties thats probably kolas doing he decided after surveying his own little pieslice of carpeted tent she must have been taking care of all of this while we were talking what an amazing woman she and diric work so well together it would be so wonderful if he could find someone like kala he lay down on his pallet and waited listening with every fiber for the sounds of the other people in the tent to die away he didnt think that mero and sheyrena were likely to wander off hand in hand under the moon not tonight anyway if they were as exhausted as he was well maybe they werent they hadnt fought he had unless of course theyd all pitched in to subdue jamal while he and myre fought in the skies gradually though the murmurs of conversation and the sounds of people moving about the little shifts in the floor and creak of wood as people walked died away finally he needed to get out dora must be frantic by now and he was starving he hadnt wanted to take the easy way out and ask for a cow or two people were frightened enough of him and he didnt want to frighten them further by eating in front of them he slipped out of the darkened tent wound his way through the camp as silent as a cat moving from shadow to shadow with all of the skill of any predator there was no moon tonight which was a help and most people were so bewildered and agitated by the turn of events today that they were keeping to their own dwellings while they sorted things out in some ways keman felt rather sorry for them the iron people were so ruled by traditionand yet today so many things had happened that didnt fit within that tradition that they must feel almost as confused as if they had awakened to find themselves camped in the midst of a glacier floating on the ocean or perched atop a mountainpeak it certainly wasnt every day that you found a pair of dragons fighting over your headthen saw them both turn into people afterwardsand one of them was someone you knew then you discovered that your war chief had been consorting with the other one in order to get you into a war against demons and your priest had been consorting with the one you knew in order to trade with the demons poor things no wonder every tent buzzed with talk and most of it sounded confused still diric has them convinced think hed have had more trouble if shana had asked him for direct help against the elves but i think he can manage to get them calmed down under the current circumstances but now he was going to have to force a confrontation on dora he hadnt wanted to not this early but there wasnt going to be much choice shes going to have to choose between running back to her own lairand and what and him but what choice did he have with her help we can all travel back to the citadel in a few days sheyrena is light enough that kalamadea can carry her double with lorryn but without dorawell have to make double trips because i cant carry two people for very long thats going to take time that we just dont have besides that in the morning all six of them were leaving this place dora would have to reveal herself sooner or later so why not sooner she couldnt hide her presence forever he stopped at the edge of the herds and sent out a questing tendril of thought here at the edge of the herds well he no longer needed to hide what he wasand he wasnt going to have to explain to any of the herdsmen what he was doing out here he shiftedslowly and with a bit of the pain that weariness always caused when he shiftedand lumbered into the air muscles ached and joints creaked as he flew i am going to have to stay in better shape from now on a moment later dora met him in the sky above the camp they flew together neither one saying a word as she led him off into the low hills beyond the encampment to his surprise and delight she led him to a cache of freshly killed plains deer and she waited patiently while he sated his ravenous hunger oh he said fervently when hungerrage had worn off enough for him to be able to think clearly i needed that thank you i knew you would she replied gravely kemani didnt know what to think when i saw that strange female and then when she spokeand you foughti was so afraid for you the words came out of her reluctantly as if she was as afraid to voice her feelings as he was i wanted to help you she continued but i didnt know how you couldnt have done anything he told her bluntly myre has resented me from the time she was born i think that resentment curdled into hate long before we met you and i anything you could have done to help me would just have delayed things between myre and me oh her head sagged deflated all i could think of was that youd be hungry i was thank you he sat down on his haunches wondering what to say next well better get it out of the way at once were leaving tomorrow her head shot up her eyes wide is it because of what she said your sister about the elves and your wizard friends she didnt have any reason to lie and plenty of reasons to tell the truth we have to assume thats what she did he replied we have to get backshana has to settle things with the wizards in case the elves do mount an attack and lorryn and rena both think they have a plan to disrupt the situation in the elven lords ranks but we havent much time so youre leaving she looked as if shed bitten into something bitter i promised to help you escape but it doesnt look as if you need me now was that all that was troubling her we need you more than ever he told her with your help if you let shana ride you we can fly at something close to our normal speed without you kalamadea and i will have to make doubletrips she looked into his eyes youre asking me toto show myself he nodded dora you have to sooner or later or else just go home and what would be the point of that ill be telling my lair about yours some of our dragons are going to go looking for yours and youll be telling your lair about all the other lairs up here eventually our kin are going to meet whether or not you show yourself to my friends but she looked troubled our laws have always said never to show ourselves to twoleggers as we are he snorted my twoleggers already know what we are and myre certainly took the matter of the iron people out of both of our hands as my twolegger friends say the horse has been stolen so whats the point of locking the barn you wont be accomplishing anything she sighed i said i wanted to help you but not necessarily my friends he asked shrewdly she nodded i cant help it she confessed its hard to think of them as people you have to start somewhere he told her softly or you end up like the elves who dont count anyone who hasnt got full elven blood as people or like myre who sees anything that isnt a dragon as rightful prey cant you see that i wouldnt want to be like them her skin shuddered and she looked away especially not your sister then help us dora he said weariness creeping into his voice he wasnt as good at this persuasion thing as shana he really wished he had lorryns gift for it not me help us she still didnt look at him i have to think about it she said slowly i dont know what else to tell you all right he sighed but what else could he say he certainly couldnt coerce her and he didnt want to use a different kind of coercion on her by telling her how very very much he liked her so instead he stretched weary and aching muscles and prepared to take flight again back to the tent and some wellearned sleep thank you for everything that you have done dora i really appreciate it he told her as he stretched out his wings just remember we take off a little past dawn tomorrow illremember she said slowly making no move to take to the air herself keeping her wings furled against her sides good night keman good night dora he forced himself not to add anything she had to make up her mind by herself instead he launched himself into the dark starspangled sky and made a slow weary flight back to the tents of the clan from this height the lights from their lanterns looked as if stars had dropped down out of the sky to arrange themselves in concentric rings on the plain this might be the last time hed see it too from here on they moved into unknown territory lorryn mero and rena would not be the only ones going into elven lands someone would have to set up shops to sell the silverplated iron jewelry it would be very dangerous for wizards to even attempt such a thing but shifted dragons now there was a possibility there was another possibility as well something he hadnt bothered telling to shana because he didnt want to get her hopes up but with myre out of the way his way was clear to return to the old lair and recruit more of the kin in fact there was nothing stopping him from going to other lairs that would free the original rebels as many of them as were willing to shift into twolegger forms to run those jewelry shops because there would be other recruits to take their places at the citadel to help the wizards defend themselves it wouldnt matter if they shifted to the forms of human slaves only slaves ran shops anyway and certainly none of the elven lords would be looking for trouble among the fat and contented merchanterslaves that he had decided would be his responsibility as soon as he was free to pursue itwhich would be as soon as they reached the citadel already he felt the stirrings of impatience he wanted to be at the job he had the sensation of time pressing in on them from all directions the feeling that he was only now beginning a race that had started without him perhaps he had perhaps they all had no matter they were in it now they had no choice but to run this race fullout and hope that they could finish it dawn came much much too soon for keman despite eating to beyond satiation and sleeping as only a thoroughly bloated dragon could sleep no matter what form he took keman felt as if he would have been a lot happier with a great deal more sleep two or three weeks worth as a start he politely refused breakfast and went out to the cleared space that diric had arranged for them so that they would not frighten the cattle as he and myre had with their shifts and appearance yesterday hed been told they nearly started a stampede and one was only prevented because all of the warriors were out near the herds playing their war games certainly jamal had not anticipated that and yet it had been the one action he had taken that had a positive outcome yesterday he had halfexpected a circle of curious onlookers but there was no one there and it wasnt because the iron people werent used to getting up at dawn theyre afraid i cant really blame them that was probably just as well he planned to take his shift slowly and that could be very unnerving to twoleggers at the best of times at the worstwell hed seen one or two of shanas friends grow rather green and sometimes lose whatever they had in their stomachs queasiness was not generally a draconic problem unless one was very ill he still had a hard time understanding creatures that were so quick to lose what theyd eaten it seemed a very counterproductive trait when he completed his shift he began stretching his muscles slowly as his mother alara had taught him to do before he undertook anything that was going to be physically taxing and this flight would be physically taxing there was no doubt of that besides his burden of shana and mero he would be carrying bundles of heavy iron jewelry gathered last night by kala from all the women she could persuade to give it up kalamadea would be doing the same though his ridingburden would be lorryn and rena and he could carry far far more than keman it was just too bad that no one had ever learned the trick of shifting the mass of something other than himself into the out as a dragon did when he had to shift to a smaller lighter form perhaps it simply couldnt be done it would have been useful though the rising sun gilded the grass and a light breeze blew up out of the south his shadow reached to the tents and mingled with their shadows he stretched each limb separately several times warming up the muscles and making them more flexible with each stretch as he began the series of integrated stretches that would finish his warmup some of the iron people began bringing the bundles of jewelry and supplies he and kalamadea would be carrying he watched them out of the corner of his eye and tried not to chuckle they were very funny really they eased up to the edge of the area with one eye on him and the other on where they were going they tried to look comfortable casual but they generally failed utterly they would always drop the bundle as soon as it was humanly possible and scuttle away as if they had heard hed refused breakfast and were afraid that he intended to break his fast with one of them the others arrived at about the same time as the bundles kalamadea who had not been the one fighting and flying yesterday shifted quickly into his draconic form of father dragon he was huge easily twice the size of keman perhaps larger and keman was large enough to easily carry one twolegger rider dragons grew for as long as they were alive and father dragon was the oldest dragon keman knew of not even alara knew exactly how old he was he had been alive at the time of the very first gateopening when the dragons had lived in a world with far more perils in it than this one weve grown soft and lazy keman thought contemplating kalamadeas huge wings fanning the morning air if those old ones could see us hiding in our lairs from mere twoleggers theyd laugh at us they had to worry about things so deadly that they would burrow into lairs to kill and eat the occupants kalamadea might have read his thoughts the elven lords given enough incentive could be just as deadly to us as the perils our kind once escaped from keman he said quietly so that no one else would overhear dont think too badly of those who only want to hide that was why we escaped here after all to hide we were running away technically speaking well maybe he was resolutely keeping his mind on anything and anyone except dora he awoke this morning resolved to assume that she would not be coining along he had tried not to feel too disappointed or hurt unfortunately as he had learned all too often in the past resolutions are usually not heeded by the emotions all the resolve in the world did not help the feeling of disappointment andyesloss as the sun rose higher and dora did not appear he wasnt sure if it was his heart that was aching but there was certainly something holding a core of dull pain deep inside him he waited patiently while the others rigged him and kalamadea with harnesses both for the benefit of their passengers and to strap the bundles of supplies to you arent going to like this at all shana was telling lorryn and his sister as she explained how the harnesses worked he sensed her tightly wound nerves and guessed that she was chattering to relieve them poor shana it was not only the threat of the elven lords that disturbed her it was he knew the threat of revolt from within the wizards ranks that was what had undone the wizards in the first war he only hoped history was not about to repeat that tragedy and dont listen to kalamadea or kemandragons dont get flyingsick i mean think about it they couldnt fly if they got sick every time they took wing but heres the problem the first thing that happens is that the dragon jumps into the air if youve ever jumped a horse over a huge obstacle youll have a very slight idea of what that feels like so unless we are strapped in were going to go tumbling over his back lorryn observed dispassionately he turned a little to look keman in the eye i hope youll forgive me my friend but i have a very hard time reconciling this he slapped kemans shoulder with the young wizard who snored all last night i did not snore keman exclaimed indignantly you did shana told him firmly most of the night loudly he snorted and ignored her examining those straps of his harness that he could reach himself with ostentatious care now at the top of that leap shana continued as if she had not been interruptedanother sign of her nervous tensionhes going to suddenly snap open his wings and start a series of very powerful wingbeats to gain altitude theyre just like the leap a series of surges youre going to be thrown backward with every wingbeat and if you dont hold on and hunch yourself over like this she crouched down demonstrating the position youre going to feel as if your head is going to snap off the end of your spine lorryn nodded and his sister sighed this sounds worse than riding the worstgaited horse in the universe it is shana assured her in fact its worse than riding a packgrel all right at some point hes going to reach the height he needs and thats where the discomfort really begins these folks dont fly in a straight line they swoop like this she made an arcing motion with her hand wingbeat swoop wingbeat your poor stomach is going to think youre falling during part of each swoop thats where youll get flightsick if it happens at all and if you have towelljust tell kalamadea hell bank to one side so that you canahstraight down and ancestors help whatever is below you keman listened with real interest although he had carried passengers before this hed never heard any of them explain what it felt like to them of course flying felt perfectly natural and right to him but evidently that was not how it felt to those who rode his back theres also turbulence up there keman has done sideslips been bounced as if he was trying to buck me off and dropped halfway to the ground and even turned upside down by winds i dont get sick and i hope you wont but i wont promise anything she shrugged at their expressions of dismay no matter what make sure that every strap is tight every buckle fastened check them while youre flying they are all that is keeping you on his back and believe me you need every one of them mero came up as she said that and nodded solemnly if we have to fly through a storm youre going to wish you had more straps than you do he added butthe stories all made it seem as if flying was so easy rena said plaintively as ifyou just got on and off you went keman laughed well do remember that it was myre telling you those tales right for us flying is easy and anyway she wouldnt have wanted to discourage your romantic image of dragons he thought for a moment men added i can at least promise you thisits easier flying with kalamadea man with me i have to take more wingbeats to stay aloft man he does because hes bigger have you ever watched birds at renas nod he went on youve probably seen the way small birds fly its very jerky and it takes a lot of wingbeats but a big hawk nowhe can glide quite a bit and when he does take a wingbeat its slower because his wings are larger thats the difference between kalamadea and me and you two will be riding kalamadea because youre less experienced shana was testing every strap the leatherworkers had worked all night on the harnesses and kalamadea rather approved of them they certainly fit better than anything hed had rigged up before ahheres something else shana said as she came around from the other side rena lorryn see the pad here thats like a saddle dont let your legs slip off it and dont ever be tempted to wear cloth breeches instead of leather dragonscales are very abrasive and theyll scrape you to the bone in a few wingbeats she had them slide their hands the wrong way along kemans shoulder and nodded when they winced thats why i asked the leatherworkers to make more than two sets of harnesses and lots of extra straps so that if some of this gets sliced up we can just discard the pieces instead of wasting time trying to mend it would one of those extra harnesses happen to fit me keman looked up as startled as everyone else as a shadow slid over them all a moment later dora landed in a flurry of wingbeats that kicked up dust and sent it flying in every direction i saw the doublesaddle on kalamadea but keman is much smaller than the elder one and i thought you might need an extra mount dora said shyly and turned to keman you were right she said simply and his heart soared and thank you for notnot using emotions to convince me she added for his benefit only kalamadea was the first one to recover and he did so with considerable aplomb keman he said quietly would you care to introduce us to yourfriend and is this where youve been vanishing at night when we all thought you were hunting you young rascal or were you hunting after all fairer game than plains deer he added ahthis is dora he said lamely suddenly tonguetied shes from a lair very far south where the iron clans all live and shes been watching this clan the way we used to watch the elven lords she didnt know there were any other dragons except the ones in her lair until she saw my shadow really was all kalamadea said then he turned to dora every talonlength the gallant welcome to our group dora we are very pleased to have your help and very grateful as well she ducked her head her nostrils flushing now if i may take command of this situation kalamadea continued looking over his shoulder at the sun i believe we should get another harness onto our new friend dora and make all speed while we can explanations can wait until we are airborne lorryn since you are riding double with your sister who is the only one of us who cannot speak and hear thoughts you can simply tell her what is being said at the least it will enliven the journey no end he clapped his wings sharply by way of emphasis come along my friends he finished the elven lords are sharpening their talons for our necks it is time and more than time that we were in the air chapter lorryn nursed a cup of thick too sweet red wine in one of the many taverns hed been frequenting since he began this part of the plan this one was in whitegates a tradecity administered by lord ordrevelor more correctly by lord ordrevels underlings it didnt matter where he was really each of the five tradecities looked pretty much like the next one and all these taverns were alike he should know hed been in every tradecity on the continent and most of the taverns the taverns were all luxuriously appointedor so it seemed if you looked closely though you saw that most of the luxury was only where it could be seen leather upholstery extended only to the side of the cushion that showed satin wallpaper gave way to bare wall where the wall was covered by furniture or something else velvet drapes proved on touching to be soft flocked paper cheap and disposable these taverns all had dark rooms in the upper levels where human slaves waited to give whatever pleasuring was required but the rooms were so dark that neither the slaves nor the surroundings were readily visible they all served very cheap wine spiced and honeyed to a fairtheewell to disguise how cheap it really was and they all played host to elves who were too low in rank and status to have estates manor houses and concubines of their ownor young elves leashed and collared by their lord fathers who likewise had nothing of the sort as their own thisand the taverns like it in this city and the other four tradecitieswas where the legacies the supervisors the seneschals and trainers came to forget the petty insults heaped upon them by their liege lords this was where the extra sons and the disregarded heirs came to forget that there was nothing that they would ever see or touch that was truly theirs this was where the former concubines or young girls and boys too delicate to serve in the fields but not comely enough to grace a harem or work as house slaves also came it was difficult to imagine a worse life than that of a field hand but surely this was it especially for the traumatized abused creatures waiting in those upper rooms lorryn tried not to think too hard about them he was already doing what he could to change their fates lorryn provided a sympathetic ear and more important a ready purse many of them were kept on meager allowances by those socareful lord fathers generally an amount that was less than the cost of a good dog or a field hand he offered his wine and murmurs of understanding that was common enough they all shared their grievances those who came here what was uncommon was that he also provided a remedy word of that remedy was spreading he had learned something fascinating during the hours he had spent in these places where the air was scented with perfume to cover the odor of spilled wine and the light was dim to hide the stains on the velvets and satins of the upholstery the serving girls and the clientele his worst fear had been that one or more of the seemingly disgruntled would prove to be an informant and that the game would be uncovered be fore it began and surely one or more had been an informant but whether they informed out of fear or out of greed when he actually gave them a way to even the odds with the great lords when he showed them how ineffective magic was against his talismanic jewelry they all turned each and every one of them turned against the lord they had been working for passed over the gold hid the necklace headband and armbands in the breast of his tunic and walked out without a word except perhaps to inform to someone else who had a lord as cruel as indifferent as sadistic as his own he had always known that the great lords were cruel to their underlings but he had never in all of his planning guessed that they were so cruel that their liegemen would turn against them at the first opportunity he had seen the gilded facade of their world as he walked through it as lord tylars son and heir beneath the languid manners the pretty magics the idle games was a cruelty that was all the darker for being so completely casual a cruelty that used up and disposed of humans and elves alike as if they were toys meant only to amuse an idle hour he sipped his wine and sat in his backcorner booth and waited for them to find him there had been a young lordhe must be a younger son for he did not wear livery and his clothing was of too high a quality to be an underlingsitting at a table nearby drinking steadily and watching him for the past hour now finally he rose to his feet wove his way through the tables with surprising grace considering the quantity of drink hed been putting away and settled himself onto the bench across from lorryn empty cup still in hand he helped himself to the wine in lorryns pitcher without a byyourleave which further argued for a high position lorryn simply nodded and pushed the pitcher of wine closer to his new drinking companion the stranger took that as an open invitation downed his cup in a single gulp and poured it full afresh fathers he said at last sneering and making the word a curse tell you how important you are from the time you can walk give you eveverything you ask for right up until you cocome of age then what you tell me lorryn said blandly nothing thats what the stranger emptied the cup again this time lorryn refilled it you come of age and nothing changes youre still the boy still have to come and go as youre bid you want to hahave a little fun bring in some friends and next thing you know hes got you hauled up in front of him like you were stealing from his money chest ah lorryn replied wisely i know you want to have a little manor of your own a few slavegirls you ask for it and hoy he acts like youd spit on the names of your ancestors oh aye the stranger agreed and just try and walk off the path just a bit just for a lark hes on you hes using his power on you as if you were his slave his property bad enough he crushes you down to the ground worse that he lays the willlash on you next thing you know hes threatening the change on you to make you mind to unmake your mind you mean lorryn said in a grim voice ah so thats whats set this one off not that i blame him not after what rena told me make you into some kind of puppet dancing to his tune thats exexactly what he said the young elven lord said in surprise you dance to my tune boy with the change or without it so put your mind to it and next thing i know hes got me betrothed to some whining milkfaced girl who cant walk across a room without having vapors who cant say three sensible words in a row whoancestors help mefaints whenever she sees a man with his shirt off whats she going to do when she sees more than that and im stuck with her and if you choose to leave her in the bower and find some fun elsewhere lorryn prompted the young lord snarled itll be the change for me my lad im to do my duty by her like a proper erlord thats what he poured another cup of wine but this time he didnt drink it instead he leaned over the table and said in a far different tone but ive heard theres a remedy for that situation lorryn made patterns on the tabletop with his finger and a bit of spilled wine filigree patterns there might beso ive heard he said casually ive heard theres a bit of jewelry that can keep someone fromhaving magic worked on him against his will the erlord looked up through his long pale eyelashes expectantlyand a little desperately there might be ive heard that lorryn completed his lacy pattern ive also heard theres something of a craze for patterned silver necklaces armbands headbands very popular among the young lords these days im told you might begin to wonder if the cure for your troubles is in that jewelry eh the stranger nodded eagerly you wouldnt know where i could find a dealer for some of thatwould you a mans got to keep up with the fashions lorryn pretended to think about it you know i might have a bit of that with me now he replied id bought it for a friend but i could let you have it right now for the same price i can go find the maker again easily enough but hes a hard man for a stranger to find and what would that price be now the erlord was leaning forward so eagerly that lorryn almost spoiled the entire deal by laughing out loud he named the price and the stranger pulled a purse off his belt and shoved it across the table theres twice that in gold there he said his fingers twitching as if he could not wait to get his hands on the jewelry take it take it all the desperation in his eyes overwhelmed the wine then again who wouldnt be desperate threatened with the change lorryn did not touch the purse he carefully took a purse of his own from his belt one containing silkwrapped silver plated ironwork from the hands of dirics people and slid it across the table the erlord snatched it up hiding it in the breast of his tunic and only then did lorryn take the purse of gold youll want to test it of coursefor its quality and workmanship he said therell be a party three nights from now in the private room above the silver rose if you show up there wearing that someone whos an expert in jewelry will look it over for you and you might hear something more thats likely to interest you and keep it in the silk until you need to use it hey you know how thingsgive themselves away you give the game away and youll hurt more than yourself the erlord nodded obviously impatient to be gone lorryn suppressed a smile he was able to hear this ones thoughts as clearly as if he were shouting which in a sense he was that was how lorryn knew who the wouldbe informants wereand knew when he had persuaded them to his side this young man could hardly wait to get his prizes home he planned to wear them constantly as so many of his friends were hidden beneath the silk of his clothing as like as not and he would be at that party another set of willing hands to aid the revolt that lorryn was planting the seeds of lorryn would not even be there he didnt have to the ringleader of the revolt at least in this city was lord gweriliaths seneschal a man who had seen his precious daughter sent away as a bride to another powerful lord more than old enough to be her greatgrandsire and all to pay one of lord gweriliaths gambling debts lorryn only needed to coordinate the revolt the ringleaders sprang up of their own accord as soon as word of the power of the jewelry began to spread and lorryn had hardly been able to restrain himself when he saw this very morning copies of the filigree jewelry showing up in shopsbut in gold of course and with none of the detail and intricacy of the genuine article before long the erlords themselves might just start plating the silver with gold and no one would ever be able to tell the difference between the genuine article and the copies except by the effector lack of it i wish you well sir he said gravely giving the young erlord the signal that the interview was over and do enjoy the party i shall trust me i shall and with that the young elven lord was out of his seat and striding out of the room with no sign whatsoever that he had put away enough wine to knock out a carthorse lorryn waited a little longer but the hour was late and it appeared that this was going to be his final customer of the evening he paid the tavernkeeperand paid him generously the tavernkeeper was a human and under his livery tunic he wore a much simplified version of the filigreework torque a cross between the womens jewels and the warriors torques these were being turned out by the clever hands of human slaves craftsmen bought with the gold the lords were paying for the prettier styles they were very popular with the slaves although lorryn was being very careful whom he soldor gavethese little baubles to it had to be to someone who had a strong grievance against his current or past mastersand yet someone who was unlikely to be on the receiving end of his current masters power shopkeepers were good prospects tavernkeepers some overseers a concubine or two these lorryn tested himself heart and soul he left the halffinished pitcher of wine on the table and went up to the third floor bypassing the second altogether here was where the tavernkeeper had his own quarters and where the offices were and here the tavernkeeper had made a small apartment which lorryn lived in with his sister and with mero he paused outside the door and sent a delicate thoughttouch to the occupant mero opened the door for him and he slipped inside convenient this wizardpower when youre building a conspiracy he remarked as mero returned to the task he had left of carefully wrapping silverclad iron in swaths of silk then slipping the resulting packet into a pouch like the one lorryn had just given the young erlord below thats precisely why the elven lords have been trying to destroy the power for so long mero replied but he looked more troubled than the simple remark called for whats the matter lorryn asked answering meros frown of anger and worry with a frown of concern shanahas her hands full came the slow reply keman and dora went off on some quest of their own just after we left and as soon as they could manage it caellach gwain and a good half of the wizards called a wizards council against her the alliance with the iron people and anything else they could think of they dont believe that the elven lords are going to come after themand even if they did caellach has the old whiners all convinced that all they have to do is give shana up to the elves and the danger will be over lorryn did not shout his angerbut his hands clenched into fists and a hot rage burned up in him they have a flexible notion of honor he drawled almost as flexible as that of the elven lords mero stared at him for a moment then his mouth twitched involuntarily can i quote you on that when i talk to her he asked thats too good a line of argument to waste lorryn relaxed just the tiniest trifle if mero was able to see the humor in something the situation couldnt be a total disasterat least not yet she has her allies and shes very powerful in her own right the other dragons will support her if she has to she can escape before they can make her a prisoner of course he said and while youre at itremind her to tell them that if the elven lords are treacherous enough to break the treaty in the first place they are certainly treacherous enough to accept shana then attack anyway a good point mero agreed oh im worried but right now its only at the talking point and all the dragons are backing shana so the very worst that would happen would be that alara would have to fly off with shana and the rest of her followers and take them all down to the iron people since that was precisely what lorryn had just been thinking he relaxed a little more it was just the thought of shana being in any danger at all that put his stomach in a knot were had so little time to get to know each otherbut did them and rena have more and yeti wish i knew what she was thinking what she thought of me what rena and them had that we had none of was time alone she and i have to keep thinking of things besides ourselves but taking her to the iron people would lead the elves to dirics clan lorryn pointed out and we pledged to avoid that is our honor no better than theirs mero grimaced maybei dont know shana is worried but not in a panic so i cant worry too much but that means that we are going to be pretty much on our own here there was another tap on the door lorryn sent an arrow of thought out and relaxed when he recognized rena he nodded at mero who leapt out of his seat and made a dash for the door opening it and seizing rena to pull her inside with something that was as much embrace as it was anything else he shut the door and lorryn politely averted his eyes as mero made it into a real and wholehearted embrace im glad they found each other he thought wistfully i just wish he didnt complete the wish he had no idea if it would even be possible shana was an infuriating combination of everything he had ever hoped for in a womanand everything he found maddening in any person she was stubbornstrongwilled his conscience reminded himopinionateda leadertoo quick to speak her own mindintelligentimpatienta fast thinkerselfcenteredselfsufficient well the list and litany could go on for hours he could not get her out of his mind though even when he should have been thinking of other things he often dreamed about her at night and found thoughts about her intruding during the day he had made the excuse to mero that his own mental powers were too feeble to reach her from elven lands but the real reason he did not want to speak mind to mind with her was that he was afraid he would reveal his own decidedly mixed feelings about her she could not afford the distraction especially not now and he i cant afford the distraction either im walking a knifeedge here andi dont want to know how she feels not now maybe not for a long time ii just dont want to know if she does think of me as no more than another wizard id rather cherish a few illusions for a while besides it wasnt as if he didnt have other things to think about rena coughed politely and he turned back to face them they stood discreetly enough side by side but their hands kept creeping toward one another he kept his eyes above the level of their hands how did it go he asked her face shone with pleasure at her own accomplishments perfectly she replied i showed my jewelrytheyd already been seeing it of course at fetes and i told them where they could find it i told lunalia and merynis the truth about ittheir fathers are horrid peopleand i slipped them pouches then and there its really dreadful this was supposed to be a prebetrothal party for poor lunalia her fathers pledged her to some arrogant erlord who seems to think she should act like his concubine and not even having vapors at the mention of anything indelicate or pretending to faint when he took off his shirt made him she stopped as lorryn choked on laughter and doubled up gasping what are you laughing at he told her about his last customer and had to hold on to a table when she started to giggle too she was not the gentle little ineffectual sheyrena she had beenthe sheyrena who would have reacted to his laughter with indignation and who probably would have burst into tears at the notion that he could have found lunalias plight funny shed found that spine he had wished she would grow and he had a notion that shed found it somewhere back in the alicornhills she wasnt his little rena anymore though in a way that made him a bit sad she didnt look to him for a partner in jokes or a source of companyshe looked to mero oh it was natural and inevitable but it also meant that little rena had grown up as if to underscore that point she sobered the only thing islunalia was the last she said we agreed that i couldnt risk the private estates because it would be too easy for me to be trapped there that means there is only one more place on our list for me to go mero froze and lorryn nodded their own work here was well started the last of the five cities to plant their gardens of discontent in all of the rest had a flourishing network of tiny shops human slavecraftsmen silverplating the iron peoples work and manufacturing the simpler versions all overseen by a shapechanged dragon sent to them by keman i wondercould that have been the mysterious quest that keman has gone off on mero didnt seem to know any of them but they were dragons no doubt about it after shana showed us how to spot a dragonshadow there is no way that we could be fooled on that score could keman be recruiting more dragons somewhere well it didnt much matter not unless keman managed to recruit most of the dragons from most of the lairs before the revolt took place and that wasnt too likely the point was it was time for rena to go home you dont have to go he reminded her although anxiety cramped his insides every time he even thought about his mother she was alive at least that much he knew for he had it confirmed from several sources her pretense that her real son had been born dead and a changeling substituted by the midwife had been accepted her feigned madness had been accepted as well and had freed her from further questioning it was a terrible scandal but no worse than that and she had been confined to a single building in the garden rather than facing the full wrath of her lord and husbandand the wrath of the law which would permitno orderhim to execute her for knowingly giving birth to a halfblood as yet there were no rumors to the effect that rena had escaped with him in fact the only rumors he had heard were that her mothers collapse into madness and lorryns own betrayal had sent her into a decline she was said to have taken to her bed and refused to wed lord gildor until the honor of her family was redeemed that was as pretty piece of fiction probably spread about by lord tylar himself i have to go she told him earnestly we both know that i wont pretend that im not afraid but at least he cant read my thoughtsand i will have my own jewelry to protect me if he strikes at me in a rage but not if he lulls you into thinking that everything is all right then orders his men to haul you off to some more powerful lord for he couldnt say it she tightened her lips and tightened her grip on meros hand but only said thats the risk i have to take but im a much better actress than i was before i think that i can make this work he sighed and stepped forward to hug her freeing one hand to pat meros shoulder as the young halfblood showed him the face of pure agony that he would not turn to his beloved if you say you can i will believe it sweeting you are not the silly little girl who used to read romances in the garden let her birds perch on her shoulders and then have to hide the soiled gowns from her father in terror oh im not so far removed from that as you might think she whispered bravely into his ear just now i have to hide a soiled past rather than a soiled gown rather easier actually he had to shake his head over that as he let her go all right he replied well proceed as we planned in the morning right nowive got to go meet with a few people then im going to go to bed the transportation spell is going to take a lot out of me he turned and went back out into the hallway without a single backward glance leaving the two of them alone to make their goodbyes however they chose and he actually managed to repress his envy enough to wish them both sincerely well he hadnt told mero about this meeting hed intended to because he would much rather have had someone to watch his back but he couldnt bear to steal a single moment of meros time from rena this time he was going out into the streets with the reverse of his guise of a young elven lord he was out there after dark as a human slave he kept his eyes on the ground ahead of him and his back hunched but his neck prickled every time someone looked at him or seemed to look at him for more than a heartbeat he didnt think anyone would be looking for halfbloods among the human slaves but how could he be sure he wished that slaves were allowed something like a hood to cover his ears but he would have to trust to darkness for that his nerves didnt stop jumping until he finally reached his goal a plain storefront with a sign of a green leaf above the door the place looked closed up for the night but when he tapped in a prearranged signal the door opened for him he slipped inside and his contact closed the door behind him quickly leaving him standing in the darkness shivering come into the dispensary came a low whisper i can strike a light there that wont be seen from the street he followed the sound of footsteps ahead of him barking his shin on a bench and holding in a curse a hand touched his arm guiding him forward and then he heard the sound of a second door closing a moment later a lantern flared into life revealing the man he had been asked to meet as well as the contents of the room in which they found themselves his nose would have told him the contents of the room herbs more herbs than he could identify by odor a mingled aroma of bitter and sweet fragrant and pungent and just plain odd the room was lined with shelves covered with bottles jars and little boxes carefully labeled there was a waisthigh table in the middle covered with an immaculately white cloth his contact was a middleaged man balding with a fringe of beard and very fitlooking what hair the man still had was curly and brown like the beard the only trouble was he was fully human i was told you have something the man said abruptly something thatsomething that blocks elven magic the back of lorryns neck prickled afresh who told you that he asked cautiously andwhy are you asking hed assumed his contact would be another minor elven lordand this mans thoughts like those of many humans were murky and chaotic with fear lorryn couldnt precisely read what his intentions were through the emotions but the human surprised him again taking a deep breath and steadying his own nerves to the point that his thoughts came clear again lorryn almost choked where had this man acquired that kind of discipline i heardfrom your good host the man replied carefully and nothing in his mind contradicted that and as for why i want what you havedo you know what a physiker is lorryn shook his head dumbly elves dont sicken but humans do and of course our mighty masters couldnt be bothered with tending to a sick slave the man said bitterly nor are they prepared to deal with the sick or the injured in their own dwellings that is when they call for meor more often send the poor sufferer to me not that i can do much but its better than nothing and nothing is what theyd get without me i take care of your hosts young ladies when one of the young lords gets too careless with his toys lorryn winced at the tone of the mans voice the suppressed anger and hate alone spoke volumeshe knew all in that moment that this physiker had seen things that he simply did not want to know about hearing more tales of horror was not going to get his job done any fasterbut he would end up with nightmares and he couldnt afford that right now soyou want protection because some of the lords he began the physiker interrupted him with a snarl not only have they punished me because i couldnt force someone to heal faster than nature would allow so they could get on with their amusements theyve tried to force me to dothings he choked and lorryn held up his hand in entreaty and resolutely shut his mind against the thoughts that beat against it please he begged id rather not know i can see that your need is genuine here he emptied out his pockets of every pouch hed brought with him a total of three take these you may know of others who could use them if he was about to say more but was interrupted by someone pounding on the street door the physiker froze and so did lorryn the pounding stopped then began again bryce bellowed an angry voice open up the physiker leapt into action and shoved at lorryn pushing him toward a waisthigh basket with a few bloodstained towels in the bottom of it get in there he hissed pulling the towels out and forcing lorryn to crouch down below the level of the rim with the three pouches dropped in after dont move if you value your life he covered lorryn with the towels draped so lorryn hoped to cover him completely then hurried to answer the pounding im coming im coming he shouted as the light moved out of the roomlorryn guessed that he was taking the lantern with him the door slammed against the wall as soon as bryce opened it and whoever it was stormed into the outer room whod you let in just now the harsh voice demanded somebody with a wound maybe or something else he doesnt want the master to know about the mans tone turned raspy and dangerous you remember what happened the last time you played that little game bryce this time they might not let you keep that hand if you must know the physiker replied testily i wasnt letting anyone in i was lettingherout one of the winegirls from the silver rose she hasaha slight infection of a personal nature lorryn had to admire the way the man coughed and flustered as if he were embarrassed i wasahtreating herahas a favor you might say the other man remained silent for a moment then broke into a gale of laughter she huh a personal problem you sly old dog i didnt think you had it in you or have you got somethin in those leaves of yours to get it in you bryce coughed again and the man laughed even harder next time you ask the master before you go treating personal problems otherwise i just might bust in here before youve let her out so i can get some of mat fun for myself the door slammed again and the heavy bootsteps retreated the light returned and bryce pulled the towels off him youll have to go out the rooftop now the man said his face white in the dim light of the lamp that trembled in his hand hell be watching the front i hope you can climbcome ill get you out and youll have to take care of yourself from there he was babbling with fear a fear that made him literally sick and the images in his mind told lorryn why he was so afraid lorryn swallowed his own nausea and kept his mouth shut he couldnt get out of there quickly enougheven if it meant a harrowing climb across the roofs anything was better than being in the same room with a man with those memories in his mind sheyrena dressed carefully in a purposefully soiled and torn gown one she had prepared herself for this ruse it had to look as if she had trekked across the wilderness in it and not willingly either instead of shoes though she wore a pair of wornout old boots that could have belonged to lorryn with rags stuffed into the toes to make them fit no shoes she owned would have survived the trip she was going to de scribe to lord tylar and she would claim to have stolen the boots from lorryn she and mero had worked out every detail of her story from the point where lorryn talked her into coming for a morning walk with him to the point where she escaped from him stealing his boots both to protect her own feet and prevent him from following her and traveled alone back along the route he had taken inside her gown sewn into the body of her petticoat she had two sets of the iron jewelry one for herself and one for her mother myre would become in this tale lorryns willing accomplice and his contact with the wizards why not it would certainly account for her presence in the boat for a third figure had surely been seen and it would also account for her absence after she fell out of it that would also be why lorryn had not gone straight to the wizards but had wandered around on his ownwithout her he had no guide anything that anyone overheard in that brief period between the moment when the pursuers had sighted the boat and the moment when it flew out of sight that might indicate that rena had been encouraging lorryn could easily be attributed instead to myre are you ready lorryn asked she nodded unable to force herself to speak mero was lying down with his eyes closed that was because lorryn was going to take all of his magic power and most of his own to send her straight to the border of lord tylars land the transportation spell as modified by the wizards and taught to mero then taught by mero to lorryn was not as noisy as the version shana had used the trick was that the person actually casting the spell had to remain behind and the noise remained with him in a big city such as this one where there were hundreds even thousands of spells being cast each day another burst of magical noise would not be noticed mero was actually better at this than lorryn but it was lorryn who knew where rena had to go so it was lorryn who must cast the spell and it would take its direction from his mind as soon as mero recovered he would journey by more conventional means to lord tylars estate where he would wait for rena and lady viridina with horses and supplies lorryn had insisted on that part of the plan knowing that mero would fret himself to piecesand be all but uselessif he was not somewhere nearby where he could help at need it would be dangerous for him certainly but no more dangerous than remaining here with only half of his mind on keeping himself hidden from those searching for halfbloods take a deep breath and close your eyes lorryn said and rena obeyed him she sensed power gathering around her twisting and turning as lorryn sent it through the amber globe in his hand as mero had taught him twisting and turning around her then there came a flash of light so bright that she saw it through her closed eyelids then nothing no sound no light no air no floorshe was falling falling she was going to fall forever her stomach churned as it had when kalamadea had hit what he called an air pocket and plummeted three times his own length before he got back under control she thought she screamed but she couldnt hear herself thought she stretched out her hands but she couldnt even feel her own body then with no warning she was there feet planted firmly in the grass beside a tall goldenyellow wall she stood in the middle of a bareearth bridle path with grass on either side of it in a place she knew as well as she knew her own room she and lorryn had been here a hundred times on their ridesthere was the apple tree they always used to shade them in the summer when they stopped for a picnic meal the grass beneath it long and rank as if no one had tended it in some time the leaves on the tree were just turning a reminder that she and lorryn had escaped in the spring and now it was already fall she had forgotten how far it was to the gate from hereand she was afoot not riding wearing boots that were far too big for her even with rags stuffed in the toes and more rags wrapped around her feet she shivered as a cool autumn breeze cut through her ragged dress and the iron jewelry felt very heavy around her waist well here i am and she wasnt going to get anything done by standing there with a tiny sigh she trudged up the path with luck she might meet with some of the guards and save herself some blisters but no guards appearedof course they never show up when you really want them toand her feet were sore enough to give ample evidence to the truth of her story when at last she reached the gate she didnt think they were blistered but if she got away with this the very first thing she was going to do would be to have a good hot bath and a footrub the gate loomed much larger than she remembered it but then again her memory now was colored by living in the wilderness and in the tents of the iron people many buildings seemed large now compared to the tents made all of bronze it boomed hollowly when she rapped on it timidly the gate swung open on her second knock revealing a halfdozen fully armed guards behind it elven guards not human which said more than any words how lorryns escape had affected lord tylar he no longer trusted anything important to human slaves it seemed she clasped her hands before her looked down at the ground and said in a tired voice that did not need any acting please could i speak with my father lord tylar your what began one of the guards as another laughedbut a third cursed and shut the other two up by the ancestors he swore its her sheyrena she hadnt really hoped for gentle treatmentnot until they knew she was fully of elven blood anywaybut she hadnt quite expected to be bound hand and foot and slung facedown over a horses back she hadnt expected to be galloped up to the door of the manor with the jewelry digging painfully into her skin and her upset stomach being jounced worse than any dragonflight had jostled it that coming on top of the effect of the transportation spell was just too much when the guards reached the front door of the manor and manhandled her down off her perch she threw up on the boots of the nearest she took small comfort in the fact that it was the one who had insisted on carrying her in that undignified position in the first place he swore and kicked at her she fell back avoiding the kick he aimed another at her but before his foot connected the sound of the door slamming open and an angry shout froze him where he stood what is the meaning of this lord tylar stood framed in his own marble doorway glaring down at the guards gathered there they moved aside quickly revealing a trembling and miserable sheyrena huddled at the feet of one of their number lord tylars face turned a lush crimson which went very badly with his pale gold hair and green eyes you he spat how dare you show up here again fffather she faltered ready tears springing to her eyes for she really did feel entirely awful fffather ilorryn fell asleep and i hit him on the head and stole his boots and he gestured and the words froze in her mouth now she was glad that she had insisted the iron jewelry be swathed in silk so that none of its protection would reach her the success of her ruse depended entirely on her vulnerability to lord tylars initial spells you dare to claim to be the daughter of my body he spat we will see about that and with those words he cast his second spell which she assumed must be the one that broke illusions of course she remained precisely as she was a huddled wretched mess in a torn gown dirty tearstained and sick but entirely completely indisputably elven and lord tylar who had assumed right up to this very moment that his daughter was a halfblood just as his son was stared with his mouth falling open but only for a moment he recovered quickly from his shock he had not become the kind of power he was by being a complete dolt after all and now he turned his anger on another target the guards you he raged although his face was no longer scarlet you imbeciles how dare you treat my daughter like this ill see you broken to sweeping stables for this and before the guards could react he himself was down the steps and stooping to help rena to her feet cutting the ropes that bound her hands and feet with his own beltdagger oh father she sobbed and flung herself at his feet to cling to them and weep into the leather of his boots father it was so horrible lorryn waslorryn is as she had expected since any display of emotion horrified him and hysteria made him desert the scene of the uncomfortable outpouring immediately he backed hastily away youyou he said pointing at two of the guards as rena watched covertly through her lowered eyelashes take my daughter to her chamber instruct the slaves to attend to her every need and gown her according to her station now you fools and he turned and fled back into the hall leaving the poor bewildered guards to help her to her feet againvery gingerly this time as if they were afraid to touch herand guide her to her own rooms the maids were already waitingall new ones which somehow didnt surprise her muchand the guards released her into their hands with illconcealed relief as they undressed her rena found the opportunity to slip the packets of iron jewelry into the old hiding place in her bed where she used to keep books within a few moments rena was sinking back into that longedfor tub of hot water with a maid attending to each hand and two more to each foot and another to wash and untangle her artistically tangled and dirtied hair it was altogether lovely and she gave herself up into their hands with a sigh of bliss the maids twittered to each other like a flock of her little birds exclaiming over her roughened hands and sore feet and the state of her hair my lady one kept saying as she mended the damaged nails as best she could my lady how could you do this to your pretty white hands as if i had nothing to worry about in the howling wilderness except care for my nails she had to bite her lip to keep from laughing eventually they finished with her dressed her in a gown of a soft rose color and sent her on her way to her fathers study they had offered her a drink that she suspected was meant to tranquilize her she accepted it and surreptitiously poured it into a vase after pretending to drink from it their expressions of satisfaction confirmed her suspicion and she took care to act relaxed and just a bit giddy when she made her way between two muchchastised guards to the study but as the door opened she discovered that her father was not alone and she was very glad that she did not have the jewelry on her person she did not know these lords by name but their faces told her all that she needed to know about them such arrogance only came with the greatest of power she made a deep though unsteady curtsy and did not rise until her father gave her leave in a voice that betrayed his pleasure at her action these are two high lords from the council sheyrena he said speaking slowly as if she were a child or feebleminded or both tell us all what happened to you at the hands of the monster that stole you away one of the high lords brought her a chair which she sank into gratefully in a trembling and hesitant voice she told her story beginning with lorryn supposedly coming to her room with her maid to take her on a sunrise picnic and ending with her escape from the terrible halfblood stealing his boots so that he could not pursue her and retracing the path she had memorized even in her terror he was going to sell me to the wizards father she cried her voice shaking not with suppressed tears as they supposed but with suppressed laughter he told me that he was going to sell me to the wizards to feed to their dragons he told me that dragons would only eat maidens and she couldnt stand it anymore she hid her face in her hands and her shoulders shook as she laughed silently the three lords conversed among themselves as she strove to get herself under control again finally she raised her head from her hands and sniffing bravely she faced them again it all fits she heard one of them say in an undertone her father and the other one nodded you have been a good and a brave child sheyrena said the one who had spoken in a voice as unctuous as massageoil and as sweet as treacle you are a credit to your father and to the name of your house she bowed her head submissively and the unctuous one turned back to lord tylar by your leave my lord we will return to the council with these tidings he nodded they turned and left through the portal door as soon as they were gone he chuckled sheyrena raised her eyes feigning shyness you have done very well sheyrena he said and studied her he blinked once or twice as if in surprise i do believe that your ordeal has actually improved your looks girl he exclaimed in a voice full of astonishment by the ancestors you actually are attractive thank you father she replied meekly she flushed with anger but dropped her eyes so that he would assume that it was a blush of embarrassment thisthis all puts a new complexion on things he muttered and drummed his fingers on his desk you are of full elven blood and now my only heiryour value as a marriagepiece is a great deal higher than when you were stolen hmm he got up from his desk came around to her side and put a finger under her chin tilting it up so that he could study her face hmm he repeated as she veiled her eyes with her lashes to hide her anger add to that the fact that youre no longer a little creamfaced loon but a handsome little thingyour value is even greater he allowed her to drop her head again and stood beside her chair she didnt reply but he didnt seem to expect her to you may go he finally said abruptly she took him at his word rose unsteadily curtsied and fled and once she was back in the safety of her own chamber she took the packets of jewelry from their hiding places and quickly concealed them in the best of all hiding places and the one place no man would ever look in the midst of all the other jewelry in her valuables chest then and only then did she strip off her gown without calling for her maids slip into her bed in her petticoat and fall into an exhausted sleep her father woke heror rather her maids did fluttering about agitated beyond measure that he was waiting outside and she was in no state to receive him in something of a fog she let them gown her again and brush out her hair the very instant she was decent he swept in with all the high drama of a state entrance have your maids pack up your things sheyrena he said to her you are moving to the bower she stared at him stupidly he smiled the smile of someone who is doing what he wants and thinks he is conferring a tremendous favor you are my only rightborn child sheyrena he said ponderously and he held out a hand she put her own in his not really knowing what he wanted and he set a ring of keys into itthe same ring of keys she had seen her mother wearing for as long as she could remember you are the lady of the house he told her you now have charge of the bower and the household at her look of naked shock and dismay he laughed oh dont worry childits only an honor and a title the slaves really see to it all you only need to see to it that the slaves know to come to you for their orders and i will tell you what to tell them yes father she faltered his smile broadened you are far too valuable to waste on the likes of lord gildor he said sounding very pleased with himself i have sent my regrets to lord gildor telling him that you are too precious to me now and that i cannot bear to be without your comfort and company i have dissolved the betrothal you have she stared at him she would not have believed that he would go that far he mistook her astonishment for dismay oh dont be disappointed child you are worth ten gildors now no now listen to me closely she shut her mouth and kept her face carefully schooled into the appearance of attentiveness i am going to find you a marriagealliance that will put our house in the ranks of the high lords he told her gleefully you have a job to do a very important one you must not allow this present attractiveness to fade and that is an order i want you to rise every morning put yourself right into the hands of your maids make yourself presentable and keep yourself that way none of these afternoon naps when you cant be viewed no disappearing for long rides dont go hiding in the garden as if you were a child is that understood yes father she replied flushing again with anger and predictably he interpreted the anger as embarrassment now sheyrena dont be upset he said in what he probably thought was a coaxing tone im not angry with you but you arent a child anymore and you are far too important to the house now to play your childish games just do as you are told and things will work out wonderfully for you just wait and see yes father she replied still flushed i have decided now that virtually every lord on the council knows your name and your story to announce that you are free for betrothal at the next council meeting it will make a pleasant diversion for everyone from our final preparations for war against the wizards i will be able to marshal my forces beside those of whoever becomes your lord he beamed as if he had thought of something terribly clever i shallahput you up for bid so to speak and i do expect the bidding to be brisk but lord gildor she said unable to think of anything else to say hah he laughed put him from your mind i dont know who your husbandtobe will be yet but you can take it as written that whoever he is he will be as high above lord gildor as lord gildor is above the chief of my guards but all that rena could thinkcould hopewas that mero would be able to read all of this from her thoughts for she had no other way to send him this allimportant message the elves were about to break the treaty and the trucemonths before any of them had thought possible shana fumed as she stood before the assembled wizards in the bare cavern they used for their meeting place wanting very much to knock sense into several heads with a large and heavy stick especially the head of caellach gwainand why had he chosen to take this line now when he had been the one howling about the danger of the elven lords only a few months ago and how is lorryn doing and what is lorryn doing and why do i never hear from him only from mero does hewould hedamn it all shana keep your mind on your enemies buthes in the midst of the worst of those enemies i am telling you i have it nearly from the mouth of one of the high lords of the council himself she growled biting off the words savagely the elves know where we are they are going to attack and they are going to do it soon theyre coordinated enough to put up a portal to bring their troops right to our doorstep oh please said caellach gwain waving a hand languidly this is an old tale and were weary of hearing it we havent seen any signs of this socalled mustering of troops youve been ranting about thats because she snarled impatiently the troops are all being mustered on the estates of three of the high lords who you have been afraid to watch and who is this informant of yours caellach asked shrewdly she didnt answer at first they wouldnt believe her even though they had seen rena themselves if only briefly they would never believe rena could keep her head long enough to be of any use as a spy im not about to blurt out any names when there might be a traitor among you she snapped oh this is nothing more than a ruse to take our minds off the important matter of a treaty negotiated with dangerous barbariansnegotiated without permission of the citadel as a whole might i add caellach looked disgustingly proud of himself she glanced over at denelor and parth agon the former shrugged helplessly the latter cast his eyes up to heaven caellach gwain did not have enough votes to cause her serious trouble but he did have enough of the wizards on his side to embroil them in this nonsense until the elven armies were at their very door once again as she gazed out at those fat fatuous faces she heard meros voice in her mind giving her the bad news he had in turn heard from sheyrena in a panic she had spent all of the energy she dared in trying to send that same message on to keman but she had no real idea if he had heard nor where he was if he had it would be just her luck that he and that lady friend of his had decided to flit off somewhere together out of reach of everything and everyone or perhaps they had gone back south to her lair to gain courting consent from her parents now as she listened to the same idiocy that had kept her penned in this chamber day after day unable to accomplish anything productive her temper snapped she stood up right in the middle of one of caellachs speeches slamming the palm of her hand on the table he stopped in midsentence shock on his face at her rudeness you can blather about this from now until youre cut down by elven blades if you want she spat i am going to try to do something about it with what caellach sneered with us kalamadea replied standing up himself as every other shapechanged dragon in the place did the same even if it is only to make plans to flee with those who are wise enough to come with us caellach gaped at him openmouthed at the revolt of the dragons but he spluttered impotently but but i dont think that will be necessary came a voice from the door a voice so hoarse with weariness that shana did not even recognize it until she turned and saw keman and behind keman a dozen two dozenthree fourshe lost count of how many strangers there were behind him all of them with dragonshadows shana here are your new allies he said as alara exclaimed in surprise and joy and ran to embrace not only her son but a tall and handsome ebonyhaired man who stood at kemans side here are dragons from our lair oordilais lair halias lair teomenavas lair he named off a halfdozen more lairs as shana stood there so stunned that she couldnt even speak well form the force on the right flank he continued dora has gone to the iron people and diric should be able to bring his mounted warriors in to be our left flank before the elven armies themselves show up we can plant wedges of iron that will disrupt the elven plan to bring the portal up right on your doorstep the blackhaired man said with a grin our best rockmelders are bringing it up out of the earth now in fistsized nodules and were flying it out here and dropping bits of it along the way we think well have enough to seed the forest for a days march all around that leaves your forces to form the rear of the trap keman continued hoarsely and turned to caellach gwain it was at that point that shana was struck by the realization that keman was no longer a boy by any standards he was thinking and acting for himself taking responsibility and willing to live with the consequences she saw by the look on alaras face that the same conclusion had just struck her on the nose as well her little baby is no longer little nor a baby like every mother everywhere her offspring had been a child to her long past the time when that ceased to be true now you can do what you please lord wizard keman continued and you can believe what you will but an army of iron people and another of dragons believe that shana is right and you fools are in deadly peril and we are willing to help her now we have a saying among the dragons he stared at caellach gwain with a gaze as sharp as a swordblade and the old wizard actually shrank back from him lead follow or get out of my flightpath he said forcefully now which is it going to be the old wizard sank down into his chair keeping any further protests behind his teem keman bowed ironically to him then gestured to shana i believe the lightning now comes to you foster sister he said with a weary twinkle in his eye i shall leave it to you and my friends here i have done a great deal of flying in the past few hours and i want to sleep for a week the council meeting lorryn said to the room full of quiet young elves the tavern had been closed to outsiders for tonight only those with an iron necklace were allowed inside they were all arrayed on every seat every bench every space where there was sitting room he alone stood in the center of the room and every emerald eye was on him every lord of any importance in their eyes is going to be there and they plan to go right into battle from the meeting that leaves the field clear for you all of you to act while they are all stuck in the council hall leagues and leagues from anywhere with little transportation few followers and no way to communicate to their estates there are only three high lords who wont be therethe three who are going to open the portals and send their slave armies through while the council is in session and all of those are sending their heirs to the council one of the erlords who had been part of the planning from the beginning chuckled theyll be as cut off as the rest of them when the erlords close their portals behind them as they pass through the rest of you have to manufacture excuses to be on your lords or fathers estates when the council meeting takes place lorryn told the rest of them well give you each a wedge of iron to spike the portal with after that it will be sealed for all intents and purposes i suggest that you hide it well your fathers and lords may have a loyal underling or two who cant be persuaded to come over dont waste time trying to find them get to the human fighters and take them over throw out anyone who wont swear to you after that he shrugged ive given you all the advice i can hold the estates for yourselves you ought to be able toanyone you shield with the jewelry will be protected from direct magic so all that will be left to your fathers and uncles and liege lords is force youll have your humans they wont and by then it will be too late to recall all the human fighters that were sent through the portals an even chance is all we need said one of them his eyes gleaming he wasnt a young lord either he must have been one of those with little or weak magic and as a result the grudge he carried was probably centuries in the brewing thats all weve ever asked for aye to that said another lorryn nodded and rubbed the side of his head wearily would this all work and what was going on with shana the last hed heard through his craftsmen keman had recruited more dragons but did she know that the armies were coming could even a sky full of dragons prevail against the numbers that were coming and for that matter was she even in charge anymore it didnt matter events had gotten away from them all now they had to act or be run over by them you all know what to do he said waving at them in dismissal he had more of these meetings to hold even as his draconic friends were holding similar meetings in the other four cities its up to you how you do it and up to the rest of us to make the most of it ah shanai could use your stubborn good sense right now rena had been a very very obedient little girl remaining meek and pliant in every way while lord tylar ordered her about she hoped to lull any suspicions that he might have had by never mentioning lady viridina in his hearing and never directly asking about her to the slaves he must have suspected somethingor perhaps the habit of suspecting everyone had become so ingrained that he could not drop it even if he wanted tofor he took care that she was never alone even though she thought she was going to scream with frustration finally though she had a respite if an eleventhhour respite he was too busy today preparing for the council meeting to watch her himself and as nearly as she could tell he had not set anyone to watch her for the first time since she had come back to the estate she was alone it might be her last and only chance and she was going to take it she dared not wear her jewelry thoughshe herself was going to have to work magic and the magics guarding her mothers gardentower were likely rigged to set off mechanical alarms if they were made to fail so she took both packets still swathed in their insulation of silk hid them in her gown and slipped out of the bower with the silence of a stalking iron clan warrior or so she fondly hoped at any rate she slipped along the hallways as cautious as a cat she passed through the magicbarriers that lord tylar had placed around the bower with no trouble although she had feared that they might stop her her father had told her they were supposed to be for her safetyin case lorryn came after her againbut she was not going to take anything lord tylar said at face value now she passed through corridors made more for use man for show heading for the herb and kitchen gardens in theory since she was in charge of the household she had every right and duty to go there in actualityit would be hard to explain her presence to anything above a household slave in the middle of the kitchen garden some wag of an architect had set a prisontower for the confinement of anyone lord tylar wanted out of the manor but near enough to keep a personal eye on it hadnt been in use in renas lifetime but shed heard of recalcitrant underlings who had spent brief but uncomfortable visits there it was supposed to be escapeproof provided the person kept there was less than lord tylar in magical power or provided that the person kept there had no allies with any magical power on the outside the sundrenched expanse of vegetables and herbs in their neat and mathematically patterned beds seemed very large as she peered out the door into the bright light and there in the middle was the towervery pretty to look at all of white marble stretching up toward the sun a round slender white column fluted and sculptured its whiteness marred by nothing like a window anywhere along its height but it seemed that her father had stripped every slave that he could from the household to serve in his armyevidently it was numbers that counted not skill with weapons there was only one slave picking cabbages at the foot of the tower and no one else anywhere in the garden rena waited in the shelter of the door until the slave finished her work and hurried toward the kitchen door now i know why the house has sounded so quiet so odd father probably took every male slave we had and sent them off to make up his share of the forces he may even have taken the brawniest of the females as well no matter that theyve never held anything but an eating knife i doubt that matters to him there are always more waiting in the breeding sheds she thought about the humans she had come to know in the tents of the iron people diric kala the new war chief she thought about the craftsmen who were not warriors and how ill suited they would be to fight she thought about all those people being herded off to die like so many cattle but without the care and dignity granted to the iron peoples cattle and she burned with rage she had hated her father before but this hatred was no longer personalit was for everything he and every lord on the council stood for she waited a moment longer fighting her angerboth to see if the slave came back out to the garden and to get herself back under control as long as she was this angry she could be distracted she could not afford to be distracted finally the anger subsided to a slow burning in her heart she took a deep breath and strolled out into the garden as if she had a perfect right to be there the door was on the opposite side of the tower from the manor she walked with simulated carelessness up the pathways of round gravel paced around the base and stepped up onto the white marble stoop all without once spotting anyone who might have been set to watch she studied the lock to the door with her eyes closed as mero had taught her but it was a lot simpler than she had expected it to be perhaps for a male unused to working magic at so fine and controlled a level it would have been very difficult to openbut for a female well it was easier than sculpting the feathers on a living bird she had it open in a moment she slipped inside and closed the door behind her the bottom story was quite empty one echoing white marble room with that sourceless light that illuminated most elvenmade dwellings she listened then straining her ears against the silence trying to determine if there was more than one occupant here talk among the slaves indicated that lady viridina was not even allowed a single body servant and had to tend to all her needs herself but talk among the slaves was not always accurate she heard footsteps faint and far above but there was only one set of them someone was pacing around and around the round wall of the tower but it was only one person silently rena slipped up the stairs pausing to peek over the edge of the next floor to see what was there this room was like the one below except that it held a marble table and a single chair there was no one here either but as rena moved up into the room itself she saw a tray of partially eaten bread and a pitcher of water on the table the bread did not look particularly fresh and it was the coarse brown beanbread generally fed to slaves clever she headed for the next set of stairs and once again paused to listen the footsteps sounded as if they were directly above her now she got halfway up the stairs before the footsteps stopped suddenly who is there lady viridina called sharply rena couldnt stop herself she ran up the rest of the stairs heedless of the fact that her mother might not be alone but lady viridina was alone dressed in a simple gown of bleached fustian the kind a slave might wear her hair confined in a single neat braid with no sign of the fine lady she had once been she stared at renamade a sign and rena felt the tingle of magic that told her a spell had just passed over herthen ran to take her daughter into her arms babbling and sobbing as incoherently as if she had been mad then again rena was doing the same thing when they both got themselves under controland in a much shorter period of time than rena would have thoughtlady viridina held her daughter at arms length and shook her as if she were once again a naughty child what are you doing here she scolded dont you know dial no one is supposed im getting you out of here mother rena replied interrupting her although she did not pull away from the admonishing hands listen to methere isnt much time to explain lady viridina did listen as rena made a brief explanation of how she and lorryn had escaped how they had met the iron people and learned of the protective power of their jewelry and how they had finally joined forces with the wizards thats what i have here she said pulling one of the packets out of the breast of her gown with difficulty that was the problem with fashionable gownsthere was nowhere to put anything here this is some of it you put this on and well cross the garden to where mero is waiting and not this time with a burst of power that left her nerves jangling lord tylar appeared in the center of the room as if he had been brought there by magicwhich of course he had rena was familiar enough now with the transportation spell to know what it felt like if his face had been scarlet with rage when she first appeared on the doorstep it was purple now and he came at rena not with magic but with his bare hands she tried to evade him but he had been a trained warrior in his youth and he still kept in practice with a single powerful blow of his fist he knocked her across the room and into the marble wall her body hit the wall first knocking all the breath out of her and her head followed a moment later sending black waves of stars across her eyes and leaving her stunned and unable to draw in air she lay there in pain trying to gasp hands clawing at the bare marble as with a tiny part of her mind she heard the jangle of the jewelry her mother had been holding and the clatter as she dropped it to the floor at his feet rena shook her head to clear her eyes and the movement must have cleared something else as well for suddenly she could breathe again she pulled in a long cool gasp of air coughed and pulled in a second then looked up trying to make her mind work again her father stood with his back to her stiff with anger her mother huddled against the far wall her face white with terror and shock there was a gleam of silk and silver on the floor under his foot now i am going to kill you woman lord tylar hissed i am finally going to be rid of you and no one will say me nay his hands shot out and he seized her by the shoulders before rena knew what he was doing in the next instant he threw her to the floor where she lay limp and boneless as he turned rena saw his face it was no longer purple or even scarlet it was white pale as the marble of the walls and as controlled as if he were talking about inconsequential council gossip among his friends and when he spoke again his voice was controlled too and so cold that it might have frosted the marble rena shuddered and her mother hid her head in her arms i am going to kill you he repeated but i am going to do more than that i am going to annihilate you i am going to destroy you so completely that nothing of you will remain to show that you ever lived and i am going to take my time about it he smiled and a voice echoed through renas mindonly now she knew who the voice belonged to and why she had seemed familiar to the speaker if you can change a flower petal what else can you change could you perhaps stop a heart and again from a time much nearer at hand its not a power to use lightly but sometimessometimes you arent given a choice if by using that power you could save an innocent life taking the first as an omen and the second as a benediction rena did for her mother what she would never have dared do for herself lord tylar was armored and warded against magic attack but his foot was touching the iron of the necklace and the silk packet had fallen open there was leather between him and the necklace but it still might be just enough rena closed her eyes and reached just as her father raised his hand to summon his power to him she never knew afterwards if it was her spell that caught him or the terrible effect of his own power caught so close to the iron of the necklace she only knew that in midreach he gasped the terrible energies he had been reaching for suddenly backwashed over him and his body exploded into a pillar of flame somehow she got to her mother past the pillar of fire a thing that screamed and bubbled horribly but seemed rooted to the spot as if the necklace chained it there she reached her mother who was now quite paralyzed with fear somehow she got lady viridina to her feet and down the stairs as the very marble of the tower began to burn and the stairs ignited practically on their heels she and her mother staggered together across the garden as slaves and underlings began to converge on the burning tower staring and shouting and ignoring the two of them completely by then lady viridina was able to move under her own power although her face was still white with shock and her eyes resembled a pair of holes burned into her face shana led the way to the open gateopened by patrolling guards who had seen the flaming tower and had pounded past the two escapees without a second glance she had no idea how to find mero but this was the only way out that she could see and by far the easiest but she didnt have to stagger around the walls of the estate to find mero he found them galloping up with two horses in tow just as they reached the outside without a single word he helped lady viridina into a saddle and tied her there in case she should suddenly collapse since it looked as if she might do that at any moment as rena clambered into her own saddle hindered by the skirts of her ridiculous gown lorryns meeting us on the way mero said shortly your timing couldnt have been better the real mess is just about to begin lets get out of here before someone figures out we arent supposed to be here rena looked back at the burning tower now a single impossible column of flame reaching into the sky a portent of things to come she felt numb her thoughts moving slowly as if they were making their way through thick mud ill be hysterical in a while she realized somewhere in the back of her mind where there was still an atom of rational thought mother will be too wed better be far away when that happens and as he read her thoughts mero nodded he turned his horses head and spurred it into a canter lady viridinas with the leadrope still tied to the back of his saddle followed with a jerk of its head rena looked back one more time shuddered convulsively and followed both of them lorryn had lost all control of his emotions by now and his heart and mind were in as much turmoil as the land around them shortly after he had met up with mero rena and his mother the countryside literally erupted all around them he had known intellectually what his revolt might mean but it had not occurred to him what it would look like he had galloped through madness through scenes out of a high lords worst nightmares there were armies of humans wearing bits of iron around their necks and wielding farm implements at all comers there were armies of mixed humans led by young elves manning the walls of besieged estates while small groups of older elves rained terrible magics down on the walls and anyone not protected by iron there were tiny groups of human fighters grimly protecting loot huddled masses of slavewomenor once a single elderly elven woman with the look of eagles and the gentle hand of a nurturer who wore one of his necklaces about her neck she recognized them for what they were and more she knew viridina on sight and called out to them before they could pass her by boy she shouted waving a restraining hand at her warriors you must be viridinasfollow us were beating the bounds and well be at my ladykeep in a trice by then they were all so weary and lorryn was so sick with worry for his mother who had fallen into a stupor that he would have accepted help from jamal himself over meros objections he did follow and they led him to a cleverly concealed keep of the oldest sort the kind that was proof against just about any form of siege she brought them in she saw viridina into a bed and them to a meal and while her humans guarded and watched them warily she got all of their tale out of them even out of mero who was not proof against her charm or her motherly manner hmm she said when they were finished my husband was a brute my sons a beast and my daughter got me one of these little trinkets of yours she caressed the necklace with one finger to keep me safe from his machinations he wasnt content with having most he wanted all even this little corner of the world that was left to me i got my boys here their own little amulets when i saw what they would do and we all settled down to wait for what i knew was coming you knew mero said but how we were very careful she laughed when you are my age and you came from evelon boy you have seen enough to be able to guess a great deal from a few signs i never held with slaves and i treated the human friends i had like the people they are didnt i boys one of her great grim guards crackled a smile and put an armored paw gently on her shoulder that you did little mother he said comfortably would that more were like you she sighed well i often said it would come to fire and the sword again and so it has i think my son is dead my daughter and her overseer held the manor when last i heard and those slaves that havent run off are helping them hold it thats most little mother said another of the guards you taught her well ah well i tried she sighed again how this is all going to fall out i dont know i heard the army sent to kill the wizards has mostly run back home to join whatever part of the fighting suits them best theyre full of tales of dragons and black men and you can tell me if those are moonshine and madness or truth mero cleared his throat theyre truth as near as we can tell you we dont know whats happening with the wizards either its been too hard to send a message he stopped and she laughed that peculiar brittle laugh of hers i know i know the human magics boy i know why you cant thoughttalk now it happened when we first came over the more chaos the more thoughts in the air the harder it is for yours to get through even with power behind it ah mero seemed at a loss for words the old lady looked them all over sharply sleep in a bed tonight boy she told him and turned to lorryn all of you bide overnight youre weary enough to drop youre about to founder your horses and youre all sad and sorry and sick of heart leave viridina here with me ill care for her and bring her out of this i knew her mother and her as a girl and if any can give her hearts ease i think it will be me if any can protect her i think it will be me and mine now lorryn recognized her lady morthena lady moth as he had called her as a child she had been one of his mothers most frequent visitors and always had hours of scandalous stories to tell he had never guessed this side of her perhaps she had hidden it beneath the guise of the scandalmongering old lady on purpose his mother had never let him say a word against her though now he thought he knew why he looked at rena who nodded slightly please he said putting all of his fear for his mother and her sanity into the word lady moth nodded as if she understood to bed with you all and get on with your journey in the morning she said only and shooed them off to beds as if they had been children out of the nursery and as if they had been children they all obeyed her even mero the next morning she met them at the door as her guards brought them their rested horses with saddlebags of provisions travel safely but travel swiftly she told them when the storms are over come to me again and tell me what has happened i think your mother will be glad to see you then she smiled and for a brief flash of enchantment lorryn saw what she must have been like when she was renas age and her elders opened the gate from evelon and bring me some of your young wizards she added ill tell them some history and they can show me wonders and bring me scandal scandal lady moth mero said as easy with her now as lorryn and rena were she laughed there will always be scandal boy maybe you and my little sheyrena here will make some hmm and as rena blushed and lorryn managed a smile she waved them off hurry up now my boys tell me theres a looting party on the road and i dont want you to meet it you might hurt them the last they saw of her was her hand waving at them from the top of the wall around her sturdy little keep two days later and they were at the edge of the ironseeded territorykeman had told them about that before he flew off with all the iron bits they could spare at the timeand lorryn was as tight as a bowstring with tension wondering what kind of reception they were going to get and what had happened to shana through all this but he was not expecting to be hailed quite so soon hold cried out a voice and a score of human archers stepped across their path iron torques around their necks and a wizard leading them the wizard stared at themhe was an old one and lorryn looked to mero who shook his head meaning that he did not recognize the old man either this looked bad it looked as if shana had won the war only to lose to caellach gwain lorryn clenched his fists in mingled fear and rage and his horse danced as the reins tightened you and you the wizard said coldly are welcome but that his tone made the word a curse as he pointed at rena is of elven blood mero bristled and lorryn reached for a sword he didnt have of course she is you twit shouted an acidic weary voice that made lorryns heart leap where do you think halfbloods come from a cabbage patch and shana brushed the wizard and the archers aside fire and rain i thought youd never make it back she said but she looked them over and obviously came up one short and paled oh lorryn your mother is fine he assured her wellmaybe not fine but we left her in good hands and lady moth says shell be fine and he was babbling and he knew it and so did she she held up her hands and he cut the stream of words off easy well get to it all in time right nowlets get you all away from here before some idiot war party shows up and tries to kill the wizards again she turned away from them and the archers parted to let them throughand lorryns heart sank to his boots all of this time he had been afraid of what would happen if she lostto the elves or to the divisions within her own ranks now now what do i do shes won she doesnt need me she doesnt need anyone black despair washed over him in all this time he had not once been tempted to weep and now his throat choked with tears his chest constricted until he couldnt breath and he picked up the poor horses reins to send him bolting away far awayhe lagged behind them all for a moment so that he could slip away without them noticing in a moment they would be around the bend in the road ahead and he could escapethinkfigure out what to do with his life since she didnt need him in hers lorryn the single weary word in his mind froze him in his saddle ah lorryn ii can t tell you she couldnt tell him but he felt itthat she had been as worried sick about him as he was about her amid all the troubles and the turmoil she had faced she had fretted about him stared at the ceiling at night in sleepless concern over him just as he had over her thank goodness youre here she said at last as she sensed what was in his heart too ii missed you and fire and rain know i need you then shanalike the sentimental turned to practical between one breath and the next and dammit i need your help too youre the one who was trained to lead people not me i cant handle all these impossible idiots without youlook what happened with caellachbeanbrainedgwain if youd been with me hed never have given me the grief he did despair turned to joy and to a kind of infuriated hilarity but of course she was going to infuriate himthat was why she delighted him and why he gathered from her amused thoughts he delighted her well she asked are you coming to help me with this pack of fools before i kill them all out of frustration gathering his reins up he turned his horses head back up the
